GATES STEPS DOWN AS MICROSOFT CEO; BALLMER GETS THE JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After 25 years of building the company he co-founded
into one of the most powerful, influential and profitable engines
of the modern era, Bill Gates on Thursday stepped down as chief
executive officer of Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, 44, relinquished that title to Steve Ballmer, 43, his
friend and colleague of more than 20 years. The raucous, ebullient
Ballmer, who joined the company in the summer of 1980 and became
president in July 1998, will retain that title and also take a
board seat.
</P>
<P>
   Gates will remain chairman and take on a new role: chief
software architect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a nice milestone to look back and say, `Hey, over the
last 25 years we really got something done,' and I'm proud of
that,'' Gates said at a hastily convened press conference Thursday.
``But it's also a milestone to look forward and say, `What can
software _ and in particular, Microsoft software _ do to make
things a lot better in the 10 years to come?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gates led the company's spectacular rise to a business behemoth
worth more than $500 billion and steered it through its turbulent
recent history, including a federal judge's ruling in November that
Microsoft used monopoly powers to harm consumers and competitors.
</P>
<P>
   As Microsoft's new chief, Ballmer declared, ``I'm certainly
honored and very, very excited about the opportunity. I'm
enthusiastic about working with Bill in this new way over the
coming years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer called Gates ``one of the best idea machines in the
world, someone who can see things in a unique way.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how the two men will share their management
responsibilities wasn't immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Allen, who co-founded Microsoft with Gates, worked with
both men at the company and now sits on the company's board, said
he believes their changes in responsibility _ especially Ballmer's
_ will be major.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve has stepped up and taken the additional responsibility,
which is no small thing,'' said Allen, the world's third wealthiest
man, in a rare interview. ``As the CEO, the buck stops with you,
and you have to make real decisions. He'll make a lot of decisions
that formerly were Bill's to make. And he'll do it with his own
style.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer, who used to report to Gates, will now answer to the
board, just as Gates does.
</P>
<P>
   Each man now appears to be doing what he likes best. As
Microsoft's long-time vice president of sales, Ballmer helped make
Windows a household name in the 1990s. The new role, observers
said, is nothing more than an extension of his role as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people miss is that despite everything, Ballmer gets the
job done,'' said Michael Gartenberg, vice president of the
technology consulting firm, the Gartner Group.
</P>
<P>
   William Epifanio, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, said, ``This is a
good change. Microsoft faces a lot of challenges going forward, and
Ballmer is a terrific manager, really, with a personality more
suited to the chief executive's job than Bill Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Gates, he said he has wanted for at least two years to
get back to a more strategic position. As chief software architect,
he will spend most of his time strategizing with the company's four
product groups, ``talking about feedback we get from developers and
making sure the pieces add up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates said he won't actually be writing code, as he did in the
company's formative years when he wrote operating systems for some
of the earliest personal computers. ``But I may be
(ital)threatening(end ital) to write code,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   The succession comes at what Gates called an inflection point in
the company's evolution. An intense, multi-year effort to create
Windows 2000, the business-oriented operating system that succeeds
Windows NT, came to a climax last month with the product's release
to manufacturing. Gates has described Windows 2000, which is set to
ship Feb. 17, as the most important product Microsoft has ever
produced.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company will turn its attention to an initiative it
calls Next Generation Windows Services, emphasizing the Internet as
a development and application platform at least as heavily as it
does the traditional focus of Microsoft's efforts: the personal
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Products will roll out over the next three years, with early
details to be revealed this spring at Forum 2000, a day for
discussing strategy with press and analysts. Additional details
will be released this summer at the annual developers' conference.
As part of the plan, updates to SQL Server, Exchange, and
development tools will be released over the next year, Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolutionary change in how the company is run, but the
company is at a revolutionary point'' in its development, said Jeff
Raikes, group vice president for worldwide sales and support.
</P>
<P>
   One skeptic suggested Thursday's announcements, which surely
have been pending for months, had nothing to do with the company's
product flow.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, suggested Giga Group analyst Rob Enderle, they may have
been timed to let Microsoft evade an agreement not to discuss
settlement negotiations in the Department of Justice's antitrust
suit.
</P>
<P>
   A government proposal, leaked Wednesday, suggested the
plaintiffs favor a harsh penalty: breaking up the company into
three pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Enderle suggested that Microsoft's responding to a press
question about that proposal would offer the company a chance to
comment without formally making a statement. And sure enough, in
answer to the first question asked at the press conference, Ballmer
blasted the government's idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be absolutely reckless and irresponsible for
anyone to try to break up this company,'' Ballmer said. ``I think
it would be unprecedented, and I think it would be the single
greatest disservice that anybody could do to consumers in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer said in a teleconference call he believed the
government's leaks were deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Allen rejected Enderle's theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who thinks this is a reaction to the lawsuit ... is
getting it completely wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On CNBC, President Clinton described Ballmer as ``a very able
man, and Gates is a genius with technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer is the son of Swiss immigrants. He grew up in Detroit,
where his father worked for Ford Motor Co. A graduate of Harvard
University, Ballmer earned a degree in applied math and economics
and later worked at Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. as an assistant product
manager, according to his official Microsoft biography. He then
attended the Stanford Graduate School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer's bulldog attitude is what attracted Gates when he first
met Ballmer at Harvard, where they were both students. The two have
worked closely together ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve is a great manager and a great motivator,'' Raikes said.
``I've worked for Steve for 18 years, and I can say that the
company's in good hands.''

BRUINS COULD BE EMBARRASSED AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ UCLA forward Rico Hines, a Greenville, N.C.
native, will have 20 friends and family members at Saturday's game
against North Carolina. He's hoping to avoid an embarrassing
homecoming, but the way the Bruins are playing, that's always a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, man,'' Hines said, shaking his head at the prospect.
``That can't happen. I want to beat them so bad, I can't tell
you.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins are headed for more humiliation if they don't
regroup from their heartless 91-79 loss to USC on Wednesday, their
worst city series defeat since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   They have 48 hours. That's not enough time to correct all their
problems _ check back in Y3K for that _ but for the moment,
horrendous fundamentals, abysmal mental preparation and
questionable strategy are not the primary concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the strategy in the world isn't going to help if we aren't
competitive,'' Hines said. ``We've got to do some soul-searching.
We've got to flush this loss and get ready for the Tar Heels. We
can't pout. We've got to be intense. We've got to compete. That's
what we didn't do (against USC).''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (9-4, 1-2) acknowledge the spectacle of Saturday's
game but question its significance. True, it won't change their
deteriorating position in the Pac-10 race (they trail Arizona by
two games), but a win would do wonders for their sagging spirits.
It would reaffirm their faith in the new offense. It would bolster
their case on Selection Sunday, and it would improve their soiled
national reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Under coach Steve Lavin, UCLA is 1-5 against Duke, North
Carolina, Kansas and Kentucky. What's more, the losses have come by
an (ital)average!off! of 24 points. Not only hasn't UCLA been
successful against the legendary programs, it often hasn't been
competitive _ just as it wasn't competitive against USC.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the Pac-10 race and national image are the least
of UCLA's concerns. To secure an NCAA Tournament berth, the Bruins
must win nine of their last 17 games. Six are against Arizona
(twice), Stanford (twice), Syracuse and North Carolina. They also
visit the inhospitable Oregon schools, plus pesky Cal and Arizona
State.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, their streak of 11-consecutive 20-win seasons is in
serious jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have been on the brink before. In 1997, they lost
three of four games and were in danger of missing the tournament.
They regrouped, won 12 straight and brought home the Pac-10 title.
In 1998, they stumbled at Oregon and Stanford, then escaped from
Cal and beat USC in overtime. Last year, after being swept in the
Bay Area, they repelled USC in the final seconds. Talent and energy
were enough to overcome sloppy play.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a difference this year: the Bruins don't have
Charles O'Bannon, J.R. Henderson, Toby Bailey or Baron Davis to
make big plays in desperate times. Forward Jason Kapono is superb,
but he's a freshman with no help from his teammates:
</P>
<P>
   _ In his past six games, junior point guard Earl Watson has
almost as many turnovers (26) as assists (28).
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Shooting'' guard Ray Young has 10 points in the past three
games.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forward Jerome Moiso, the team's leading scorer at Christmas,
is averaging 8.8 points in his past four games. He made one basket
in the decisive first half against USC.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, Moiso and Young were supposed to be UCLA's playmakers.
Instead, they're either playing poorly, playing without passion, or
both.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is this: Two months is more than enough time to
salvage the season, but the reclamation project must begin Saturday
in the Dean Dome. The Bruins don't have to win, but a good showing
is essential.
</P>
<P>
   Another rollover, and the season might be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys that as bad as it was here (USC), it'll be
worse at North Carolina if we don't compete,'' Hines said. ``They
lost to Wake Forest (Wednesday), so they'll be all fired up.
They're licking their chops.''
</P>
<P>
   Time to see if the Bruins have any chops.
</P>

LAKERS FACE PACERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS -- So, what does a team that's won 16 games
straight do for an encore? The possibilities for the Lakers are
endless, and poss ibly, ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, the 33-game NBA record set by the 1971-72
Lakers. But how about a modest 20-game set? That would tie the
second longest st reak in history.
</P>
<P>
   Or a 70-win season? That would move the current Lakers past the
1971-72 team's 69-win season and into Chicago Bulls territory (72
wins, 1995-96 ).
</P>
<P>
   Anything seems possible as the Lakers try to extend the streak
to 17 to night against the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven teams in NBA history have won at least 17 in a row,
meaning the Lakers are already in heady company.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-win Lakers won the championship. The 20-win Milwaukee
Bucks of 1 971-72 did too. Three teams won 18 in a row, and two of
them -- the 1969 -70 Knicks and 1995-96 Bulls -- won the
championship. Two teams have won 17 straight, including the 1959-60
Celtics, who also won a championship .
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the current 16-game streak, matched by three
other tea ms and tying the second longest streak in Laker history,
which on its own, ``is an accomplishment,'' forward Rick Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously a franchise with a lot of great history. To be
one of the better teams that have put together a streak is
something that's nic e to be part of,'' he said. ``But I don't
necessarily think it's going t o amount to much if we don't really
accomplish what we ultimately set ou t to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   The 33-game record, coach Phil Jackson said, is still too far
off to co ntemplate. But a 70-win season, he can visualize.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has potential,'' Jackson said. ``I mean, it has
potential maybe not this year, maybe in the future ahead of it, the
potential to do that. It takes so many lucky things, like health
and scheduling and the right stuff. They're not quite ready yet.
They're not totally mature in their game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Robert Horry was scheduled to be fitted for a
protective mask Thursday, but it's still uncertain whether he will
play tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Horry broke his nose when he caught an elbow from Milwaukee's
Tim Thoma s in Wednesday's victory over the Bucks. He was able to
practice Thursda y, without any protection, but his status tonight
might depend simply on his pain threshold.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have been relatively injury-free since Dec. 1, when
Kobe Bry ant returned from a broken hand. In the 21 games that have
followed, no member of the Lakers' nine-man rotation has been
injured, though Glen Rice missed one game with the flu.

USC HAS PROPER FOCUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's basketball season took a huge leap forward
after its victory over UCLA on Wednesday, but forward Brian
Scalabrine thinks the Trojans' fortunes really changed after the
team began to think small.
</P>
<P>
   Following an embarrassing 76-66 loss to Long Beach State on Dec.
16, USC coach Henry Bibby forced the Trojans to watch game films
until 2 a.m. the next morning. Afterward, the team decided to
re-evaluate its goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the year, we were so involved with looking
at the NCAA Tournament, and our chances of making it, it was really
hurting us,'' Scalabrine said. ``We figured out if we're going to
be the best team we can, we're just going to have to take it one
game at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're really putting something together.''
</P>
<P>
   Just average:Guard Jeff Trepagnier scored a career-high 26
points, made 11 of 15 shots and grabbed 10 rebounds against UCLA,
but that wasn't enough to impress Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Jeff played average. I expect a little more out of
him,'' Bibby said. ``He didn't have his usual bounce he's had. But
you look at the stat sheet and he played a good game.''
</P>
<P>
   Trepagnier, who sprained his ankle during Monday's practice, did
not dispute Bibby's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was an average game also. I was getting burned on
defense,'' he said.

TUG OF WAR AS COMPLEX AS WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Which was tougher: prying three American soldiers
from the grasp of Slobodan Milosevic, or trying to liberate a
6-year-old Cuban boy from bureaucratic bumbling, juridical
hocus-pocus and political pandering in America?
</P>
<P>
   No contest, said the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, until two weeks
ago the general secretary of the National Council of Churches in
New York. ``Getting the soldiers out of Serbia wasn't easy, but it
was easier,'' she said. ``As complicated as that was, the emotions
vested in the Cuban-Americans in Miami and the political weight
that they have _ that's the wild card in this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' as you have no doubt figured out, is the fate of Elian
Gonzalez, the boy who survived an escape from Cuba that drowned his
mother and who now carries four decades of miserable United
States-Cuban relations on his tiny shoulders. Had he come from any
other country, Ms. Campbell said, this affair would have been a
no-brainer. Elian would have been sent home to his father weeks
ago, instead of remaining in Miami with relatives and other
Cuban-Americans out to make an anti-Castro poster boy of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's deep in the American court system that children belong
with their families unless their families are abusive,'' she said
in her Manhattan apartment. ``And nobody, not even people who want
to make hay out of this, are saying this father is abusive. In
fact, he had primary care for the child.''
</P>
<P>
   How did a New Yorker get caught up in this messy business? Easy.
The same way Ms. Campbell joined the Rev. Jesse Jackson and other
American religious leaders on a mission to Serbia last spring to
free three soldiers held captive by Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   Getting involved is what she did for nine years as leader of the
church council, which encompasses 35 Christian denominations with
54 million members. The tug of war over Elian was a natural issue
for her. She has visited Cuba regularly for more than 30 years. The
Cuban Council of Churches enlisted her help, she said, even though
she was leaving the American council to become chaplain of the
Chautauqua Institution in western New York. The two councils had
strong relations since well before Castro took power in 1959. She
elaborated:
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `Look, we're prepared to offer ourselves as a third
party that could take this boy back to Cuba, turn him over to the
Cuban Council of Churches rather than to the government, and they
would turn him over directly to his father.' Our government said,
`Interesting idea; it might work.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is different than Bill Clinton giving him to Fidel
Castro,'' she said. ``The hardest thing for the Miami people to
take would be, `OK, we'll hand him over to Castro.'''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she visited Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, a
hotel worker in the coastal town of Cardenas. She and another
council official, the Rev. Oscar Bolioli, were among the few
outsiders given such access. There were also both sets of Elian's
grandparents and other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are genuine emotions in this family, genuine grief,
genuine tears about this boy not being there,'' Ms. Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   What about suspicions that Gonzalez is little more than a Castro
marionette? Why does he not go to Miami, as some demand, and make
his case there?
</P>
<P>
   Because, Ms. Campbell replied, he fears ``being trapped'' by
lawsuits and subpoenas. His concern seems not unreasonable. We have
already been treated to political theatrics like a congressional
subpoena of little Elian. As for the family being puppets, Ms.
Campbell said, ``I've been in those situations many times in my
life, and there was no looking over the shoulder, the kind of thing
you see when people are nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   But wouldn't Elian have a happier, freer life in this country?
``I do think _this is more as a mother and a grandmother _ there is
a reason that in our country, we make the assumption that children
belong in their families, that that's where they can grow up to be
the healthiest adults,'' she said. ``If we don't believe that, the
whole family structure becomes up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter is a county commissioner in Cleveland,'' Ms.
Campbell continued. ``She said, `Mother, tonight we have over 5,000
children in protective custody for only one reason: nobody loves
them.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know for sure about the family is that they spoke from
their hearts, that they miss this little boy, and that they
certainly have the capacity to love him. That, in many ways, is all
you can ask of a family.''

AIRBUS ORDERS JET BY BOEING 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For the first time in its 30-year history, Airbus
Industrie significantly beat Boeing in winning orders for new
airplanes last year.
</P>
<P>
   The final numbers released Thursday by Airbus showed it bested
Boeing by nearly 20 percentage points _ 59 percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, the Airbus backlog of planes on order is now
nearly equal to that of Boeing. Airbus has a backlog of 1,445
planes, against 1,512 for Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great year for Airbus. They beat Boeing fair and
square,'' said Joe Campbell, chief aerospace analyst for Leahman
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't see Airbus being able to sustain this level of
difference between themselves and Boeing'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Boeing said the numbers show it is clearly time
for Airbus to end its use of government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing congratulates Airbus on its successes, which underscore
the fact that Airbus should no longer need government subsidies to
compete in the market place,'' said Randy Harrison, spokesman for
Boeing Commercial Airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of subsidies has been a sore point with Boeing for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   The gap in orders between Airbus and Boeing last year was even
wider than a first look at the numbers suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus said it had 476 firm orders in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, according to its web site, had 391 new orders in 1999.
But analysts said the Boeing figure is misleading because it
includes planes ordered in 1998 and in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In mid December, Alan Mulally, president of Boeing Commercial
Airplanes, announced that Boeing, to be consistent with the way
Airbus does things, would for the first time count orders from
customers who did not want to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   That meant Boeing was adding 163 such orders from unidentified
customers to its 1999 total, Mulally said.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those orders had been placed in 1998 and in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, the analyst, said 59 of the planes were actually
ordered the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's Harrison said the figure was 58 planes. Using that
number, Boeing ended the year with only 333 new orders in 1999s. So
the 476 orders claimed by Airbus represents about 59 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has long argued that Airbus has on occasion counted
commitments in its order totals and not firm orders as Boeing does.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus said Thursday, in announcing its 1999 results at a news
conference in Paris, that it only counted orders for which a
contract was signed and a down payment was made.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison would not say if Boeing still suspects that Airbus has
fudged its numbers, but he did hint in a comment that Boeing is
suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1994, Airbus has claimed to have won about half the
orders,'' Harrison said. ``This year, six years after they first
claimed near equality in orders, we will deliver 480 planes and
they say they will deliver just over 300. So one has to wonder at
what point their orders take the form of aluminum rolling out the
door.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Boeing delivered a record 620 planes, while Airbus
delivered 294.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Chairman Phil Condit likes to make the point that
deliveries are a much better way to judge Boeing's performance
against Airbus. That's because orders can change and also because
airlines pay the bulk of the purchase price of a new plane upon
delivery, not when the plane is ordered.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Beoing had 45 order cancelations and Airbus had 46,
according to calculations by Leahman Brothers' Campbell and other
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Taking that into account, Boeing had net 1999 orders of 288
planes and Airbus had net orders for 430 planes.
</P>
<P>
   Only once before, in 1994, has Airbus claimed to have beaten
Boeing in new orders. But that was at a time in the industry when
orders were so far down for both manufacturers that the Airbus
victory was considered insignificant. And considering the
cancellations that year, it was pretty close to a dead heat,
according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Airbus win is an important measure of how far
Airbus has come toward its goal of being Boeing's equal, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give Airbus a lot of credit,'' said Bill Fiala of
Edward Jones. ``They have done a great job of taking a company with
less than 20 percent market share and getting to 50 percent. But
that's only half the equation. They also need profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Airbus is a consortium of four companies from France, Germany,
England and Spain. It does not make public its financial
performance and most analysts believe Airbus has sold planes at
huge discounts to gain market share against Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus said the 476 planes ordered in 1999 have a list price of
about $30.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said its 391 orders would be valued at about $28.3
billion at list prices.
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell, the industry analysts, said the actual dollar
values of the 1999 orders by Boeing and Airbus are much less when
discounts are taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   He calculated that Boeing's 332 new orders are worth about $17.5
billion and the 476 Airbus planes are worth about $21.9 billion at
discounted prices.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives have said repeatedly over the last year the
company will walk away from a deal if it can't make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have welcomed such talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather Boeing have 30 percent market share and hefty
margins than 50 percent and struggling to show a profit,'' Fiala
said.
</P>
<P>
   David Venz, an Airbus spokesman, said the European plane maker
is winning the competitions against Boeing because its planes have
greater commonality, such as similar cockpits. And that means cost
savings to customers.
</P>
<P>
   He also dismissed reports that Boeing has been losing market
share because of pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing has been saying that for 10 years,'' he said in a
recent interview. ``Whenever they lose it always comes to pricing.
If Airbus is such a notorious under pricer, why would we ever
lose?''
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research, discounted
commonality as the reason for the Airbus gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does Airbus explain the former success of Boeing,'' he
asked. ``I don't see that Airbus planes have any more commonality
now than they used to have.''
</P>
<P>
   He said pricing, not commonality, best explains the Airbus wins.
Boeing can't compete as it once did because of its own undoing, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's cost skyrocketed two years ago when its assembly lines
faltered as the company ramped up production to record levels.
Boeing took about $3 billion in unanticipated charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``They screwed up royally,'' Nisbet said of Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing must continue to get its production costs down so it can
offer airlines more attractive prices for its planes if it wants to
be competitive with Airbus, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's new executive team is making great progress in
cutting costs, Nisbet said. He expects Boeing to narrow the order
gap this year, and possibly overtake Airbus again by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long slow process,'' Nisbet said. ``What Boeing did was
like throwing sand in a smoothly running engine. You can't wash it
out. You have to rebuild it.''

EDITORIAL: LEAVING THE COCOON 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Jan. 14:
</P>
<P>
   Whether by prearrangement or on the advice of Walter Cronkite,
David Letterman was extremely gentle to Hillary Rodham Clinton as
she took her first steps this week into the real world of New
York's brand of performance politics. Mrs. Clinton should be
pleased with the good reviews she got for composure and humor. But
she should also know that this was only a small step in the
direction of conducting an open campaign. Now that she is a
resident of the state, it is time for Mrs. Clinton to emerge fully
from the White House cocoon.
</P>
<P>
   New York likes its politicians available _ on the phone, at the
subway, in your face. The local style is to be open to questions
from constituents and reporters on any and all subjects, instead of
seeking out hand-picked audiences and softball questions. To be
taken seriously as a candidate, Mrs. Clinton needs to show she does
not have to hide behind her advance team and press spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons, of course, that Mrs. Clinton has not been
readily available to potential constituents until the past few
days. She had the holiday scene at her former home in Washington.
She moved to a new house in Westchester County. And because she is
the president's wife, there are legitimate security concerns that
have to be honored.
</P>
<P>
   But by choosing to run she has obligated herself to find ways to
engage issues, the public and the press. In other words, it's
showtime. Surveys suggest that Mrs. Clinton's reclusiveness has
been costly. One poll even found that the first lady was running
behind Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in support among women. The message
seems to be that she needs to be more on view, countering the
general worry that she is too cautious and pre-packaged to make it
in New York's rowdy political arena.
</P>
<P>
   Every candidate faces threshold questions about campaign
competence and fitness for office. Some of these questions are
based on reality. Others are flukes, a ballooning of some momentary
image into a widespread conclusion about a political candidate. But
all candidates have to deal with these issues in full public view.
Giuliani is out there barking his views, making his mistakes and
defending them. Mrs. Clinton has yet to show how well she can
survive as an independent operator outside the cosseted world of
spinners and loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   Public politicking is a nonpartisan New York tradition. One
notable practitioner, former Mayor Ed Koch, says he has advised the
first lady to ``be open and around and available.'' That is wise
counsel. The Letterman appearance was an entertaining gesture in
the direction of openness. But Mrs. Clinton must move on to a truly
public campaign. &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE MAYOR'S POLITICAL RENDERING 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Jan. 14:
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's State of the City speech on Thursday
was in part a summation of his now-familiar list of successes over
the last six years. Giuliani sought to define and secure his legacy
in what ``could be my last'' such annual accounting at New York's
City Hall. But it was also a highly political campaign speech for
his Senate race against the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton. The
mayor burnished his tax-cutting credentials by agreeing to push for
some $2 billion in business and income tax reductions to spur
economic growth. And he sought to distance himself from the city's
school crisis with proposals on privatization, vouchers and tenure
that might score points with the Republicans' core constituencies
but would cause more harm in the schools than good.
</P>
<P>
   With education stirring new passions nationwide, the mayor
showed his own intense feelings on the issue, heatedly complaining
at one point about the city's failure to educate vast numbers of
students each year. He called for an end to teacher tenure,
accusing the teachers' union, which supports Mrs. Clinton, of
caring more about job protection than schoolchildren. His proposal
could earn support, but such a plan might hamper the city's
nationwide recruiting program at a time when the system faces a
devastating shortage of teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also thumped for vouchers, a plan that wins support
from conservatives but serves only a few needs in a vastly needy
system like New York City's. A fight over the voucher issue has
already destabilized the school system once, and to reintroduce it
now, with new interim and permanent chancellors not even in place,
is needlessly provocative. Just as destabilizing is the mayor's
suggestion that private companies be used to conduct summer school
classes, which will have to serve 300,000 or more children who need
help this summer. Privatization would introduce a needless
complication into a task that has to be organized quickly by the
new interim chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor even announced plans to sell the city's big old school
administration building as a way to shrink the school bureaucracy,
a proposal that smacks more of posturing than of any serious effort
to reform school administration.
</P>
<P>
   Scorched by his latest policy of arresting the homeless, the
mayor tried once again to explain the complexity of treating a
population that includes not only criminals but also the needy and
the mentally ill. Giuliani promised to help convert the many
shelters now run by private or religious groups into ``New Start
Centers'' to give the homeless the various levels of help needed. A
new name, however, must come with the resolve to back these groups
with the funds to fulfill such a mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the mayor outlined tax cuts on commercial rents and
hotel occupancy, plus an income tax credit proposal that would have
widespread appeal. The plan must be weighed against future budget
gaps to be fully evaluated when a budget plan is released later
this month.

CHOUINARD WIFE TELLS OF ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BEVERLY FORD AND VICTORIA HARKER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Diamondbacks pitcher Bobby Chouinard's Christmas night
arrest for threatening to kill his wife was not the first time he
aimed a gun at his her during their turbulent 10-year relationship,
Erica Chouinard told police.
</P>
<P>
   In tape recorded interviews released Thursday, Jan. 13, Erica
Chouinard told police that her 27-year-old husband always had a
problem with his temper and often became physically abusive when he
drank.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been times when I think I've had broken ribs, times
where I've had more marks. I've taken punches to the stomach, more
slaps to the face. I've drawn blood on my lip,'' she told a Phoenix
police officer after her husband's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is the first time I can remember him actually loading
a gun, pointing it at me and threatening and threatening for more
than a second . . . I really actually thought he was going to beat
me, really, really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Erica said the last time her husband aimed a gun at her was
about eight or nine months ago after he had been drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got sent down from the major leagues to Triple A that day
and had some drinks and that night we got in a fight and he pointed
a gun at me,'' she told police. ``I can't even remember what we
were fighting about.''
</P>
<P>
   In a tape recording of Bobby Chouinard's police interview, which
was also made available to the media, he admitted pointing the
loaded weapon at his wife but told police he only meant ``to scare
her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I grabbed my gun, pointed it to my head and asked her if
that's what she wanted,`` he told the officers. ``She said `no.'
Then I pointed it at her and asked if that's what she wanted and
she said `no' and that's when I put it down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never intended on shooting her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Erica's interview with police, however, reveals a frightened
woman who was attacked, choked and slapped during a fight that
began when she refused to go out on Christmas night and buy her
husband more beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had both hands around my neck,'' she said, describing the
look on her husband's face as ``pure venom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `stop, not in front of the baby, what are you doing? I
love you. . .' and he smacked me. It was an open-handed smack. He
slapped me and I started to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a familiar Christmas scenario, Erica said. Exactly one
year earlier, her husband choked and slapped her as they argued on
Christmas Day, she told police.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, when her husband stormed into the bedroom to get
his gun, she was so afraid he would kill her that she dialed 911.
Moments later, her husband ripped the phone from the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I backed out of the room, got down on my hands and knees and
literally begged for my life,'' she told police. ``I was crying so
hard, begging so hard. I don't know what made him put the gun
away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was desperate. I was doing anything I could do so he
wouldn't shoot me,'' she told an investigator.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the alleged abuse, Christmas was the first time police
were called to the Chouinard house.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Jan. 13, Chouinard waived his right to appear in
court, where he was to face arraignment on aggravated assault
charges for the Christmas night attack.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Ronald Reinstein of Maricopa County Superior Court entered
a plea of innocent on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the pitcher faces 5 to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for both Erica and Bobby have said the two are back
together, in counseling and committed to keeping their marriage
together. It remains unclear whether she will testify against her
husband in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby, meanwhile, is working out with the Diamondbacks and
expects to participate in spring training, said his attorney, Larry
Debus.
</P>
<P>
   Neither husband nor wife could be reached for comment Thursday,
Jan. 13. &QL;

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Jan. 14:
</P>
<P>
   Turkey made the right choice in deferring the execution of
Abdullah Ocalan, the Kurdish rebel leader, until the European Court
of Human Rights hears his appeal. The decision took political
courage in a country where passions against Ocalan run high. But it
will help smooth Turkey's path into the European Union, and may
permit a solution to the Kurdish conflict, Turkey's most vexing
internal problem. Turkey is not obliged to follow the court's
ruling, but has obeyed its decisions in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan was seized in Kenya last February, brought to Turkey and
tried for the murder of the more than 30,000 people killed in the
Kurdish insurgency. He was convicted and sentenced to death last
June. Ocalan has tried to bargain for his life by offering to
broker an end to the 15-year-long Kurdish conflict. He has also
ordered his followers to withdraw from battle. As a result Kurdish
violence inside Turkey has sharply diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Others with terrorist pasts, like Yasser Arafat of the Palestine
Liberation Organization and Gerry Adams of the Irish Republican
Army's political wing, Sinn Fein, have swapped violence for
political bargaining and contributed to peacemaking. Istanbul
should give Ocalan a chance to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Delaying his execution will ease European concerns about
Turkey's human rights record and its retention of the death
penalty, which all members of the European Union have abolished.
Turkey has not executed anyone since 1984. Ending that moratorium
would be a mistake. Turkey should not just postpone Ocalan's
hanging, but cancel it.  &QL;

GOOD NIGHT TURNS BAD ON MURRAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Thursday night started out great for Glen Murray,
but it went south in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, a streaky goal scorer all season, got one 3:36 into the
game against St. Louis, just his second in the last 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   But minutes later, Murray was checked into the boards by the
Blues' Tyson Nash and injured his right shoulder. Murray went for
X-rays, which were negative, but he did receive a chest contusion
and did not return.
</P>
<P>
   Then between periods, there was a scoring change, giving Bryan
Smolinski the goal on a redirect of Murray's slap shot from the
slot.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, tied with Ziggy Palffy for second behind Luc Robitaille
with 14 goals, has been hot and cold most of the season. It started
during the first week when he was held to one assist in the first
six games then scored three goals at Edmonton on Oct. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Murray had his best stretch this year from Nov. 23 to Dec. 10
when he scored eight goals seven games. He had two goals in three
of those games.
</P>
<P>
   But until he scored an empty net goal Jan. 6 against Florida,
Murray went two games without a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get more from him,'' coach Andy Murray said. ``We
need balanced scoring from the first and second lines and he is a
big part of that. He'll pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, 27, scored a career-high 31 goals for the Kings during
the 1997-98 season. He dropped to 16 last year when he missed 19
games with a torn medial collateral in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you keep working hard, you will get your goals,'' Murray
said. ``When they aren't coming, you still can help your team by
doing the other things that help you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Snubbed: Kings right-winger Ziggy Palffy was not named to the
World team for the Feb. 6 All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, who has missed four games since early December with a
sore lower back, has two goals since returning from injured
reserved on Dec. 14. He has missed two practices with flareups to
the back, but has remained the Kings leading scorer most of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, who made the All-Star team two years ago when he played
with the New York Islanders, received 235,592 votes finished fourth
on the ballot to Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr (1,020,736), the Mighty
Ducks' Teemu Selanne (652,620) and Florida's Pavel Bure (435,161).
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he would have made it,'' general manager Dave Taylor
said. ``But the are some guys who made it that are hurt so
something might happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the forwards who made the team despite getting fewer votes
than Palffy: Calgary's Valeri Bure (235,095), Buffalo's Marovlav
Satan (160.301), St. Louis' Pavol Demitra (153,067), Carolina's
Sami Kapanen (100,596) and Montreal's Martin Rucinsky (49,266).
</P>
<P>
   Each team must have a representative in the game. Captain Rob
Blake will be the Kings' only representative. Last season, Blake
and Luc Robitaille played for North America. Mattias Norstrom
represented the World team.

PROPOSED MERGER OF AOL, TIME WARNER IS MUCH ABOUT INTERNET MANIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Early investor reaction to the proposed merger of
America Online and Time Warner is the goofiest example yet of the
Internet stock mania.
</P>
<P>
   After the market had gotten over the shock of the announcement,
AOL's stock price came under pressure. One analyst said AOL chief
Steve Case's decision to acquire the Time Warner colossus implied
acknowledgement that his company's stock was worth $50 a share
rather than the $70-something it was fetching last week.
</P>
<P>
   How can this be? The corporate empires built by the respective
efforts of publishing magnate Henry Luce and the Warner Bros. movie
moguldom have been leaders in their industries during much of the
20th century. Together they have become a leading media
entertainment business.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is still in its infancy, but is nevertheless a dominant
Internet player. It owes its ability to buy Time Warner to the
fanciful valuations being given Internet companies by frenzied
speculators. AOL perceives the need for product, which Time Warner
has aplenty. It also needs entree into the millions of homes wired
to the Time Warner cable system. Time Warner perceives the need to
expand its distribution capability, and AOL brings millions of its
Internet customers to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're a rational being with a modest working knowledge of
traditional markets, what's not to like? AOL gets an established
corporation with tons of media and entertainment product; Time
Warner gets substantially more opportunity to market these wares.
How does this make AOL's stock worth less than when it was a
smaller, undiversified enterprise?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to life in the wacky world of Internet stock
speculation. Last month a company with $14.5 million in losses on
revenue of about $18 million in the first nine months of 1999 saw
its publicly traded stock soar 700 percent on the same day it was
initially issued. The record eclipsed one set a year earlier by
another Internet company, which has since seen its stock price
crash and burn.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is whether AOL's stock price can remain high
enough long enough for the guppy to swallow the whale. Regulatory
approval could take 12 to 18 months; if AOL's stock decline
continues, the shares that are its currency could lose value to the
point of jeopardizing the deal.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal goes forward, however, it will mark the advent of a
new era in American business. It has always been a given that
Internet mania would run its course. Lucky speculators early to the
party with sense enough to leave before it's over will be the
richer for it. The latecomers will come to the same grief
latecomers always suffer when speculative craziness passes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most apt analogy for today's Internet phenomenon is
what happened in the auto industry in the early 20th century.
Everyone knew there was a lot of money to be made from the new
technology, but most investment bets became losers during the
sorting-out process.
</P>
<P>
   For every General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, there were many
more start-ups that became investment croppers. AOL Time Warner may
prove the Internet industry's version of GM or Ford, while many
others will become the info-tech age's Hupmobile, Pierce-Arrow and
Stanley Steamer.

   UNDATED: lucrative business customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large telecom carriers don't want the headaches of customer
service and call centers for small Internet users,'' said Joe
Eshoo, Internet analyst at A.G. Edwards. ``Sprint sold off its
residential customer base to Earthlink, and now acts as a
wholesaler. UUNet is also a wholesaler.''
</P>
<P>
   That may change.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the companies say the new WorldCom will
aggressively pursue residential customers. But the strategy to
blanket local markets with high bandwidth connections is still
piecemeal, relying on a hodgepodge of digital phone lines, fixed
wireless systems and possibly cable lines, if cable companies are
forced to open their networks to other competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say one effect of the AOL-Time Warner deal might be an
acceleration of all telephone companies' efforts to provide such
high-speed connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of these events creates more urgency in the
marketplace,'' Kagan said. ``It throws gasoline on the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   On the upside for the new WorldCom and competitors such as AT&AMP;T,
it could take years for AOL and Time Warner to figure out how to
digitize all of the content they own, put in software to deliver
it, upgrade their networks and figure out how to price the premium
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see that content will be the big driver in the future.
But how far in the future and how much is it going to cost?'' Eshoo
asked. ``There are economies of scale in delivering these services.
If you don't have enough potential customers out there, does it pay
to digitize the content?''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's Schell said the company had looked at the content
business for years but always concluded that ``content owners
maximize value by maximizing their distribution channels.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, AOL always will be looking for new customers and
will need to reach beyond the local networks that Time Warner owns,
cutting deals with other network providers to reach new markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get extraordinarily good at facilitating the
distribution of content,'' said Schell, downplaying the likelihood
that the new WorldCom would become a content provider.
</P>
<P>
   But the move toward content is already apparent. Sprint is
cutting deals almost weekly to bring news, information and
e-commerce content to its Sprint PCS Wireless Web service. And the
company talks about caching data for customers and hosting software
applications and servers on its Integrated On-Demand Network.
</P>
<P>
   That's content, analysts say, and it will only become more
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, this doesn't preclude a deal between AOL Time Warner
and MCI WorldCom,'' Kagan said. ``Put Steve Case (of AOL), Gerry
Levin (of Time Warner) and Bernie Ebbers together at a cocktail
party and we could have some serious mergers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebbers, whose company has completed 65 mergers since 1983,
hinted at the possibilities at Wednesday's news conference, albeit
jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed that AOL took Time Warner before we did,'' he
said.

AOL-TIME WARNER MERGER HAS PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE NEW
WORLDCOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The titans of telecommunications woke up Monday with a
new giant in their midst, one sending shock waves through an
industry already in upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts hailed the proposed combination of America
Online and Time Warner as the perfect marriage of new media and old
_ of content, customers and the high-tech networks to bring them
all together.
</P>
<P>
   This, many analysts concluded, is the shape of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It confirms what the future is,'' said Peter Jarich of the
Strategis Group. ``This shows that you won't have traditional phone
companies. You'll have integrated media companies that do it all.''
</P>
<P>
   If true, the deal could have profound implications for the likes
of Sprint Corp. and MCI WorldCom Inc., whose planned merger was the
toast of media circles just two months ago but now sounds old hat.
</P>
<P>
   The new AOL Time Warner would control a vast collection of
entertainment and information, from movie and music libraries to
television channels and mainstream magazines. AOL has 20 million
online customers. Time Warner owns cable networks that pass 20
million homes, potentially with high-speed Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wake-up call for traditional telcos,'' said Jeanne
Schaaf, an analyst with Forrester Research. ``They're still
thinking about bundling local and long-distance service, and now
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this says is that content matters. Consumers don't want
pipes. They want what comes over the pipes.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, however, Sprint and MCI WorldCom say they're
delighted with the deal. Both companies say that, far from
undermining their deal, it validates the argument they are making
to regulators _ that only the strong will survive.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the National Press Club on Wednesday, MCI Chief
Executive Bernard Ebbers called the AOL-Time Warner deal ``a great
merger'' that would have wide implications for customers and his
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to offer consumers some tremendous advantages they
haven't had before,'' he said. ``We view this as very positive for
MCI WorldCom.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Schell, senior vice president of strategic planning at
Sprint, echoed Ebbers' comments and downplayed the potential threat
from a new competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that Time Warner is a substantial player in the
cable industry,'' Schell said, ``but they really only run to a
small percentage of households in the U.S. ... This hasn't
transformed them overnight into a ubiquitous communications
provider.''
</P>
<P>
   If the respective deals make it past regulators, the AOL deal
clearly has implications for the new WorldCom. Investors sent a
clear message about the perceived consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The stock price of MCI WorldCom slipped 9.3 percent Tuesday,
partly on speculation that AOL _ MCI WorldCom's largest customer _
would no longer need the company's services.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who connect to AOL by dial-up modems do so over local
connections provided by MCI WorldCom's Internet division, UUNet.
MCI also provides AOL, the largest online service in the world,
with its connections to the Internet, known as Internet backbone
services.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to reporters' questions Wednesday, Ebbers said there
might be even greater demand for UUNet's services after the AOL
merger with Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We supply a lot of their capability of getting into homes, and
we feel this will provide them the capability of getting into a lot
more homes,'' Ebbers said. ``We are very excited about the
potential for that merger.''
</P>
<P>
   UUNet would lose out if AOL customers moved to Time Warner's
networks en masse to get their local connections through cable
modems. Those connections are 27 times faster than the dial-up
connections that UUNet provides.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts think that's unlikely, in the short run at least.
Internet users with high-speed connections are still in the
minority and are forecast to remain that way for the next two to
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, AOL still would need a backbone provider to route its
customers onto the Internet. Ebbers said AOL was bound to a
long-term contract, though he wasn't specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a free world out there, and if they decide the service
they can get from someone else is better than they can get from us,
we deserve to lose it,'' Ebbers said. ``I can assure you we don't
intend to lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new WorldCom eventually could find itself facing a
potent competitor in its traditional business _ networks _
particularly in areas where Time Warner owns cable networks.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner has 13 million customers and passes 20 million
homes, and is quickly upgrading its cable lines to provide
high-speed Internet service to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a definite first-mover advantage,'' said Jeffrey
Kagan, an independent communications consultant. ``When a customer
signs up for a bundle of services with high-speed access, they're
not switching any time soon. The expense and the hassle is too
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the company also could provide local telephone
service over its cable networks. AOL is already a large reseller of
long-distance service and might start taking even more market share
when it can bundle that service with local and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy enough for the combined company to add voice
services,'' Schaaf said. ``In places where Time Warner has a
footprint, (competitors) almost have to say, `Forget it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint and MCI are big dogs in long-distance, but they are
struggling to connect their vast web of fiber to customers in local
markets. Neither company is a big Internet provider to residential
customers. Instead, they act as wholesalers to smaller providers
and concentrate their efforts to sell data services to more
lucrative business customers. MORE

GOVERNOR PROPOSES TOUGHENING MISSOURI'S DRUNKEN-DRIVING LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL AND WILL SENTELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan on Thursday called
for wholesale changes in the state's drunken-driving laws that
would lower the intoxication limit to 0.08 percent blood-alcohol
content and increase penalties for offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lives are lost every day in this ultimate act of
carelessness,'' the Democratic governor said in Kansas City, vowing
to work hard to pass the package this legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Democratic leaders in Jefferson City on Thursday
outlined their own legislative agenda, and lowering the definition
of intoxication from 0.1 percent to 0.08 percent was absent.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said he was disappointed but optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we've got to put some pressure on the
legislature, particularly the Senate, to accept and pass these
measures,'' he said. ``But I believe that we're within range of
doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mothers Against Drunk Driving reacted warmly to Carnahan's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am gratified to see the list (of reforms) is as long as it
is,'' said Paula Kanyo, state director. ``I think there is going to
be a lot of people making this part of the agenda whether the
Democratic senators have it on their list or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan announced his plans in Kansas City and cited the
findings of The Kansas City Star. The newspaper last month reported
that Kansas City leads Missouri in alcohol-related accidents, the
number of repeat drunken drivers and the number of repeat offenders
with 10 or more convictions.
</P>
<P>
   And Missouri ranked worse than all but nine states and
Washington, D.C., in 1998 in the percentage of traffic fatalities
that are alcohol-related.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Carnahan was flanked by Jackson County
Prosecutor Bob Beaird, Kansas City Municipal Prosecutor Roger
Potter and Kansas City Police Chief Rick Easley.
</P>
<P>
   Beaird said he was pleased with the governor's package,
particularly a provision that would allow greater penalties for
involuntary manslaughter while driving drunk. The current maximum
of seven years would increase to 15.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's plan also would double the maximum penalty for
first offenders to one year in jail and create a possible life
sentence for people with more than five convictions.
</P>
<P>
   It would ban open alcohol containers for passengers in vehicles.
It would end suspension of sentences, which can conceal a drunken
driver's record.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan also supports penalties up to five years in prison for
people with a blood-alcohol content of 0.15 percent or greater. The
Missouri Highway Patrol reports more than two-thirds of
alcohol-related fatalities in Missouri in 1998 involved drivers at
that level.
</P>
<P>
   And he would extend drunken-driving laws to boaters on Missouri
lakes and rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan emphasized that lowering the state's intoxication level
to 0.08 _ as 17 other states including Kansas have done _ would
make the state eligible for up to $5 million in federal highway
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   But Carnahan's plan does not include two other provisions that
could avoid a cut of millions of dollars in federal highway
construction money: impoundment or immobilization of offenders'
vehicles and mandatory minimum penalties for repeat offenders.
Although his plan increases the range of penalties, judges still
would be able to grant probation or early release.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said he was focusing on the incentive money available
for adopting a 0.08 intoxication limit.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan's efforts have support in the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Craig Hosmer and Rep. Mike Schilling, both Democrats of
Springfield, will push Carnahan's package in the House. Sen. Wayne
Goode, a Democrat of St. Louis County, has introduced an
``aggravated offender'' bill raising penalties for repeat offenders
with a 0.15 blood-alcohol content or higher.
</P>
<P>
   But other elements in the governor's plan appear to face major
hurdles in the Senate, which has been a stumbling block for years
in drunken-driving legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Key Senate leaders sounded lukewarm to the 0.08 percent plan
Thursday when they unveiled their priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Goode, who Carnahan hopes will support his package, on Thursday
complained that the 0.08 issue seems to have become a ``litmus
test'' for lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Pro Tem Ed Quick, a Liberty Democrat,
questioned whether the 0.08 proposal would address problem
drinkers. Passing the measure might make people think lawmakers had
done more on the alcohol problem than they really did, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most outspoken supporters of the 0.08 bill are
Republicans, including GOP sponsor Sen. Morris Westfall of Halfway.
He said he plans to push hard this year for a floor vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an election year I feel confident if we vote on it, it will
have (the necessary) 18 votes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, a lame-duck governor who is challenging incumbent John
Ashcroft for his U.S. Senate seat this year, conceded it would be
difficult to get his package through the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hard work,'' he said. ``This is going to take lobbying
efforts by me and other interested people in order to make
change.''
</P>
<P>
   The 0.08 percent bill is SB578 (Westfall); Open-container bill
is SB579 (Westfall). Legislation is available on the Missouri
General Assembly site on the Internet at the following address:

U.S. OFFICIALS RELEASE NEW PLAN TO CONTROL MISSOURI RIVER FLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Hoping to end decades of squabbling, federal
officials Thursday released a new plan to control flow of the
Missouri River from Montana to its mouth near St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The plan offered by the Army Corps of Engineers would maintain
enough water during times of drought to keep barges afloat on the
lower Missouri _ but not for the duration that Missouri officials
or the barge industry had sought.
</P>
<P>
   It offers a few more feet of water in the upper river's six main
reservoirs. That might help keep marinas and docks from being left
far from the water's edge, as they were during the drought of the
late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very big step,'' said Richard Opper, executive
director of the Missouri River Basin Association. ``It's about as
close as you can get to a plan that people can live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Some interests on the river will say it doesn't go far enough,
Opper added. Others will say it goes too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this plan will win some support,'' Opper said. ``The last
time, the corps didn't get any support.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan would not allow summertime flows to dwindle along the
lower river. With flows maintained, the navigation season would not
be split. And it doesn't promise to restore a spring rise in the
lower river's flow during drought, one of the most contentious
proposals for the river's future operation.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers in Missouri and other downstream states worry that a
spring rise would threaten crops. But environmentalists say that
the corps must do it to return endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan does nothing substantive for endangered species,''
said Chad Smith of American Rivers, a national river conservation
group. ``The fate of the Missouri River is assuredly going to end
up in the hands of a federal judge.''
</P>
<P>
   American Rivers and the Environmental Defense Fund have
threatened to file a federal lawsuit if the corps doesn't restore
the river's flows to more natural rates.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring backwater areas, such as chutes and swamps, will help
fish and wildlife. But the endangered species won't return until
natural flows are restored, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   But corps officials were optimistic about their new plan's
chances for winning support and approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's considerable consensus and support for this,'' said
Paul Johnston, a spokesman for the corps in Omaha, Neb. ``If this
(revising the river's operation) is going to happen, this is the
time to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The corps plan released Thursday would not be implemented before
2002. The corps plans a series of workshops and public meetings
throughout the basin and a six-month public comment period.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the corps will release its draft environmental impact
statement, which will give more details on the new flow plan and
its impacts.
</P>
<P>
   The corps began in 1989 to revise its Master Manual, which
dictates the river's flows. Those flows are controlled largely by
six main dams, operated like giant bathtubs from which the corps
can hold water upstream or increase flows downstream.
</P>
<P>
   Upstream states pressured the corps to revise the river's
operation because of the drought of the late 1980s. Five years
later, the recommendations from the corps were met with so much
criticism that it withdrew its plan and started anew.
</P>
<P>
   Corps officials Thursday said their plan benefits from the
recent efforts of the basin association to broker an agreement
among its member states on flows during drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at the MRBA (basin association) as a grass-roots
operation,'' Johnston said. ``We've got really wide support for
their recommendations. Even though Missouri was not in support of
the basin association's plans, they were in support of most of the
recommendations.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, Missouri representatives to the basin association
declined to join the other association states in recommending a new
flow plan to the corps. Missouri wanted more water assured during
drought for the barge industry.
</P>
<P>
   The corps also hoped that the plan would withstand any legal or
regulatory challenges of the corps efforts to restore endangered
fish and wildlife in the Missouri basin, Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   The corps and the basin association point to new efforts to help
the endangered piping plover and interior least tern, which like to
nest on sandbars and sandy shores, and the prehistoric pallid
sturgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to restore the sturgeon in the corps plan are restricted
to changes in flow below Fort Peck Dam in Montana, although other
federal efforts are under way to restore more backwater chutes and
swamps in the lower basin.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan and Kansas Gov. Bill
Graves said the governors had yet to review the new plan.

REWARD SET FOR LAPD RECRUITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Rick Orlov  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES, Calif., -- Hard-pressed to recruit and retain
officers, the Los Angeles Police Department wants a few hundred
good men and women and is willing to pay a $2,000 relocation fee
and $200 finder's fee for new cops.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Thursday that the number of officers has declined
to 9,500 and could fall as low as 9,000 because of high attrition
rates, partly caused by other police agencies hiring away LAPD
officers.
</P>
<P>
   To counter that trend, the department has started an aggressive
recruiting drive in Los Angeles and out of state to hire the new
officers needed to maintain its current size as well as hire the
157 new officers needed to keep a federal grant.
</P>
<P>
   The number of officers has risen under the Riordan
administration, peaking at 9,700. The goal is a 10,000-officer
department.
</P>
<P>
   Cmdr. Betty Kelepecz of the LAPD's Personnel Group said it will
offer a $2,000 relocation bonus to any recruit coming more than 150
miles to go through the Police Academy training. In addition, it is
offering a $200 finder's fee for anyone who recommends someone who
completes the training.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters plan to travel around the country this month and next
to lure recruits. Among the areas being visited are New England,
New York, Illinois, Texas and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Kelepecz said the difficulty in recruiting is seen in the size
of classes being graduated. The most recent class had 19 officers
and the current one has 25 recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing all we can to speed the process,'' Kelepecz said.
``Once a person is ready, they go into the next class. There is no
waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan is so concerned about the difficulty in
hiring new officers that he ordered the department two months ago
to take over all recruitment and initial testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor's very concerned about meeting hiring goals and is
looking at any way to streamline the process and get more officers
on the force,'' said Chris Modrzejewski, policy director for
Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg questioned having the department
take over the function, saying she is concerned about the need to
keep testing separate from recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear complaints all the time from people about testing and
whether someone knew someone and gave them an advantage,'' Goldberg
said. ``It's all about appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelepecz said officials shared her concern about fairness but
noted testing is only the first part of a seven-step hiring
process.
</P>
<P>
   Of greater concern to her and others is the loss of officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hearing of cities that are offering to pay the training
costs for officers or with more flexible work schedules,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles requires officers to reimburse the city for its
training if they leave within their first five years.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Feuer said he has been attending police roll
calls and has heard from a number of officers about their plans to
leave the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real fear I have is we will have an even deeper attrition
problem and end up even below our maintenance of efforts (of the
number of officers),'' Feuer said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelepecz said the department also has that concern.
</P>
<P>
   So far for this fiscal year, 365 officers have left the
department, keeping it on the same pace as last year's 700
officers.

ANTI-DRUG DEAL NOT TV FICTION
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES, Calif., -- The federal government gave television
networks financial incentives to put anti-drug messages into the
scripts of some of their most popular shows, including NBC's
``ER,'' ABC's ``The Practice,'' CBS's ``Chicago Hope'' and Fox's
``Beverly Hills 90210.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House drug office -- which reviewed some scripts and
footage in advance of broadcast -- valued the trade-offs at $22
million.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the networks, which have long held their program content
sacred and beyond the reach of would-be government censors, issued
statements denying that they profited from the trade-offs.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement, however, was not known by most of those working
on the shows and raises serious ethical questions about how the
networks can be influenced by outside forces, especially government
policy-makers, when it comes to content.
</P>
<P>
   An investigative report published Thursday by Salon.com, a San
Francisco-based online magazine, said NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox and the WB
offered series episodes with anti-drug themes for the federal
office's approval. The WB was cited as the only network that
changed scripts in response to government drug experts. The shows
were ``Smart Guy'' and ``The Wayan Brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   If drug czar Barry R. McCaffrey's staff deemed the programs
delivered a good message, they credited advertising time the office
was due back to the networks, at least a portion of which was
resold on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement began in 1997 as a well-publicized five-year, $2
billion anti-drug campaign approved by Congress and accepted
reluctantly by the networks. The White House Office of National
Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) drove a hard bargain, negotiating for a
$1 billion cash package and another $1 billion in free air time and
other media considerations for its messages -- those ``this is your
brain on drugs'' spots, among others.
</P>
<P>
   By early 1998, the TV advertising business was booming and the
networks were grumbling about all that free time they had kissed
goodbye. Alan Levitt, the ONDCP's official in charge of the
campaign, saw an opportunity and proposed that the office would
accept anti-drug themed prime-time programs in exchange for some of
those free spots.
</P>
<P>
   It was seen as a win-win situation, both for the ONDCP, which
benefited from having its messages couched inside some of TV's most
popular shows instead of during often-ignored commercial breaks,
and for the networks, which claimed back commercial spots at a time
when Internet companies had boosted demand.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly everyone agrees it's good citizenship to discourage
drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The problems, however, are myriad:
</P>
<P>
   -- The networks may have opened the floodgates for similar
programming- for-dollars arrangements with nonprofit groups,
government agencies, even ordinary advertisers like carmakers and
soda brands.
</P>
<P>
   -- For the most part the networks don't own the programs they
have been using for their own financial gain. Yet air time kicked
back to the networks was resold by the networks, which pocketed the
proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   -- Scripts and tapes of TV shows were shipped to Washington for
ONDCP approval -- and sometimes revisions -- often without the
knowledge of the series' writers and producers, let alone their
consent.
</P>
<P>
   -- TV viewers have been unknowingly subjected to what some
critics call propaganda during a show itself, not just during the
breaks when they expect it.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, for its part, says it did not profit from the arrangement
because it fulfilled its obligation to air all the free and paid
spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we did in fact provide tapes of some of our
programs after they aired, it was a moot issue because we had
over-delivered on our (public service announcement) commitment,''
said ABC spokeswoman Julie Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   However, ABC showed it was game to make the trade-off of program
content for commercial time and other considerations by sending in
tapes to the ONDCP.
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives say their deal with the government called for
half paid air time and half in equivalent ``media value,'' meaning
anything from public service announcements on air to adding those
``this is your brain...'' spots to home videocassettes. One
executive said Fox did not receive anything from the ONDCP it could
resell to any other company.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox all insisted they retained complete
artistic control over their programs.
</P>
<P>
   WB has acknowledged that a script for ``Smart Guy'' was altered
after it was submitted to the drug policy office based on the
government's input. Jamie Kellner, WB's top executive, told The New
York Times the network was just seeking the agency's ``expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   One veteran producer whose series was among those cited by
Salon.com was stunned by the news, adding he never was asked by his
boss or his network to alter an episode dealing with the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Francke, counsel for the California First Amendment
Coalition, called the idea of the government influencing program
messages ``insulting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly should raise hackles in viewers' minds,'' Francke
said. ``Are we going to see Homer Simpson stop on the way home from
the reactor to make sure he pays his taxes promptly on April 15?''
</P>
<P>
   The Salon.com story, the result of a six-month investigation by
Daniel Forbes, is sure to be the focus of the Television Critics'
Association gathering today in Pasadena. Donald Vereen, deputy
director of the ONDCP, is set to present the results of a new study
about the impact of television's portrayals of drug and alcohol
abuse on viewers.

ODDBALL SONICS AREN'T ALL THAT BAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A week or so ago, one of my Queen Anne dog-walking
friends asked a ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' question
regarding the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of Gary Payton and maybe Vin Baker, who are these
guys?'' was the basic gist.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Seahawks' faux playoff run had kept people in the dark
regarding the city's once superhyped NBA squad.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the league-wide, Post-Jordan, post-lockout identity
crisis was simply making it tough for otherwise good-intentioned
Seattle sports fans to get a handle on these Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they're alone.
</P>
<P>
   All across the country, NBA arenas are featuring plenty of empty
seats. Red ones. Orange ones. Green ones. Blue ones.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics have had just one sellout so far this season. That
was the first Laker game, which turned into an embarrassing blowout
with a crew that didn't yet include Kobe ``Air Part II'' Bryant,
who was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices are higher at KeyArena this season, thank you very
much, as they are elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   And in living rooms and dens across the nation, TV sets have
been tuning into fewer NBA games this season.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, news that Michael Jordan is joining the sinking
Wizards' ship has Beltway ballhogs salivating, they're so
desperate.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, an answer to the dog-walker's question included a list
of names that make up the Sonic roster: Horace Grant, Brent Barry,
Ruben Patterson, Greg Foster, Rashard Lewis, Vernon Maxwell,
Emanual Davis, Shammond Williams, Chuck Person, Jelani McCoy, Fred
Vinson, Vladimir Stepania and Lazaro Borrell.
</P>
<P>
   But the answer didn't clear things up much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, what's the identity of this team?'' the dog-walking
former Sonic enthusiast insisted. ``Who are they and where do they
think they're going?''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help matters much that the Sonics were mired in a
five-game losing streak at that particular time. The bad patch of
road was pocked with a few minor but notable outbursts, one by
Baker and another by Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Both were frustrated with their roles and both made no bones
about letting head coach Paul Westphal know it, to which Westphal
apparently assured both players that their fates were in their own
hands.
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, the Sonics' serious little skid had all the
earmarks of a team dangerously close to sliding into the proverbial
tank.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, exactly one year to the week since the end of the 1999
lockout, the Sonics are pleasantly discovering that this season,
time is on their side.
</P>
<P>
   The rolling nature of a bonafide 82-game season is giving the
Sonics time to make adjustments and get the most out of an almost
all-new roster still looking to figure out its identity.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, a hodgepodge team culled together in the frantic
free-agent aftermath of last year's 50-game nutball season, the
Sonics are now riding a three-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been a six-game winning streak, except that after
beating San Antonio for a nice upset and then the Rockets, the
Sonics were whiplashed again by the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully for them, though, the follow-up work has been
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Wins over Golden State (barely) the Suns and Nuggets had the
Sonics acting giddy and loose during practice Thursday _ even in
the face of Friday night's rematch against the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   For a team no one can quite get a handle on, including
themselves, the Sonics have to get some credit for continuing to
try and work it all out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think by the time the last month of the season comes around,
it's going to be like the playoffs,'' Baker said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be a lot of teams scrapping and fighting to
make it. That's why all these road wins we collect are going to add
up.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Sonics, the prediction amongst most local soothsayers,
including the Queen Anne dog walker, was 40 to 45 wins. Tops. And
if they made the playoffs, it would be as a No. 8 seed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a worst-case scenario shows that the Sonics could go 22-24
over the last 46 games and still fulfill everyone's meager
expectations, although there still could be a playoff dogfight
between everyone in the West who isn't the Lakers and the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after the Lakers, Blazers, Spurs, Heat, Jazz, Knicks
and Pacers, the Sonics are in a mid-tier bubble with the likes of
Sacramento, Charlotte, Minnesota, Phoenix and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   After that, there are still 16 other clubs, including 1999
playoff teams like the Sixers and Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Odd as it may seem, for a team that seems to lack a
distinguishable personality, the Sonics are still wondrously ahead
of two-thirds of the rest of the league.
</P>
<P>
   We're not sure exactly what that says about the post-lockout,
post-Jordan NBA. Maybe it will wind up meaning that the Sonics are
one of the best dozen or so teams in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Or, perhaps as likely, it will reveal that other than the
Blazers, Lakers, Spurs and Heat, the NBA is just totally whacked.

   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Argun) _ The Russian military insists it has
taken back this Chechen town. But Russian soldiers nervously
scanned the rooftops and windows of Argun's battered buildings as
they sought to keep order. Set in the Chechen lowlands, Argun was
taken by the Russian military in early December. Today, however, it
has become a salient example of how hard it may be for Russia to
take Chechnya and keep it. All across Chechnya, Russian troops
tried to tighten their grip over the swath of territory
``liberated'' by Russian forces. By Michael R. Gordon.

   SAHARA-VILLAGE (Araouane, Mali) _ The sand woman came out of the
blackness of the village master's house into the desert light,
bearing a bowl of sand her hands had scooped from the doorway and
would deposit several feet away. It is a lifetime's work, this
struggle against the sand, for Souda Cissey and Araouane's other
sand women, a daily contest to prevent the Sahara from burying,
once and for all, this ancient village in West Africa. The world's
largest desert has already taken away a mosque and countless houses
in recent years, the rooftops of some still visible on the sand's
surface, others fallen into the Sahara's bottomless pits. By

the effort say. Exclusive. By James Glanz.

<P>
   TV-DRUGS-SCRIPTS (Undated) _ The White House drug office has
secretly been pushing TV networks for scripts with anti-drug

financial incentives to networks to make sure the scripts were on
message. By Marc Lacey and Bill Carter.

   IOWA-OUTLOOK (Perry, Iowa) _ Over the years, the Iowa caucuses

unmade others (like Edward M. Kennedy). But this time, they have
seemed like a sideshow, and a poorly attended one at that, to the
main event in New Hampshire. That may be changing. With only 10
days left until Feb. 24, when tens of thousands of Iowans will
assemble in living rooms, clubs and school halls to declare their
preferences, two well-funded, well-organized underdogs, Bill
Bradley and Steve Forbes, have accelerated their efforts. If not to
defeat their respective rivals, Al Gore and George W. Bush, they

   UTILITIES-NORRIS-COLUMN (Undated) _ It has long been taken for

After all, electric companies borrow a lot of money, and thus
suffer when rates rise, and their shares appeal only to the
diminishing band of investors who value dividends. So it is worth

what's under discussion here. For an authentic period room you have
to leave your own fledgling interior and visit a major museum; in
New York this means going to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the
Brooklyn Museum of Art. With roughly 80 period rooms between them,
they represent the greatest concentration to be found in any
American city. By Roberta Smith.

   NEW-YORK-LIGHT (New York) _ Two years ago, Joe, the man I lived
with, suggested that we outfit our apartment with a light
especially created to combat the winter blues. Seasonal affective
disorder is its quaint moniker. I vetoed the proposal. What I
wanted was not to sit under 10,000 lux of white light to trick my
brain into believing it was spring. I wanted us to soak up the real
stuff, the unadorned light of the New York Harbor at sunset, say,
or the slow illumination of the city on a Sunday morning. Joe isn't
here anymore. He went hiking up a mountain one day last summer. It
is believed that he slipped and fell in the woods. Bloodhounds and
rescue teams were sent for him. But the forest is so dark and
dense, his body is yet to be found. This winter, with unusual
deliberation, I have taken to soaking up the light alone, or mostly
alone. I troll for outings that promise birds and sunsets on
Jamaica Bay in Queens. I bundle up for lunchtime sprints around
Bryant Park in Manhattan to watch how the windows of the library
spit out the sun's reflection. Unwittingly I have turned into a
student of light. The August light that envelopes the beaten-down
old streets of Red Hook, I have learned, is more melancholy than
the morning light during lilac season in the Brooklyn Botanic
Garden. The sun sparkling on the crown of the Chrysler building is
whimsical, like a woman dressed for a party at high noon. By Somini
Sengupta.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
With any legend, it is difficult to separate fact from fiction, but
in the state of Tennessee, some insist that Peyton Manning is more
popular than Davy Crockett and more influential than Al Gore.
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it weren't for Elvis, Manning would be king of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Manning is an icon in the eastern part of the state because of
his football heroics at the University of Tennessee. There is a
street named after him in Knoxville, where he is more revered than
Johnny Majors and Doug Dickey.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's loyalties are divided this week because the Titans,
who have become the hottest thing in Nashville, are playing
Manning's Indianapolis Colts in a second-round playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's an interesting story for the fans and media,
but nobody on the Titans cares where I went to college, and nobody
on the Colts does, either,'' Manning said Thursday. ``I really
don't have much to add to that whole scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to my first playoff game, and I am glad
the game's at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Manning/Tennessee story line would be more intriguing if the
game were being played at Adelphia Coliseum, site of the Music City
Miracle, where the Titans sold out every game and posted a 9-0
record, including their wild-card victory over Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his friends in Tennessee became Titans fans this
season, Manning said, ``Oh, sure. People in Tennessee have really
adopted the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, you've seen how many teams struggled at their home
field because of the crowd noise. The crowd really got into it. So
a lot of my friends have become major Titans fans. That's a good
thing. That's the way it's supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing at home, and I'm certainly glad about that. We
need the advantage of playing in front of our home crowd. You saw
the Tennessee-Buffalo game. Tennessee's crowd was definitely an
advantage for them and gave Buffalo problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an NFL playoff game, and I can't worry about all the
other scenarios and stories dealing with the game. All I can do is
to try to help my team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine: Peyton Manning a villain in his adopted state. It
could never happen, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Manning is beloved in Tennessee for several reasons. First, he
left Louisiana, his home state, for a rival. Second, he didn't
attend Mississippi, the alma mater of his famous father, Archie
Manning, despite tremendous pressure to do so from people outside
his family. Third, even though he earned his degree in three years,
he passed up the NFL as an underclassman to return for his senior
year. And, finally, Manning is popular because he is a genuine
first-class guy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, when the Titans were still the Oilers, they got an idea
of just how popular Manning was in Tennessee. In his rookie season,
there was a major controversy when the CBS affiliate in Knoxville
elected to show Colts games over Oilers games when there was a
conflict. That policy still exists, but there were fewer conflicts
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessean, Nashville's newspaper of record, conducted a
survey to find out if it is true that fans around the state,
especially in the eastern part, are pulling for Manning. The
results of the survey showed that fans want the Titans to win, but
they hope Manning will play well and stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something I really can't get into,'' Manning said.
``I'm sure the people in Tennessee are going to cheer for the
Titans because that's their team and that's the way they should do
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm focusing on is just this game. I know it's boring. I'd
like to help you with your story, but I don't have much to add to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But others do. Take Titans tight end Frank Wycheck, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great story for the media, isn't it?'' Wycheck said.
``You guys can write about Peyton all week. That'll sure be a
change for us.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has to tell the Titans how respected Manning is in their
state or how good he is in any state in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great quarterback who's done an outstanding job in only
his second season,'' Titans offensive tackle Brad Hopkins said.
``You won't see many second-year quarterbacks play like Manning
does. It's like he's a 10-year veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can make every throw. He's hard to sack because he knows
when to get rid of the ball. He utilizes all of his weapons. We
know we've got our work cut out.''
</P>
<P>
   And the feeling is mutual. In truth, Sunday afternoon at the RCA
Dome in Indianapolis, the state of Tennessee won't be on Manning's
mind. He couldn't care less about who is rooting for him and who
isn't. He will enter the game with one goal _ to win.
</P>
<P>
   And to win, the Colts know they have to protect Manning from the
fierce Titans pass rush that has produced 60 sacks in 17 games,
including 16{ by defensive end Jevon Kearse, the NFL Defensive
Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a very active front seven,'' Manning said. ``They
rush the passer well. They're good against the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage, there's not much you can change. We're going to
try to run our offense. The Titans have won a lot of big games.
They've seen a lot of things. We have to execute very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Titans, the Colts have a lot of young players. This is
the first playoff experience for many of the Colts, and there could
be some nervousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably some truth to that,'' Manning said. ``I mean,
for a lot of us, this is the first playoff game we're in, and the
first playoff game at home for everybody here with the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of been this way all season. We don't know any
better than to treat every game as if it's the most important game.
That's why we've played well the majority of the season. A playoff
game's certainly different. It's going to be more intense. It's
going to be faster. Hopefully, we can rise to the occasion.''

KINGS POWERLESS TO STOP BLUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Kings know they can play with the better teams
in the National Hockey League. Now they have to find a way to win.
</P>
<P>
   After getting riddled with penalties two nights earlier, the
Kings again were beaten by the power play Thursday night, this time
on a third-period goal by Scott Young that gave the St. Louis Blues
a 3-2 victory in front of 16,278 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The key call was a questionable hit by Kings defenseman Sean
O'Donnell on Scott Pellerin that set up the man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   With 6:35 gone in the final period, Blues defenseman Al MacInnis
fired from the blue line and Thomas redirected the puck past Kings
goaltender Stephan Fiset for the winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   Hot teams get those calls and the Blues certainly are that,
unbeaten in their past eight games. The loss was the Kings' second
straight and ninth in the past 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Also lost in the loss were two goals by Bryan Smolinski, who
leads the team with 38 points. Smolinski scored the game's first
goal less than four minutes in, then tied it at 2-2 with 29 seconds
left in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were coming off a sloppy 4-3 loss to Ottawa and facing
probably the hottest team in the league in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues were undefeated in their past seven (5-0-2) and had at
least four goals in each of those victories.
</P>
<P>
   They embarrassed San Jose last Tuesday without their top player,
Pierre Turgeon, who returned for the Kings game.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with the Blues right now is they play in the
Central Division, which has been dominated by Detroit the past few
years. St. Louis entered Thursday's game with 58 points, just one
behind the Red Wings. But with division winners getting the first
three seeds, that puts the Blues fourth in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   For the Kings, who questioned team discipline in a meeting
Tuesday with coach Andy Murray and the team captains, Thursday
could have been a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Ottawa game, where they were undone by penalties
and poor performances by Fiset and defenseman Aki Berg, the Kings
were sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset was back in net for the ninth consecutive game. Jamie
Storr, sidelined since mid-December with a concussion, will play
tonight for the minor league Long Beach Ice Dogs and hopes to be
ready for the Kings game Saturday night in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Berg, who played a role in three of the four Ottawa goals, was
scratched Thursday, a move that drew cheers from the crowd. His
replacement, Garry Galley, returned from injured reserve after
missing a month with a concussion and assisted on Smolinski's
second goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings took a 1-0 lead just 3:36 into the game. At first, it
appeared to come on a goal by Glen Murray, who took a pass from Luc
Robitaille in the slot and fired a slap shot that sailed past the
left shoulder of McLennan.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been just the second goal in 13 games for Murray,
who had a scoreless string of 10. But after the first period, the
goal was credited to Smolinski, who redirected Murray's blast for
his goal of the night.
</P>
<P>
   While things got better for Smolinski, they got worse for
Murray. Just minutes after his apparent goal, he was knocked into
the board by the Blues' Tyson Nash. Murray suffered a bruised chest
muscle and did not return.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings controlled the action until the end of the period when
the Blues scored twice in the final 2:37.
</P>
<P>
   The first goal came when Jamal Mayers beat Sean O'Donnell to the
puck at the Kings' blue line and blew in on Fiset for his third
goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   With just 1:11 left in the period, St. Louis took the lead.
Pavol Demitra fired a slap shot from the Kings' blue line that was
well wide of Fiset. But Lubos Baretcko redirected the shot past
Fiset for his 10th goal.

   MALIBU, Calif., -- Nuptials at The Streisand Center for
Conservancy Studies in Malibu just won't have the same celebrity
ring anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, couples will be tying the knot in Ramirez Canyon Park.
</P>
<P>
   Chagrined at plans to sharply increase use of the area, Barbra
Streisand, in a letter delivered to the California Coastal
Commission on Thursday, said she no longer wants her famous name
linked to the $15 million rustic estate she donated to the Santa
Monica Mountains Conservancy in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The commission hearing was the first public outcry from the
singer and actress about the conservancy's plans to open the 22
acres to visitors with reservations free of charge and to expand
use of the facilities concerns that put her squarely on the side of
Malibu residents fighting the conservancy.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand intended the estate to be used ``to create a small
conference center for scientists, academics and
environmentalists.''
</P>
<P>
   After initially trying such a venture, the conservancy turned to
renting out the estate, with its meadows and gardens, for
high-priced weddings, bar mitzvahs, conferences and garden tours.
It now is proposing more public access, while continuing the
private galas at whatever frequency the environmentally-sensitive
setting can withstand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not in agreement with the proposed use of the land, my
name will no longer be affiliated with the property, and I ask you
to give every consideration to the concerns of my neighbors and the
community,'' Streisand wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A Streisand spokesman said the star ``is making a substantial
expression of sympathy with her former neighbors' situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservancy executive director Joseph Edmiston called the
removal of the Streisand name a ``de minimus concern.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Streisand's gift was generous and appreciated, but that
it's now a ``good place to part the way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably a good thing,'' Edmiston said. ``It (the
ecological study center) was a good idea and it's too bad it didn't
work out. Now we're looking at a park use vs. the more rarefied
academic use, which fits more of our profile.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmiston said weddings and other functions did not violate
Streisand's memorandum of understanding, because it included a
clause stating the estate could be used for all legitimate
conservancy purposes. Streisand said she intended it be used
strictly for scientific purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand had no interest in having the park named after her,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Edmiston said the conservancy has done its utmost to be a good
neighbor, and suggested Streisand wanted to make a good impression
both on the neighbors and city officials, who are considering her
permit to build a 6,700-square-foot home at Malibu's Point Dume. On
Monday, she requested a delay in the city process, saying she
wanted more time to address neighbors' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only connection between the two is her concern for her
neighbors,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission delayed until April a decision on the
conservancy's permit application, citing lingering concerns over
traffic, fire hazards and the center's fragile septic system.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Sheps, a community resident and attorney, said residents
were disappointed the commission did not immediately stop the
center's activities, but that they were pleased commission members
were taking more time to address their concerns, and might impose
stricter use limits.
</P>
<P>
   Sheps said neighbors want a limit placed on the number of cars
or vans on the narrow road to the estate, perhaps with a security
guard to ensure enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission encouraged us to seek a settlement,'' Sheps
said. ``I could see that if the conservancy would limit the traffic
in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmiston said the conservancy is willing to discuss the matter,
but wants the city of Malibu also at the table, because it is suing
the center over alleged violation of local zoning laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a comprehensive agreement it could be a good thing,''
he said. ``But, what I've heard is they want the Coastal Commission
and the Superior Court to take a cut at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmiston said the conservancy is addressing all the issues
raised under the permit application, including traffic concerns, a
fire evacuation plan, the engineering adequacy of a crucial wooden
bridge and the fragile septic system.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the whole, we're very, very positive,'' Edmiston said.

NORTHRIDGE UPSET BY PORTLAND STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ This is how it's going to be now. Off to the
best Division I start in school history, the Cal State Northridge
men's basketball players are going to just have to get used to
being a favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The price of success? CSUN can't play meekly for any stretch on
the road against a Big Sky Conference opponent. It happened against
Portland State on Thursday night, and the Matadors were buried
76-62 in front of 1,283 at Stott Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out knowing we were the best team in the conference,''
CSUN junior guard Carl Holmes said, a hint of sarcasm in his voice.
``We came out a little bit overconfident. We came out sluggish.
(Portland State) just put it on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Northridge hardly fought back, falling behind by at least 10
points through much of the game. CSUN (10-4, 2-1) had its five-game
winning streak snapped and dropped out of a first-place tie with
Weber State; Eastern Washington, the Matadors' opponent Saturday
night in Cheney, leads the Big Sky at 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The host Vikings (9-5, 1-1), who outrebounded Northridge 45-31,
got 21 points from Derek Nesland, who missed all 12 of his shots
last week in a loss at Weber State.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statistics are very, very telling,'' CSUN coach Bobby
Braswell said. ``Portland State was a desperate basketball team.
(The Vikings) knew they needed to win. They were better than us at
every position.''
</P>
<P>
   The first half was a nightmare for CSUN, a complete opposite of
its spectacular performance six days ago at Idaho State, where the
Matadors cruised to a 101-86 win. Portland led 27-12 at the
8{-minute mark.
</P>
<P>
   Every CSUN possession against PSU was awkward. Worse, the
aggressiveness that makes the Matadors one of the most-potent
offenses in the conference was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out not as focused as we should have been,'' said CSUN
sophomore point guard Markus Carr, the Big Sky's top playmaker
whose two assists were a season low. ``We got beat down... You
don't know why, you can't explain it, but one night you're great
and the next night you're not so great.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so great was the perfect description. Brian Heinle, CSUN's
leading scorer, had a season-worst 3 points, and he took only two
shots, another low. Heinle, a junior center from Eugene playing in
front of his family, capped a disappointing effort with a technical
foul with 9 minutes, 57 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Heinle's gaffe led to three free throws by PSU and the Vikings
suddenly had a 19-point lead, 64-45. Just as quickly, the
Northridge players sprung to life, darting around the court and
causing a few turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Parris' 3-point play with 5:08 left made it 65-57, and the
thought was creeping into the Matadors' minds: They might steal
this game. Then, Portland's Anthony Lackey made a 3-pointer _ the
Vikings' first field goal in 11 minutes _ and the rest of the game
played out like the first half; CSUN took bad shots, hoped for
fouls and continued to scramble.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out and pushed us around,'' said Holmes, who had 11
points in 31 minutes. ``This is an embarrassing loss for our
program. It's not the end of the season, but this loss hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   After the team met for almost 20 minutes in the locker room
after the game, Braswell emerged only to say about the same thing.
He knows the Matadors were tested Thursday in the role of a Big Sky
favorite. Their grade was below-average.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a step behind in everything we did,'' he said. ``I
told them, `You've got a target on your back and on your chest,
everywhere you go.'''

   LOS ANGELES, Calif., -- In a deal that could generate $100
million in revenue over the next four years, free Internet service
provider NetZero Inc. has formed a marketing partnership with
General Motors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for General Motors to be the exclusive
automotive sponsor of NetZero's Internet portal. In a few weeks,
NetZero will place a ``speed dial'' button on the ZeroPort that
takes users directly to the GM Buypower Web site.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, which has a similar arrangement with the
nation's largest Internet service provider, America Online, will
distribute NetZero connection software in its dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   And the giant automaker will receive a gold mine of data in
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited. What's really unique is that the GM
agreement takes advantage of every revenue product that NetZero
offers,'' said Mark Goldston, NetZero's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   NetZero, based in suburban Los Angeles' Westlake Village, will
revise its membership survey to include questions on customers' car
buying habits and other automotive preferences.
</P>
<P>
   NetZero subscribers fill out the survey when they first connect
to the service and again at regular intervals throughout their
membership.
</P>
<P>
   David Cooperstein, an analyst with Forrester Research who
follows General Motors' Internet initiatives, said the automaker
has been working hard to establish itself as a player in the online
world.
</P>
<P>
   The deal gives newcomer NetZero the credibility of an industrial
institution such as General Motors, Cooperstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For GM, it's a way of generating interest in the GM brand for
the Internet users or communicating with their existing
customers,'' he said. ``Clearly, I think this will be the year that
a lot of traditional brand advertisers wake up to the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal also benefits both parties because it goes well beyond
banner advertising and ventures into the sharing of customer
information, Cooperstein said.
</P>
<P>
   While General Motors' deal with America Online benefits General
Motors in giving it a large Internet presence, the NetZero
partnership gives the automaker a presence and access to valuable
customer information, Cooperstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advertising angle is only half the story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, General Motors will receive a warrant to purchase
575,000 shares of NetZero stock at $28.71 per share, a total
investment of $16.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant is effective through the four-year life of the deal,
Goldston said.
</P>
<P>
   It allows General Motors a chance to take equity in a growing
company, said Mark Hogan, president of e-GM, the Internet division
of General Motors, which was formed in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that NetZero has some growth opportunity,'' Hogan
said. ``Perhaps GM can participate in that growth in some way, and
that's the reason behind this.''

BRITISH FIRM BUYS VALLEY COMPANY

<TEXT>
<P>
   TARZANA Family-owned Terry Industries, a lumber company that
helped supply the San Fernando Valley's post-World War II building
boom, has been sold to a North Carolina company, officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal, which closed Jan. 7, were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a well-managed, well-run and profitable company,''
said Bryce Smith, spokesman Carolina Holdings Inc. of Raleigh,
N.C., a wholly owned subsidiary of Wolseley PLC, based in
Droitwich, England. ``We like companies like Terry Industries.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tarzana-based building materials company operates 14 Terry
Lumber Co. yards from Burbank to Bakersfield. The company also
operates three hanging door facilities, a lumber distribution
center and one mill-work plant.
</P>
<P>
   Company founder Terry Mullin, 78, said the decision to sell was
made before his son Tom died in July. The sale is ``in the best
interest of the family, the company and its employees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to be sold while I'm still active,'' added Mullin.
``I didn't want it sold by a bunch of bankers who don't understand
the lumber business. We are very happy with Carolina Holdings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mullin family invested $6,000 to open its first lumberyard
in Tarzana in December 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a good 50 years,'' Mullin said. ``I love the lumber
business, our customers and suppliers.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the company's name will remain the same. Lonnie
Schield will also remain company president, and none of the 735
employees is expected to be laid off at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin doesn't plan many changes, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will remain active in the business to the extent they would
like me to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With sales of about $250 million last year, Terry Industries is
one of the top suppliers of building materials to the contractor
trade in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``They service builders and contractors, which is the focus of
our business,'' Smith said. ''All their manufacturing, including
their mill-work plant, supports that business.''
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Sayas, owner of Woodland Hills-based Lifetime Construction
Co., said he has shopped at Terry Lumber Co. for 10 years and would
continue to buy his doors and windows for his clients at any of its
locations.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Holdings last month purchased Columbia Lumber Co. of
Columbia, S.C, and McGinnes Lumber Supply in Plant City, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   With its recent acquisitions, Carolina Holdings now operates
more than 150 locations in 15 states and is one of the largest
suppliers of lumber and building materials in the nation. The
company reported sales of $1.7 billion for the fiscal year that
ended July 31.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
LOS ANGELES _ Maybe we shouldn't be surprised.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe the Lakers would be coasting along, owners of a 31-5
record and a 16-game winning streak, no matter who was coaching.
And maybe anyone could have gotten Shaquille O'Neal to make offense
secondary, instead having the colorful colossus focus on defense
and rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   But not many coaches could have O'Neal saying things like: ``I'm
like the Pythagorean theorem. Not a lot of people can figure out
the Pythagorean theorem ,'' or, ``He leads; we follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many at all.
</P>
<P>
   Only one comes to mind _ Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where you gauge Jackson's impact on the Lakers.
Forget the numbers they put up, the outrageous win totals and the
unending string of highlight-quality plays.
</P>
<P>
   No, these Lakers are not only playing the game, they're thinking
it as well, and that's where Jackson has made the biggest
difference.
</P>
<P>
   With players such as O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Glen Rice, the
Lakers always had been able to rise to a physical challenge. But a
mental challenge was something else. Enter Jackson, the third man
in less than a year to coach the Lakers, following Del Harris and
Kurt Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared of the Lakers,'' said Portland's Damon Stoudamire.
``They're a load. Phil Jackson has been coaching there for only two
months, and they're playing the way they're playing. That man
doesn't even get off the bench anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say he will be there awhile. The Lakers have found
their man.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was the Lakers always figured they needed a coach
who was essentially young at heart. That's what led them to Harris,
who might have looked like a fuddy-duddy college professor but who
lived the life of a much younger man, getting his first tattoo at
age 60 and listening to rap.
</P>
<P>
   But after a series of crash-and-burn performances in the
playoffs, including last year's wipeout at the hands of the San
Antonio Spurs, the Lakers realized they had it wrong all along.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't require a coach who was young at heart. What they
needed was someone who was Jung at heart _ someone who had a grasp
of basketball and who had a helpful dose of Jungian psychology.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they needed Jackson, one of the few coaches who has
gotten maximum production (with a minimum of distractions) from
Dennis Rodman, no small reason the Bulls were able to win their
last three titles.
</P>
<P>
   And if Jackson could get Rodman to devote himself to team play,
then the Lakers would be a cakewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest _ I felt that after nine years of doing it with
the Bulls I felt like I had had enough,'' Jackson said. ``But after
being away a year, I felt like it would be fun to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has his biggest ally _ literally and figuratively _ in
O'Neal, who dropped in on his new coach before the season started.
O'Neal, in Montana to give a rap concert, figured the least he
could do was surprise Jackson with a visit to his log cabin in
Kalispell.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal wanted to feel out his new coach, so he spent the day
doing things like bouncing on the trampoline with Jackson's
children. He then went to karaoke night with Jackson's wife, June,
and sang _ if you can call it that _ I Believe I Can Fly into the
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   But all O'Neal remembered was what he first saw in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you walk through the front door, you see those big
gold balls _ all six of 'em,'' he said, referring to replicas of
the championship trophies Jackson won with the Chicago Bulls. ``The
sun was hitting them. They were sparkling.''
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to get O'Neal. And when you have the big fella,
you have the team. O'Neal respects the air of discipline Jackson
brings to the team, reminding him of his father, Phillip Harrison,
a military man who had no qualms about raising his voice while
raising his stepson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil is a straightforward kind of guy,'' O'Neal said. ``He's
also the type of guy that when you don't do what you're told to do,
you have to hear him a lot. And even though I enjoy being yelled
at, I really don't like being yelled at all the time. And me, being
a kid, you do what your father tells you to do and then you don't
have to hear him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one of these bratty superstars you can't talk to. I
grew up like that, and that's what's made me successful. And the
key to success is that you have to stick to what made you
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jackson has been successful.
</P>
<P>
   Where other coaches tried a more laid-back approach, hoping to
ingratiate themselves with the young superstars, Jackson backs his
basketball philosophy with a stern hand. And that hand does not
have enough fingers for all his championship rings _ six as a coach
and one as a player with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning is something that instills confidence in players, and
you believe in yourself that you can overcome certain odds,''
Jackson said. ``I think that's part of it. I think that's part of
winning. I think it's an attitude and it's a way you go about your
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is the way Jackson goes about his business. As a young
man, Jackson was the ultimate loner, but he finds his greatest
pleasure in perfect team play.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson learned the beauty of that selfless teamwork during his
playing days with the Knicks. In New York's beautifully
choreographed system, where the balletic moves of teammates Walt
Frazier and Earl Monroe were featured, Jackson stood out, more a
collection of involuntary twitches and tics, with elbows and knees
flying every which way.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in his mid-50s, Jackson's mind seems to fly in every
direction, with interests as far-reaching as O'Neal's wingspan _
philosophy, politics, comparative religions, Native Americana, pop
culture, travel and so on.
</P>
<P>
   So why does Jackson devote that mind to basketball rather than
applying his intellect to the many social issues for which he
crusades?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a forum,'' said Jackson after a pause as he searched for
the right words. ``It ends up being a really good forum for a
number of reasons that appeal to me. I just think it's part of the
fact that we come from such diverse backgrounds to get to this
position in basketball. We've got a smattering of kids from here
and there _ from Europe, from Africa, from Australia _ from all
over the world to play in this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we've got kids in this country who come from the poorest
situations to some of the wealthiest situations, so the
socio-economic background and status is so different. And to find
the common thread and to really kind of work on that
American-dream-type stuff is always interesting to me. To find
players who have very little education and players who are
educated, they all have a certain way of communicating.
</P>
<P>
   ``And finding a way to communicate is kind of my goal because
this is what I do as a coach is try to meld them together and have
them work in an atmosphere that is good like this. Yet when it's
over, what you have to have is yourself and you still have to be in
control of your person and not so enmeshed in the team or in this
business that it is all you have. I think that balance is
important.''
</P>
<P>
   And balance is what the Lakers are all about.
</P>
<P>
   In O'Neal, Bryant and Rice, they have three All-Star-caliber
players capable of scoring 40-plus points on any given night. But
in Jackson's triangle offense, the three have been content to share
the ball _ and the spotlight _ as they pursue the ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a really good chance (of winning the
championship),'' O'Neal said. ``We'd always win our 50 or 60 games,
but then we'd always get beat in the playoffs. I think Phil (knew
the Lakers) needed somebody to take us over the hump.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think this is the staff that's going to take us over
that hump. Everybody believes in it, and we all believe in each
other. I think that by February or March we should be able to tell
whether we have a great shot at it or not.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't a victory. There weren't even any goals scored. But
Thursday night's 0-0 tie with the Buffalo Sa- bres at the
FleetCenter was a tri- umph of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have gotten back to playing their system, one of
sound defense. They've gotten back to L playing the way they have
to if they want to win. It wasn't a win, no, but it was a step in
the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Even more encouraging, it was Byron Dafoe's 19th career shutout
(23 saves) in a performance that re- sembled those of the Dafoe of
last season. It was the third shutout for young Buffalo netminder
Martin L Biron, who made 39 stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave up no goals. That's a step in the right direction,''
said for- ward Steve Heinze, who turned in arguably his best
performance of the year. ``It's defense first around here. You're
not going to lose any games like that. We shut them down and didn't
give them a lot of chances and had a ton of chances ourselves. The
good part is we did have a ton of chances. Unfortunately, none of L
them went in.''
</P>
<P>
   The first 40 minutes consisted of some good news and some bad
news. The good news was that it was a typical Sabres-Bruins game.
But L that also was the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins outshot the Sabres, 8-6, in a first period that
featured three Boston power plays.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, Dafoe didn't have as much action but was
called upon to make some tough stops. At 16:47, defenseman Alexei
Zhitnik L barreled down to the right circle with P.J. Axelsson
crosschecking L him from behind, but Zhitnik got off a backhander
that Dafoe turned L back by stacking his pads.
</P>
<P>
   With 1:16 left, Dafoe stopped Curtis Brown from in close.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second period, Joe Murphy, who played his best game
in a Bruins uniform, had a terrific bid from the left circle (one
of his four shots in the period), when he took a pass from Kyle
McLaren and attempted to beat Biron from the in- side edge of the
circle. He failed but the heat the Bruins were applying caused
Sabres coach Lindy Ruff to call a timeout at 4:39 to regroup.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins outshot the Sabres, 18-4, in the second but the
Sabres had good chances. Perhaps the best came at 11:05, when
Miroslav Satan tested Dafoe with a backhander.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Bruins were L sound, just as they were Tuesday
night against Toronto. There was lit- tle running around and little
chaos, helped by good faceoff performances by Anson Carter and
Marquis Math-H ieu. Brandon Smith, who was a last- minute call-up
for Don Sweeney L (flu), filled in admirably.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the absence of so many regular players, the club was
forced to simplify the game plan and that seemed to work to the
Bruins' advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we played a perfect game,'' said Dafoe. ``And if you
insert a couple of guys on the offensive zone, maybe we score a
couple of goals. Obviously we miss (Jason Alli- son, Dave
Andreychuk, and Sergei Samsonov). Those are three guys who know how
to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys played very well who were called up and it almost
simpli- fied the game for us. They did the system perfectly. Where
we came up short was not getting the puck in the net. You can't
really pin that on them because it's not their forte. In our own
end, it felt back to normal for me. It simplified it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins very nearly scored at 1:42 of the third when Heinze,
who had broken an 18-game point/goal drought Tuesday night, rattled
a shot off the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   Another good opportunity came with the Bruins on their sixth
power play of the game. Ray Bourque fired a wrist shot from the
left point with Rob DiMaio in front, hoping for a re- bound. But
Biron saw it all the way and gloved it at 9:13.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres put some pressure on the Bruins, too, but Dafoe held
the fort.
</P>
<P>
   With 1:57 left in regulation, L Heinze came close again. Murphy
tried centering a pass that went off Biron's stick to Heinze. The
puck hit Heinze's stick and then he tried to bunt it past Biron,
but the goalie snared it with his glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit it off my stick and I missed it out of the air,'' said
Heinze. ``It was on its way in, it was end over end and going to
end up in the net, but he caught it.''
</P>
<P>
   Biron came up big again when he stoned Carter on a shot from the
right circle with 10 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to very positive about what we saw,'' said coach Pat
Burns. ``I see a lot of positive things.''

CELTICS TRIP AND FALL AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Most of the 14,659 spectators at the Target Center
proved they could recognize a blowout Thursday night. They began
leaving en masse in the fourth quarter, but they must have gone
with warm feelings into the cold Minnesota night as the
Timberwolves took a 103-85 win over the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   This was a discouraging defeat for the Celtics, as the
Timberwolves patiently dissected their half-court defense and had
little difficulty solving the full-court press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minnesota just outplayed us in every phase of the game,''
Celtics coach Rick Pitino said. ``They shot a high percentage and
we shot a low percentage. And they played good defense. Hopefully,
we will play better against New Jersey (Saturday).''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics fell out of contention early as their low-post
offense disappeared with the departure of Vitaly Potapenko after he
committed his second personal foul late in the first half. The
Celtic offense appeared disjointed, with no effective focal point
until Danny Fortson injected some power and spirit on the baseline
long after the outcome had been decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play better defense,'' guard Kenny Anderson said.
``Our rotation was terrible. We've got offensive players, that's
not the problem. The problem is stopping people from figuring out
our defensive game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ran their offense well and we broke down. It's been like
that the whole season. And we're going to have to do better if we
want to make the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics didn't look like a playoff team. They have won only
twice on the road this season, and should not have been expected to
overcome an efficient Minnesota attack. But the Celtics could not
even make things difficult for the Timberwolves, falling out of
contention during a third-quarter drought.
</P>
<P>
   Potapenko cut the deficit to 53-46 1:17 into the second half.
But the Celtics would score only once more from the field in the
next 9:57. And the Timberwolves would take command with a 17-3 run.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino called three timeouts in less than three minutes, but
failed to affect the Minnesota momentum. The Celtics'
ineffectiveness was apparent on their first possession after the
third timeout, as they failed to take a shot within the 24-second
time limit. Antoine Walker launched an airball 3-pointer on their
next possession, and Sam Mitchell countered with a 3-pointer with
one second remaining on the shot clock for a 70-49 Timberwolves
lead with 5:17 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the basket and thought we got fouled and didn't
make the basket,'' Pitino said. ``And we didn't get back in
transition. It was one of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's patience was illustrated by four possessions that
concluded with successful, unguarded shots with less than four
seconds remaining on the shot clock.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's drive stretched the advantage to 80-56 with 1:13
left. The Celtics retaliated with an Eric Williams foul shot and
Dana Barros 3-pointer in the final minute. But Mitchell was fouled
by Barros with less than two seconds left in the half, and he
converted three foul shots for an 83-60 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Walter McCarty limited Minnesota's Kevin Garnett in the first
half. But Garnett remained poised _ except for a couple of
outbursts directed at official Ron Olesiak _ and sparked Minnesota
in the second half. And Terrell Brandon controlled the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Walker scored four seconds into the game but struggled in the
first half and launched two long-range airballs in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to find a way to win on the road if we want to be a
playoff team,'' Walker said. ``The whistle was more generous on
their end than it was on our end, but we missed some easy shots,
and that's just the nature of the game. We've got to find ways to
get to the foul line if we expect to win on the road.''

KINGS POWERLESS TO STOP BLUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Kings know they can play with the better teams
in the National Hockey League. They just can't beat them.
</P>
<P>
   Take the St. Louis Blues, who have the league's best record
after a 3-2 victory over the Kings on Thursday night in front of
16,278 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   They have a tie and a one-goal win in the past 10 days against
the Kings. They were limited to just three shots in the first
period, but scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have outshot opponents in 11 of the past 12 games. The
problem is they are 2-9-1 during that stretch. If San Jose, which
plays the Kings on Saturday and the Mighty Ducks weren't also
struggling, the home team would be in big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the good stuff really means anything when you need
victories,'' said Bryan Smolinski, who scored the Kings' two goals.
``Playing better doesn't matter when we have a chance to do some
things. We played better tonight, but it's not something you feel
good about.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting riddled with penalties two nights earlier, the
Kings again were beaten by the power play, this time on a
third-period goal by Scott Young.
</P>
<P>
   Sean O'Donnell received a questionable interference call on
Scott Pellerin that set up the man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   With 13:25 remaining, Blues defenseman Al MacInnis fired from
the blue line and Young redirected the puck past Kings goaltender
Stephan Fiset for the winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   Hot teams get those calls and the Blues certainly are that,
unbeaten in their past eight games
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Andy Murray, who has scheduled a team meeting for
today, isn't critical of the team's effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were coming off a sloppy 4-3 loss to Ottawa and facing
the hottest team in the league in St. Louis. Holding the
high-scoring Blues to just 16 shots was admirable. Smolinski's
game-tying goal with 29 seconds left in the second period against
Roman Turek seemed to bring momentum.
</P>
<P>
   But that was it. They might catch a break against stumbling San
Jose, but the Kings now are saying injured center Jozef Stumpel
will be out two to three more weeks with a knee injury. The Kings
also lost Glen Murray in the first period after he got crunched
against the boards, but he is expected back Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this streak of misery we're on right now, we are trying to
grind up some offense,'' Andy Murray said. ``We wanted to play real
solid in the third period. St. Louis is on a roll right now and
things are happening for them, that happen when you are playing
well. We have to earn our breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with the Blues right now is they play in the
Central Division, which has been dominated by Detroit the past few
years. St. Louis entered Thursday's game with 58 points, just one
behind the Red Wings. But with division winners getting the first
three seeds in the playoffs, a loss to the Kings would have put the
Blues fourth in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (18-17-7) are still seventh in the West, but only
because the Mighty Ducks are in a free fall.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Ottawa game, where they were undone by penalties
and poor performances by Fiset and defenseman Aki Berg, the Kings
were sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset was back in net for the ninth consecutive game. Jamie
Storr, sidelined since mid-December with a concussion, will play
Friday night for the minor-league Long Beach Ice Dogs and hopes to
be ready for the Kings' game Saturday night in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Berg, who played a role in three of the four Ottawa goals, was
scratched Thursday, a move that drew cheers from the crowd. His
replacement, Garry Galley, returned from injured reserve after
missing a month with a concussion and assisted on Smolinski's
second goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times where everything seemed to fall into place,''
said Smolinski, whose 38 points are just two short of last year's
total when he played with the New York Islanders. ``But not
enough.''

SCHWAB BUYING BANK THAT CATERS TO THE RICH  
   
  
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM ZUCKERMAN  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
 
SAN FRANCISCO _ In a high-profile marriage of new money and old,
online trading giant Charles Schwab Corp. agreed Thursday to buy
U.S. Trust Corp., one of the nation's largest managers of money for
the wealthy, for $2.7 billion in stock.
<TEXT>
<P>
   If approved, the deal would be the nation's largest takeover of
a bank by a brokerage firm _ just the sort of combination
anticipated when Congress rewrote banking laws last year to make it
easier to create bank, brokerage and insurance hybrids. Although it
markets itself as a trust company, U.S. Trust, founded in 1853 and
based in New York, is chartered as a bank and has banking powers.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover also marks another triumph of the new economy over
the old.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger is as important for financial services as AOL and
Time Warner were for entertainment,'' said Charlotte Chamberlain,
an analyst with the Los Angeles brokerage Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``This is
a watershed merger in financial services, joining together online
and old line.''
</P>
<P>
   Like AOL, Schwab is using its stock _ inflated by its Internet
status _ to buy a more traditionally valued firm. Schwab's stock
traded at about 45 times projected earnings for the year, compared
with 19 times earnings for U.S. Trust's stock before the purchase
was announced.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trust's stock rocketed $54.13, to $133, Thursday. Schwab's
shares gained $2.88, to $40.50.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Schwab is not a pure Internet company. It began 26
years ago as a discount broker offering cheap commissions on stock
trades for customers who made their own investment decisions,
emerging as the strongest competitor in that field.
</P>
<P>
   The company still has extensive branch and telephone operations,
but customers now enter more than 2 out of 3 stock orders over the
Internet, and Schwab has emerged as the dominant force in online
brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely pairing of the leading mass-market discount broker
and a prestigious, old-fashioned money manager is not as strange as
it seems, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab will be able to offer its customers banking products,
such as federally insured deposits, although U.S. Trust's status as
a trust company, not a full-service bank, may restrict Schwab's
ability to provide a full range of bank services.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, U.S. Trust's research department, which includes
about 20 stock analysts who follow 300 companies, gives Schwab the
building blocks for in-house stock analysis, a service investors
demand. Currently, Schwab provides stock research from outside
firms only.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have not yet decided whether Schwab will give stock
reports to all customers or just top-tier clients. ``My guess is it
will be available to everybody,'' said U.S. Trust Vice Chairman
Maribeth Rahe.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's main reason for scooping up U.S Trust is to capture a
market segment is has coveted but never conquered _ the wealthiest
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   For clients with $2 million or more, U.S. Trust manages
investment portfolios, does estate and tax planning, creates trust
accounts and offers individually tailored banking services,
including loans and checking accounts. It charges clients hefty
fees for the services.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Schwab has tried to upgrade the services it
offers its wealthiest _ and most profitable _ customers, giving
them individual service representatives and a variety of frills,
such as opportunities to chat with corporate CEOs in conference
calls. But given its discount-broker origins, Schwab's culture and
business model make it difficult to provide the kind of coddling
rich clients want.
</P>
<P>
   As their assets have grown, many Schwab customers have defected
to trust companies and high-end brokers such as Merrill Lynch. Even
so, Schwab has more rich customers than ever, thanks to a soaring
stock market. Now Schwab will be able to refer them to U.S. Trust,
which will retain its identity after the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're increasingly getting wealthy clients,'' said co-Chief
Executive David Pottruck. ``We need services we have not
traditionally been able to provide.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Schwab's move positions it to grab a bigger share
of the wealth market.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have leapfrogged ahead again,'' said J.P. Morgan
Securities analyst Michael Freudenstein. ``The next big
battleground is the affluent market, and (Schwab) will be very
formidable.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schwab faces a potential revolt among one of its key
constituencies _ the 4,600 independent financial advisers who
provide personal investment advice to Schwab customers for a fee.
About 30 percent of Schwab's assets are managed by these advisers,
and many of them may feel threatened if the firm can refer clients
to U.S. Trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shock,'' said one such adviser, Morgan White of Menlo
Park's Woodside Asset Management about the U.S Trust purchase.
``That's our market.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab is working overtime to assure the advisers that their
business will actually be helped by the purchase. Advisers ``have
been telling us for years that we need to have trust services,''
said Pottruck.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers say they will scrutinize Schwab's behavior closely.
``We're reserving judgment,'' said White.

MICROSOFT CEO STEPS DOWN  
 
 
 
 
</HEADLINE>
   By KELLY ZITO and CARRIE KIRBY  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the world's most valuable company faces a potentially
wrenching breakup, Bill Gates stepped down as chief executive of
Microsoft Corp. Thursday, handing the reins to his former Harvard
classmate, Steve Ballmer, the company's gregarious president.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer, 43, whom Forbes magazine once called ``the George S.
Patton of the software industry'' and Microsoft's ``chief coach,
cheerleader and hatchet man,'' also will take a seat on Microsoft's
board beginning January 27.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, 44, will remain chairman and take on the new position of
chief software architect as the Redmond, Wash., company retools for
the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve's promotion will allow me to dedicate myself full time
to my passion _ building great software and strategizing on the
future,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, the world's wealthiest person, founded Microsoft 25 years
ago with Paul Allen. Since then, the company has grown into a
juggernaut in the software industry: Its Windows operating systems,
its applications software and its Internet browser dominate their
respective markets.
</P>
<P>
   But that dominance has had its downside.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Microsoft's management shuffle prompted widespread
speculation that it was tied to its acrimonious battle with the
Justice Department and the offices of 19 state attorneys general,
which charge that the company is an illegal monopoly that harms
consumers. A federal judge found last year that Microsoft used its
position in the industry to create a monopoly, but he has not yet
ruled on whether the company's actions were unlawful.
</P>
<P>
   This week, unnamed sources said the Justice Department will
demand that Microsoft break itself into three distinct ``Baby
Bills'' as part of an out-of-court settlement of the antitrust
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But Ballmer said his promotion was not related to the lawsuit.
He used Thursday's press conference to lash out at what he called
the ``deliberate'' leaks out of the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would absolutely reckless and irresponsible for
anyone to try to break up this company,'' Ballmer said. ``I think
it would be unprecedented, and I think it would be the single
greatest disservice to consumers in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials didn't directly comment on the
announcement. A spokesman said, ``The department is committed to
seeking the remedy that will solve the serious competitive problems
reflected in the court's finding by promoting innovations and
consumer choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillard Sterling, an antitrust lawyer at Chicago's Gordon &AMP;
Glickson, doesn't believe the management change represents legal
maneuvering by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were relevant to the litigation, the changes would
have fallen along product lines,'' he said. ``For example, Ballmer
could have become head of browser operations, thereby easing a
restructuring whereby the browser splits from the operating system
functions.''
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement does echo a similar event of two decades
ago. In 1979, as AT&AMP;T was fighting an antitrust case brought by the
federal government, AT&AMP;T's chairman and chief executive, John D.
deButts, stepped down a year before his scheduled retirement.
DeButts was vehemently opposed to the breakup of the company, which
eventually occurred under his successor, Charles Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gates, Ballmer has taken a strong stance against the
possibility of splitting up Microsoft. But some observers believe
his mere presence in the chief executive slot could thaw relations
with the government. ``He's emphatic that he doesn't want to break
up the company,'' said Andrew Roskill, an analyst at Warburg Dillon
Read. But ``it's possible the change in the guard at the
head-kahuna level will help make some progress on the negotiation
front. Bringing in a fresh face could help rejuvenate the
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Roskill also said Gates may be filling a hole left by Nathan
Myrhvold. Myrhvold, the company's chief technology officer, took a
year's leave of absence beginning July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Myrhvold) was always thinking about what is going to be
happening not this year, not next year, but three, four years down
the road,'' Roskill said. Since he left, ``they've lacked that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer, the world's fourth-richest man, is known for his
intensity, tenacity and passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one person at Microsoft I feel very good about,''
said Jeffrey Tarter, publisher of SoftLetter, in Watertown, Mass.
``He's a human being. He has a personality and he's fun. He's a
teddy bear with a big, booming voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gates' bespectacled face has probably graced more
magazine covers, Ballmer is considered a driving force behind the
company's success.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian King, who worked beside Ballmer at Microsoft for five
years in the 1980s, told PC Magazine several years ago, ``Microsoft
could lose Bill Gates, but it could not survive without Steve's
sheer will to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of immigrants, Ballmer was friends with Gates at Harvard
and kept in touch with him after Gates dropped out to start
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer's first job was selling cake mixes for Procter &AMP; Gamble.
But in 1980, Gates lured him to Microsoft. In July 1998, he was
promoted to president _ a move many interpreted as an unofficial
grooming for the CEO post.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill hasn't been running the company for at least a year, ever
since Steve took over as president. If you look at the
organizational chart for Microsoft, Bill was in charge of a few R&AMP;D
people, and that's it,'' said Tarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Ballmer has already proven that he's in some ways much
better at running the company than Bill ever was,'' Tarter added.
``He's made the company far more focused on customers, taken a much
tougher attitude on product usabililty and made the development
process more demanding. He's running the company internally much
better; he's always been incredibly smart about the marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   In regular trading Thursday, Microsoft shares gained $1.81 to
close at $107.63. In after-hours trading, Microsoft shares dipped
as low as $101.50. The announcement was made after regular hours.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The reality of global warming
 &HT;    (Eds: This column, which normally moves Mondays, is moving today
to accommodate early deadlines for the MLK holiday.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apparently global warming, as a phenomenon, is roughly on a par
with the Tooth Fairy. How else to explain the number of
conservative politicians and commentators who rush to say they
don't ``believe'' in global warming with every new report verifying
it?
</P>
<P>
   So expect the usual gainsayers to form up and declare their
eager apostasy to the finding by a panel of the National Academy of
Sciences that global warming is very much with us and shows signs
of having accelerated in the last couple of decades.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one vivacious scientific dissenter, a chemist,
immediately kissed the report off as evidence only that the academy
has been captured by, his word, ``enviros.'' We are to understand
that enviros, who- or whatever they may be, are bad.
</P>
<P>
   Please know, and I can't emphasize this too much, that I have no
idea what I'm talking about here. I don't know beans about the
science of it. But I can count heads and I can read pedigrees and
it has been clear for some years that the overwhelming burden of
the best-informed scientific judgment holds that the Earth is
growing warmer at markedly ahistorical rates.
</P>
<P>
   If you are handicapping biospheric health and _ not to be
alarmist, mind you _ perhaps THE VERY BREATH OF LIFE!, it would
seem prudent to go with the odds.
</P>
<P>
   For another view, consult the right-wing radio talk-show guru of
your choice or one of the dwindling number of contrarian scientists
who, as chance would have it, are not infrequently in the employ of
mining, oil or power companies. Or consult just about any
Republican pol.
</P>
<P>
   The academy pretty well debunks one of their favored arguments,
to the effect that because upper-atmosphere temperatures are not
rising nearly as much as surface temperatures, what we take as
global warming is only a spell of bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy, the panel concludes, ``in no way invalidates
the conclusion that the Earth's temperature has been rising.'' The
warming trend over the last two decades ``is undoubtedly real and
is substantially greater than the average rate of warming during
the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel did not make predictions about the durability of
warming or its future rate, and it didn't speculate on
consequences. Neither did it address the suspicion, widely held
among scientists, that the trend is at least partly and maybe very
substantially the result of pollution by carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases that trap heat.
</P>
<P>
   There are perfectly legitimate arguments over those and more
points among scientists who concur on the basic premise, and by
extension it is perfectly valid, too, to argue a spectrum of social
responses, from watch-and-wait to kill the automobile.
</P>
<P>
   What is not sensible is to continue stubbornly denying the
obvious for ideological reasons and imprudently, considering the
potential disruptions, to disallow even measured precautions out of
partisanship or in greater fealty to sponsoring benefactors than to
humanity's simple self-interest.

 &HT;    Father should get Elian
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The raging debate regarding 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez shows how far removed from our common sense _ and our
sense of common humanity _ we have become.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which kind of family is a less important factor in how this
boy should be raised than which kind of state,'' said attorney Jose
Garcia Pedrosa, who represents Elian's Miami relatives who are
trying to keep him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The only people sent back to Cuba are criminals, opined
presidential hopeful John McCain. (Quick! Has the INS been alerted
of this policy?)
</P>
<P>
   Elian already lost his mother. Now, lawyers, politicians and
some Cuban-American activists are making the tortured argument that
because Elian lost his mother, he should also lose his father.
``She died to bring him here,'' goes the rallying cry. ``He should
be allowed to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, is attempting to
pre-empt the rights of the father, Juan Miguel, and even those of
his maternal grandparents. His supporters argue the boy could have
a ``better life'' in America. Translation: Affluence and a superior
political system supersede a family's love _ and a family's rights.
</P>
<P>
   It's good old-fashioned cultural imperialism masking itself as
``the best interests of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Put aside, for the moment, the fact that the same argument could
be made to justify the kidnapping of every last child in Cuba. Put
yourself in the father's position: Your ex-wife flees with your
6-year-old son and risks his life in a desperate attempt to
emigrate to America. She dies; the boy miraculously survives.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine being told you can't have your son back because he will
have a ``better life'' _ without you _ in another country.
</P>
<P>
   It would be one thing if Juan Miguel Gonzalez were an absent
father. But here is a man actively involved in his son's life _ a
man who hasn't cut his hair since Elian left, since the two always
went to the barber together.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, made the sensible, compassionate call that
``this little boy, who has been through so much, deserves to be
with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   That should have been the end of it. As we all know, it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Now Republicans in Congress, led by Dan Burton of Indiana, have
even issued a subpoena requiring Elian to appear before a House
subcommittee. Great idea. If he tells them he likes Barney, does
that mean he has to stay in America?
</P>
<P>
   People can't get enough of Elian, with his choir-boy eyes and
little-boy exuberance. The politicians, the Cuban-American
activists and lawyers have all claimed him as their own; the
cameras have all but devoured his image. But who is really seeing
him? Everyone is too wrapped up in his own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   A Florida family court ruled in favor of the Miami relatives,
granting the great-uncle temporary custody _ a decision swiftly
dismissed by Attorney General Janet Reno because the court has no
jurisdiction in federal matters.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope the federal courts move swiftly to return Elian to
his father in Cuba. Protracted custody battles do nobody any good,
least of all the child. (Remember baby Jessica?)
</P>
<P>
   ``Which kind of family is a less important factor in how this
boy should be raised than which kind of state,'' said the lawyer
for the boy's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   He's forgetting that ours is a great state because we value the
rights of individuals, of families.
</P>
<P>
   And he's forgetting Elian is not a symbol or a rallying cry or a
political pawn, but a flesh-and-blood little boy who has lost his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   And who needs his father, now more than ever.

 &HT;    Shaky AOL-Time Warner merger has everyone watching for hard fall
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Using American Online to connect to the Internet
is like riding a race bike with training wheels.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is slick, pretty, touchy-feely and in the way, in my
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   My opinion doesn't count because AOL just pulled off the biggest
merger in history when it plunked down $165 billion to buy Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   That's amazing when you consider that the smart money kept
saying AOL would fold as soon as newbie computer users wised up and
switched to cheaper and less intrusive Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently 20 million paying subscribers don't mind having their
hands held when they use the Internet through AOL.
</P>
<P>
   AOL subscribers must not mind all the offers for things they've
never thought about or the delays while AOL downloads something
supposed to upgrade something they've never complained about.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of Congress, including GOP presidential hopeful
Sen. Orrin Hatch, have said they are extremely concerned about this
mega-merger because it may hurt consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Congress members will look the merger over for antitrust
problems. None will be found since the two customer bases are
separate. Still, Congress members know that if they can regulate an
industry, they can hit it up for campaign donations. It's worth a
shot.
</P>
<P>
   This deal really isn't a merger. It's a buyout.
</P>
<P>
   AOL founder Steve Case, whose poor-boy whining recently helped
convince a federal judge that Microsoft founder Bill Gates was a
monopolist bully, bought Time Warner, which happens to own CNN,
HBO, Warner Bros., Sports Illustrated, Time and assorted other
magazines, music and movie studios and 13 million cable TV
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Case paid for Time Warner with an all-stock transaction. AOL
stock, like a lot of the dot.com companies, is based more on
expectations than profits. During its 15 years in business, AOL has
only barely begun to make a profit in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   To continue valuing AOL's stock based on expectations of profits
is not unlike Vegas craps shooters betting on the come.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, AOL's newfound profits look shaky when you
consider Case's company charges its customers more than $20 a month
for Internet access now given away free by other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of shaky, Time Warner has been having trouble turning a
profit since Warner Communications bought Time Inc. for $13.9
billion in 1989. At the time, people thought $13.9 billion to form
the biggest media conglomerate was a big deal. Silly us.
</P>
<P>
   At least Time Warner's stock is based on something people can
understand, such as profits, earnings, capital holdings and other
old-fashioned considerations.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder how Ted Turner is taking this. The master yachtsman
used to be master of his own ship, CNN, which he founded.
</P>
<P>
   CNN keeps sinking deeper into an ever-growing conglomerate. Now
Turner is some sort of a vice president. On top of that, him and
his better half, Jane Fonda, have seperated.
</P>
<P>
   As owner of the Atlanta Braves, Turner probably got enough money
out of the AOL-Time Warner deal to pay for John Rocker's
sensitivity training after Sports Illustrated, a Time Warner
publication, outed the flame-throwing pitcher as flaming bigot.
</P>
<P>
   These escalating mergers are entertainment in themselves. Now
that AOL has clasped hands with Time Warner and jumped over the
cliff together, everyone wants to see if the new company will land
on its feet and die from the fall.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, other mega-mergers and buyouts from filthy-rich
dot.com upstarts have to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates can't be outdone like this. I just hope Ted Turner
will still have a job.

 &HT;    Delivery to your door no guarantee if on 'wrong' side of river
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Jean Laster has the angels on her side. If only we
could summon the National Guard, too.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the image of guardsmen escorting a pizza driver to the
doorstep of a forbidden address doesn't fit in with the righteous
causes of Little Rock and the University of Mississippi. But it
doesn't make the cause of the Precinct 7 justice of the peace less
right, which is to demand to have a pizza delivered to people
regardless of skin color.
</P>
<P>
   The big-cheese pizza companies involved say pigment isn't the
issue, that safety is what keeps them from sending drivers to
certain places.
</P>
<P>
   It just so happens that virtually every inhabitant in those
places is black. It just so happens, also, that some of those
places have nicely maintained homes, well-manicured lawns,
pro-active neighbors and every criterion of a safe destination.
</P>
<P>
   No company can be faulted for having employees steer clear of a
specific danger spot. Anyone in town could name a dozen or more.
</P>
<P>
   Even San Francisco, which at one time imposed a
nondiscrimination ordinance on such deliveries, had to soften and
allow businesses to steer clear of places that presented an
``unreasonable risk of harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Crime statistics don't back up the prejudices of those who'd
red-line East Waco. As the Waco Tribune's J.B. Smith reported
Sunday, predominantly black City Council District 1, in which
Laster resides, had 73 robberies in 1998 compared to 124 in more
diverse though still inner-city District 4 on the other side of the
river.
</P>
<P>
   City officials are right to put the crime figures on the table
and urge pizza companies to be more selective about their
selectivity.
</P>
<P>
   But we can't force them.
</P>
<P>
   If they were banks, we would have more standing in calling the
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1970s, with rampant discrimination by banks in
denying loans to minorities, Congress did two things: First, in
1975 it required that banks start reporting where and to whom they
loaned under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. Second, in 1997 it
enacted the Community Reinvestment Act, which required banks to act
affirmatively in providing loans to inner-city residents.
</P>
<P>
   How possible? First, banks are chartered by the government.
Second, banks are insured by the government. They owe us, as
taxpayers, socially responsible practices, just as surely as their
debtors owe the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, the Community Reinvestment Act has proved to
be a godsend to America's cities.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of banks that opposed such requirements have come to
embrace the principle of putting something back into one's
community.
</P>
<P>
   A rational look at one's community, as banks have had to do,
breaks down a lot of barriers. A lesson for Pizza Inc.?
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that some banks don't skirt the law's intent.
While pledging nondiscrimination, some impose discriminatory
guidelines like minimum loan amounts and maximum housing age
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation that ended up with sweeping changes in banking last
year _ breaking the ``firewall'' between banking, insurance and
securities _ carried for a time a Senate-passed measure, authored
by Sen. Phil Gramm, that would have removed CRA requirements for
smaller banks (under $100 million in assets). It would have
affected rural communities throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton veto threat and opposition in the House killed that
dangerous wrinkle.
</P>
<P>
   How does banking deregulation bear on the delivery of pizza? Not
at all, unless _ the insatiable bank-insurer-securities
mega-corporations convince Congress they need more. They get the
green light to get into the pizza and Chinese food businesses.
Bingo. Federally regulated, we could require home delivery (and egg
rolls?) to all.

 &HT;    Japanese turning tools not as popular in U.S.
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once or twice a year a postcard from a reader arrives,
typewritten and anonymous, with a few terse lines usually couched
as a complaint rather than a question.
</P>
<P>
   The latest arrival begins with my correspondent claiming that he
can't find a single free plan for a garden arbor on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there you go. People who produce work have a habit of
wanting to get paid for it. Why not just examine a few arbors
already made, take the features you like, and draw up your own
plans? Heck, maybe you could sell them on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Next he _ I assume it's a man _ wants to know who sells Japanese
turning tools.
</P>
<P>
   As far as I know, no one sells them. I'm not even sure they are
available factory-made. To the best of my knowledge the woodturning
generally done in Japan is basic, architectural and, like much of
their joinery, involves soft woods. The turners generally make
their own tools and they wouldn't be of much use in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Another gentleman wrote in to apprise me of the finish he's
always used, which turns out to be the same finish I've always
used. It's made of polyurethane varnish, linseed oil and
turpentine. I've lost his note, but I believe his recipe called for
about one part each of polyurethane and oil and two parts of
turpentine. That's about the same proportions I've used.
</P>
<P>
   You can also buy the same kind of finish in commercial
preparations if you don't want to mix up your own. Minwax Antique
Oil is probably the most easily found, but there are several
others; just about every major maker of finish has one.
</P>
<P>
   It's generally referred to as an oil-varnish finish, because
varnish is a word not all woodworkers care to use in polite
company. A chemist, however, would consider it a varnish. The
virtue is that it combines the increased protection of varnish with
the ease of application of a straight oil finish. It is also easy
to repair.
</P>
<P>
   You apply it just like oil _ flood it on, let it soak in a
while, and wipe it off before it dries. you can adjust the drying
rate by varying the amount of turpentine. The 2-1-1 mixture will
dry rapidly, so you don't want to try to cover too big an area in
one go. If it gets too tacky to wipe off, just apply some more
fresh finish, which will loosen up the tacky stuff enough to wipe
off.
</P>
<P>
   As with a straight oil finish, you don't want to hurry. Most
commercial finishes tell you to wait 24 hours between coats.
However, I think it's best to wait at least two days, especially in
humid weather.
</P>
<P>
   Expect to apply two or three coats. The heavier the buildup, the
more protection and gloss.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Maloof uses a finish like this, except for the final coats,
when he adds beeswax to the mixture and heats it in a double
boiler.
</P>
<P>
   Sam has the advantage of living in sunny Southern California,
and does this finishing outdoors. I wouldn't suggest doing it
indoors.

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ The raging debate over
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez shows how far removed from our common

justice of the peace less right, which is to demand to have a pizza

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ It looks as though Mary Anne Gehris will slip
the hangman's noose that the Immigration and Naturalization Service

convince Congress to scrap its over-the-top deportation law, then
is it hard to imagine any abuse will ever move the legislators.

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Carlton Fisk was a major-league baseball
player with a .269 lifetime batting average. There is one moment in

 &HT;    Japanese turning tools not as popular in U.S.
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once or twice a year a postcard from a reader arrives,
typewritten and anonymous, with a few terse lines usually couched
as a complaint rather than a question.
</P>
<P>
   The latest arrival begins with my correspondent claiming that he
can't find a single free plan for a garden arbor on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there you go. People who produce work have a habit of
wanting to get paid for it. Why not just examine a few arbors
already made, take the features you like, and draw up your own
plans? Heck, maybe you could sell them on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Next he _ I assume it's a man _ wants to know who sells Japanese
turning tools.
</P>
<P>
   As far as I know, no one sells them. I'm not even sure they are
available factory-made. To the best of my knowledge the woodturning
generally done in Japan is basic, architectural and, like much of
their joinery, involves soft woods. The turners generally make
their own tools and they wouldn't be of much use in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Another gentleman wrote in to apprise me of the finish he's
always used, which turns out to be the same finish I've always
used. It's made of polyurethane varnish, linseed oil and
turpentine. I've lost his note, but I believe his recipe called for
about one part each of polyurethane and oil and two parts of
turpentine. That's about the same proportions I've used.
</P>
<P>
   You can also buy the same kind of finish in commercial
preparations if you don't want to mix up your own. Minwax Antique
Oil is probably the most easily found, but there are several
others; just about every major maker of finish has one.
</P>
<P>
   It's generally referred to as an oil-varnish finish, because
varnish is a word not all woodworkers care to use in polite
company. A chemist, however, would consider it a varnish. The
virtue is that it combines the increased protection of varnish with
the ease of application of a straight oil finish. It is also easy
to repair.
</P>
<P>
   You apply it just like oil _ flood it on, let it soak in a
while, and wipe it off before it dries. you can adjust the drying
rate by varying the amount of turpentine. The 2-1-1 mixture will
dry rapidly, so you don't want to try to cover too big an area in
one go. If it gets too tacky to wipe off, just apply some more
fresh finish, which will loosen up the tacky stuff enough to wipe
off.
</P>
<P>
   As with a straight oil finish, you don't want to hurry. Most
commercial finishes tell you to wait 24 hours between coats.
However, I think it's best to wait at least two days, especially in
humid weather.
</P>
<P>
   Expect to apply two or three coats. The heavier the buildup, the
more protection and gloss.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Maloof uses a finish like this, except for the final coats,
when he adds beeswax to the mixture and heats it in a double
boiler.
</P>
<P>
   Sam has the advantage of living in sunny Southern California,
and does this finishing outdoors. I wouldn't suggest doing it
indoors.

A LITTLE DIGGING PRODUCES A GEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EARTH CITY, Mo. _ Charley Armey was well into the tale of all
tales for the 1999 National Football League season, of how he found
Kurt Warner, lost in the ozone between Iowa and Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was aware of what Kurt had been doing in the Arena
Football League,'' said Armey, the former Patriots executive and
current vice president of player personnel for the St. Louis Rams.
``There were write-ups in the papers and videotapes, so you knew
about the guy. And I had worked out other Arena League guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner had a tryout with the Green Bay Packers in the 1994
training camp, but was so intimidated by Brett Favre and the other
quarterbacks that he was reluctant to even take snaps in
scrimmages.
</P>
<P>
   Many minds in the NFL closed. Warner went off to the Iowa
Barnstormers of the Arena League, where he played from 1995-97.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one day, coach Al Luginbill of the Amsterdam Admirals of
NFL Europe called _ his 12th NFL team as it were _ and talked to
Armey. Armey's mind was not closed especially since Luginbill,
Marshall Faulk's former coach at San Diego State, was a longtime
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al was calling and and he was looking for a quarterback and he
was asking me about working out Kurt,'' said Armey. ``Kurt had come
from Northern Iowa and then what I did was look up the report I had
done on Kurt when I was with the Patriots. And then I noticed in
the report I'd done with the Patriots that I had written, `(Warner)
has a chance to develop into a solid player in the NFL.' I had
written that because of his accuracy and his arm strength. But, you
know, at New England, we weren't really looking for a quarterback
with Drew (Bledsoe) there and (Scott) Zolak.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL scouts have pals strewn through all the highways and byways
of America. It's a necessity. The pipeline must be replenished
every year with nuggets about a hidden gem at some unknown school.
Armey recalled that he had a pal, Mike Kolling, on the staff of
Northern Iowa ``and my first coaching job I ever had, at a high
school in Grainsville, Minn., Mike was my quarterback. So I just
called and asked him about Warner, to get a little background on
the kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike said, `You really need to work this guy out because his
arm is so accurate.' Already, it was an unbelievable story with
Warner, because in five years at Northern Iowa, it wasn't until his
senior year that he had ever played. And then he went into Green
Bay's camp and they never really gave him a chance since they had
Favre and (Mark) Brunell there.''
</P>
<P>
   So Armey went to Rams coach Dick Vermeil and the two decided to
bring in Warner for a workout. ``We were both struck by how quickly
he got rid of the ball _ and that was strictly because of the Arena
League and how fast-paced it is _ and how accurate he was,'' Armey
said. ``He always put the ball where the receivers could catch it
without adjusting their routes. But what you never know about a
quarterback is how well he runs a team and manages a team.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, Armey and Vermeil decided, could only be found in
NFL Europe. So Armey and the Rams signed Warner in December 1997
and shipped him to Amsterdam in 1998. ``He immediately started
lighting it up there,'' said Armey.
</P>
<P>
   Armey's mind was not closed _ the Rams signed a totally unknown
quarterback and shipped him off to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And ``what's happened,'' said Armey, ``is one of the great
Cinderella stories you've ever heard of in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner, of course, replaced the injured Trent Green for St.
Louis in the exhibition season and has already won the MVP award
for the 1999 season.

ARMEY'S BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EARTH CITY, Mo. _ Their two personalities couldn't be more
different. One is demanding and driving. The other is relaxed and
accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells and Charley Armey truly did not mesh in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Armey is now flourishing as the St. Louis Rams' vice president
of player personnel, solidifying his reputation as a keen judge of
talent with the signing of quarterback Kurt Warner, who has risen
from the obscurity of the Arena Football League to garnering the
NFL's most valuable player award.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his _ and his team's _ success, the wounds Armey
suffered in New England still have not healed. From time to time,
he will be discussing one subject, only to have the specter of
Parcells slip back into the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Armey, who worked in New England from 1991-97, was the Patriots'
director of college scouting during Parcells's tenure and his words
about his former colleague are unusually blunt.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while discussing the coaches he has worked under,
Armey said the secret for all good coaches is ``they all have a
plan and they all stick to it. They're not wishy-washy with their
plan. And, without question, Dick Vermeil is the most overall and
well-rounded of all the coaches I've worked under. He has fewer
weaknesses and more strengths than any I've known.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all have strengths. Like Forrest Gregg was a great
disciplinarian out of the Lombardi era and I loved working under
Gregg. And Chuck Knox, too. And I loved working for Marv Levy. And
Bill? Everybody knows what Bill's all about. But Bill doesn't have
the compassion that Dick Vermeil has.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey talked on. Of how Vermeil ``is the most compassionate man
I've ever known and I'm not just talking about dealing with
football players and coaches. I mean, just with people. He
genuinely would treat the guy shingling his house as well as the
guy throwing his 40th touchdown pass. He is just an unusual
person.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he goes back to New England. Back to Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Bill squeezed me out in New England, he didn't squeeze me
out totally because I had a great relationship with the owner (Bob
Kraft), but he squeezed me out out of the process of selecting
players,'' said Armey. ``The last two years I was there in New
England I really didn't have too much to do with selecting players
and who they took.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bill is a bully,'' he said. ``I think he bullies his
coaches and personally I think that's why (Bill) Belichick isn't
coaching the Jets. I think he bullies his coaches, I think he
bullies the people he works with and I think he tried to bully his
way through everything, and I just don't think you can do that in
modern-day football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him once, `When's the last time in the NFL a coach has
fired an owner?' . . . I don't know, I just think his personality
and my personality didn't mesh.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Armey's version of the unhappy relationship, ``Bill and I
never hit it off from Day 1. Bill was always trying to edge me out.
I'm sure, if he had had complete control, if Robert Kraft had let
him, he would have fired me.''
</P>
<P>
   As Armey looks back, he feels his system of scouting and
``layering'' the draft board paid dividends both before Parcells
arrived and after. ``Sam Gash? I drafted him in the eighth round
before Bill was even there. And Todd Collins was drafted before
Bill was there. And Ty Law was a player we were completely sold
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Armey said, ``Bill was a great coach'' and just as
certainly, a head coach has to be involved in who is drafted
``because he has to be the guy who cooks the meal'' and, ``He has
to have the type of players that fit in with the way he coaches.
And I've always believed this _ you've got to give the head coach
the players to work with because the personality with the team will
be the head coach's.''
</P>
<P>
   When Parcells was the coach and Armey the head of college
scouting, the Patriots would involve the assistant coaches in the
draft process. New England now has reverted to the late Dick
Steinberg's method, where the scouting department more or less
makes the call without much, if any, involvement from the men who
will coach the players. ``I've always believed, and I'm surprised
Bobby (Grier) might not, that all your people have to be
involved,'' said Armey.
</P>
<P>
   In his last two years, Armey was cast out of the process, and in
his last year (1997) _ because it was known he was coming to St.
Louis _ he was unable to say anything of import.
</P>
<P>
   Asked which picks in New England made him the proudest, Armey
replied, ``Ted Johnson . . . and Drew Bledsoe because of what he is
and I'm very, very, very proud of the fact that I stood up at the
table and we were able to draft Sam Gash because he turned out to
be a good player. From where Sam was rated to where he went is
probably my greatest thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, said Armey, ``didn't make any selections at all''
after the infamous Terry Glenn episode on draft day in 1996. And,
by then, Armey had been relegated to being ``like any other scout.
I wasn't running the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey wants to make clear that ``I wasn't treated poorly by
Bobby Grier or Robert Kraft or any of the scouts or the office
people. It was just my relationship with Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguments and debates persist endlessly in New England about who
was responsible for drafting whom during the Parcells years. Armey
was asked to give his view of the most famous decision the Patriots
had to make _ Bledsoe or Rick Mirer with the No. 1 pick in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll always be the age-old argument (about who in the
organiation wanted Bledsoe and who wanted Mirer), and you'll always
get a story from Bill and a story from me,'' said Armey. ``The true
story and the facts are with (former New England owner) James
Orthwein. Orthwein knows the true story. But Bill never tipped his
hand. See, people think Bill had the final authority to make the
picks with the Patriots but that was never in his contract. Not
when I was there, and I left after he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, the final authority in the draft, before Kraft gave
it to Bobby Grier, was (former general manager) Patrick Forte. But
there was some debate between Bledsoe and Mirer . . . but Bledsoe
rated higher and it was obvious I wanted to pick Bledsoe. There was
also some entertainment about trading the pick, and bringing in
(Steve) Beuerlein.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `I was lucky that Coach Vermeil believed in my ability and (Rams
president) John Shaw believed in my ability and gave me an
opportunity,'' said Armey of his rebirth in St. Louis. ``I'm
probably lucky they didn't call Bill Parcells.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey places himself squarely on the side of Kraft in the messy
divorce that developed between the Patriots' owner and Parcells, a
divorce that has risen to a blood feud between the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have any complaints about how I was treated by
Robert Kraft _ zero,'' said Armey. ``But I can tell you from
first-hand experience, and you can quote me on this, that nobody
ever treated a coach better than Robert Kraft treated Bill
Parcells. There are things that went on that I wasn't aware of . .
. that's possible . . . but I saw how Robert Kraft revered him and
how he treated him from the first day. Robert Kraft loved him.''
</P>
<P>
   And the falling out?
</P>
<P>
   Somebody, said Armey, ``convinced Robert Kraft that coaches
should coach and scouts should scout and somebody should do the
(salary) cap. He just believes that. That's his philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   And Armey, the personnel guy, was in the middle ``and that
almost always happens because personnel guys are half-management
and half-coaches. The No. 1 responsibility is to get the players
for the head coach to win. And your No. 1 loyalty is to the
organization, to do what's best for the organization. So you can
see how that can be a pull and a tug.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was.
</P>
<P>
   So Armey was pushed aside, then pushed out, and landed in St.
Louis. He talks about his next brightest gem after Kurt Warner, a
5-foot-9-inch, 268-pound linebacker from Division 3 John Carroll
University that nobody in the NFL dared covet because of his size
and the competition he faced. But London Fletcher (after convincing
the Rams' PR people to list him in the team's media guide as 6
feet) has blossomed into one of the league's most promising
linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the Rams' players weren't in St. Louis when
Armey arrived, and with his team _ the men he acquired _ set to
begin its playoff quest Sunday against the Minnesota Vikings, there
is much to discuss. But back, inevitably, it seemed, he came to New
England, an area he misses and a team he cherished. And back he
came, of course, to Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert Kraft was as fair to me as anyone ever has been and
he's a real true friend,'' said Armey. ``And everybody coaches
their own way . . . I have no problems with Parcells. It's not part
of his job description to like me and it's not part of my job
description to like him. It's just that I don't believe that he
should bully people. He tried to intimidate everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, Armey continued, ``wins by the intimidation rule. And
that's what he is. That's who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   And Charley Armey is who he is _ laid-back and convivial _
except when it comes to discussing one man. Bill Parcells.

forgive ``The Sopranos'' for giving itself a subtle pat on the
back.
</P>
<P>
   After all, as Frank Sinatra sings in the opening minutes of the
HBO drama's second season premiere, it was a very good year.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a new year, a new season. All those magazine covers
and Emmys and Golden Globe nominations and the rest don't mean
squat. You have to understand, this is just business.
</P>
<P>
   So I'm not gonna gush about the new ``Sopranos'' season
beginning at 9 p.m. EST Sunday. No way. Enough already with the
platitudes. As Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) says, ``You gotta
exercise impulse control.''
</P>
<P>
   So we will cut to the facts. In the first three episodes:
</P>
<P>
   _ We meet Tony's sisters, including the wonderfully wacked
Janice (Aida Turturro). She also goes by the name of Pavarti and
may also have an agenda beyond just re-establishing links to her
family.
</P>
<P>
   _ We learn mommy dearest Livia (Nancy Marchand) survived her
``stroke,'' despite being ``dead'' as far as Tony is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   _ We are hit with a sledgehammer by the return home of new face
Richie Aprile (David Proval), brother of late mob boss Jackie
Aprile. After a long stretch in the pen, Richie is looking for his
street action again.
</P>
<P>
   _ He is not the only one to come in from the cold.
</P>
<P>
   _ We learn Tony likes Deep Purple (hey, that is the kind of
detail fans love).
</P>
<P>
   _ Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), fearful of a hit, is
still meeting clients for therapy sessions in a motel.
</P>
<P>
   We also learn that the acting and writing of the mob hit created
by David Chase remains as sharp and captivating as it was in the
earth-shaking 13 episodes of season one.
</P>
<P>
   You call that gushing? Tough. Judging from the first three
episodes, there is nothing to indicate ``The Sopranos'' has slipped
from its perch.
</P>
<P>
   How can I tell? That old post-``Sopranos'' depression has
returned. It's a gnawing emptiness that arises after you see
upcoming episodes in advance and know that when the show actually
airs, you have already spent that initial rush. It's like eating
your Halloween candy while you're still trick-or-treating, then
having to watch your siblings gorge at the kitchen table afterward.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a little more than a year ago that the cast and crew
thought that this little drama they had slapped together would go
by unnoticed, a fun experience that would look good on a resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too bad people won't watch it,'' Chase told co-star Edie Falco
(Carmela Soprano).
</P>
<P>
   The only thing the people involved in this show have gotten
wrong is judging how good it really is: The initial tidal wave of
acclaim _ it was universal_ stunned Gandolfini and the rest. In
fact, Gandolfini said last summer that he didn't even expect to get
the part of the mob boss in need of psychiatry: ``They decided to
take a shot, I guess. But that's probably because I'm cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Gandolfini is a private man. When he met with
the press to accept an award from critics last summer, Gandolfini
was noticeably uncomfortable with the attention. Generous, but shy,
cast members said.
</P>
<P>
   Gandolfini, like others in the cast, has trouble pinpointing why
the show resonates with the public. This is where I could go on
with a dissertation of family, and how people can relate to the
flawed mob boss whose nearly unlimited power in the local mob does
nothing to ease his inner fears and troubles with family at home.
But if you've seen the show, either on HBO or on tapes that are
floating around everywhere, you already knew that.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, this is a new season. What about 2000? ``I'm sure
we'll screw it up,'' Gandolfini joked before filming began.
</P>
<P>
   How can people involved in something so right get it so wrong?

CHASE CREATES MOBSTERS JUST LIKE YOU AND ME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Chase is sitting in a strangely empty
hotel-restaurant near his apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side,
noshing on a bagel and trying to articulate just what it is that
has made ``The Sopranos,'' his HBO series about the life of a Mafia
family, such a smash hit.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, in part, it's the realism of the show, but what does that
mean exactly? He hems, haws, meanders, muses. Then he hits on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this show has, that other shows don't have,'' he begins,
``is that people try to talk to each other _ sometimes _ but even
when they try, they fail because everyone's locked in their own
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of TV and movies today _ people say exactly what's on
their mind and they say it very eloquently and very well,'' he goes
on, warming to the subject. ``You know, two characters `have it
out,' and they end up hugging and teary, and each character has
come to a `new understanding' that the other was really trying to
help him in the last 42 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   He giggles, then says, ``I don't see that happening so often in
life. I see people fumbling and flailing. And when you do give
somebody your catalogue of all the things they've said in the past
to hurt you, they say, `I didn't say that!' '' He roars with
laughter.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI recently released excerpts of tapes on which senior
members of the New Jersey mafia are heard raving about ``The
Sopranos,'' extolling the writing, the acting, and wondering how
its makers know so much about them.
</P>
<P>
   Chase is amused and pleased by the reports. He grew up in New
Jersey, in an Italian-American family (the name was changed from De
Cesare back in the 1920s). He knew a few gangsters in his youth,
though nobody high up.
</P>
<P>
   But what clicks about this show isn't that Tony Soprano and his
crew are so much like real mobsters. It's that they're so much like
real people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason they seem real is because I've based them on people
in my family or someone I went to school with,'' Chase says.
``There's one episode where Tony says about Uncle Junior, 'I love
my uncle but, when I was growing up, he told my girl cousins I'd
never be a varsity athlete and that was a great blow to my
self-esteem.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Chase says, with a slight laugh, ``my uncle did tell
my girl cousins that I'd never be a varsity athlete, and it was a
huge blow to my self-esteem. That's why people think it's realistic
_ it's built on all the little grudges in life.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest influence here was Chase's mother, the model for
Tony Soprano's mother, Livia, a seething, manipulative (and
completely captivating) monster of a woman who gangs up with Tony's
uncle to bump off her only son.
</P>
<P>
   Chase has spoken of his mother before, but was she really such a
horror? ``No, of course not,'' he replies. ``But her id was right
there, ready to come out any time, and she had a great way with
words, very wild.''
</P>
<P>
   So, she didn't threaten to poke Chase's eyes out with a fork, as
Livia threatened to do to 9-year-old Tony in last season's
flashback-episode? Chase pauses. ``Well, yeah, she did do that,''
he admits.
</P>
<P>
   This comes as a visible shock, so he explains: ``There was a
snowstorm, we were cooped up in the house, and I kept moaning that
I wanted this little Hammond organ'' _ just like little Tony moaned
in that episode! _ ``and finally, she was driven up the wall, and
she said that.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't mean it,'' he adds, lightheartedly. ``I drove her
to it. My mother was very operatic, she was over the top. But she
never subjected me to any kind of physical abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   What's eerie is that these are almost precisely the words Tony
Soprano uttered, with the same moms-will-be-moms shrug, while
telling the tale to his alarmed psychiatrist. For a brief moment,
Chase _ the show's creator, director, and frequent writer _ looks
like, sounds like, seems to be Tony Soprano.
</P>
<P>
   Chase's mother, who died several years ago, was the key not only
to Livia but to the whole show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been milking stories about my mother at dinner parties for
years,'' he remembers, ``and my wife said I should write a show
about her. I said, `Nah, who cares?' But the idea that did come _ I
was in therapy _ was having a mobster in therapy, working out his
relationship with his cantankerous mother. And I had this notion
that the solution to his Oedipal and maternal dilemma would take
place not in the therapist's office but in the streets, through
gang warfare, with his mother siding with his uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   This, the germ of what would become ``The Sopranos,'' was in
1988, long before ``Analyze This'' or ``Grosse Point Blank.'' Chase
pitched it to his agents as a movie _ ``DeNiro and Anne Bancroft,
something like that,'' he recalls. ``They said, `A mob comedy? Come
on.' So I put it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, he signed a deal with Brillstein-Grey, the company
that produced HBO's ``The Larry Sanders Show.'' They asked if he'd
like to make something like ``The Godfather'' as a TV series.
</P>
<P>
   Chase declined. ``I didn't want to do these guys in a black
car,'' he says. ``Then, I was driving home, and I thought about
this film idea I'd had _ a family drama, like `Year in the Life' or
`Eight Is Enough,' but about a mob family. I realized that the idea
could be expanded into that.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest is well-trod history. He sold the idea to Fox, which,
after mulling it over, backed off. ``They never said why,'' he
says. ``I think it was too dark for them.'' The three big networks
all passed, too. Finally, HBO got it, and gave Chase complete
artistic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Had one of the majors signed up, it would have been very
different, not just in tone _ the show is rife with profanity _
but, even more, in its casting, especially of Tony, wonderfully
played by the balding, overweight James Gandolfini.
</P>
<P>
   ``No network would have cast him,'' Chase says, shaking his
head. ``They would have given him a sitcom maybe, put him on a
couch with a beer can in his hand. The thing with the networks,
it's all looks, `sexy.' It's so draining. They'll say, 'Let's get a
Winona Ryder type.' I don't even know what that means. I'd say,
`You can't get Winona Ryder, so let's get somebody else as good but
different.''' He laughs uproariously.
</P>
<P>
   Chase has worked on a number of successful network shows,
including ``Rockford Files'' and ``Northern Exposure,'' but ``The
Sopranos'' is the first show that is totally his.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have likened the show to Dennis Potter's ``The Singing
Detective,'' but Chase says he was more inspired by David Lynch's
``Twin Peaks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like stuff that has mysterious comings and goings, a vague
sense of menace, of something coiled that's ready to blow, stuff
that has a certain dreamlike quality to it,'' he says, in a
dreamlike reverie. Then, as if waking up, he adds, with a laugh,
``It's probably time I grew up.''
</P>
<P>
   The first season was all shot before a single episode aired, so
he had no idea how it would be received. By the time he started to
write for the second season, it was clearly not just a hit but a
phenomenon. The pressure was on to top himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not some kind of lion-like auteur who thinks, 'I don't
care if people like it or not!' '' he says. ``We're social animals.
We try to make something entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, he often found himself pushing way beyond the envelope
to fulfill or exceed expectations. ``This was not always a great
idea,'' he says. ``I ended up pulling back during the filming or
the editing.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis Coppola followed ``The Godfather'' with ``Godfather
II,'' but even he crashed with ``Godfather III.'' ``Twin Peaks''
dwindled into self-parody less than halfway through its first year.
How long can ``The Sopranos'' go on?
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years, tops,'' Chase states. The Soprano kids will grow
up; the actors will move on to movies. Aside from all that, he
adds, ``I hope we have the good sense to know when it's over.''

TOO BULLISH ON AMERICA? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For two decades Dick Greene was a legend, the Ted Williams of
Boston stockbrokers, a threat to lead the league in any given year.
The Splendid Splinter, however, could only daydream about the kind
of paychecks Greene brought home.
</P>
<P>
   Greene was the perennial number one producer in Merrill Lynch's
Boston office, some years the number one retail broker nationwide
for America's number one brokerage house. Neither Greene, who spent
years avoiding newspaper guys like me, nor Merrill Lynch will talk
numbers. But competitors estimate Greene could have had $1 billion
in assets under management, generated $10 million a year in
commissions, and taken home $4 million or more a year.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston Irishman with a fondness for cigars, Greene was an
old-school stockbroker who succeeded for exactly the reasons good
brokers do: He worked harder than the next guy and made his clients
money. Legend has it that Greene stopped to see a client every
morning on his way to work, and another every evening on his way
home. That adds up over four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Greene retired at the end of 1998, but now he is under scrutiny
by the state Division of Securities and the target of a slew of
complaints by unhappy former clients. He is also the latest local
Merrill Lynch broker to come under fire, raising the question
whether the big money manager, which has a good reputation for
policing itself, has simply hit a patch of bad luck or whether
there is something amiss.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Merrill's recent run here is bad for its image, in a
business where image counts.
</P>
<P>
   In October and November, The Globe ran stories about Merrill
Lynch broker Donald Martineau, who was charged with stealing $9
million from clients over 11 years. Last month the Boston Herald
outlined how a Merrill broker in Pittsfield, Mass., Donald Sarin,
churned the account of a dead woman, costing her estate $500,000 in
potential investment gains and $160,000 in commissions. Both
brokers have been fired.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch has terminated two other brokers in its Boston
office this month, including one who allegedly steered clients into
a company connected to his father. And now comes Dick Greene, an
icon in Boston's brokerage community.
</P>
<P>
   Greene spent 38 years at Merrill Lynch and retired without a
mark on his disciplinary record, a remarkable achievement in the
brokerage business. But now, in retirement, clients have come out
of the woodwork to complain that Greene put them in two stocks that
collapsed in the second half of 1998. At least seven clients have
filed complaints and more are expected to. Two clients each say
they lost $1 million; another client settled a $420,000 claim for
$25,000, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Greene was known for taking large positions in a
few stocks, and some of his clients are now charging that he had
their assets largely in the two stocks, Genesis Health Ventures
Inc. and IndyMac Mortgage Holdings Inc. Genesis, a nursing home
operator, was selling for $30 a share in early 1998, collapsed in
July, and is at $2.75 today. IndyMac, a real estate investment
trust, was at $27 early in 1998 before falling as low at $8 in a
tremendous one-day swoon in October; it is now at $11.50.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill says Greene's retirement at age 65 in December 1998 was
unrelated to the stocks' declines a few months earlier. Said Greene
in a statement Thursday: ``I, too, am disappointed by the
performance of these two stocks. Though I saw many ups and downs in
the market during my career, you never get used to significant
losses that occur when the unexpected happens.'' Neither he nor his
attorney, Gerald Rath, would comment further.
</P>
<P>
   The Greene case will turn on the narrow issues of whether the
investments were suitable for his clients and whether their
portfolios were overconcentrated. But more broadly his problems,
along with the other recent accidents at Merrill, have brought the
kind of attention that no brokerage house needs. The question, of
course, will be: Who's watching the store?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at their activities in a fairly comprehensive
way,'' says Secretary of State William Galvin.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a problem, no one has a greater stake in fixing it
than Merrill Lynch itself.

JONES DOESN'T SPREAD THE NEWS IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roy Jones chipped a tooth the day before he came to
New York. That may be the most damage he sustains in the next 48
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Jones will make history when he becomes the
first prize fighter to defend a world title inside Radio City Music
Hall, a place known for high kicks, not low blows. He is there to
put what he contends is the undisputed light heavyweight title on
the line against No. 2-rated David Telesco, a local Westchester
county fighter with some punching power but not much more than
that.
</P>
<P>
   The show has been sold out for weeks, the Hall's 5,700 seats
going quickly because the price was reasonable ($300 ringside) and
the moment historic. But did Jones's presence have much to do with
it?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but you'd never know it because Roy Jones knows
everything about the fights except how to sell one.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctant to fly and unwilling to spend one more day outside his
native Pensacola, Fla., than necessary, Jones did not arrive in
Manhattan until 1:40 p.m. Wednesday afternoon. Since he's not
fighting until tomorrow night that might not have been a problem
except that HBO and the promoter had scheduled a press conference
to hype Jones at noon. By the time he strolled in, the room at the
Hilton was filled with some mighty displeased journalists. Roy
Jones didn't seem to notice. The following morning, he didn't seem
to notice his name in too many newspapers, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy's a good guy but I can't defend him on this,'' said HBO
senior vice president for programming Lou DiBella about his
fighter's consistently late arrivals. ``He did a lot to make this
fight possible but he still can't bring himself to act
professionally (outside the ring). Oscar (De La Hoya) has never
been late to a press conference.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but then Oscar long ago figured out that punctuality and
salesmanship have as much to do with earning millions of dollars
above the norm in the fight game as does boxing ability. Jones,
however, still thinks it's only about what he'll do to Telesco, a
12-1 underdog. That thinking is why Jones will make a couple of
million for his fight and De La Hoya will make a couple million
more than that to fight Derrell Coley next month in New York, with
no title at stake and with an even less compelling opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the business of boxing, and Jones professes not to care
about that. At least not much, which is why he reportedly agreed to
bring the fight to Radio City for a million dollars less in site
fees than he could have gotten from the Grand Casino in Biloxi,
Miss., which for all intents and purposes is now his home field.
</P>
<P>
   If it were solely up to Jones, he would never fight beyond
Mississippi's Gulf Coast but although he is loath to admit it, he
has advisors and occasionally he listens them.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was he would come into the media capital of America and
increase his visibility with a round of interviews and appearances.
Instead he failed to make most of the New York dailies Thursday
because he was so late he was upstaged by a charming, young
heavyweight named Derrick Jefferson, who stole the press conference
with his humor and his honest stories about his days growing up in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   This week Jones lost the backpages of the tabloids and most of
the inside ones as well because of Bill Belichick's hearing at a
Manhattan law office that he hopes will free him from his contract
with the Jets and Bill Parcells's musings over whether or not he
will return as the Jets' head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Jones will get that big story Saturday, but so far he's
been upstaged even in the boxing headlines by Mike Tyson's battle
to get into England for his Jan. 29 fight with Julius Francis and
Jefferson's stories of street life in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't have to be this way for Jones, but it was said long
ago that 50 percent of success in life is showing up. Although he
did on Wednesday, he was 95 minutes late, and so he became an
afterthought even though he remains arguably the best fighter in
the world. It is a position he's used to.
</P>
<P>
   Slick and lethal in the ring, Jones is not the savviest guy when
it comes to marketing himself or his opponents. Admittedly, he is a
man trapped in a division that has no real competition and because
of that there are no Big Fights for him on the horizon or on his
resume unless he makes the mistake of challenging for the
heavyweight title against men twice his size.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite that dilemma, Jones repeatedly compounds that
problem by insulting the fitness of everyone he fights to be in the
same ring with him. That, like his broken watch, remained unchanged
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have trouble getting up for these kind of guys but it's
not a problem I haven't dealt with in the past,'' Jones said when
asked if he is tiring of facing non-entities like Telesco. Instead
of building him up as a dangerous puncher, which he is, Jones
simply said that was all Telesco had and dismissed him curtly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him once or twice,'' Jones said. ``He can't beat
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably so but Jones would be wise to talk up his opposition
instead of down to them and to stop refusing to make the closest
thing he has to a big fight, which would be to travel to Germany
and face one of several light heavyweights there such as undefeated
Darius Michalzewski, who continue to call him out. They may not be
fit challengers either but at least they look the part.
</P>
<P>
   That Jones couldn't care less about this is readily apparent.
That much of the sports world feels the same about him was just as
apparent if you stopped anyone in mid-town Manhattan this week and
asked if they knew that the pound-for-pound best boxer in the world
was fighting in New York this week.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them didn't know who Jones was. Most of the ones who
knew of the fight knew only that it was at Radio City, where no
fight had ever been before. Admittedly, this was a small and far
from scientific polling of America's sports fans, but what it
proved was that even when he's making history, Roy Jones remains in
the shadows.

NATIONAL CAMPAIGN AIMS AT DISPELLING STEREOTYPES

<P>
   BOSTON _ Professor Albert H. Yee calls it the Asian Stereotype:
If they are not typified as brilliant scholars, Asian people are
sometimes seen as secretive and conspiratorial.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Wen Ho Lee, says Yee. A former scientist at the
Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratory, Lee is awaiting trial on charges he
shared US nuclear secrets with China. But his staunchest supporters
insist he is being made a scapegoat because he was the only
Chinese-American who worked on nuclear secrets at the lab for 18
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the thing is that if people would just put aside the
rampant stereotypes of Asians and look at Asians that they know . .
. you go to school with them, you work with them,'' said Yee, a
retired professor who taught at universities in the United States
and east Asia.
</P>
<P>
   It is schools, in fact, that have the best chance to change what
a new generation of Americans learn and perceive about Asia, says
Charlotte Mason, a high school teacher. She is among those trying
to change how American students learn about the continent and
passing on her passion for the culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have relationships with Asia in the 21st
century and we don't have any teachers in the schools currently
trained to teach about it,'' said Mason, who teaches social studies
and special education in Newton, Mass. ``And we have school systems
recognizing the importance of education about Asia, but what are
they going to do about it?''
</P>
<P>
   Her zeal for Asian studies prompted the Asia Society _ a
non-profit group started by John D. Rockefeller III in 1956 to
promote Asian culture _ to appoint Mason to help oversee the
National Commission on Asia in the Schools.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 18 months, Mason and the commission are launching a
national lobbying campaign for better training of teachers of Asian
studies _ and for all educators to teach historically accurate
information about the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have Marco Polo as one of the most enduring figures of
Chinese history,'' said Namji Kim Steinemann of the New York-based
Asia Society. ``This is a teenage son of a Venetian trader who
happened to go along on a sales trip. He certainly is not the most
enduring figure of Chinese history, but the way we teach about it
in our textbooks, he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason studied South Asia and Bengali language in college, but it
was after visiting China and seeing the culture come alive that she
became committed to teaching about it.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Mason stood in front of her ninth-grade world
history class, horrifying many students when she held a pair of
four-inch cloth shoes in the palm of her hand. On a trip to China,
Mason, who is not Asian, bought them at a market. She initially
thought they were baby shoes; but they were the shoes of an adult
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more important to have small feet than a beautiful
face,'' Mason said, speaking of a thousand-year practice in China
of binding the feet of women to prevent them from growing. ``If you
were lucky, your toes would fall off. If not, you would continue to
be in excruciating pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the class watched part of a video by a Chinese filmmaker
interviewing women who suffered from the practice, outlawed in the
early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to say Chinese women bound their feet for thousands
of years, isn't that disgusting? But we forget the things we do to
ourselves,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This grosses them out,'' she said, still holding the shoes
after class, ``but plastic surgery doesn't? Well, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Asia Society say Mason is the kind of teacher
they want to see more of in the future: knowledgeable in the
culture, history, art and language of the 41 countries that combine
to form Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're proposing isn't that Asia-related education should
be taught at the expense of other subject matter,'' Steinemann
said. ``Asia is already being taught in schools, it's just not
being taught well.''
</P>
<P>
   She points to methods elementary teachers often use to introduce
new cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the lower grades, you might have a tendency to teach about
Asia through food, fun and festival. That's all good if you can
provide some context,'' she said. ``Teaching about Korea through
half-moon cakes trivializes these cultures . . . or teaching about
Japan through Origami. It's very much a part of Japanese culture,
but it stops there.''
</P>
<P>
   In Newton, students are exposed to the cultures of China, Ghana
and Mexico starting in the second grade. Sixth and seventh grade
see them learning of ancient China, the dynasties and inventions.
By high school, students are studying modern Chinese history and
ancient philosophies and can elect to take an Asia study course as
seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1985, about 40 students at Newton North have annually
traded places with Chinese students at a Beijing sister school.
Students spend four months at the Beijing Jingshan School, three
blocks east of the Forbidden City. Many teachers have taken the
trip as well.
</P>
<P>
   It is only with such widespread exposure to other cultures that
people become less discriminatory, say some.
</P>
<P>
   ``When most people think of Asia, I think a lot of people think
solely of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, now more so Vietnamese,'' said
Leverett Wing, a local Asian-American activist, who is a
fourth-generation, Chinese-American. ``I think a lot of people are
unaware of the amazingly heterogeneous nature of the Asian
community.''
</P>
<P>
   And, said Wing, stereotypes still abound. A popular one, he
said, is that all Asians are Buddhist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Christmastime and someone walks up to me and I say `Merry
Christmas.' They just looked at me and said, `Well how do you
Buddists celebrate?' And I think my exact response was, `Well, I'm
going to go to midnight Mass' and he asked, `Why would you go to
midnight Mass?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Asia Society hopes teachers and textbooks are the key to
correcting such misconceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this global society, we really need to think about what our
kids are learning in the short time they have available and ensure
that time is well spent,'' Steinemann said. ``That's the best
hope.''

WHAT CHRISTINA AGUILERA WANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Christina Aguilera is holed up in a hotel room in Los Angeles
_ just a girl, a telephone, and a gaggle of handlers carving up the
day into 10-minute chunks of conversation with strangers. ``Oh, I
don't mind,'' says the audibly wilted but unfailingly polite
19-year-old of the rigors of the press circuit. Aguilera's sudden
and massive stardom is, after all, something she's been aiming for
since she made her national television debut on ``Star Search'' at
the age of 9.
</P>
<P>
   Only six months ago, Aguilera was a lesser-known teen singer,
one more ``Mickey Mouse Club'' alumna who had won attention for her
lovely rendering of ``Reflection'' on the ``Mulan'' soundtrack.
Then last summer ``Genie in a Bottle,'' the first single from her
debut, which has since sold 5 million copies, came out. It
catapulted Aguilera to the top of the Billboard charts, where the
single lodged for five weeks. Her new single, ``What a Girl
Wants,'' just knocked Santana's ``Smooth'' out of the top spot. And
the crowning achievement of a whirlwind half-year came last week
when Auguilera was nominated for two Grammy awards: Best New Artist
and Best Female Pop Vocal. She performs at the FleetCenter on
Thursday, with fellow Grammy nomi-
</P>
<P>
   nees TLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so thrilled,'' she says of the nominations, and despite
her weariness _ Aguilera is speaking in a voice as small as her
singing is large _ it's clear she's not just paying lip service.
``I had no idea. People around me were saying it would happen, but
I'd only had one single out. I was not expecting this at all.''
</P>
<P>
   She has, however, been greasing the wheels for most of her life.
Born on Staten Island and raised near Pittsburgh by her mother and
grandmother after her parents split up, Aguilera listened
incessantly to her favorite singers, ``the great vocalists'' as she
calls them: Etta James, Billie Holiday, Barbra Streisand, and
contemporary powerhouses Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. As a
precocious grade-schooler she was in demand as a National Anthem
performer at professional sporting events in and around Pittsburgh.
At 12, Auguilera went to Orlando to join the cast of ``The Mickey
Mouse Club.'' High-powered manager Steve Kurtz discovered her as a
Mouseketeer (alongside Britney Spears, Keri Russell, and members of
'N Sync) and offered to shepherd her career. In 1998, in a
remarkable display of faith in an untested artist, RCA signed her
to a seven-album contract. Aguilera was 17.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't want to release ``Genie in a Bottle'' as a single.
``Hearing that song in the first stages, it didn't let me go places
vocally. It sounded very Top 40 to me, very pop-driven, all about a
cool hook and melody. It fit too much into what was going on in
pop, and I wanted to be different. I never wanted to be a straight
pop singer.'' Indeed, the rest of the album is filled with songs
that display her striking range and power as a singer of R &AMP; B,
pop-soul, and ballads.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she is being positioned as a teen pinup (undoubtedly part of
RCA's plan to maximize the return on its hefty investment), and she
knows it. ``This one is the most pop-sounding album I will ever
do,'' declares Aguilera, who says that blues is her number one
favorite style. ``I definitely want to take it to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   She plans to record ``At Last,'' an Etta James tune, for a
hidden track on her sophomore CD and is eager to start writing
herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got songs from some great writers for this album,''
Aguilera says, including hitmeister Diane Warren, who is already on
board for the next album. ``But I want to write more about
experiences I've gone through. I've gone through bad situations. I
come from a divorced home. I've been around abuse. I've lived a
different life, been on the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends, Aguilera says, resented her success and were in short
supply as her career blossomed. ``But I turned negative situations
into positives by putting all my focus and energy into music. I was
always a deep thinker, an introverted person, to the point where
music was an escape.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, Aguilera will release a Spanish-language CD. Her
father, with whom she has no contact, is Ecuadoran, and Aguilera
wants to rediscover her Latin roots. Also, ``it makes my
grandparents happy,'' she says. Although it's not her intention,
that album should help distinguish Aguilera from the bevy of teen
sensations who appeared on the scene last year: Britney Spears,
Jessica Simpson, and Mandy Moore _ all blond teenagers with
dance-pop records. It's a phenomenon that Aguilera accepts, but
it's still disconcerting to her. ``It's so weird that we all came
out at the same time, and yeah, it's a little frustrating to
constantly get compared. We're all so very different,'' she says,
careful to point out in well-rehearsed tones that ``it doesn't take
away from what I think of them. They're all so talented.''
</P>
<P>
   More accurately, Aguilera is so very different _ far and away
the most gifted vocalist of the bunch. ``People,'' she says, ``will
see (the differences) as time goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she is busy learning to navigate a world where
``everyone wants a piece of you. Good and bad. They either want to
put you down or talk to you. All these people are pulling, just
pulling on you.''
</P>
<P>
   She's constantly on the road. And as for dating?
</P>
<P>
   ``No time,'' Aguilera says. ``It's sort of sad. I see these
gorgeous guys in the audience and would love to get to know them.
But I'm off to the next airplane.'' Still, like any red-blooded
teenager, she is prone to crushes. Her latest? Limp Bizkit singer
Fred Durst. But with a schedule as hectic as hers, Aguilera says,
``I'm lucky if I get to see a movie. Alone.''

MARINO LEAVES MIAMI IN THROES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it ends this weekend, at least it will be in Florida, where
it all began.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Marino may well be the greatest passer the National Football
League has ever seen, but what is clearest about him now is that
his time has past. He is not very often the Marino he once was. Not
often the most feared passer in football.
</P>
<P>
   But last Sunday _ for two drives and maybe for old time's sake _
Marino was all that once again, and that is why the Dolphins will
travel to Jacksonville to meet the heavily-favored Jaguars Saturday
in the second round of the AFC playoffs. An upset there and Marino
will be in the conference championship game for the first time in
seven years, one game away from seeking the only prize in pro
football that has eluded him: a Super Bowl ring.
</P>
<P>
   At 38, that is all Marino has left to play for. He has already
thrown more passes (8,358 in regular season) than anyone in
football history. He has already completed more of them, too
(4,967). He has already passed for more yards (61,361) than anyone
in football history, nearly 10,000 ahead of longtime rival John
Elway. He has already thrown more touchdown passes (420), too.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the lion is in winter now, and the clearest measure of that
is another, simpler stat. Marino has had just 32
sub-50-percent-completion games in his 17-year career. Three of
them, nearly 10 percent of the total, came this season. The
Dolphins won only 10 of those games. They lost all three this
season.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the years the Dolphins and Marino have been linked,
the one long relied on the other to bring it victory. Although he
does that less often now, he did it again last Sunday in Seattle,
not by throwing often but by throwing well when needed most.
Throwing well when he completed six straight passes to open the
second half of a wild-card playoff game with a touchdown drive that
gave his team some life and throwing better still when he completed
4 of 6 throws for 82 yards to set up what ended up being the
winning touchdown with 4:48 to play in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 37th time Marino had led the Dolphins to a
come-from-behind, fourth-quarter victory. It may be the last or it
may not. That will be up to the Jaguars more than it is up to
Marino, because that is how it goes now for him much of the time.
</P>
<P>
   His arm is not what it used to be since a bulging disk in his
neck weakened it earlier this season and forced him to the sideline
with the fear, he now admits, that he might never throw like his
old self again.
</P>
<P>
   Marino's replacement, Damon Huard, went 5-1 during that stretch
and declared himself the future in Miami. But when Marino was
healthy, he returned to the lineup with the belief nothing had
changed. He was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Some around the NFL now say in almost funeral tones, that during
that layoff Marino lost more than arm strength. They say he lost
his nerve. They whisper that too often now he seems to have the
yips, making critical throwing errors that put his team in trouble.
They note that the Dolphins committed 19 turnovers in their final
six games, going 1-5 because of it. Twelve of those were
interceptions and three of those interceptions were returned for
touchdowns. They are the kind of lapses the young Marino seldom
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   In 17 years, Marino has had one season when he threw more
interceptions than touchdown passes. That year was 1999 (12 to 17)
and those turnovers were critical in the season's final weeks when
the Dolphins lost five of six games to blow the advantages of a
fast start. They barely snuck into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Miami is still alive today, and so is Marino's career after
leading the Dolphins to their first playoff road victory in 28
years last Sunday. Despite speculation of impending retirement and
a supposed on-going feud with coach Jimmy Johnson, Marino showed
one more time that when he is on, it is still the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   The receivers aren't as good as the ones he used to have, and
neither is he. They are not in the same league with Mark Clayton
and Mark Duper, and he is not in the same league with the real Dan
Marino. But they are good enough when he is good enough, and they
both know it. His receivers know it, and the rest of his teammates
know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only Dan could have thrown some of those passes,'' said Miami
middle linebacker Zach Thomas, after Marino's 23-yard completion on
third-and-17 from his own 8 started Miami rolling toward the
winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Marino spent the first half handing off and the
second half completing 12 of 21 for 168 yards and a touchdown plus
leading his team to the game-winning score by accounting for 82
yards in an 85-yard touchdown drive. In the end, at least for that
one game, he was Dan Marino the way he used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every guy gave everything he had to win this game,''
Seattle defensive end Phillip Daniels said after Marino had beaten
his Seahawks, 20-17. ``You never know which Marino is going to show
up. The right one showed up for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The right one? The real one? The one who used to be? Hard to say
what Dan Marino is anymore. Or at least what he will be come in
Jacksonville. But whatever he is in his next game, which he knows
could be his last, everyone around Marino knows who he really is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best quarterback of all time,'' Thomas said. ``He
plays well when it counts. We all believe in Dan.''
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, they should.

`BARGAINING CHIP' POLICY ON CAPTIVES ASSAILED IN ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV _ Hasan Hijazi has spent nearly half of his life behind
bars in Israel, prisoner of a high-stakes battle for release of an
Israeli Air Force navigator captured in Lebanon nearly 14 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   It does not matter that Hijazi, who was 15-years-old when
Israeli soldiers picked him up in south Lebanon in 1986, never met
Israeli Air Force navigator Ron Arad, who was captured by a Shiite
Muslim guerrilla group in south Lebanon the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it matter that Hijazi, now 28, long ago served a
three-year prison sentence for membership in the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, a Shiite group fighting Israel's occupation of south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Hijazi is what Israel's Supreme Court has called a ``bargaining
chip,'' one of 16 citizens of Lebanon who were held by Israel in
the hope that they could be traded for Arad or other Israeli
soldiers missing in the course of Israel's nearly 20 year
occupation of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 men _ some detained in Lebanon by Israeli soldiers,
others handed over by pro-Israeli Lebanese militia _ were held for
up to 14 years in Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Some were tried for links to guerrilla groups fighting Israel
but were not released after completing their sentences. Others were
never charged. One man, Ghassan Dirani, a bank clerk on his way to
the United States when he was detained in Beirut by a Christian
Lebanese militia, has been diagnosed by Israeli doctors as mentally
ill, according to human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Holding these men is a controversial policy that is shrouded
behind court-imposed and state secrecy. Little is known about the
detainees, who have limited contact with the outside world and are
not allowed to be photographed by the media.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to seize the men was made after years of failed
attempts to negotiate for the release of soldiers who went missing
during and after Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. It was seen at
the time as a way to pressure forces in Iran, Syria, and Lebanon to
free Israeli soldiers captured dead or alive.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a decade later, questions are being raised about
the effectiveness and legality of such actions, and the issue is
under appeal before Israel's Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's call the baby by its right name, they are hostages and
international law forbids holding hostages,'' said Zvi Rish, the
Israeli lawyer fighting for the release of the Shiite Muslim
detainees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking hostages is like a terrorist act and Israel condemns
terrorists for taking hostages, then at the same time Israel is
using the same method,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government has argued before the Supreme Court that holding
foreign nationals is justified because it may help win the release
of Israeli soldiers held by enemy forces.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago the high court, in a 2-1 decision on an appeal
filed by Rish, sided with the state. The court ruled that it was
legitimate to hold people as ``bargaining chips'' given the goal of
freeing Israelis held captive outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is now in front of the full panel of nine high court
justices. The court had promised to issue a decision by the end of
December, but last week the state presented new evidence _ at a
hearing closed to the media and Rish _ to back its position that
the detentions are legal and justified.
</P>
<P>
   About a week before the hearing, five of the original 21
detainees were secretly flown to freedom, sparking speculation in
the Israeli media that the release was tied to the resumption of
peace talks with Syria and new information about missing soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   But human rights activists say the release of the five, while a
welcome move, does not overcome the general problem that Israel is
holding people to trade them for other people held captive.
Dismissing Israel's legal justifications, human rights activists
say the policy runs counter to international conventions signed by
Israel and basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking hostages for any purpose, no matter how worthy, is the
method used by terrorist organizations, not by modern
democracies,'' the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem wrote in a
report issued this month.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli supporters of the policy say their country must do what
it can to protect itself and the lives of its soldiers, even if
some of the actions might seem unjust or distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair but it's more unfair (for enemy groups) not to
give information to Israel about prisoners in Lebanon,'' said
Gideon Ezra, former deputy head of the Shin Bet internal security
and a Likud member of parliament
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not lucky because we are surrounded by countries that
are not so democratic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether or not Israel should resort to holding
even Hezbollah rebels as ``bargaining chips'' is not something that
has been widely debated here.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that in a country where almost every Jewish
citizen has either been a soldier or is related to one, saving
soldiers lives is seen as an act of paramount importance.
</P>
<P>
   There is also little sympathy for the detainees, said to have
been supporters or members of groups fighting Israel.
</P>
<P>
   One of the detainees is Mustafa Dirani, who split from the Amal
group that captured Arad and took the Israeli soldier with him. In
1989, after holding Arad in harsh conditions, Dirani reportedly
gave the Israeli airman to the commander of the Iranian
Revolutionary Guards in Lebanon. If Arad, who has a teenage
daughter, is still alive, he would be 41.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, few Israelis really know much about the Lebanese
detainees. At various times Israel has denied holding them. Court
rulings have been held back from publication. Even the true number
of detainees was only officially released a few weeks ago by the
Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to make sense at the time,'' said Gerald Steinberg,
a professor of political science at Bar-Ilan University outside Tel
Aviv. ``When Ron Arad or when somebody is shot down and taken
prisoner, there's a moral obligation to the soldier and his family
to do everything to rescue him.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Yakir, a lawyer with the Association for Civil Rights in
Israel, said the issue should be viewed in strict moral and legal
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I too am concerned about our missing soldiers, and everything
must be done to get them back,'' he said. ``But this is a clear
violation of morals, of international law, and of Israeli law.''

EVERETT NONCOMMITTAL ABOUT HIS SOX FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Almost a month to the day that the Red Sox acquired
Carl Everett from the Houston Astros, their new center fielder
showed up in Boston Thursday for introductions. He left the
impression that he also may take his time deciding whether he wants
to make a long-term commitment to the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I can't count anything out,'' said Everett, who
took off his rust-colored suit jacket to model a Red Sox jersey for
the cameras, then made his first public appearance at the baseball
writers dinner, where he was warmly received. ``I'll weigh all my
options, explore them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to sit here and say I'm boogieing after a year.
I'm the type of guy, I go with the flow. I'm not a demanding type
of guy, but I weigh everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett's agent, Larry Reynolds, said Everett's intentions might
take on more clarity after he sat down for his first negotiating
session with Sox general manager Dan Duquette, who gave up top
shortstop prospect Adam Everett and Single A pitcher Greg Miller
for the 28-year-old switch hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who was paid $2.8 million by the Astros last season,
can expect to at least double that salary if he exercises his right
to salary arbitration, after a season in which he batted .325, hit
25 home runs, stole 27 bases, and drove in 108 runs.
</P>
<P>
   But with Everett eligible for free agency after next season,
Duquette has said he would like to lock up Everett long-term, as he
did with Pedro Martinez after trading for his righthanded ace under
similar circumstances two years ago. A long-term deal in the
four-to-five year range presumably would cost the Sox in the
neighborhood of $40 million, and that may be conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Everett acknowledged he was caught off-guard when the
division-winning Astros, who claim to be in a money crunch, traded
him. ``My initial reaction was like, `Wow,' '' said Everett. ``I
didn't expect it simply because of the year I had.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's baseball. I look at the business side of it. I take
it in stride.''
</P>
<P>
   But Everett, who got his first chance to play every day with the
Astros, clearly enjoyed Houston, which he said reminded him of his
native Tampa. ``Off the field, I have a real soft personality,'' he
said. ``I like to fish. I'm a real `green' kind of guy. I'm an
outdoor type of person.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett hasn't played in the American League _ he originally was
a No. 1 pick of the Yankees (1990), but was taken by the Marlins in
the 1992 expansion draft and later was traded to the Mets and
subsequently the Astros. But he once roomed with Troy O'Leary in
winter ball in Puerto Rico, was a teammate of Bret Saberhagen on
the Mets, and faced Pedro Martinez in the National League. He
already feels an affinity for the Sox, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the options you have to weigh is, `is it a good fit?'
'' Everett said. ``I'm quite sure, from the teammates I see here,
that they want to win. I want to be on a team that wants to win,
and looking at this team, I see that. To me, I fit in already with
the attitude this team has. That's on the plus side of the whole
thing . . . I don't see any fear in anyone. That's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox also are getting an assist in Tampa from one of
Everett's buddies, whose mother lives here. The friend has been
selling him on the virtues of life here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Red Sox fan again,'' Everett said. ``Ever since the
Buckner game (he'd lapsed), but he said `I'm rejuvenated now that
you're here.' He told me that I'm going to love it here, even
though I don't eat seafood. He said it's not what everybody
perceived it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not a reference, Everett said, to Boston's reputation
for not being the most hospitable place for African-American
athletes, but to the intensity of scrutiny athletes receive here.
He was asked about the allegations of child abuse that were brought
against him and his wife, Linda. The charges were subsequently
dropped by a Family Court judge, who ruled that Linda Everett
inflicted ``excessive corporal punishment'' on their two children
and the player did little to stop her. The children, who were
placed in foster care for a time, are back in the custody of their
parents, said Everett, whose wife has given birth to two more
children since.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's three years old _ it's a dead issue,'' Everett said.
``There's nothing to worry about. My kids are here. Other than
that, everything is dead. Just leave it there, and play ball. To
me, it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams said he has not yet decided where Everett
will fit in the middle of the Sox order. Everett is expected either
to hit in the No. 3 hole, ahead of Nomar Garciaparra, or cleanup,
behind the Sox shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like our options a lot,'' Williams said. ``A switch hitter
with power. I'm not a numbers guy, but at times you have to look at
the numbers, and you see with what Carl hit, he brings an awful lot
to the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to hit with guys on base. He likes to be in the box
when those base runners mean something . . . I think that's big. He
understands how to win, what it means to win, because of where he
comes from.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can teach that, or how you learn it, but
you can see he has it. You can't touch it, but you can see it and
feel it.''

MR. DOTCOMGUY JUST LIVES FOR THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about a gimmick. An unassuming fellow in Dallas decides to
lock himself up in an empty house for a year, just one man and a
computer. He can graze in the backyard, but other than that, he's
not allowed to leave for 366 days (remember, this is leap year).
Poor fellow. He can't go out to get a smoothie from 7-Eleven, one
of his favorite activities. But he can use the Internet and a
seemingly unlimited budget to bring in food, clothes, furniture, a
personal trainer, a decorator, musical entertainers _ you know, all
the essentials.
</P>
<P>
   Meet DotComGuy, 26, the wired world's version of P.T. Barnum.
His birth name is Mitch Maddox, but he changed it legally before
moving into what he refers to as the Dotcompound (what else?) on
Jan. 1. He says he's trying to prove that man can survive on
e-commerce alone. So what if he sells a few million ads on the
site? Remember, this is a sociological study conducted by a guy who
reminds us that he is ``blessed with an extremely high IQ, a dry
humor, and a personal demeanor.'' And you, too, can participate.
The whole world is invited to watch DotComGuy's every breathing
moment Webcast live on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sound like a cure for insomnia? The next best thing to C-Span?
Plenty of journalists have tried similar experiments for a week or
so, and their published accounts have had an unintended narcotic
effect. But oddly enough, www.dotcomguy.com has attracted a cult
following, with 150,000 unique visitors a day. He's had marriage
proposals. Some folks tune in for hours; others have said they need
DotComGuy detox.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the appeal? We needed to know. ``Gosh, this has struck
a nerve bigger than we expected,'' he says when he answers the
phone in the kitchen. Remember, talking to the guy can be a surreal
experience; you can see exactly what he's doing on the Webcam on
his site, which films him from 12 different camera angles. First,
he puts you on the speaker phone and introduces you to the
``viewers,'' then he paces around the house during the
conversation. There you are asking brilliant questions about the
meaning of life, and he's putting strawberries on a chocolate cake.
A viewer gave him the recipe, of course.
</P>
<P>
   His project has been compared to ``The Truman Show'' and ``Ed
TV,'' but the guy himself rejects the comparision. ``This is
real,'' he says, strolling out to the patio. ``This isn't TV. This
is real life. This isn't a soap opera where every day there is a
twist and turn. It's showing that there are real people out there,
just like them, unlike television where everything is so unreal and
no one can relate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic, it's not. See DotComGuy surf the Net. See him buy a
couch. See him hang out with his friend Blaine Twilley, who already
has his own fan club. See him lift weights. See his hair grow.
</P>
<P>
   But DotComGuy says, gosh, he is having the most exciting year of
his life. A band played in his living room the other night, and
tonight he's going to have a slumber party with some of his
buddies. The other day, he didn't have a pen, so the folks in the
chat room took notes as he made a shopping list, and when he later
found a writing implement, they reconstructed his list.
</P>
<P>
   The goal on the Internet is to attract ``eyeballs'' that
``stick'' to a site. And those eyeballs are always there, watching
his every move on the Webcam and deconstructing the minutiae of his
existence in the chat room, which is full 24 hours a day. When the
viewers don't like an interviewer, they make comments like, ``She's
not the next Barbara Walters.'' When UPS makes a delivery, they
guess what's in the box.
</P>
<P>
   Now certainly, Webcams are nothing new. Remember the Jennycam?
And it's certainly no big deal to live off e-commerce _ folks have
been banking, grocery shopping, and even buying bathing suits on
line for years. DotComGuy admits that, but he contends he can teach
valuable lessons about the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Like what? Gosh, maybe he'll teach the viewers how to look up
this very article in the Globe, he explains. He's providing a
service, he continues, for ``people who have disabilities that
cause them to be in my situation where they cannot leave the house.
They're so excited. This is showing that they can live a normal
life and be productive.''
</P>
<P>
   But, DotComGuy, most folks don't have unlimited budgets. Most
folks can't just log onto the Net and order up a storm. Most folks
don't generate revenue from selling banner ads. ``Oh gosh, sure,
definitely,'' he says. But just in case people are interested, he
wants them to know they can tune in to watch his personal trainings
sessions every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. And he wants to say
hello to all the folks in Boston. The folks in the chat room send
their regards, too.

HARVARD FIELDS A START-UP IN SILICON VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Tucked among the high-flying venture
capitalists sitting on fabled Sand Hill Road is a sliver of
crimson, a tiny outpost from New England run by Harvard Business
School.
</P>
<P>
   More than just a representation of Harvard's efforts to gain a
toehold in the new economy, its office here in the heart of Silicon
Valley is an acknowledgment that the ascendancy of so-called
``dot-com'' companies is reshaping business education, not just at
Harvard but at business schools around the country.
</P>
<P>
   It is here, in an unassuming three-room office, that two
graduates of the school write case studies on Silicon Valley
companies, cases that help Harvard and other business schools to
make the transition from being factories that churn out consultants
and captains of industry to incubators for entrepreneurs wise in
the ways of risk-taking start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed there were things happening in Silicon Valley that
were the microcosm of the future,'' said Kim Clark, dean of the
Harvard Business School. ``We believe we needed to build the human
capacity and the organizational capability to tap into that
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Called the California Research Center, the outpost does more
than produce case studies. Along with the school's alumni club, it
also acts as Harvard Business School's hub on the West Coast, a
networking vehicle for 3,500 graduates in the Bay Area and a place
for students and newly minted graduates to seek jobs, advice on how
to start a company or establish connections.
</P>
<P>
   Its mainstay, however, is creating a new generation of cases
that help Harvard update its curriculum to fit the technological
age. Since opening in the summer of 1997, the center's two writers,
Christina Darwall and Nicole Tempest, have produced 48 case
studies, many of which have been disseminated to dozens of business
schools around the world. This year, their dance card is already
filled with 25 cases, and professors now must wait until next year
to add new ones to the list.
</P>
<P>
   The Silicon Valley cases have been used by 70 out of the 200
faculty members at the business school to teach everything from
finance to management theory, in addition to entrepreneurship. ``It
has cut across all sorts of other areas of the curriculum,'' said
Clark, who along with William Sahlman, a Harvard professor of
entrepreneurship, helped set up the center. ``It's effects are
beyond our wildest imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the cases have been mined from the school's formidable
network of alumni, who are ensconced in the top echelons of
companies from eBay Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. to Intel Corp. and
Hewlett-Packard Co. At eBay, for example, Harvard featured Meg
Whitman, the on-line auction company's chief executive and a 1979
graduate of the business school, as the ``protagonist'' in a case
study on the San Jose, Calif. company's libertarian culture.
</P>
<P>
   In general, however, the center is ecumenical in its search for
cases, which feature executives of all stripes, as long as they
demonstrate some key business lesson that can generate discussion
in a classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Running between 15 to 30 pages long, each case is written by a
professor and the center's case writers, Darwall and Tempest. Ideas
can be generated by Darwall and Tempest, both of whom have
connections in the Bay Area from prior jobs, or by professors. The
cases often present real-world dilemmas that require students to
debate various courses of action _ whether to take on additional
business partners, what types of financing to pursue, or when to go
for an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any case should meet at least two objectives,'' said Michael
J. Roberts, senior lecturer at the business school who helped
shepherd the center in its early formation. ``It should capture
what is unique about Silicon Valley, and it should give students
analytical tools and skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the cases feature graduates of Harvard Business School
who have gone on to create companies, an increasingly common path.
``We like it when students pick up the case and they can see
themselves in the protagonist's shoes,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   The center's executive director, Darwall, lists one additional
ingredient in a good case study: tension. Indeed, several of the
cases are rather candid about the shortcomings of the companies
being featured. ``A good case has to have tension, and we make sure
people know that up front,'' said Darwall, who spent the last 25
years in Silicon Valley after graduating from Harvard Business
School in 1975. ``These are not promotional puff pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies, however, get to have final say over whether a case is
released, an option that makes protagonists more forthcoming in the
interviewing process, said Tempest, associate director of the
center. In a way, Silicon Valley's quirky culture makes it easier
for Darwall and Tempest to write cases that illustrate business
failures, which are seen here as something of a badge of honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies here are moving so fast that after three or six
months, it's history. People have moved on,'' said Darwall, who
cofounded a high-tech startup in the mid-1980s. ``Companies are not
at all nervous about water under the bridge, and out here, those
are things that happened two months ago! But for us, it's fresh,
and students love the timeliness.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Meceda, whose Internet startup's demise in 1997 was disected
several months later in a 1998 case study, was undiminished by the
experience. ``You rarely ever get the opportunity to look backwards
and see what you've learned,'' said Meceda, 28, who sometimes
travels to Harvard to participate in the class discussion of her
case. ``To spend time thinking about about why we made the
decisions that we did was extremely interesting to me. I got more
out of the experience that way.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, the fame garnered from being a Harvard case is
another reward. ``You get a fair degree of notoriety from being in
a case study, and as a start-up, notoriety is good,'' said David
Perry, chief executive and founder of Chemdex.com, an on-line
marketplace for specialty chemicals based in Mountain View, Calif.
``We were struggling for attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry, a 1997 Harvard Business School graduate, said that while
Harvard came a bit late to the Silicon Valley party, the school is
catching on fast. ``Harvard Business School got a late start on
Silicon Valley,'' Perry said. ``If Harvard is to remain on the
edge, they know they've got to have a tight link with Silicon
Valley. It's not a nice-to-have. It's a must-do.''
</P>
<P>
   Others note that the center pulls together many of the school's
resources to create a window on Silicon Valley, what some consider
the world's greatest center of innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I find amazing is how incredibly strong their network is.
They can pick up the alumni directory and call just about anyone
and get a return call back,'' said Randy Komisar, an Internet
entrepreneur who has worked with the center on several case
studies. ``It's a powerful network, and the center is a node, a
place to crystalize their network in the Valley.''

ORCHESTRA MORPHINE CARRIES ON TRIO'S LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sunlight streams through the windows of Mark Sandman's
fifth-story loft in Cambridge, Mass., where the remaining members
of his band, Morphine, are rehearsing in his memory. Sandman died
on stage in Italy last summer, but Dana Colley and Billy Conway are
determined to keep his songs alive, and have gathered their friends
and allies into a new group, Orchestra Morphine, which aims to do
just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the fans who followed this group over the years, it's
important to say goodbye and get some closure,'' says Colley, the
baritone saxophonist who helped define Morphine's unique sound,
dubbed ``low rock'' and ``noir jazz-rock,'' during the course of
five albums in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   A sixth is on the way _ an inspired disc called ``The Night,''
finished shortly before Sandman's July 3 death from a heart attack
at a festival at the Giardini del Principe in Palestrina, just east
of Rome. The new songs _ due Feb. 1 on the giant Dreamworks label _
are quintessential Sandman, featuring late-night poetics and a
funky amalgam of styles that summon comparisons to Tom Waits and
Allen Ginsberg rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   The music was created in this same studio loft _ named the High
`N Dry Studio, though it's anything but high and dry in the way
that instruments and recording gear are spread all over the
spacious, exposed-brick room, which looks out on the Boston
skyline. Morphine posters adorn one corner, while a kind of Sandman
altar is in another, with pictures of him surrounded by
memorabilia, including his odd-looking single-string guitar.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun poured in this week, Orchestra Morphine powerfully
played several tunes from the album, topped by the rollicking ``A
Good Woman Is Hard to Find,'' given fresh energy from having nine
players in the band, as opposed to the three in Morphine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic that Morphine was so stripped down, and this band
is so overloaded,'' says saxophonist Russ Gershon. ``But maybe this
is a good thing, because if it was stripped-down, there would be
too many comparisons, and that would be unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard without Mark, but what can you do?'' says bassist
Mike Rivard. ``Yet it's a great bunch of songs and they deserve to
be played.''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, the hope is to return this summer to the same
festival in Italy where Sandman died, as a way of repaying festival
sponsors for the kindness shown during last year's tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking it one step at a time,'' says Colley when asked
if the group will continue beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want people to hear this music,'' says Conway,
Morphine's drummer. ``It's sad that Mark died _ and the sadness is
a pervasive thing _ but there's light in performing these songs.
It's the place where we find new health.''
</P>
<P>
   Orchestra Morphine is an all-star group. Apart from Colley and
Conway, there is Gershon (Sandman's colleague in their side group,
the Hypnosonics), Rivard (who runs the Club d'Elf jam nights around
town), trumpeter Tom Halter, singers Laurie Sargent (originally
with Face to Face) and Christian McNeill (with Hybrasil), drummer
Jerome Dupree (Morphine's original drummer), and keyboardist Evan
Harriman (from the Immortals).
</P>
<P>
   A smaller group of these same musicians was in Moveable Bubble,
which played two memorial tributes to Sandman last year. The group
kept growing, until it became Orchestra Morphine, in which many
members will sing Sandman's songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one person who can take the place of Mark,'' says
Colley. ``We'll have different singers so there's no pressure on
just one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The group will play some older Morphine and Hypnosonics tunes
but focus on the new album _ which is more orchestrated than past
Morphine CDs, so the increased size makes sense. It boasts a number
of guests (from cellist Jane Scarpantoni to Cambridge's Mr.
Airplane Man) and some exquisite numbers in the up-tempo ``Top
Floor, Bottom Buzzer'' (about finding a party across town), the
drawling love song ``Like a Mirror'' (``I'm like a mirror/I'm
nothing until you look at me''), the title track ``The Night'' (in
which Sandman describes a potential lover: ``you're a folk tale,
the unexplainable''), and the sexy, Middle Eastern-sounding ``Rope
on Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandman is gone, but his music is living on.
</P>
<P>
   A Morphine documentary will be shot this year, followed by a
live album released in July, ``Live in St. Andrews Hall,'' recorded
in Detroit in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Duke Ellington and Count Basie passed away, their bands
continued to do their songs,'' says Colley. ``So this is nothing
new _ and we intend to do that with Mark's songs. He left a great
legacy.''

HOT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, BUT AN ICEBERG IN IOWA? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1984 in a Houston beer garden, Texas wiseacre Jim Hightower
gave one of the best introductions to one of the unluckiest
presidential candidates of all time. ``Here he is,'' thundered Jim,
``He's hotter than high school love!''
</P>
<P>
   Saying your guy is hot, and having your guy cooking at a high
temp are two very different items. But getting hot at the right
time is every candidate's fantasy. Just as chilling at the wrong
juncture can send your crusade into the deep freeze. Which brings
us to the fate of Senator John McCain. By any measure, the Arizona
Republican is the hottest commodity on the campaign trail, coming
farthest from furthest back.
</P>
<P>
   Of the dozen Republicans who began, he's chin-to-chin against
Texan George W. Bush in New Hampshire, just 18 days out. But Iowa
Republicans caucus in 10 days, and McCain's hottest hopes for New
Hampshire risk clipping an Iowa iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa is tough territory for McCain. He has opposed ethanol
subsidies, the gift of tax dollars to Iowa corn growers to make
fuel. Because that's one of the pork outrages McCain targets, it's
all uphill for McCain in Iowa's 99 counties. It is conceivable that
the feisty Arizonan, who has not campaigned hard there, could run
fourth when the Monday night caucus attendees choose up sides,
behind Bush, Steve Forbes, and maybe even Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the lopsided front-runner everywhere but New Hampshire.
Forbes, who spent $300 a head to finish second in last summer's
Ames, Iowa, straw poll, can buy his way into a distant second.
Bauer has the God Squad going for him, the antiabortion zealots of
Iowa's robust Christian Right, whose small but cohesive numbers are
exaggerated in the easily manipulable caucus format.
</P>
<P>
   So where does that leave McCain with New Hampshire voting eight
days later? Possibly up the creek, if the same thing happens to him
as happened to another military hero, former Ohio Senator John
Glenn in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Walter Mondale won Iowa going away, but Glenn fared
poorly out there. Gary Hart, who finished a distant second to
Mondale with barely 15 percent of the caucus votes, roared into New
Hampshire and clobbered Mondale eight days later.
</P>
<P>
   Half of Glenn's New Hampshire support bled off to Hart, who had
overnight become the stop-Mondale candidate. New Hampshire is
fluid, and Granite State voters are shrewd and sophisticated about
sending the message they most want sent. Eight years ago, their
message was President Bush was in trouble, and the centrist dogma
of Paul Tsongas and Bill Clinton was Oem, just fix the
economy, stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, it was Pat Buchanan's turn to ride the wave.
This year, I suspect, the message might have something to do with
corruption and chicanery and character, or perceived lack thereof,
in D.C.
</P>
<P>
   So who's the messenger New Hampshire will select? I've argued
here that the messenger will be McCain or Bill Bradley, the two
campaign finance critics who have prospered by being critical of
business-as-usual. And you've heard me suggest that it is the
independent bloc of unenrolled voters who can vote in either
primary who will tilt the outcome in both party races. If McCain
outduels Bradley for the lion's share of the independents, McCain
might outlast Bush in New Hampshire. But if Bradley cops the
independent vote over McCain, that could enable Dollar Bill to nose
out Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   There's a synergy to campaigns, just as there is to business
mergers or high school love; what happens elsewhere affects the
relationship. And if Bradley runs a close or even respectable
second to Gore in Iowa's caucuses, while at the same time McCain
runs a poor third or a lousy fourth, New Hampshire voters have a
week to make their choice:
</P>
<P>
   Who's the better messenger on campaign finance reform and
business as usual? McCain or Bradley? Because one of those two
aspires to become the Gary Hart of 2000. For my money, the gutsy
McCain has more of a claim to being the real deal than Bradley, who
was a backbencher in the Senate, who virtually disappeared in the
last of his three six-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else you may think of Jarrin' Jawn, he's no MIA.
Neither Bradley nor McCain has much of a shot at actually getting
nominated because Gore and Bush are way ahead elsewhere. Both tried
to inoculate their candidacies in New Hampshire. How? Bush has run
the same ad every day for three weeks, casting himself as a
tax-cutter, to preempt the air assault of Steve Forbes's ads
calling Bush a tax pledge-breaker, like his old man. And Gore roped
in the endorsement of Ted Kennedy, the Senate's heavyweight champ
on health care, to blunt Bradley's
my-big-idea-is-health-insurance-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   Inoculation is a safety belt, as all who skipped their flu shots
realize. Clinton inoculated himself against media viruses in New
Hampshire eight years ago, surviving the Gennifer Flowers flu.
</P>
<P>
   Gore this time has had generally the worst press of any
candidate, and if he survives New Hampshire, he will be inoculated
to some extent. But as Bush Sr., Bob Dole, and Walter Mondale
learned to their rue, there's no inoculation against the Iowa flu.

FALLEN HERO KOHL TRIES TO RIDE OUT FINANCE SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ During the 16 years he was German chancellor, Helmut
Kohl drove his aides crazy whenever he was confronted with a crisis
because his usual response was to do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aussitzen,'' his aides would whisper, which in German means to
sit and wait until the problem is forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Aussitzen all over again as Kohl tries to ride out a
campaign finance scandal that has sullied his reputation as one of
Europe's most respected statesmen, torn his Christian Democrat
party apart, and may have irreparably damaged his hand-picked
successor as party leader.
</P>
<P>
   Some have called for Kohl to save the party by resigning and
retiring from public life. Kohl, who stepped down as party leader
but remained in Parliament after losing his bid for a record fifth
term as chancellor in 1998, refuses to go.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's fall from grace has been as sudden and dramatic as the
allegations of an arms dealer who touched off the scandal by
claiming he gave Kohl's party money that was never declared.
Germans, just getting over the self-congratulatory hoopla that
marked the 10th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, are
reeling from the realization that their political system is as
vulnerable to influence peddling as any other in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Kohl was feted here as the leader who presided over
the collapse of the wall and the reunification of Germany, sharing
a stage with George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev. But within a few
weeks of what amounted to his secular beatification, Kohl was
forced to admit he had stashed at least $1 million in secret
contributions in slush funds between 1993 and 1998. Under a German
law introduced, ironically, by Kohl, political parties are required
to disclose the name of anyone who makes a contribution of roughly
$10,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, people were debating how many streets and
squares across Germany would be named for Kohl. In countless ``end
of the Millennium polls,'' he ranked among the top 10 Germans of
all time, with Albert Einstein and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Now,
Christian Democrat candidates running in state elections next month
have asked him to not campaign for them.
</P>
<P>
   It got worse for the party this week. On Monday, Kohl's
handpicked successor as party leader, Wolfgang Schaeuble, admitted
on public television that he had accepted about $50,000 from
Karlheinz Schreiber, the arms dealer whose claims began what could
become the biggest political scandal in Germany since the end of
World War II. Schreiber says the money was to win the government's
support for a tank parts plant in Canada. Schaeuble says he took
the bag of cash from Schreiber but handed it over to the party
treasurer and forgot about it, an explanation few find plausible.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeuble, who has used a wheelchair since a 1990 assassination
attempt and long portrayed as squeaky clean, had sought to distance
himself from Kohl in the past month, but his admission has led some
observers to conclude his career is doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, prosecutors began investigating Kohl's handling
of the contributions, and they want to extradite Schreiber from
Canada to testify. But while Schreiber is not budging from his
story, neither is he budging from Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   While admitting to running party slush funds, Kohl insists he
did nothing sinister and that his government was not for sale. He
said the money was used to cover party expenses. But his refusal to
name the contributors has fed speculation that he has something to
hide. Kohl says he promised the contributors anonymity, and has
called his refusal to name them honorable, not unlawful.
</P>
<P>
   A committee made up of members of the Bundestag will soon begin
hearings aimed at determining whether any of Kohl's decisions as
chancellor were influenced by the secret contributions. Unlike the
criminal investigation, the parliamentary probe will be public and
could drag on for two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl could face charges that carry up to five years in prison.
While few believe the 69-year-old Kohl will be indicted, much less
convicted, neither would they have believed two months ago that
Kohl would be caught up in such a scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Many Germans seem to accept Kohl's insistence that he did not
personally profit from the contributions. Kohl's love of frugal
comforts is legendary. His weakness is an appetite for saumagen,
pig's stomach. Unlike his successor as chancellor, Gerhard
Schroeder, who has been married four times, Kohl has been married
to the same woman for nearly half a century. He and his family
vacation yearly at the same place, Lake Wolfgangsee in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal that has engulfed Kohl and threatens to destroy his
party has stunned many Germans who thought their democracy was
beyond the petty corruption common in much of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Harald Grunert and Friedel Drautzburg run what is arguably
Berlin's most politically wired bar and restaurant, Standige
Vertretung, a mecca for politicians and natives of Kohl's beloved
Rhineland. The pair used to run Gambrinus, a political haunt in
Bonn, but when the government decided to move from Bonn to Berlin,
they moved, too. At Standige Vertretung, the walls are lined with
photographs of German politicians, and patrons throw back small
glasses of kolsch, a light beer, in an atmosphere where politics is
taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Grunert says many of his patrons, pols and ordinary people
alike, are glum and disillusioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew this sort of thing happens in other countries, but a
lot of people are shocked that it can happen in Germany,'' Grunert
said, standing next to a photo of Kohl which shows him,
uncharacteristically, grinning like a Cheshire cat. ``A lot of
people don't want to know about it. They'd prefer we ignore it
until it goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl may be banking on that old tactic, Aussitzen. Sitting in a
restaurant here, Wolfgang Kammler, 60, and his wife, Baibel, 58,
say they are not happy about the revelations, but not especially
angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more relaxed about it,'' Wolfgang Kammler says. He says he
is willing to overlook what Kohl did, but not Schaeuble.
</P>
<P>
   Baibel Kammler said she had already tired of the media's
obsession with the story. She said she and her friends avoid
discussing it.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office a few hundred yards from Brandenberg Gate,
Guenter Nooke cannot avoid discussing it. As the Christian Democrat
representative in the Bundestag for the Mitte and Prenzlauer Berg
sections of east Berlin, Nooke knows the scandal will dominate
German politics, perhaps for years.
</P>
<P>
   Nooke is among those who say Kohl should not step down. But
Nooke says he favors Kohl naming the contributors, and cannot
understand why some of those contributors have not come forward to
save Kohl the humiliation he is enduring.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal has been a welcome diversion for Schroeder and his
Social Democrats, who had been reeling from a series of state
election losses last year. Before the scandal broke, the
conservative Christian Democrats were neck and neck in the polls
with the more liberal Social Democrats, and serious commentators
questioned whether Schroeder's coalition could last until the 2002
election.
</P>
<P>
   But Nooke and other Christian Democrats take some solace in the
lack of enthusiasm the Social Democrats have shown in fanning the
flames against Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of fierce attacks from the other side suggests they
have skeletons of their own in some closet,'' said Nooke. ``There's
a larger issue here about campaign financing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nooke says party activists are more upset about the scandal than
ordinary voters, many of whom remain loyal to Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls suggest that about 90 percent of Germans now
believe that all German parties keep secret accounts and all
parties engage in what can loosely be described as corruption.

`GIRL, INTERRUPTED' TAKES SOME UNEXPECTED DETOURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
GIRL, INTERRUPTED 
Directed by: James Mangold 
Screenplay by: Mangold, Lisa Loomer and Anna Hamilton Phelan, based
on Susanna Kaysen's memoir 
Starring: Winona Ryder, Angelina Jolie, Vanessa Redgrave, Whoopi
Goldberg, Clea Duvall, Brittany Murphy, Elisabeth Moss, Jared Leto,
Jeffrey Tambor, Travis Fine, Jillian Armanette, Angela Bettis 
Rated: R (strong language and content relating to drugs,
sexualitry, and suicide) 
Running time: 125 minutes 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes and no on James Mangold's film of Susanna Kaysen's ``Girl,
Interrupted.'' First the pluses, because I think they deserve
precedence. The pluses after Winona Ryder in the title role, that
is. It's difficult to imagine any actress today bringing more
sentience and intelligence to her role here as stand-in for the
17-year-old Kaysen in 1967. That Mangold has fashioned an honorable
film from Kaysen's memoir of her two years spent at McLean Hospital
in Belmont when she shuttled between _ in her image _ the parallel
universes of madness and so-called real life, is no small
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   The book is a string of vignettes, sharp-eyed recollections and
insights thrown into high relief with a gift for detail that marks
Kaysen as a natural writer. Without wanting to violate the tone or
sensibility of the book, Mangold, nevertheless, was faced with
turning it into a narrative. Some of Mangold's biggest successes
lie in the realm of what he has avoided. One anticipates a
skewering of psychiatry and at least some of its assumptions,
especially the ones based on the lopsided power relationship
between the medical establishment, which has it all, and the
patient, who has none. One needn't be a feminist to hear mental
alarm buzzers upon learning that one of the things that landed
Kaysen in McLean was promiscuity. When was the last time a man was
committed for that?
</P>
<P>
   But ``Girl, Interrupted'' has no intention of setting itself up
as a feminist ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' with the
establishment as villain, drugging into submission anybody who
exceeded its narrow parameters of tolerable deviation. The medical
establishment depicted here remains observed through a prism of the
times, which is to say it emerges as merely obtuse, not evil. While
facing up to the fact that there was reason to believe that Kaysen
was genuinely depressed and posed a danger to herself, Mangold
takes his cue from her wittily reverberant observation that the
keepers were clueless and the patients had to be their own finders.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Girl, Interrupted'' neither glamorizes insanity by falsely
propagating the idea that the mentally ill see things more clearly
than the rest of us nor puts histrionic spin on that most
pernicious of Western myths, the noble savage. So far, so good. The
noble savage myth, with its corollary canonization of the mentally
ill, has always seemed to me nothing better than a convenient piece
of guilt-removing payback for colonialism. (It's also an
increasingly obsolete totem; what we need is a different paradigm,
one that suits what is about to be our revved-up competitiveness
with Europe and a revived Asia, not the looting of lands populated
by trusting people.) Mangold wisely avoids conventional critiques
of psychiatry, feminist and otherwise, because that's not what the
book is about.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the atmosphere of brittle camaraderie he does create,
he also avoids any hint that he's trying to fob off on us a pajama
party, a modern ``Little Women,'' but with bars on the windows. So
he's got the right idea _ don't be swerved off the book. But right
there on page 36, Kaysen spells out the pitfall when she writes:
``My motives were weak.'' As she herself saw at the time, she was
depressed, and more confused than pathological. Her suicide attempt
consisted of taking 50 aspirin, and it was just the luck of the
draw that the doctor she saw clapped her into a taxi and sent her
off to McLean as opposed to prescribing medication and handling her
case on an out-patient basis.
</P>
<P>
   She's the central figure, but she's also the least troubled of
the characters we meet. Most of the time, she's detached,
clear-eyed, acute, (rightly) pretty confident that she'll soon be
out of McLean (she was admitted in October, 1967, discharged in
January, 1969), quite aware that all she has to do is stay cool
during this respite from the pressures of life outside. Only the
fact that we keep wondering what's going on behind Ryder's big
hungry eyes prevents the film from being stolen away entirely by
Angelina Jolie in the much showier role of a charmismatic woman
named Lisa, who has panache, is a natural leader, thrillingly
nervy, and in a lot more trouble than Ryder's Kaysen because she,
Lisa, is a sociopath.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the big-screen Kaysen is that, dramatically,
she is given no compelling arc. The other patients _ most notably
Elisabeth Moss's burn victim, Polly, and Brittany Murphy's dutiful
daughter, Daisy, bent on meeting her father's demands _ have real
problems, to say nothing of Lisa. Jolie deserves nothing less than
a best supporting actress Oscar nomination for her high-voltage
performance and also for remembering to dull her wild eyes to
remind us that Lisa's sexiness can go only so far to divert
attention from her disorder (she's not a free soul being squelched
_ she's in undeniable trouble).
</P>
<P>
   It would be frivolous and wrong-headed to trivialize Kaysen's
youthful troubles in making the jump from adolescence to adulthood,
to hint that they may have been at least in part attibutable to
self-indulgence, or to discount them because she came from a
privileged background. But Ryder's integrity in muting the alarm
bells is going to work against her in terms of generating audience
empathy. She's only just a little unruly. She can pull back. Lisa,
Polly and Daisy can't. There's a lot of skilled, responsible work
on screen in ``Girl, Interrupted'' (which, incidentally, was filmed
on unused portions of an institution in Harrisburg, Penn.).
Ironically, though, the vibe it transmits is the one that usually
attaches to castigated institutions in movies. There's too much
control in it, and not enough danger.

 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Movies based on living people are a morass of trouble. If
they're slavish to the facts, the results can be episodic and lack
dramatic tension. If they're not slavish enough, the film's living
counterparts scream betrayal and blab appropriately to the press.
Rare is the movie that balances truth with fiction, accuracy with
narrative power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hurricane'' comes close. Despite a very public flap in
recent weeks over the film's simplification, elimination or frank
mutilation of the facts, Norman Jewison's startlingly effective
biography of prizefighter Rubin ``The Hurricane'' Carter finds a
consistent, combustible balance between telling his story and
lending it literary fire.
</P>
<P>
   It is not wholly accurate and should not _ could not, will not _
be mistaken for a documentary on boxing and the New Jersey justice
system. No chance of that. But like every good story, ``The
Hurricane'' informs the facts with a deeper truth, the truth of
metaphor and human meaning. And in that it is a triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Based on two sources _ ``Lazarus and the Hurricane,'' by Sam
Chaiton and Terry Swinton, and Carter's own memoir _ ``The
Hurricane'' features a revelatory star turn by Denzel Washington as
the middleweight boxing champ who spent 20 years in prison for
murders he didn't commit. Washington has always been a great actor,
and he's always been a sympathetic actor, but never before has his
greatness thrown such a warm light.
</P>
<P>
   If ``The Hurricane'' succeeds, it succeeds on the grit and heart
in Washington's performance and on his delicately touching scenes
with the extraordinary Vicellous Reon Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon plays Lesra, a teen-ager who reads Carter's memoir
(``The Sixteenth Round'') and, moved by his story, writes to him in
prison. The two strike up a correspondence that blossoms into
heartfelt friendship, which inspires Lesra to introduce Carter to
three friends and guardians (John Hannah, Liev Schreiber and
Deborah Kara Unger) who resolve to get him out of prison. (Two of
said friends went on to write the book mentioned above. One,
Unger's character, married and eventually divorced Carter. None of
this is alluded to in the film, although Washington and Unger have
a certain snazzy chemistry.) Lest all of this confuse and worry
you, rest assured: ``The Hurricane'' is a film about Rubin Carter,
not about the three yuppie do-gooders who rescue him from
immurement. It is not, to put a label on it, yet another virtuous
white folks save victimized black folks movie. Lesra's earnest
Canadian guardians do come across as a wee bit dippy and easily
qualify as the film's weakest links. But they're not disposable;
they taught Lesra to read; without them, Lesra's own story would
make little sense. And without Lesra, Carter's transformation from
hardened jailbird into a man of hope and love would prove far less
dramatic. It'd be missing half its heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate put me in here,'' says Carter to Lesra in a scene (one of
several) that jerks huge tears. ``Love is gonna bust me out.''
</P>
<P>
   Such unabashed emotion fills the screenplay (by co-producer
Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon, who wrote the uneven but
shattering prison drama ``Murder in the First''), which bumps
around from Carter in prison to Lesra at home to Carter in
prizefight flashbacks, pulverizing opponents in black and white
(i.e., ``Raging Bull'') verite.
</P>
<P>
   In roughly linear fashion we follow Carter from his first,
tragic brush with the law and subsequent incarcerations through his
exultant rise as middleweight boxing champion. When he and a young
acquaintance are arrested for the murders of three white people in
a New Jersey bar, the film zooms us through the justice system and
whisks us off to prison, where Carter strips himself of emotion and
gets down to the unforgiving business of serving three life
sentences. He becomes a machine: His task is to endure his time,
nothing more. Enter Lesra.
</P>
<P>
   So much works with ``The Hurricane'' _ Washington's performance,
Shannon's performance, Clancy Brown's in a small role, Rod
Steiger's in an even smaller (but razor-sharp) one _ that the
film's sagging conventions and simplistic good-vs.-evil moralizing
barely matter.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Hedaya has the unenviable job of playing the film's chief
tormentor, a heinous, racist sheriff who tampers with witnesses in
his quest to brand Carter Public Enemy No. 1. The guy would be
awful enough without turning him into Tony Soprano, but there he
is, age spots affixed in the final act, rasping pro-forma death
threats to the crusading Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the film nicely avoids other plot devices, spending
mercifully little time with Carter's early home life and treating
his prison scenes with compassion and firm restraint. (There is no
shower rape scene.) Jewison's direction has never been flashy _
from ``Moonstruck'' to ``Rollerball,'' story has always topped
style _ and his work in ``The Hurricane'' is characteristically
meat-and-potatoes. There's nothing new here; there's no frenzy of
innovation, no obsessive virtuosity (as in the incoherent
``Magnolia'') that mucks up the tale being told.
</P>
<P>
   It's simply a well-told, well-acted, viscerally satisfying
story. Conventional it is. Flaws it has. Weepy it may be. It's
nevertheless a gut-socking motion picture, a moving paean to the
power of justice and yet more proof that Denzel Washington is one
of his era's finest talents.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seeing ``Fantasia/2000'' shouldn't be about the
visual and aural wraparound experience. The aesthetic experience _
conception, execution _ should be all. What's being delivered
should be what it's all about, not the delivery system. But part of
what's being delivered here is the delivery system. So it does
matter. People who see the usual IMAX nature films come away wowed
by just how much nature comes at them in an IMAX presentation. The
new ``Fantasia/2000,'' with seven new segments and a reprised
Mickey Mouse in ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice,'' is in part a
demonstration of just what Disney's artists can do with their new
computerized toys. Some of it is impressive, some seems
undersupplied. In baseball terms, it's a two-bagger, but not a home
run.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney intended to update and release ``Fantasia'' every
few years, but World War II intervened. ``Fantasia'' was a flop
that didn't move into the black until its abstract patternings made
it a money-making head movie in 1969, and music education itself
took a leap forward in the intervening years _ partly due to
``Fantasia.'' Its signature frame is the one in which conductor
Leopold Stokowski is shown shaking hands with Mickey Mouse before
conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra. ``Fantasia'' was kitsch from
the start. And the music was truncated. But Stokowski fulfilled a
function few conductors could have. He was the most unabashedly
hammy of conductors, whose flamboyance earned him armies of
detractors. Yet he possessed artistic credentials that meant he had
to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   So he bridged a gap. James Levine, who mostly conducts the
Metropolitan Opera, but who has a history with the Chicago
Symphony, brings ease and poise to his interlocutor's role here
with that orchestra. And the new Disney masterminds have had the
good sense to divide the hosting among a handful of savvy, engaging
pros, ranging from Steve Martin to Bette Midler, to Quincy Jones to
Angela Lansbury to Penn &AMP; Teller, who drolly reintroduce what these
days looks like a very grainy Mickey Mouse, in his borrowed pointy
hat with the stars and the moons, trying to turn the magic off
before the brooms flood the sorcerer's lair with the pails of water
Mickey can't make them stop carrying in.
</P>
<P>
   If the grainy ``Sorcerer's Apprentice'' was included to offer
contrast to today's technical razzle-dazzle, provide continuity,
and repeat sci-fi's usual reactionary warning to avoid
venturesomeness, the seven new episodes more than once genuflect to
it. Stylistically, they spend more time looking back than forward.
The geometric shapes that morph into butterflies and bats in the
first section (to Beethoven's Fifth) seem perfunctory, less
compelling than the corresponding abstractions accompanying
Stokowski's Bach in the original. The flamingos dancing to
Saint-Saens' ``Carnival of the Animals,'' if no less inspired than
the hippos twinkle-toeing their way through Ponchielli's ``Dance of
the Hours,'' are certainly no more inspired.
</P>
<P>
   The kinetic, propulsive segment set to Stravinsky's 1919
``Firebird'' Suite (second _ and leanest _ of three he extracted
from the full score), depicting a pagan goddess regenerating the
earth after a volcanic firebird consumes it in flames, seems to owe
more to the demon rising up out of Mussorgsky's ``Night on Bald
Mountain'' than, to, say, the more recent and more innovative take
on nature in ``Princess Mononoke,'' or even this new Firebird's
purported source, the reappearance of plant life on the slopes of
Mount Saint Helens. It works as spectacle, and works best of all
with its music, whooshing through its motions as slickly as
``Tarzan.'' Yet, it typifies much in the new ``Fantasia/2000'' in
that it seems more intent on establishing a firm link to the
traditional Disney house style than to pushing into challengingly
innovative territory.
</P>
<P>
   The segment in which Donald Duck acts as a gatekeeper for Noah,
ushering pairs of animals into the Ark to Elgar's Pomp and
Circumstance Marches and nearly losing Daisy in the process, is
attractive enough, but it's just there, never really leaping off
the screen in any way that surprises and delights. Although there
are satisfactions, there are no surprises, either _ I wish there
were _ in the chapter played out to Gershwin's ``Rhapsody in Blue''
by characters from the pen of Broadway's legendary Line King, Al
Hirschfeld. New York never rides higher than on the music of
Gershwin, and Hirschfeld's drawings, with their elegant panache,
are in themselves a logo for Manhattan glamour. I only wish Disney
could have figured out a way for Hirschfeld to dot the lively but
modest Jazz Age vignettes with his unique takes on a few period
celebs. The closest we get is a rich woman's henpecked husband, who
suggests Alexander Wollcott doing a Walter Mitty number.
</P>
<P>
   I have saved the best for last: Hendel Butoy's two striking
segments that utilize the computer's ability to convey an almost
lunar stillness and isolation. Setting Hans Christian Andersen's
``The Steadfast Tin Soldier'' to the Allegro from Shostakovich's
Piano Concerto No. 2 freshens the film's traditional spirit with a
classy, affecting, arguably even existential interplay between a
mechanical ballerina, a menacing jack-in-the-box, and the brave
little one-legged tin soldier. Despite its heightened technical
finesse, there isn't as much to the new ``Fantasia'' as there was
to the old one, but the ``Tin Soldier'' segment, plus the remake's
most beautiful section, involving a pod of whales rising out of the
sea to serenely float like zeppelins amid clouds, make it mandatory
viewing. If the cool blues and greens don't get you, the trancy
mystery of it all surely will. Set to Respighi's ``Pines of Rome,''
it reminds us that it's much easier to set a riveting ballet to a
piece of second-rate music than to a towering masterpiece.

<P>
   With all the NFL coaching changes in recent weeks, CBS analysts
Dan Dierdorf and Phil Simms say, don't expect to ever again hear a
coach say his team will be great in two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it's going now, there'll be at least five job openings
at the end of each regular season,'' said Dierdorf, who will share
the broadcast booth with play-by-play man Verne Lundquist for
Saturday's Miami-Jacksonville game.
</P>
<P>
   Simms, who'll work Sunday's Tennessee-Indianapolis contest with
Greg Gumbel, lamented the good old days when owners and fans had a
little more patience. ``Building a team is out of the question,''
Simms said. ``With free agency and player movement, teams have to
win right away. It's like everything else: People want instant
gratification. They have to be great now. They can't wait until
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierdorf, a Hall of Famer, recalled his playing days as a St.
Louis Cardinal in the '70s on one of the greatest offensive lines
ever assembled. ``The five of us played as a unit for six straight
seasons,'' he said. ``That will never happen again. And the burden
falls on the shoulders of the coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Jesse Jackson's protest of Green Bay's firing of coach
Ray Rhodes, Dierdorf was dismissive. ``To think that (Packers
general manager) Ron Wolf is all of a sudden a racist after he
hired Rhodes a year ago is absurd,'' Dierdorf said. ``To suggest
that the firing of Rhodes has anything to do with other than wins
and losses is absolutely ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms attributed the move to Rhodes's inability to get the most
out of his star players. ``That's what cost Rhodes his job,'' he
said. ``Players are always complaining about tough disciplinarian
coaches like (Bill) Parcells and (Mike) Holmgren. Let me tell you
something: If you hear players talking about how much they like
their coach, fire the coach.''

   The Associated Press is reporting that longtime NBC announcer
Dick Enberg is close to signing a deal with CBS to do play-by-play
for the NFL, college basketball, US Open tennis, and golf. No
telling how much Enberg is costing the network, but one thing is
clear: Letting Sean McDonough go to clear the table for Enberg was
already too costly . . . John Rocker granted ESPN's Peter Gammons
an interview and, surprise, the controversial Atlanta Braves
reliever stated that he is not a racist. ``If I was a racist,'' he
said, ``would I want a black guy living in my house and would I
invite him to come to my house? I did that three times over.''
Racist or not, Rocker is stupid. Gammons later asked him what he
would think if he heard someone else make the kind of comments that
Sports Illustrated quoted him as saying. ``I'd think he was a
complete jerk,'' Rocker said. ``Who the heck does this guy think he
is, mouthing off like this? What kind of experiences does he have
to talk from? And if I could just take a second: It's not going to
justify my comments by any means, because I'll reiterate again and
apologize one more time to anybody I've offended. It certainly was
not my intent.'' Whatever, John.

   New England Sports Network has hired Wendi Nix as Jayme Parker's
co-anchor on ``NESN SportsDesk: The Weekend Edition.'' Nix comes
from WPDE-TV in South Carolina, where she worked as a general
assignment news reporter. Before that, she earned a master's degree
in Sports Management from the University of Massachusetts . . . ABC
Sports has hired Loren Matthews as senior vice president of
programming. Matthews was executive vice president of ESPN Regional
television . . . ABC Sports and Panasonic will work together to
broadcast the 2000 National Hockey League All-Star Game in HDTV
(high definition television) on Feb. 6 . . . New England Cable News
is launching a new nightly show, ``Sports Late Night,'' with hosts
Kristen Mastroianni, Steve Buckley, and Chris Collins. The show
airs at 11, for 30 minutes on weeknights and an hour on weekends .
. . Talk about cheap shots. ESPN the Magazine's Tony Kornheiser
writes: ``How about Chris Weinke agonizing over whether he should
pass up his senior season and go to the NFL. What's he waiting for,
his AARP card? He could be the first NFL draft choice to be
collecting his pension while he's playing.'' All right. It's kind
of funny.

`SOPRANOS' RETURNS WITH ALL ITS OPERATIC, LOWLIFE POTENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE SOPRANOS 
Starring: James Gandolfini, Edie Falco, Nancy Marchand, Lorraine
Bracco, Michael Imperioli, Steve Van Zandt, Jamie Lynn Sigler, Tony
Sirico, Dominic Chianese, Robert Iler 
On: HBO 
Time: premieres Sunday at 9 p.m.; reairs Tuesday at 11 p.m.,

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard not to greet the new 13-episode season of ``The
Sopranos'' with anxiety. How could this HBO phenomenon possibly
approach the brilliance of its freshman year, a year in which
creator David Chase covered more dramatic territory than most TV
shows do in a decade? A year whose captivating themes _ depression,
family politics, infanticide, baked ziti _ seemed to leave nowhere
else to go? Can it be that, like so many pop-cultural returns to
the well, ``The Sopranos'' will return to the air as a shadow of
its former self, a thing lacking in bada bing, the ``Phantom
Menace'' of classic TV?
</P>
<P>
   Fear not. The first three new episodes of ``The Sopranos,''
which is back on Sunday at 9 p.m., suggest that this will be a very
strong season indeed, that Chase has kept his vision unspoiled
despite the torrents of praise, hyperbole, and Emmy nomination that
have rained down on his show. Yes, the exhilarating sense of
discovery that electrified the first season of ``The Sopranos'' is
gone; the first cut is always the deepest. But last season's
revelatory buzz is replaced by a certainty that this show has got
legs, that the writing is as comic and edgy as ever, and that Chase
has a few new monsters up his sleeve _ most notably Tony's sister,
Janice ``Pavarti'' Soprano, who may rival Nancy Marchand's Livia in
the scheming department.
</P>
<P>
   Chase opens the season with a quick nod to the show's success by
setting a wry montage to Frank Sinatra's ``It Was a Very Good
Year.'' The images reacquaint us with the characters _ Tony, still
cheating on Carmela; daughter Meadow learning to drive; Livia
hiding behind an oxygen mask; Dr. Melfi seeing clients within the
cardboard walls of a cheap motel. Without giving plot twists away,
I will say that a rage-filled Tony, the street boss now that Uncle
Junior is in jail, has a mantra: ``She's dead to me.'' Melfi, who
has a therapist of her own (played by Peter Bogdanovich in Episode
3), wants nothing to do with Tony, despite his need for her.
Christopher is running a new wing of the business, a brokerage
firm. And Livia continues to spew repulsive self-pity from her
hospital bed. ``It would kill him to see me now,'' she bleats about
her late husband, probably more right than she realizes.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't ever expect to find Tony Soprano in the same room
with a Birkenstock-wearing, miso-soup-drinking Seattle hippie. But
such are the realistic incongruities that ``The Sopranos'' manages
to pull off. Aida Turturro, cousin of actorsJohn and Nicholas, fits
right in as sister Janice, a vegetarian pothead who moved to the
West Coast 20 years ago and renamed herself Pavarti. (``She's a
cheese now?'' asks Carmela's mother, whom we meet briefly.) No
pushover, Janice is back for some triangular power struggles with
her mother and brother, and to create a place for herself in
Livia's will. Oh, and to pitch a self-help video that she'll call
either ``Lady Kerouac'' or ``Packin' for the Highway to a Woman's
Self-Esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the sly comedy in ``The Sopranos'' _ some of which is easy to
miss on a single viewing _ the magical key to its popularity, the
reason it has engendered a passionate TV cult in only 13 episodes?
The very names (Pussy Bompensiero, Paulie Walnuts) are a hoot, and
some of the props (Junior's black-rimmed glasses, Silvio's hair)
are irresistibly kitschy. The nods to mob movies are clever
(Sunday, the prize goes to an ``Analyze This'' allusion), and the
playful one-liners are delicious, such as when our own city of
Boston is indelibly dubbed ``Scranton, with clams.''
</P>
<P>
   Or is the ``Sopranos'' magic the way that raw, opera-size
emotions are set in the grit of New Jersey suburban realism and
deli capicole? Maybe we are all Tony and Livia Soprano, brimming
over with murderous fantasies that they can act out for us. Or is
the magic the way each episode feels like a little movie, with no
artificial dramatic peaks to set up commercial breaks? Or is it the
Scorsesean use of music, from the tough-guy opening theme, A3's
``Woke Up This Morning,'' to the skipping ``Smoke on the Water'' CD
and next week's hysterical insertion of a Paul Simon song? Or is it
the pitch-perfect acting, from Marchand's relentless Livia to James
Gandolfini's sympathetic-against-all-odds Tony? Or is it the show's
slippery morality, which has you rooting for Tony and Carmela and
compartmentalizing as much as they do?
</P>
<P>
   That is the question critics and fans have been teasing out
endlessly since the show premiered last January. And that is
exactly what makes ``The Sopranos'' so exciting: It cannot be
easily summarized, or reduced to a formula. Unlike most TV drama,
cable or network, ``The Sopranos'' is so vivid and unpredictable
and organic, it defies easy explanation. To say that Tony's mother
tried to have him whacked, for instance, is to do injustice to the
complexity of the first season, which had Livia exerting her will
through Junior but never overtly calling for Tony's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' is a show for viewers who want an alternative
to TV dramas that too often ask us to accept oversimplification and
feel-good-ism. Even high-quality series like ``Once and Again'' and
``The Practice'' tend to cap each episode with some kind of
resolution, to leave us feeling the possibility of redemption or
character nobility. ``The Sopranos'' is not only comfortable with
character flaws and messiness, it thrives on them. The redemption
comes in the form of knockout scripts and killer acting.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's episode is a little choppy compared with last
season, but next week, ``The Sopranos'' hits its stride once again
as the familial and criminal battle lines become clearer. And by
the time an ultraviolent ex-convict named Richie Aprile arrives in
Episode 3, dressed in tacky, dated leisure clothing, the show is,
as we would hope from ``The Sopranos,'' back with a vengeance.

MEMORIES OF A LADY IN MOTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRESTON, Miss. &UR;  &LR; _ Several relatives of my grandmother, Lolee
Roberts, hunkered down at the breakfast table. We had to bury her
in four hours. It was the responsibility of the grandchildren to
say a tribute at the service.
</P>
<P>
   We recalled that Lolee Roberts was a grandmother of perpetual
motion, feeding and shooing chickens, checking the coop for fresh
eggs, shucking peas, grinding corn feed and so we thought in a flip
generality, cooking. This got Uncle Leonard cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Leonard was the only son of Lolee Roberts. Contrary to
assumptions about rural Southern women and soul food, Uncle Leonard
said grandmother really did not like to cook. When he said what she
liked the most, the table was stone silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this image of mother that is frozen in my mind, and I
remember it just like yesterday,'' Uncle Leonard said. ``It was one
of those steaming hot summer days when she came back from picking
cotton. She had her sack slung over her back. Sweat was streaming
down her face from out under her straw hat. Her hands had scratches
and trickles of blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got to the door and said, `I love this.' I'll never forget
those words. `I love this.' Here she is, doing this hard, hot,
painful work, and she says, `I love this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, we had our speech. But the revelation about
grandmother was so much more. Uncle Leonard delivered a bolt of
lightning so hot in its truth, it fused our souls at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Leonard is a retired aerospace publications production
manager. Of the four grandchildren, one sells real estate in the
Dallas area. Another works at an auto assembly plant in Detroit and
has an excavation business on the side with a backhoe in mother's
backyard. Another is a newspaper columnist. The fourth hooks up
video/audio equipment for conventions and business meetings in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It would be facile to say that all of us like or love our jobs
equally, but looking at it another way, not a single word last
weekend was spent complaining about our chosen lines of sweat. Not
over grandmother's grave. Not over the grave of someone who,
because of segregation, did not have our choices.
</P>
<P>
   Not when you are burying someone who comes in from labors so
hard and humble and says, ``I love this.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King Jr. once said, ``If a man is called to be a
street sweeper, he should sweep streets even as Michaelangelo
painted, or Beethoven composed music, or Shakespeare wrote poetry.
He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and
earth will pause to say, here lived a great street sweeper who did
is job well.''
</P>
<P>
   The post-King world is one where we rarely celebrate the street
sweeper, instead musing in tremendous volume last year on the
passings of celebrities like John Kennedy Jr., or Wilt Chamberlain.
The departure of people like Lolee Roberts, 87, farm wife, cotton
picker, chicken shooer and well-water carrier would ordinarily be
marked with a tiny local newspaper obituary.
</P>
<P>
   But who knows what percentage of dedication in this world is
actually spawned by women like grandmother as compared to the
elites? For instance, in a word where too many young people put
money over their hearts in choosing a career, I tell college
students that I love journalism because it is fun. I tell them
whatever you do, do it because it is fun.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I never quite understood where I got that sense of fun from
since I was surrounded in Milwaukee by adults who told us they
worked long hours in factories precisely so we would not have to
take such jobs. They too did their job well, but they'd cut you up
if you dared suggest it was ``fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet here is this image of grandmother, in the midst of the very
work that African-Americans fled North from, and saying ``I love
this.'' It is hard to believe that all of the work she did was
``fun'' in the childish sense, but what she was did was make the
most out of her piece of property, precious in a Mississippi where
she could not vote for her first 50 years of her life.
</P>
<P>
   You can easily chart how her attitude spawned. Uncle Leonard
tried singing before landing in aerospace. My mother Doris earned a
two-year degree in accounting 20 years after high school. My Aunt
Mae Kather, in her mid-60s and long done with her six kids, had
four foster boys when I visited her last fall.The perpetual motion
never stopped. The sweat never stopped dripping. Even in the vacant
depths of a decade of Alzheimer's disease, her work was not done.
</P>
<P>
   I took my 9-year-old son to see grandmother a month and a half
ago. I did not know what the meeting meant to him at the time. When
we told him last week that his great-grandmother had died, he
slumped in the couch as if he really knew her.
</P>
<P>
   Because of what Uncle Leonard said, I think I know why.
Somewhere, deep in the vacant depths, Lolee Roberts would not let
go of life. My son could sense it. As ludicrous as it might seem,
it was as if what precious little was left of her brain reached out
to her great-grandchild and said, ``I love this.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a type you are sure to find in any room full of
Internet venture capitalists: high energy mixed with a certain edge
just below the surface, flawless business-school pedigree, and a
preternaturally youthful appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Mitch Kapor.
</P>
<P>
   Kapor, the legendary founder of Lotus Development Corp.,
advocate for social causes in the real and virtual worlds,
respected technology visionary, onetime mental health counselor and
teacher of transcendental meditation who decades ago left MIT's
Sloan School of Management one term short of a degree, has jumped
into the big-money venture capital world with both feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have good radar for things coming over the
horizon,'' he said in an interview from the modest Kendall Square
office of Kapor Enterprises, a few blocks from Lotus headquarters
in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kapor said his name often rings a bell with people who
can't quite place it. Many don't even associate him with Lotus. But
at a peak in the 1980s, Kapor was the best-known Boston leader in
the personal computer revolution, often mentioned in the same
breath with Bill Gates or Steve Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Kapor, 49, has worked for the last year as a partner at Accel
Partners, a high-tech venture firm based in Palo Alto, dividing his
time between Boston and California. He is serving on boards of or
directly involved with four companies and will step down this month
as the director of a fifth, Allaire Corp. of Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Kapor's evolution into a full-blown venture capitalist stems
from more than four dozen private equity investments he made
personally since resigning as chief executive at Lotus in 1986.
Along with some bombs, Kapor scored several big early-stage hits
and brought them to Accel because they needed the support a venture
capital firm can offer.
</P>
<P>
   Kapor was an early investor in UUNet Technologies, later
acquired by MCI Worldcom Inc., and RealNetworks Inc., maker of the
software that brings audio and video to computer screens via the
Internet. He brought them both to Accel when they needed more help.
After six years investing with Accel as a limited partner, he
decided to join the firm full time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing angel investing before anyone called it angel
investing, before it became so popular,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the choices didn't go nearly so well. Kapor briefly ran
ON Technology Corp. in Waltham, Mass. with little success. His
ground-floor involvement in GO Corp., a big-concept business bust,
was chronicled in a book widely read throughout the high-tech
world, ``Startup: A Silicon Valley Adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapor said the setbacks taught him more than his winners as an
investor. ``I learned about timing, not being ahead of the market.
I learned a lot about focus. I learned about different investing
styles.''
</P>
<P>
   He learned what he liked and what was distasteful about the
venture capital world and the billions it sinks into the corporate
seeds of the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like huge challenges but I don't like the
swing-for-the-fences investment style that says get a world-class
team, have a big idea, get a big-name VC, create huge strategic
alliances, pump up your burn rate (your spending) to millions of
dollars per month and either it works or it doesn't,'' said Kapor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find yourself being compelled by the business logic to do
things that shuffle people around like they're pawns on a
chessboard. That's outside the bounds of what I consider to be good
outcomes.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is the way of much of technology venture investing
today. Huge sums chasing the Internet's earliest investments,
pouring as much as $1 billion into individual funds, are forcing
managers to make increasingly larger bets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it's a boom time,'' Kapor said. ``There are huge
excesses that happen and there's certainly a lot of that going on
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapor is working with a handful of early-stage companies,
including HotDispatch Inc. of Cambridge, an on-line marketplace for
technology expertise, and aQuery of Somerville, Mass., a
search-technology company that came out of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most intriguing is Groove Networks of Beverly, Mass.,
run by Lotus Notes software creator Ray Ozzie. It isn't clear yet
what Groove Networks is doing, and Kapor, an early investor, won't
say much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an ambitious technical project with a lot of people in it
doing something that has a similar innovation challenge level to
Notes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kapor said he tries to choose companies with the chance to
generate something new and compelling for its customers. The
paybacks: money, help with a long-term view, and less immediate
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everything we do makes some amount of money, which
means we never walk away from things,'' he said of Accel. ``You can
argue economically that's sub-optimal. We don't have that culture
and it's one of the things that makes it possible for me to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his other interests are the Mitchell Kapor Foundation,
which he said he has funded with ``a good chunk'' of his net worth.
It has funded environmental health work but plans to make grants
for projects related to Internet public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Kapor if he would like to be back in the saddle, running a
company of his own again, and you will hear a mixed message. It's
too consuming, it doesn't fit with his life now. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've thought about it,'' he said with a grin. ``I've had
fantasies about it. It's probably the Warren Beatty answer: No
plans at this time.''

&HT;     `GIRL INTERRUPTED' EXPLORES A WORLD OF TORMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There wasn't a lot of screaming described in Susanna Kaysen's
memoir of her stay in a mental institution. But since director
James Mangold doesn't seem to know how to convey ``crazy,'' he's
added wall-to-wall shrieking as a bonus of his film adaptation of
``Girl, Interrupted,'' Kaysen's fragmented confessional.
</P>
<P>
   In Mangold's hands, it becomes a noisy statement less about the
distinction between insanity and simply having difficulty living in
the world and more like a glossy handbook on how to make some new
girlfriends at mental camp.
</P>
<P>
   The beautifully explained source of the book's title (a Vermeer
painting) has been jettisoned, and Kaysen's stream-of-consciousness
remembrances have been paved into a dramatic narrative complete
with a melodramatic finale that would shame Susan Hayward. But for
all Mangold and co-writers Lisa Loomer and Anna Hamilton Phelan's
simplifications, he refuses to indulge the darker, florid passages
in Kaysen's prose.
</P>
<P>
   In Winona Ryder's case, ``Girl Interrupted'' is a showcase in
which her brittle, angry portrait shows she has graduated from
ingenue to actress. Mangold, who made ``Copland'' in 1997, may not
have been able to say anything substantial about personality
disorder, but Ryder as an incarnation of Kaysen's twentysomething
self is a one-woman brokedown palace of self-doubt, self-loathing
and yes _ as Hollywood would have it _ self-discovery. But in the
most convincing work she's done so far, moments that could easily
have had the emotional wallop of a girl-scout training film are
endowed with pathos and sinew simply in the way Ryder contorts her
lines.
</P>
<P>
   In Ryder, Mangold knows he has something close to scrappy
divinity, so he uses her not simply as the movie's narrative
fulcrum but as its stylistic one as well. The film is set in 1967,
and, as photographed by Jack Green, looks like something from that
late-'60s-early-to-mid-'70s period fashioned by Cassavetes and
Polanski. The lighting is soft, establishing shots are nonexistent.
We see just striking close-ups of Ryder's Susanna completely lost
in the activity of her busy house, harangued by her mother (Joanna
Kerns), shaken by an affair with a friend's father and sharing her
thoughts on existence with her lover (Jared Leto). People talk to
Susanna across time, and Mangold uses that call-and-response
editing technique to erase the seams in her reality.
</P>
<P>
   Susanna is bewildered by her inability to catch up with the
world happening outside her head, and Ryder makes Susanna's
disorientation seem like a playground ride she can't get off. When
a shrink (Curtwood Smith) confronts her in a session about her
possible suicide attempt, Kevin Tent's editing slows down and Ryder
looks cornered in one long, claustrophobic take. Minutes later,
Susanna is booked for delusion and is headed to the psych wing of
Claymore Hospital (changed from the book's famous McLean).
</P>
<P>
   Claymore is a haven for Massachusetts' most wayward upper-
middle-class girls. And Mangold presents the place as a revolving
door of actual and affected derangement. Each girl appears to
suffer some imbalance, a combo of eating disorder and severe
paranoia resulting in her complete disempowerment, and the fierce
cast playing these girls seem to be gorging themselves on air and
scraps. Brittany Murphy's Daisy is addicted to laxatives and has a
horrible secret involving the storage of roast chicken carcasses,
and Janet (Angela Bettis) is just straight-up anorexic.
</P>
<P>
   The ward's bully is an emaciated hellion named Lisa, played with
equal parts menace and reserve by Angelina Jolie, who's so thin
here the screaming she has to do wipes her out. Lisa is the
``notice me'' one in a stable of dynamic characters, but Jolie
doesn't burn down the house. In a blond wig of coarse hair, she may
look like a rock groupie in rehab, but she plays Lisa with the
frailty and volatility of a Billie Holiday record. She pulls
people's strings and pushes their buttons, none worse than Georgina
(Clea Duvall), Susanna's roommate. But as it turns out, Lisa is
more complex than a mere bully. She's like the Brad Pitt character
in ``Fight Club'' transferred to the Claymore ladies psych ward,
the voice that taunts conflicted souls. Only, Lisa's real.
</P>
<P>
   The girls fight, bond, then scream and fight some more with
Susanna's calm eroding as her days pass in Claymore. But each girl
_ and there are five or six eddying around Susanna _ is more wily
and manipulative than the victimhood they feign. And Valerie
(Whoopi Goldberg), the ward's head nurse, knows the drill and meets
every temper tantrum with skeptical tough love. As an actress,
Goldberg resonates best when she looks like everyone around her has
worked her last nerve. And she couldn't be more exasperated than
she is here, exuding maternity that's ironclad, even through an
extra large wig that hides her dreadlocks and makes her look like
she just walked off a mother ship.
</P>
<P>
   The film's best scene is one that's not in the book (in which
the head nurse was white and very much in the background). In it,
Valerie tells Susanna to grow up, and Susanna retaliates by calling
her a mammy. It's a powerful face-off between two actresses in full
control who have never been better. And it's an encounter that
provides the piercing, adult clarity in a movie that has as its
theme song Petula Clark's ``Downtown,'' that girly girliest of
liberation anthems.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the way these girls perform it underscores the beguiling
convergence of banshee and Lorelei.

&HT;     PROTESTS AGAINST CLOTHING RETAILER GAP CONTINUE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ELIZABETH BRENNAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Gap Inc. said its sales have not been affected
by a year of demonstrations led by a San Francisco human rights
organization that is demanding improved human rights conditions at
the retailer's overseas garment factories.
</P>
<P>
   The protests ``have no effect on sales,'' Gap spokeswoman Maria
Moyer-Angus said. ``Sales are going up. We are confident in our
program and want to be proud of the vendors we have and improve
over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gap Inc. has nearly 3,000 stores, including about 370
international stores. Company officials expect a $2 billion
increase in sales in 1999 from 1998 and plan to open about 550 more
Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy stores in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 protesters, primarily from the Global Exchange,
gathered Thursday morning outside and in the lobby of Gap's
headquarters, exactly one year after first demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters hoped to deliver to Gap President Donald Fisher a
petition signed by some 10,000 people nationwide asking that Gap
ensure the workers who manufacture its goods are paid a living
wage, that they have the right to freely associate and that the
company allow independent monitors to inspect factories in 50
countries. But no senior official accepted the petition in person.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Mark of Global Exchange said he remains optimistic despite
the lack of response from Gap officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're raising a tremendous amount of awareness,'' Mark said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen demonstrators were arrested Thursday for trespassing
while shouting, ``Gap workers have been wronged, one year is too
long.'' They were given a citation and a court date, said Capt.
Dennis Martel of the San Francisco police.
</P>
<P>
   Leila Salazar of Global Exchange, who was among those arrested,
said that she is confident the campaign will be effective.
</P>
<P>
   The Gap ``has an exemplary code of conduct, but we know it's not
being enforced,'' Salazar said. ``We need to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark said the organization has staged protests in front of Gap
stores in Chicago, Minneapolis, New York, Austin, Texas, and other
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Gap, like most clothing retailers, contracts with companies to
manufacture it products. Much of the manufacturing has moved out of
the United States to countries where labor and production costs are
lower. Labor and human rights groups contend that many of these
workers face exploitation in countries with minimal labor
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Gap has an 80-person staff to monitor working conditions at its
contract factories. The company does business in 50 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The officers generally visit the factories once every three
months and also conduct random inspections and check for human
rights violations and safety hazards, Moyer-Angus said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has used independent monitors in El Salvador
and is working to develop more independent monitoring programs in
other Central American countries.

&HT;     HBO'S `SOPRANOS' RETAINS ITS PERFECT PITCH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: Subs hed, story stands.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK McGUIRE  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With everybody else singing its praises, you can more than
forgive ``The Sopranos'' for giving itself a subtle pat on the
back.
</P>
<P>
   After all, as Frank Sinatra sings in the opening minutes of the
HBO drama's second season premiere, it was a very good year.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a new year, a new season. All those magazine covers
and Emmys and Golden Globe nominations and the rest don't mean
squat. You have to understand, this is just business.
</P>
<P>
   So I'm not gonna gush about the new ``Sopranos'' season
beginning at 9 p.m. EST Sunday. No way. Enough already with the
platitudes. As Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) says, ``You gotta
exercise impulse control.''
</P>
<P>
   So we will cut to the facts. In the first three episodes:
</P>
<P>
   _ We meet Tony's sisters, including the wonderfully wacked
Janice (Aida Turturro). She also goes by the name of Pavarti and
may also have an agenda beyond just re-establishing links to her
family.
</P>
<P>
   _ We learn mommy dearest Livia (Nancy Marchand) survived her
``stroke,'' despite being ``dead'' as far as Tony is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   _ We are hit with a sledgehammer by the return home of new face
Richie Aprile (David Proval), brother of late mob boss Jackie
Aprile. After a long stretch in the pen, Richie is looking for his
street action again.
</P>
<P>
   _ He is not the only one to come in from the cold.
</P>
<P>
   _ We learn Tony likes Deep Purple (hey, that is the kind of
detail fans love).
</P>
<P>
   _ Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), fearful of a hit, is
still meeting clients for therapy sessions in a motel.
</P>
<P>
   We also learn that the acting and writing of the mob hit created
by David Chase remains as sharp and captivating as it was in the
earth-shaking 13 episodes of season one.
</P>
<P>
   You call that gushing? Tough. Judging from the first three
episodes, there is nothing to indicate ``The Sopranos'' has slipped
from its perch.
</P>
<P>
   How can I tell? That old post-``Sopranos'' depression has
returned. It's a gnawing emptiness that arises after you see
upcoming episodes in advance and know that when the show actually
airs, you have already spent that initial rush. It's like eating
your Halloween candy while you're still trick-or-treating, then
having to watch your siblings gorge at the kitchen table afterward.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a little more than a year ago that the cast and crew
thought that this little drama they had slapped together would go
by unnoticed, a fun experience that would look good on a resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too bad people won't watch it,'' Chase told co-star Edie Falco
(Carmela Soprano).
</P>
<P>
   The only thing the people involved in this show have gotten
wrong is judging how good it really is: The initial tidal wave of
acclaim _ it was universal_ stunned Gandolfini and the rest. In
fact, Gandolfini said last summer that he didn't even expect to get
the part of the mob boss in need of psychiatry: ``They decided to
take a shot, I guess. But that's probably because I'm cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Gandolfini is a private man. When he met with
the press to accept an award from critics last summer, Gandolfini
was noticeably uncomfortable with the attention. Generous, but shy,
cast members said.
</P>
<P>
   Gandolfini, like others in the cast, has trouble pinpointing why
the show resonates with the public. This is where I could go on
with a dissertation of family, and how people can relate to the
flawed mob boss whose nearly unlimited power in the local mob does
nothing to ease his inner fears and troubles with family at home.
But if you've seen the show, either on HBO or on tapes that are
floating around everywhere, you already knew that.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, this is a new season. What about 2000? ``I'm sure
we'll screw it up,'' Gandolfini joked before filming began.
</P>
<P>
   How can people involved in something so right get it so wrong?

&HT;     CHEVRON SETTLES LAWSUIT OVER OIL ROYALTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GEORGE RAINE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Chevron Corp. has agreed to pay $95 million to
settle a federal court case in which it was charged with
underpaying royalties due for oil produced on federal and Indian
land over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco-based Chevron did not acknowledge any wrongdoing
or liability in the settlement, which led to dismissal of the case
Thursday. The $95 million is not in the form of a civil fine or
penalty, but the sum the parties involved in the case agreed would
resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Two Texas men acting as private whistle-blowers, J. Benjamin
Johnson Jr. and John Martineck, former employees of Arco, a
competing oil company, filed the lawsuit against Chevron and 15
other oil companies in U.S. District Court in Lufkin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Martineck filed on behalf of the federal government
under provisions of the False Claims Act. They will be paid
approximately $14.5 million of the $95 million settlement from
Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department subsequently joined the case that alleged
the oil companies used a variety of schemes to establish
artificially low prices. Chevron and the other defendants denied
the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The case alleged Chevron and the other defendants systematically
underreported the value of oil the company produced on land leased
from the federal government and American-Indian tribes between Jan.
1, 1988, and Dec. 31, 1998, and, consequently, that they paid fewer
royalties than they owed.
</P>
<P>
   Federal leases are administered by the Minerals Management
Services of the Interior Department. Each month, Chevron is
required to report the amount of oil produced and the value of the
oil produced on federal and Indian leases, located throughout the
western United States and in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron is one of the largest producers of oil from these leases
and paid the federal government more than $1.5 billion in royalties
during the period, said Jan Golen, a Chevron spokeswoman in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The $95 million payment represents about 6 percent of that
total, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron agreed to the payment to close the dispute and to avoid
the expense of litigation and exposure to other risk, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron also noted that it had paid royalties consistent with a
long-standing practice by which the government accepted Chevron's
pricing as the appropriate value for the royalties.
</P>
<P>
   However, the government abandoned the practice and revoked it
retroactively for the 10-year period as the case progressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publicity surrounding the agreement included harsh allegations
that Chevron and other oil companies `cheated' the government,
allegations which are totally unfounded,'' said Harvey Gunman, vice
president and general counsel for Chevron.

By DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it's a romantic notion that if we all sat down and
discussed things, we could understand or at least appreciate the
concerns of those least like us. Would we find a common ground?
Would it all come down to: How did our mothers treat us? Did they
smother us with love? Did they expect too much of us? Or did they
try to have us whacked?
</P>
<P>
   Tony Soprano is a ``waste management consultant,'' who
propitiously neglects to mention that it's the detritus of humanity
that he manages _ and rather violently at that. Yet even he, in an
uncharacteristic pique, tried to become self-reflective and answer
that eternal question _ what am I doing here? _ in between
felonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos,'' which returns for its second season at 9
tonight on HBO, is virtually everything that makes for good
television. It's a cracking good action yarn with breath-snatching
moments of brutal, remorseless, even cathartic mayhem. It's a
workplace comedy, with the usual assortment of colorful colleagues,
that reveals to us to the inner workings of a profession few of us
could otherwise relate to.
</P>
<P>
   It's a scintillating character study, exposing us to wounded
souls who, having made terrible compromises somewhere in their
lives, are wondering how seemingly thoughtless decisions have
landed them in the morass in which they now wade, or refuse to
reflect at all for fear of what they might discover about
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a flat-out funny, dysfunctional suburban family sitcom,
with an eccentrically pig-headed matriarch, a murderously wacky
uncle, a dad who sees a shrink and hangs out with his crass buddies
at a strip club, a mom who flirts with the family priest and kids
who are hellions. Yet, there's genuine love in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Any TV critic with a functioning sense of aesthetics declared
the show the best TV of 1999. ``The Sopranos'' creator David Chase
has taken something pop-culture fans have nearly overdosed on _ the
mob saga _ and reimagined it. It wasn't as if we had been lacking
for good mob tales _ try ``Public Enemy'' or ``Godfather'' or
``GoodFellas'' _ but in Chase's hands, it's something we had never
seen before. And if the characters in those other films were too
aggressively or ruthlessly tough _ really, the best relationship we
have toward those made men is icy admiration _ Chase made us love
Tony Soprano (the wryly sleepy-eyed, smarter-than-he-lets-on James
Gandolfini), even as he tightened a wire around the gasping throat
of a stoolie.
</P>
<P>
   We also grew to adore Tony's wife, Carmella (Emmy winner Edie
Falco), who sees through his lies and infidelities but can't
dismiss the fact that he has provided for her very handsomely,
which is why she married him. Tony's kids, banally named Anthony
Jr. (Robert Iler) and, of all things, Meadow (Jamie Lynn Sigler),
are good kids rebelling against the dawning realization of their
father's amorality _ what are rules to a crook?
</P>
<P>
   As for Tony's mother _ boy oh boy, does he have the mother of
all mothers. Livia (Nancy Marchand) is the eternally beset mother
who makes her suffering an occasion for exponentially worse
suffering on the behalf of her progeny. As Tony observes this
season, ``She's too miserable to die.'' When Tony had her placed in
a nursing home _ sorry, retirement community _ against her will,
she only convinced his uncle to put a contract on his head.
</P>
<P>
   Chase has also dropped an insight simultaneously brilliantly
simple and sublimely ironic: Crime is just like any other job, with
its perks and its disadvantages. Even the mob is plagued by
upstarts strutting with the same attitudes informing the new
generation of endorsement-crazy athletes or film directors weaned
on music videos. Generation X gangsters are self-absorbed, too
seduced by the easy money, incapable of appreciating their
forebears' history of sacrifice and work ethic and loyalty. They're
not nearly dedicated enough to putting in the time and effort to
keep the mob running smoothly. Thanks to their laziness,
indictments are flying everywhere in Jersey. It's Chase's take on
America's general spiritual malaise, and who's to say he's wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Chase metes out adult entertainment in the best sense of the
word _ this is for live-and-let-live adults who aren't easily
scandalized or shocked or offended. The pneumatic ``atmosphere''
(to use the current Hollywood vernacular, which seems to be getting
ever more impersonal, for extras) at the Bada Bing! strip joint
includes naked bimbos who aren't presented for purposes of
titillation _ they're too obviously enhanced and too clinically
photographed for that.
</P>
<P>
   The colorfully crude language is simple verisimilitude. The
characters' misogyny and racism is offhandedly depicted _ not as a
heavy-handed character flaw but as just a fact of life.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout it all _ the oral sex discussions, the shockingly
casual murders, the withering pop-culture references, the
generously proportioned babes, the frequent ``Godfather III''
disses _ Chase is repeatedly telling us, ``You can take this
without sniggering or protesting political incorrectness. We're all
adults here.'' That's how the audience feels most jazzed _ this
show isn't kowtowing to them, it's treating them as equals _ and
how often does that happen? There are precious few entertainments
that at some point make fewer artistic concessions to their
narratives than Chase's ``Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   The new shows have unprecedented quality to live up to.
Tonight's season premiere has the twin burdens of outrageous
expectations and providing some requisite character exposition,
bringing us up to date on the characters and, after the first
season rolled much of the story up into a tidy ball of exquisite
yarns, unraveling said ball and beginning anew. Hence, there's no
real driving story mechanism. One of Tony's crew, thought to have
turned state's evidence against his colleagues and therefore
disappearing after being placed on a hit list, returns; a brief
explanation and apparently all is forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   We meet Tony's sister, a New-Age scam artist _ she's collecting
disability for unnamed and apparently non-existent injuries _ named
Janice (Aida Turturro), or, as she prefers to be addressed these
days, Parvotti. Carmella's parents ask, skeptically, ``What, she's
a cheese these days?'' (in fact, it's a Hindu god). Janice has
designs on Livia in some fashion _ she usurps use of her car and
plans to move into her home; it's clear she's after bigger fish,
but no one knows what. But here's how wretched to the core Janice
is _ she has the exquisitely insidious Livia worried.
</P>
<P>
   Episode two is centered around another of those casual glimpses
that the show takes at racism, turning on the utter cynicism of
ethnic leaders as Tony puts muscle on a construction site to
squeeze out more money, ostensibly for the union. Episode three
pits Tony and Carmella against Meadow, yet another imposing foe _ a
willful teen-ager _ who uses Livia's empty house for a raucous
party; the best they can do is mete out an impotent punishment.
Tony sighs, ``If she finds out, we're powerless.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tony's former shrink, Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco)
tries to figure out why she's so obsessed with Tony, even after one
too many threatening outbursts have forced her to drop him as a
patient (filmmaker Peter Bogdonavich plays !ital!her!off! shrink,
one even more stupefyingly pedantic than she).
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's as good as you've heard. So what more encouragement do
you need? &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The United States and Russia plan to opej a joint
military center near Moscow later this year to reduce the chances
of war between the world's two largest nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
   An outgrowth of a 1998 agreement between President Clinton and
former Russian President Boris Yeltsin, the center will provide an
unprecedented level of military cooperation between the former Cold
War adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   According to Air Force Gen. Richard Myers, head of the U.S.
Space Command, Russian officials earlier this month selected a site
to house the facility, which will give U.S. and Russian military
personnel access to each other's classified missile warning
information.
</P>
<P>
   Before the center is opened, U.S. communications specialists
must design a way to transmit U.S. missile warning data to the
Russian center from Colorado Springs, Colo., headquarters of NORAD,
the North American Aerospace Defense Command.
</P>
<P>
   While the center is emblematic of improved U.S.-Russian
relations, it is also a tacit acknowledgement that Bussia's network
of ground-based radar and satellites are deteriorating and could,
in a wovse case, provide the spark for a nuclear conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The center is designed to thwart this doomsday scenario: Russian
radar and satellites mistakenly perceive that Moscow is under a
nuclear attack from the West; military commanders afvise the
Kremlin to launch a retaliatory strike, based on the erroneous
information that they are unable to check out because of their
unreliable equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Once the early warning center is operating, Russian officers
would be able to check U.S. radar information displayed on computer
consoles. The Russians would confer with U.S. officers seated next
to them and report back to their commanders that no such attack is
under way, thus defusing a potentially deadly situation.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of an early warning center received a dry run last
month when some 20 Russian officers joined their U.S. counterparts
at a special facility in Colorado Springs during the Y2K rollover
period. The Russians were allowed to view U.S. radar information in
case the Russian early warning system malfunctioned due to computer
glitches.
</P>
<P>
   The condition of Russia's early warning network has become a
debate topic between U.S. and NATO officials on the one side and
outside military experts on the other. But both camps agree that,
at a minimum, the Russian system linked to some 5,500 nuclear
warheads is becoming less reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Two outside military experts worry that the situation is
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Blair, a Brookings Institution fellow and a leading U.S.
expert on Russian nuclear systems, says Russia's strategic forces
and early warning network have ``already passed the threshold of
becoming unsafe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If our secretary of defense applied our own standards of
safety in personnel reliability to the Russian force, he would
de-certify that force,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   Lani Iass, director of Russian military studies at the
Pentagon's National War College and a former analyst for the oint
Chiefs of Staff, said the risk of a nuclear disaster ``without a
shadow of a doubt'' is greater now than during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a more dangerous period,'' Kass said. ``A nuclear
system you want centralized, you want it tightly controlled and
with a clear sense of who is in charge. Ill these commodities are
absent in Russia today.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Kass and Blair base their assessments on deteriorating
conditions of Russia's strategic rocket forces, comprised of about
150,000 troops dispersed over 11 time zones with responsibility
over some 5,500 nuclear weapons, 2,300 of which are on a so-called
``high-alert'' trigger, ready for launch on only a few moment's
notice.
</P>
<P>
   Once the elite of the Russian military, the strategic rocket
forces now face the economic perils that have decimated the 
remnants of the Soviet Red Army: pay shortages are commonplace,
morale is spotty and some officers responsible for nuclear weapons
need second jobs to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never met anyone in the strategic rocket forces in Moscow
on active duty who isn't moonlighting, usually driving a taxi, to
put food on the table,'' said Blair. ``If our nuclear crews had to
work second jobs to pay the bills, they would be drummed out of the
force. The commanders would say, 'You can't be alert and have your
mind on the job. You are out of here.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Kass-Blair concern also is based on an ailing Russian radar
system that hasn't been able to provide commanders with a complete
picture of the skies ever since the dissolution gf the Soviet Union
when Moscow lost control of republics that had housed ground-basgd
radar stations. For example, a key Russian radar station at
Skrunde, Latvia, was closed, leaving a large gap in radar coverage
over the Baltics.
</P>
<P>
   What this means, said Kass, is that if a Russian radar were to
mistakenly indicate that the United States had launched a nuclear
attack, the Kremlin's ability to confirm the attack with radar data
from other ground stations or from satellites would be diminished.
Any Kremlin decision to launch a retaliatory strike, which must be
made in a matter of minutes, might be based on only a minimum of
information, all inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have an incomplete radar picture and feel vulnerable,
they're liable to make mistakes,'' Kass said.
</P>
<P>
   The joint center in Moscow would help the Russians plug these
gaps in their early-warling system and help prevent
misidentification of a launch.
</P>
<P>
   Another worrisome prnblem is the deteriorating communications
links between commanders in Moscow and rocket forces dispersed
across the country. According to Blair, the failing links cut both
ways: They inhibit the ability of the Moscow leadership to order
nuclear strikes; but they also inhibit the leadership's ability to
detect and override a situation in which someone attempts to launch
a missile without permission, a so-called unauthorized launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a school of thought that holds that this decay
reduces Russia's ability to conduct offensive nuclear strikes,
which is true* But the decay also degrades safety and safeguards,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kass said Russia's strategic forces have been functioning
remarkably well under trying conditions. ``The very fact that
nothing that we know of has happened is a testimony to the
professionalism of the strategic forces, but I am not sure how long
I am willing to count on that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The official government view is less alarmist.
</P>
<P>
   George Robertson, NATO's secretary general, said recently that
the status of Russia's strategic missile system `should not be a
matter of mutual concern at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The general situation in the Russian forces is pretty
obvious,'' he said, referring to the problems afflicting the the
military, `but the information that we have is that their nuclear
forces are maintained at pretty high states.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hamre, the retiring deputy defense secretary, said the
Russian early warning system `has decayed in its capability over
the last several years ... It is obviously less robust than it was
four and five years ago, but it is still functional and they place
good confidence in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Davis, head of the Pentagon's Defense Threat Reduction
Agency, said that ``the notion of Russian nukes accidentally
tripping off and coming out a silo, technically I am not so worried
about.'' Davis said, however, that military payroll shortages are
starting to reach the strategic forces.

   MEAT _ WACO, Texas - Although the H&AMP;B meat packing plant here
has failed three consecutive sets of Salmonella tests, the U.S.

It is unclear whether the USDA can enforce its new food-safety

   HAITI-REFUGEES _ MIAMI _ Six-year-old Cuban rafter Elian
Gonzalez wasn't the only dramatic, heart-rending immigration story
in Miami this week. Miami Haitians held their own marches and
emotional demonstrations over the fate of a pregnant Haitian woman
separated from her children when a rickety boat carrying 400
Haitians was stopped off the Florida coast on New Year's Day.
Haitians were happy Thursday when immigration officials said they
will allow the woman's two children to join her in Miami while she
awaits an asylum hearing, but still blast the agency for what they
say is its discriminatory policy. (Williams, Cox News Service)

   BABY-SAVER _ MOBILE, Ala. _ By the time television reporter Jodi
Brooks arrived in Mobile, Ala., she already had covered two

Mobile, she decided to take action. After a year of operation, ``A
Safe Place for Newborns'' is gaining national momentum. Several
Minnesota hospitals have adopted the program, and the attorney
general there, Michael Hatch, supports making it statewide. The
Alabama District Attorneys Association voted in November to adopt
the program statewide. Brooks, who is helping set up a program in
nearby Pensacola, Fla., said she has had inquiries from Seattle;
Boston; Los Angeles; Austin, Texas; and Paris, as well as George W.
Bush's campaign office. (David, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   DEBATES _ George W. Bush has debated more this month than in his
entire political career, and politics watchers say he's getting
better at it. After a rocky beginning in which he was criticized
for being too scripted and stilted, Bush seems to have warmed up to
debating, becoming more relaxed and taking the offensive more
often. After Saturday's debate, therer will be a lull, and we use
the opportunity to take stock of the debates so far, including are
they having an effect and whether anyone's watching. (Herman,
Austin American-Statesman). 25-30.

DIG DEEP WITH INFORMATICA 1.0
</HEADLINE>
  (David Bloom's weekly Digital L.A. column on the intersection of
entertainment and technology) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Minor edits throughout. Note (AT) symbol in tag) 
 
 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Off and on over about three decades, Stewart Brand and his
cohorts created various versions of the Whole Earth Catalog and the
equally useful quarterly Whole Earth Review.
</P>
<P>
   It was a terrific resource for people trying to find the best
tools and technology for all kinds of tasks, because Brand defined
the term ``tool'' in the broadest possible way, with essays,
reviews and contact information on everything from computer
software to post-hole diggers.
</P>
<P>
   The last catalog came out a few years back; the quarterly shut
down then reopened for a while under other, less interesting
management; and Brand went off to write books about the 10,000-year
clock and other futuristic visions. Thankfully, however, something
of the Whole Earth spirit is living on with the release this month
of Informatica 1.0.
</P>
<P>
   Subtitled ``access to the best tools for mastering the
information revolution,'' it fancies itself a Whole Earth Catalog
without the manure spreaders (other than metaphorically speaking;
he does include some politically oriented Web sites).
</P>
<P>
   It's a great resource, loaded with reviews, excerpts, tips on
buying things such as laptop computers and broadband services, even
goofy odds and ends like a search through an IBM database of U.S.
patents for hits on the term ``mouse trap.''
</P>
<P>
   Each page-long review gives prices, contact information,
background, related resources, even a product's likely obsolescence
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   The book nicely rewards a sustained read or the serendipitous
opening to a random page. And though the book's organization feels
a bit haphazard, it is functional enough, with an index and table
of contents to make searching a bit more straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect part of my problem is that I long for a good search
engine for the book itself, and ``paperware,'' to use author Peter
M. Black's term, isn't so good for that. I'm guessing a more
effective electronic search tool is included in the CD-ROM (which I
didn't get to review) that can be bought in a bundle with the book,
or separately, through www.etronica.com.
</P>
<P>
   Black also promises to issue regular, downloadable disc updates
to the book through the etronica Web site, creating what he calls
in the introduction ``a kind of a magazine, but without the lag
time of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with its minor shortcomings, I highly recommend this book
as a cool, quirky compendium of goodies for the digital age. After
all, as Black admits, this is version 1.0, and the first version of
anything technological always stinks. Imagine how great this will
be when Black hits his stride. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A HIT OF `MYTHIC' PROPORTIONS
</P>
<P>
   When the third-person fantasy strategy game Myth hit store
shelves a few years ago, it knocked a lot of players for a loop. It
was really one of the first games, particularly on the Mac side, to
do something interesting with 3-D graphics, and was hailed as one
of the year's best. Its successor, Myth II: Soulblighter, was
almost equally praised.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bungie has gathered up the two games, a scenario pack
called Chimera, a bunch of other multiplayer levels created by fans
of the game and electronic versions of strategy guides for the two
games, and then put them in one three-disc package: Myth, The Total
Codex.
</P>
<P>
   The games aren't as ground-breaking as when they came out, of
course, but there's still lots to love here, with excellent
graphics and good gameplay, plus free Internet play on the
wonderful Bungie.net Web site against other Myth-sters. Best of
all, the collection comes with a great price: $19.95. Don't Myth
out. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHO WANTS TO MAKE SOME REAL MONEY
</P>
<P>
   All the PC gaming companies may have figured that something like
Quake III Arena or Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation would be the
Christmas season's biggest seller, but a funny thing happened on
the way to the cash register.
</P>
<P>
   According to gaming magazine Next Gen, the holiday box-office
champ for PC games turned out to be the computer version of the
insanely popular TV game show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,''
minus the moolah when you answer Regis' questions correctly.
</P>
<P>
   The title from Disney Interactive and Jellyvision is certainly
entertaining enough, if lacking that certain something that comes
with sweating over an answer worth a million bucks. It's only
$19.99, though, which probably explains a bit of its wide-ranging
consumer appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope, however, that this PC-side success (there's also an
online version at www.abc.com) doesn't spawn the same execrable set
of copycats that the TV program did. ``Greed: The PC Game'' doesn't
work for me. And if I see a commercial for one more ``Who Wants ...
'' knockoff before the February sweeps period kicks in, I'm gonna
make like Janet Leigh (or Neve Campbell) and scream. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THROUGH THE ROOF
</P>
<P>
   With the Consumer Electronics Show safely behind us, it's a good
time to note that the show's sponsor, the Consumer Electronics
Association, has now declared DVD the fastest-selling consumer
electronics product ever.
</P>
<P>
   Electronics companies sold 349,000 DVD players in the product's
first year, 1997, then jumped to 1.08 million units in 1998. Final
figures for 1999 are expected to top out around 3.5 million, and
that doesn't count millions more DVD-ROM drives installed in
computers of even modest cost, such as those by budget-conscious
e-Machines and Avatar Technologies' V-Box.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, about 5 million DVD players already have been sold,
compared to about 1.1 million VCRs between 1975 and 1977, and 1.2
million CD players between 1983 and 1985.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison, CEA officials said, almost 10 times as many DVD
players were sold in their first year as CD players were, back in
1983. Of course, DVD players are helped by the fact that they are
backward compatible, in that they can also play CDs, whereas CD
players definitely couldn't play cassette or eight-track tapes or
vinyl records.
</P>
<P>
   Digital televisions, by the way, have been selling pretty well,
too, topping out at more than 100,000 units this year, despite a
couple of pretty substantial problems: They cost a lot _ anywhere
from $4,000 to $20,000 _ and there's still not that much to watch,
random sporting events and the CBS evening lineup notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   My latest fave pick for a great DVD is ``The Wall,'' the old
Pink Floyd film that has been completely redone for the digital
age. Just as digital versions of ``Dark Side of the Moon'' were an
early favorite among audiophiles with compact-disc players, so,
too, this will likely be a hit with DVD cognoscenti.
</P>
<P>
   The whiz kids over at Sony's High-Definition Data Center put the
original print through a transfer to sparkling high-definition
video, and the soundtrack was carefully remastered to 5.1 channels
from the original stereo under the direction of Chief Floyd, Roger
Waters.
</P>
<P>
   They put in a ton of extra goodies, including two different
documentaries about the film and band. The film itself may not have
been blessed with the visual jaw-droppers of ``The Matrix'' (aka,
The Film That Sold a Million DVD Machines), but it's a great disc.
</P>
<P>
   For oddball disc releases just in time for Valentine's Day (yes,
men, it's almost that time, so think ahead), how about Fox Consumer
Products' release of three two-episode volumes of ``Ally McBeal''?
</P>
<P>
   Fox is also issuing a boxed, two-disc compilation of all six
``Ally'' episodes, a Vonda Shepard music video and a booklet with
excerpts from ``Ally McBeal: The Official Guide.''
</P>
<P>
   In case you have legitimate wonders about how many times you can
watch ``Ally'' hilarity or what impact it might have on your love
life, Fox is also releasing some legitimately romantic movies, like
``Hope Floats,'' ``Ever After'' and ``One Fine Day.'' Float on. &QL;

A WINE CELLAR ON A BEER BUDGET
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes color graphic of a man and his wine bottles) 
 By JENN SHREVE 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It all began with a single sip of a 1993 Andrew Will Cellars
merlot, but there was no turning back for Mike Flaherty. A
42-year-old strategist for Boeing in Seattle, Flaherty amassed a
300-bottle wine collection, with plenty of zinfandels, cabs and
ports. But one thing was missing: a cellar to put it in.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a poor, 'trailer trash' citizen like myself, I spend an
inordinate amount of my income on wine,'' Flaherty explains. ''I
just don't have enough money lying around to buy a fancy oak
refrigerator for my wines, as much as I'd like to.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Wine Market Council's recent $1.3 million ad
campaign:
</P>
<P>
   ''Wine: What are you saving it for?'' It's a question that those
who've savored a perfectly aged vintage are quick to respond to:
When it comes to wine, even a year or two of proper storage can
make all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Wine consumption, of course, is up and sales are booming _
thanks to a flush economy and a stream of reports on the health
benefits of wine _ so there are plenty of newly minted wine
fanatics in search of a reliable cellar.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that a spacious, stand-alone wine room runs
about $2,500 and a wine refrigerator with a 300-bottle capacity or
a WhisperKool system, which you install in a closet, are about
$1,000 each _ prices high enough to make even hardened wine
enthusiasts think twice.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves many budding collectors with bottles stashed under
the bed or in a closet, less than perfect cellar conditions. That
doesn't mean you can't get creative like Flaherty and other
fledgling collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Flaherty found his solution on the Internet, where wine
consumers increasingly gather in chat rooms to exchange tasting
notes and dole out advice. He discovered that many household
refrigerator thermostats have a ''range adjustment'' screw on them
that allow you to change the cooling range.
</P>
<P>
   So the 1-to-9 dial can be lowered or increased to suit a wine
bottle's particular needs
</P>
<P>
   One of Flaherty's friends donated an old fridge. He located the
screw behind the temperature gauge, bought a cheap thermometer to
read the temperatures as he adjusted the screw. Once he reached a
steady 55 degrees Fahrenheit, the ideal temperature for long-term
wine storage, Flaherty located some wooden bottle racks at a
clearance sale for $24.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Flaherty spent less than $50 on his 78-bottle ''wine
cellar,'' allowing him to invest the savings in more wine.
</P>
<P>
   Many, like Flaherty, are using the converted fridge to solve
their wine-storage problem.
</P>
<P>
   For about $400, Keith Kwasne of San Jose, Calif., converted a
commercial beverage refrigerator into a wine cellar for his
300-plus bottles. ($200 for the refrigerator, $50 for a new
thermostat and $150 for the racks).
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't look pretty, but it sits in my garage anyway,''
Kwasne says.
</P>
<P>
   These makeshift fridge cellars won't soothe every storage issue.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerators tend to vibrate and wine doesn't like to rock 'n
roll.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerators also don't control humidity, important in keeping
corks moist and securely sealed.
</P>
<P>
   But those are long-term concerns, for collectors storing wine 10
years or more.
</P>
<P>
   Advises Robin Garr, host of The Wine Lovers' Page on the Web,
''Bear in mind that 99 percent of the wine made in the world is not
intended for aging but is to be drunk up as soon as possible _
certainly within a year _ while it is still young and fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Garr lists Bordeaux, Burgundy, cabernet sauvignon and pinot noir
among those that benefit from long-term aging in an expensive wine
cellar.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who don't have the money for a fancy solution like that
don't have to despair. It's probably not practical to keep wine for
decades without a cellar, but for a year or two or even as long as
five years, you can do very well with a wine rack that holds your
wine bottles on their sides (so the cork stays wet), kept in a
relatively cool and quiet part of your house,'' he continues.
</P>
<P>
   Places to avoid? The kitchen, direct sunlight, and any part of
the house that receives a lot of foot traffic or vibrations from
the street.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Davis, a computer programmer in Columbia, Md., finds his
basement works well for storage.
</P>
<P>
   ''My basement rarely, even in Maryland summers, gets over 65
degrees with a low of 55 in winter. It's probably not good for
long-term storage but will probably work for me, as I only have
maybe two bottles I intend to let live beyond another five years,''
Davis says of his 270-bottle collection.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, if you can't afford to buy a bells-and-whistles
cellar, you probably can't afford the kind of wines you'd want to
keep for 10 or more years either.
</P>
<P>
   When Jonathan Gorman, a finance manager in Chicago, started
collecting wine nine years ago, basement storage was adequate.
Since then, his collection has grown in breadth and scale.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he stashes 30 to 40 bottles in a wine refrigerator at
home, and keeps the remaining 400-600 bottles at a personal storage
facility.
</P>
<P>
   The cost is $1 per bottle per year, and they accept deliveries
from wineries. ''While it's like sending your children to boarding
school, at least you know they are being well taken care of,''
Gorman says, displaying a level of devotion that is common among
seasoned wine devotees.
</P>
<P>
   There are hidden benefits to storing wine offsite, Gorman says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some wine-locker facilities act as wine clubs, hosting parties
where fellow aficionados can gather to trade and taste. I always
enjoy meeting the other people who are storing wine at my facility.
We obviously have at least one thing in common. Plus, it's kind of
cool to walk around the facility checking other people's
collections out. Some people you envy and some you pity. One locker
is full of Beringer white zinfandel!''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they prefer white zinfandels or aged pinot noirs, and
regardless of where their collections are stored _ be it a
renovated fridge or mahogany, 3,000 bottle storage room _ wine
collectors great and small will tell you they're constantly
thirsting for more.
</P>
<P>
   As Flaherty puts it, ''My retirement plan? Work forever, but
plan carefully to die with no unopened bottles.''
</P>
<P>
   With proper storage and the right amount of planning, that
shouldn't be a problem.

DOGS PULLING SKIERS: IT'S SKIJORING
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes color photo of people and dogs skijoring) 
 By KEN MCALPINE 
 c. 2000 Ken McAlpine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is an edge to the air, a swell of nervous energy, the sort
that speeds the heart. And if you can't feel that, there's the
raucous din of dogs near mad. Pinched cries, barks, yelps,
beseeching whines, run-on yaps, an anxiety-soaked yowling unmuted
by the snow laying thick across Fairbanks under the wide, blue
Alaska sky. Haunches twitch. Steaming noses jerk about, picking at
the sting of cold air.
</P>
<P>
   George Salmon nods.
</P>
<P>
   ''The dogs know exactly what's going on,'' he says. ''They're
ready to fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon plunges his head into the camper shell of his red Toyota
pickup and rummages around, while, Benny and Jets, 60-plus pounds
of Alaskan husky each, jerk at their chains, working to remove the
truck's bumper.
</P>
<P>
   From the back of the truck Salmon pulls out skis and a long
strand of bungie cord.
</P>
<P>
   ''Skijoring is a trip,'' Salmon says with a wide grin.
</P>
<P>
   Skijoring is a Norwegian word. It means ''ski driving,'' though
driving implies control that's not always present.
</P>
<P>
   Done correctly, skijoring works like so: dog (usually one or
two; more than that and there's even less control) and trailing
skier are connected by 7 to 12 feet of bungie cord running from the
dog's harness to a hook on the skier's belt. Skier gives the
command to go. Dog lunges forward, bungie jerks taut. If the
skijorer remains upright, off they go, dogs eagerly bunching and
unbunching in fluid surges of power, skier skiing behind.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking a brake or any kind of steering device, skijorers rely
on verbal commands, but dogs can be selective listeners. So when
skijorers compare their sport to water-skiing, it's a reasonable
analogy, except that boats don't leap into embankments to roll in
the snow or stop abruptly to pee.
</P>
<P>
   Skijoring's roots are traced to Scandinavia where Nordic-style
mushing _ teams of one to four dogs pulling a small sled called a
pulk, with the skier trailing behind _ has long been immensely
popular. But the pulk can be heavy and difficult to maneuver, so in
skijoring one simply gets rid of it.
</P>
<P>
   Scandinavian immigrants actually introduced skijoring to this
country more than a hundred years ago, hardy souls donning skis,
then schussing along behind a galloping horse. One can only imagine
the long winters that lead to such recreation, and the excitement
that ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon can do better than imagine. A boisterous fellow with an
exemplary handlebar mustache, a few years back Salmon gained local
notoriety by briefly skijoring behind eight dogs, which in Lower 48
terms is akin to strapping booster rockets to your back and
pointing them all in different directions. The attempt ended in a
giant tangle. On another occasion, skijoring with four dogs and a
pulk down a steep, narrow trail, he was yanked off his feet.
Spinning along behind, Salmon managed to align himself so that none
of his limbs whacked against the trees and rocks edging the trail.
But the sleeves of his jacket were rolled up, exposing his
forearms.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got dragged maybe a hundred yards,'' he says. ''It was
almost a third degree burn. Nearly got to the fascia. There was
blood all over the trail.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon laughs as his dogs might bark.
</P>
<P>
   ''Haw! We were really blitzing.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon may be alone in his enthusiasm, but he isn't alone in his
pursuit. North America's first skijoring club (the Alaska Skijoring
and Pulk Association) was founded in Fairbanks in 1987, and since
then the sport has spread elsewhere: to New Hampshire, New Mexico,
Arizona, Minnesota and Wisconsin _ where apparently their
ancestors' experiences with horses didn't dissuade them.
</P>
<P>
   If skijoring has an epicenter its the Salcha, Alaska, home of
Mary Hoe-Raitto. Hoe-Raitto has probably done more for skijoring in
this country than anybody. Soft-spoken and direct, she possesses
the quiet competence necessary to run her own sled dog kennel and
the firmness of character required to run off an angry moose that
has dashed into the midst of a mushing team.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in the tiny town of Fagernes, Norway, Hoe-Raitto
stewed in the Nordic passions of dogs and skiing. Arriving in
Fairbanks in 1983, she first popularized skijoring by inadvertently
introducing it to her Salcha neighbors. An expert cross-country
skier, on one occasion skijoring with two dogs, she tailed a
surprised musher, and his 20-dog team, for five miles (''He kept
looking back, expecting me to be gone.'') Another time she fell and
careened through the neighborhood for a half-mile on her belly
(''That gets people's attention.'')
</P>
<P>
   Since then she has organized skijor exhibitions, conducted
clinics, and, along with friend and fellow skijorer Carol Kaynor,
written ''Skijor With Your Dog,'' a thorough book filled with sound
advice (Take the line off your belt and hold it in your hands when
going down steep hills.)
</P>
<P>
   According to Hoe-Raitto and Kaynor, skijoring is growing by
leaps and bounds for simple reasons. It's fun, fairly safe (''Only
slightly more dangerous than cross-country skiing,'' says Kaynor),
cheap (a skijoring belt, line and dog harness cost less than $70)
and easy to do.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a skijor dog isn't hard either. Hoe-Raitto and Kaynor
tick off the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Golden retrievers. Border collies. There's lots of Australian
shepards. Labs, Chesapeake Bay retrievers, Great Danes, beagles,''
says Hoe-Raitto.
</P>
<P>
   ''Schnausers!'' says Kaynor. ''We've had a couple of giant
schnausers! Poodles too. They can pull really well.''
</P>
<P>
   By dint of temperment and genetics certain breeds _ German
short-haired and wire-haired pointers, German shepards, Irish
setters, Siberian huskies _ make good race dogs. Bassets do not.
</P>
<P>
   ''They like to stop and shake,'' says Kaynor.
</P>
<P>
   Skijoring isn't limited to dogs either. People have used
reindeer. Hoe-Raitto has seen pictures of her father and
grandfather hooking up a Norwegian elkhound and a goat.
</P>
<P>
   A skijor team on the fly can reach 22 miles an hour, which gives
the skijorer little time to account for canine idiosyncrasy. That
is why, before races, Salmon heads off what potential problems he
can. It might look like he's trotting Benny and Jets through their
warmup paces before the race begins, but it's mostly an attempt to
have them do what dogs do. Benny and Jets can perform on the fly,
but Salmon would prefer they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not something you want,'' he says. ''Plus they slow
down and that can really bring your time down.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, for one, sees a bright future for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ''People love skiing, they love the outdoors, they love dogs,''
he says. ''You're going to be seeing more and more of skijoring.
And once you see it, winter will never be the same!''

   &UR; By DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the AOL/Time Warner orgy, the media have anointed Steve
Case as the official visionary of the new media age, ruminated
about how Ted Turner (Time Warner's first wife) will handle this
second marriage, and lavished attention on AOL President Bob
Pittman, the presumed heir to the empire.
</P>
<P>
   But they have written scarcely a word about the person who will
actually run the joint: Gerald Levin, Time Warner's current CEO and
AOL Time Warner's future CEO.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal's historical review of the two
corporations included images of Case, Turner, Netscape's Marc
Andreessen, and the late Time Warner CEO Steve Ross -- but not
Levin.
</P>
<P>
   News coverage of the opening announcement mentioned Levin's
joke--flanked by the nattily clad Case, the casually dressed Levin
welcomed ``the suits from Virginia to New York''--but reporters
have otherwise dismissed Levin as the dutiful manager who will
execute the brilliant strategies devised by Case et al.
</P>
<P>
   Levin is being overlooked again, and he is surely enjoying it.
He has turned being underestimated and misunderstood into a career
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   He has always seemed the dreariest of moguls. He may control the
largest media company in the world, but he is gray next to the
vivid crimsons of Rupert Murdoch, Edgar Bronfman Jr., and Sumner
Redstone. He hardly rates a mention in Ken Auletta's infoworld
chronicles.
</P>
<P>
   Levin seems to have given himself a ``charisma bypass,'' as a
Time Warner executive quipped to the New York Times. He is
willfully invisible: He eschews limos and luxuries, avoids the
press, and makes the most mundane of public statements.
</P>
<P>
   Levin is a survivor. He has not only endured but won two decades
of brutal corporate war. No executive has been fired so often in
the press, and none has been so often declared a genius.
</P>
<P>
   Levin joined Time Inc.'s HBO division in the early '70s after a
decade in corporate law and international development. Jewish,
frumpy and intellectual (he studied the continuity between Jewish
and Christian theology at Haverford), he did not mesh with Time's
polished WASP culture.
</P>
<P>
   But he won a reputation as the house Einstein when he
revolutionized the cable TV industry in the mid-'70s. Levin
conceived the idea of distributing HBO movies to cable providers
via satellite. This revived the struggling cable channel and
allowed the creation of national cable brands.
</P>
<P>
   The next decade was rockier for Levin, as he supervised fiasco
after fiasco. (Two of his failures -- a news-on-demand ``teletext''
service and a subscription television experiment -- foreshadowed
his technological derring-do.) He was leapfrogged in the corporate
hierarchy and dropped from the Time board.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the late '80s, Levin recognized that staid Time needed
to transform itself into an entertainment company. He engineered a
merger with Ross' Warner Communications, the deal that invented the
'90s media company. A couple of years later, Levin helped topple
co-CEO and ally Nicholas Nicholas -- in a sly coup. When Ross died
in 1993, Levin took control of Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   The dry, solemn Levin remained overshadowed by the titanic Ross,
but he demonstrated a gift for holding on. During the mid-'90s,
Levin invested in cable as that industry tanked, dragging down the
company's stock price and prompting calls for his head.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 and again in 1995, Time Warner was savaged by critics
for distributing violent music, especially gangster rap. Levin was
particularly ridiculed for his self-righteous defense that Time
Warner was trying to spread provocative ideas. Then Levin lost $100
million on a disastrous experiment with interactive television in
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Time and time again, Levin has seemed on the verge of losing his
job. The stock stagnated; the money magazines called for his
sacking. But his bets paid off. The cable industry began to recover
in 1996. The gangster rap scandals blew over.
</P>
<P>
   When Levin acquired Ted Turner's empire in 1996, it was taken
for granted that flamboyant genius Turner would bulldoze Levin and
rule the new company. Instead, Turner moseyed off to Montana. The
booming economy boosted movie, music, and magazine publishing. Time
Warner's stock rebounded: It has now climbed about 700 percent
during Levin's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Levin has been underestimated in part because he has cultivated
such a diffident style. He is a man without a shadow, affectless,
egoless. He burned his own papers in college because he thought it
would be arrogant to keep them. He avoids opportunities to draw
attention to himself -- opportunities that Redstone or Barry Diller
would seize.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, for example, Time Warner announced that it would stop
contributing soft money to political parties because soft money
corrupts politics. Time Warner then gave its news operations
several million extra dollars for election coverage. Levin could
have grandstanded as a champion of political reform, but he did not
say a word. (Since his son's 1997 murder, Levin has been especially
self-effacing.)
</P>
<P>
   His enigmatic nature has won him the reputation of a
``philosopher-businessman.'' For decades he has dazzled and baffled
colleagues with cryptic statements, more Zen koan than management
advice. ``Print is our soul and heartland,'' is a typical Levinism.
</P>
<P>
   The air of rumination can seem studied: Levin told reporters
this week that he decided on the AOL merger after ``a walk in the
woods.'' In 1992, Levin said he decided that Nicholas had to leave
Time Warner after ``a walk in the woods.'' There is nothing like
walking in the woods to make a man a thinker.
</P>
<P>
   Levin's opaqueness actually masks a savage toughness. If he is a
``philosopher-businessman,'' his inspiration is Nietzsche. On the
day Ross died and Levin replaced him, Levin sacked nine members of
Time Warner's 20-person board. When Bronfman acquired 15 percent of
Time Warner and seemed poised to take it over, Levin foiled him
with a ``poison pill'' and barred him from the Time Warner board.
</P>
<P>
   Levin ruthlessly sacked his own protege and heir-apparent
Michael Fuchs when it appeared Fuchs was questioning the Turner
merger.
</P>
<P>
   All this may suggest that Levin survives only for survival's
sake. But in fact, he has been guiding Time Warner toward a very
specific and ambitious goal. He has been ruthless because he knows
exactly what Time Warner should be.
</P>
<P>
   Levin once said that the most important lesson he had learned
was not to be afraid of complex technology. He is a tech
enthusiast, and he has educated himself rigorously about its
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   His career has been defined by deep and early understanding of
how technology would change media and entertainment. He recognized
much earlier than his colleagues the importance of broadband and
consumer choice. (He pioneered ultra-choice cable with a
150-channel experiment in Queens.)
</P>
<P>
   He has been right frequently -- putting HBO on satellites,
merging Time's news with Warner's entertainment, investing in
cable.
</P>
<P>
   And he has been wrong frequently -- experimenting with teletext
years before there was demand, investing in interactive television
rather than the Internet, sinking millions into the clunky
Pathfinder Internet venture.
</P>
<P>
   But he has always pursued a coherent and prescient set of
principles: distributing the richest variety of content with the
most customer interactivity through the fattest pipes. When he was
questioned about his ``old media'' company this week, Levin noted,
perhaps peevishly, that ``I am a broadband guy. I'm an interactive
guy. I have been building networks all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The AOL merger culminates Levin's decadelong campaign to
reinvent the media company. He turned staid magazine publisher Time
Inc. into news-entertainment conglomerate Time Warner; turned that
into news-entertainment-cable kingdom Time Warner (Turner); and is
turning that into news-entertainment-cable-Internet empire AOL Time
Warner (Turner) -- the largest, most diverse media company in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The press and Wall Street are assuming that AOL Time Warner will
belong to the 41-year-old Case and 46-year-old Pittman, and that
the 60-year-old Levin will clock a few years as CEO, cash a billion
in options, and shuffle off to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But Levin outlasted and outmaneuvered the largest personalities
in his industry--Ross, Nicholas, Bronfman, Fuchs, and Turner, and
kept Time Warner headed where he wanted to go. Soon we may be
talking not about how Case got Time Warner, but how Levin got AOL.

   OAKLAND, Calif. _ A potent, pungent creature thrives in deep
plastic buckets
</P>
<P>
   at the worker-owned Arizmendi Bakery in Oakland, a 25-year-old
sourdough starter passed down from Berkeley's legendary
Cheeseboard, a cheese store, bake shop and pizzeria.
</P>
<P>
   Replenished by flour, water and faith, the beery-smelling
starter grows and grows. A bit of the starter (a symbiotic mix of
yeast and bacteria) goes into each batch of sourdough, permeating
the air with its tangy scent.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-enlarging starter is symbolic of one group's efforts to
replicate democratic bakeries in the San Francisco Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Cheeseboard loaned $20,000, its sourdough starter,
its recipes and its worker knowledge to Arizmendi in 1997, so too
will Arizmendi now assist in opening a bakery on the Ninth Avenue
in San Francisco this year.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next week, the Association of Arizmendi Cooperatives _
an organizing group with employees from the Cheeseboard, Arizmendi
and others interested in
</P>
<P>
   worker cooperatives _ will begin holding information sessions to
attract workers who knead good bread and want democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sourdough starter produces a certain culture, that when you
move to another place, can take on a life of its own,'' said Tim
Huet, who helped coordinate
</P>
<P>
   efforts to launch Arizmendi and the latest San Francisco bakery
venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to replicate a democratic business, with
good-paying jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The co-op bakeries show that workers can have their ideals and
eat, too. Last year Arizmendi rang up more than $1 million in
sales, and the Cheeseboard more than $2 million, on pizza,
chocolate goodies and zampanos. The name ``Arizmendi'' refers to a
line of Spanish worker co-ops.
</P>
<P>
   The newest bakery will join other San Francisco worker co-ops
such as the radical Bound Together Bookstore and the Good
Vibrations sex emporium.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Inner Sunset neighborhood, a vibrant restaurant
and cafe area, has rallied for the co-op bakery. After the Planning
Department erroneously classified the bakery as a fast-food joint
and rejected its application, residents gathered signatures in
support last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to support local businesses over a national chain
store,'' said Rolf Mueller, president of the Inner Sunset Merchants
Association. ``If people own their own business, they put effort
into making the business successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Though co-ops may seem a 1960s anachronism, such collectives
have flourished in the last five years, said Paul Hazen, president
and chief executive of the National Cooperative Business
Association in Washington, D.C. Today's movement has evolved to
include professionals fleeing the corporate world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is that people feel they are losing control of
their lives,'' Hazen said. ``They can control capital they have, if
they're involved with a cooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   Every employee at each store, no matter their tenure, takes the
same cut of the profits. The common hourly wage and benefits are
determined each year by the collective. At Arizmendi, workers
bumped their earnings by $3 to $13 per hour after a profitable
year.
</P>
<P>
   The co-op association's plans for expansion have some parallels
to traditional franchises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses are so hard to start. What we're trying to do is
provide a framework to be successful,'' said Steve Sutcher, 43, the
association's founder and longtime Cheeseboard worker.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike a franchise, which expands its empire by selling
know-how for thousands of dollars and taking sales royalties,
bakeries in the co-op pass along their recipes for free and provide
start-up loans and legal advice. They also start training workers
six to nine months before a store opens.
</P>
<P>
   At Arizmendi, workers initially paid a $5,000 start-up fee to
join the collective. With the bakery's success since its opening in
August 1997, the workers voted to drop the start-up fee to $3,000.
Employees have the option of paying off the debt through payroll
deduction.
</P>
<P>
   A hiring committee interviews prospective workers, looking not
so much for baking skills but an ability to operate within a
collective. They must also try out at the store for a couple hours,
to test their interactions with others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cumbersome, but worth it,'' said Bridget Berrigen, 51, of
Oakland. Though the former human relations manager now has to
report to work at 4 a.m. and lift 50 pound bags of flour, she gains
the satisfaction of group decision-making. ``We're taking on
partners, not just hiring an employee.''
</P>
<P>
   At co-ops, all workers must reach a consensus on issues that
range from how much of the profit should go back into the business
to what to include in the product line. Arizmendi shuts down
mid-afternoon on Mondays, so its roughly 16 worker-members can
meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in a co-op is harder than being employed,'' said Michael
Addison, 36, a bespectacled Oakland resident pouring eggs, flour
and butter into a giant mixer at Arizmendi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The questions are open and you provide the answer. You can't
complain about decisions made without your participation,'' Addison
said.
</P>
<P>
   That freedom allows workers to tailor their environment to their
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   At Arizmendi, co-op members agreed to celebrate holidays such as
International Worker's Day and donate some profits to charities. At
the Cheeseboard, workers used some of their profits to buy a cabin
in Mendocino.
</P>
<P>
   The co-op structure also mandates that workers rotate in all
jobs, giving them equal opportunity in baking, bookkeeping and
over-the-counter service.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Oviedo, 36, came to the United States from Nicaragua five
years ago and worked as a house cleaner until joining Arizmendi
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy they gave me the opportunity,'' Oviedo said.
``People here have (an) open mind and good humor.''

   (Timothy Noah writes Slate's Chatterbox column)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By TIMOTHY NOAH &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stuffed inside the shrink wrap alongside of February's Talk
magazine is a glossy new Benetton catalog titled ``We, on Death
Row.'' This elegant advertorial product intersperses color
photographs of death-row inmates with somber quotations about the
evils of capital punishment from Pope John Paul II, the Dalai Lama,
Martin Luther King Jr., and other giants of the fashion industry.
</P>
<P>
   The mostly one-piece garments worn by the inmates, which come in
bright hues of yellow, blue, and (especially) red--to judge from
the photos, red is the dominant color this season on death row--are
not, one presumes, actually available at Benetton outlets.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently, Benetton hopes that some of the death-row
inmates' existential glamour (``They broke the rules. They defied
the order,'' writes someone named Ken Shulman in an introductory
essay) will rub off on the retail clothing chain.
</P>
<P>
   According to a press release posted on Benetton's home page,
Benetton is launching a campaign that is ``about the death penalty.
Leaving aside any social, political, judicial or moral
consideration (!), this project aims at showing to the public the
reality of capital punishment, so that no one around the world,
(sic) will consider the death penalty neither (sic) as (sic) a
distant problem nor (sic) as (sic) news that occasionally appear
(sic) on TV. ... The campaign will appear on billboards and on the
pages of the major news publications in Europe, America and Asia in
January 2000. ... With this new initiative, Benetton has once again
chosen to look reality in the face by tackling a social issue, as
it did in previous campaigns that focused on war, Aids,
discrimination and racism. Bitterly attacked by some and
internationally acclaimed by others, Benetton's campaigns have
managed to tear down the wall of indifference contributing at (sic)
raising the awareness of universal problems among world's (sic)
citizens. At the same time, they have paved the way for innovative
modes of corporate communication.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong; like Benetton, I'm is opposed to capital
punishment. But its attempt to harness this principled stand to the
selling of high-necked mohair sweaters, Peruvian folk ponchos, and
lycra-lined lace panties does tend to trivialize the issue (in much
the same way that its previous campaigns trivialized war, AIDS,
discrimination, and racism).
</P>
<P>
   The catalog also objectifies real people. Looking at the photos
of murderers awaiting execution, one feels invited to ask--are they
human beings? Or are they objets de couture?
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Benetton would consider this characterization terribly
unfair. After all, it didn't just put together a bunch of
photographs; it also hired Ken Shulman (``a free-lance journalist
who works for Newsweek,'' according to the Web press release) to
conduct interviews with the inmates. Here are some of the questions
Shulman asked:
</P>
<P>
   --What does this place sound like at night?
</P>
<P>
   --What did you think of Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   --What's it like when you lose a person you've been close to?
</P>
<P>
   --What's wrong with the world today?
</P>
<P>
   --Do you think you're unlucky?
</P>
<P>
   --What is your favorite part of the Bible?
</P>
<P>
   --Do you miss real food?
</P>
<P>
   Here are some questions Shulman never asked (or, if he did,
never included in the final version):
</P>
<P>
   --Why did you kill that person?
</P>
<P>
   --Would you be sorry you killed if you'd never been caught?
</P>
<P>
   --Can you imagine circumstances in which you'd kill again?
</P>
<P>
   According to a note at the end of the catalog, ``Individuals
were not permitted to speak about the crime, guilt or innocence, or
prison conditions unless specifically requested by their
attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   Benetton might just as well have added, ``And we had no interest
in discussing these crimes with the families of the murder
victims.''
</P>
<P>
   The prison inmates may be objectified, but the people they
killed don't seem to exist at all.
</P>
<P>
   Especially perplexing is Benetton's reluctance to
investigate--even inquire about--the guilt or innocence of these
death-row inmates. The judicial system's tendency to mark the odd
innocent soul for death is, after all, one of the more powerful
arguments against capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it seemed that Benetton didn't probe individual cases
because it didn't want to demonstrate that most death-row inmates
are indeed guilty. (Not even the most bleeding-heart death-penalty
opponent would dispute that.) On reflection, though, it's possible
that Benetton's fear is more likely the opposite: It doesn't want
to find any innocent men or women. The point, after all, is to be
outre.
</P>
<P>
   Killers are outre. Wrongly accused prison inmates are merely
tragic. Imagine trying to sell a pair of shantung trousers with the
pitch, ``It will make you look like a victim!''

&HT;     TICKET SALES SLOW FOR WINTER GOODWILL GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JAMES M. ODATO  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A month from now New York will host an
international sporting event in Lake Placid for which state
taxpayers invested more than $23 million during the past two years.
But so far just 5,000 reserved tickets have been sold for the first
Winter Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,000 are part of about 24,000 advanced tickets made
available for the only reserved seats required, the figure-skating
events. The $25 seats went on sale in early October for the Feb.
17-20 games, according to Olympic Regional Development Authority
(ORDA) officials.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the opening ceremony on the evening of Feb. 16 went
on sale Friday. The ceremony will include music by Bruce Hornsby
and Edwin McCain, and will cost $30 per seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the least indicative of (success) . . . are the
number of tickets sold,'' said Republican Assemblyman Chris Ortloff
of Plattsburgh, N.Y., a former member of the Lake Placid village
board and the 1980 Winter Olympics Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an event, like the Olympics, that was built for
worldwide television viewers. It should be judged by the number of
viewers and the ratings and the long-term enhancement of the
worldwide reputation of the community. (It's) almost like the
return of having a motion picture shot in your community,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Goodwill Games, to be given 16 hours of coverage on TNT,
will be held at former Olympic venues in the Lake Placid region and
will feature 11 winter sports.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of New York Gov. George Pataki, the
facilities have been substantially upgraded. The biggest projects
include a $5 million, high-speed gondola to carry people up and
down the Whiteface Mountain downhill skiing facility and an $18
million, revamped luge and bobsled run on Mt. VanHoevenberg. The
$18 million was part of a $24 million investment on the track that
included federal funds of about $6 million. Work is nearing
completion.
</P>
<P>
   This week Pataki proposed an increased operating budget for
ORDA, the state authority that runs the competition sites used in
the 1980 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said New York taxpayers should finance 31 percent, or
$7.6 million, of the authority's $24.2 million proposed operating
budget. That's up from almost $6.3 million in general fund support
of ORDA in the fiscal year that ends March 31, during which the
governor provided another $8.3 million to beef up facilities needed
for the Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a long term investment,'' said Sandy Caligiore, a
spokesman for ORDA.
</P>
<P>
   The Goodwill Games, with the support of Turner Broadcasting
System, Inc. and parent company Time Warner Inc., are the key
organizers of the event, and they are underwriting the
entertainment costs for the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Caligiore said ORDA will receive all gate revenues from the
opening event and the sporting events. He added that about 30,000
ticket sales will be needed to break even on security and other
staff added for the events.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first ever Winter Goodwill Games. It's a new
brand. So we're trying to sell that brand,'' Caligiore said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of ORDA, he said, is to promote and create business in
the region. ``We hope we get 12,000 to 15,000 tourists _ overnight
and day-trippers. Then we would be creating a day that is very
similar to a busy summer day. If we create that for the town, than
we would have been successful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another goal, he said, is to promote the village as a
world-class winter sports capital and a potential future Olympics
site.
</P>
<P>
   The Lake Placid/Essex County Visitors Bureau reports that 75
percent of the 2,500 rooms in the region within 10 miles of the
village are booked, many by athletes and crews associated with the
games and the television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the 11-sport event range in price from $5 for many
general admission competitions to $46 for a Whiteface skiing pass.
About 150,000 tickets will be available for sale for the five days.
</P>
<P>
   William Curren, an Adirondack Park Agency executive, said 50,000
visitors are expected during the four days of competition.

&HT;     AT&AMP;T, EXCITE AT HOME BID MAKES SENSE AFTER AOL MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The dot-com dating game is heating up in the
aftermath of America Online's proposed purchase of Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Redwood City-based Excite At Home jumped 19 percent
Thursday on rumors of a possible liaison with AT&AMP;T Corp., which
already owns 40 percent of the Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman Brothers investment analyst Vik Grover wrote a report
that helped fuel the speculation. He said by acquiring the smaller
company, AT&AMP;T would strengthen its position by acquiring Excite At
Home's Internet portal and its service of providing Internet access
over cable television lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AOL-Time Warner deal supports our belief that ownership of
content is becoming critical to the success of telecommunications
companies worldwide,'' Grover wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies declined to comment on Grover's report.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Grover explained the logic behind his
prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AOL takeover of Time Warner in our view raises the bar for
AT&AMP;T,'' said Grover, whose New York-based firm specializes in
telecommunications. ``If you look at the technology space and
what's going on, there's a massive poker game going on. The
AOL-Time Warner merger is a major bet on the cable space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that this merger moves a number of issues to the front
burner for AT&AMP;T,'' Grover said.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, it forces AT&AMP;T's hand with regard to the delivery of
Internet services over existing cable lines. Time Warner's
Roadrunner service, which does just that, is the only major
competitor to Excite At Home's cable modem technology, which
pioneered the delivery of the Net through copper cable wires,
Grover said.
</P>

   Microsoft is involved, too, having invested $5 billion last year
in AT&AMP;T's Internet efforts.

<P>
   With that investment bearing little fruit, he said, AT&AMP;T is
feeling pressure from Microsoft to make a stronger Internet play.
Excite At Home would serve that purpose, said Grover, creating an
on-line triumvirate that could rival AOL-Time Warner.

&HT;     SURVEYS SHOW INTERNET HOLIDAY SHOPPING WAY UP IN 1999 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite complaints about out-of-stock items and late deliveries,
surveys show that consumers spent even more on line this past
holiday season than many analysts had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best-known on-line market research firms, New
York-based Jupiter Communications, reported holiday shoppers spent
$7 billion between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31, up from $3.1 million for the
same period in 1998 and even higher than the $6 million Jupiter
projected.
</P>
<P>
   And even amid reports of on-line retailers that couldn't deliver
on their promises, consumers said they liked shopping on line.
</P>
<P>
   The Jupiter report found 90 percent of 810 shoppers interviewed
were ``largely satisfied'' with their on line experience, up from
74 percent in 1998. Only 4 percent said they would decrease their
on-line spending in 2000 based on this past season's experience.
</P>
<P>
   In another survey, PC Data Online estimated shoppers spent $5
billion between Nov. 14 and Dec. 31. The Reston, Va.-based company
tracks the on-line activity of 100,000 home computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers may be higher than some expectations, but overly
optimistic projections made early in the season put some estimates
over the $10 billion mark. Part of the enthusiasm was tied to the
strong economy and high expectations at traditional stores, which
were borne out last week when retailers reported their highest
numbers in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Commerce estimates that consumers spent
$259.6 billion in December, both on line and off. That is a 9.7
percent increase from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   PC Data Online released a satisfaction survey, which was
conducted with Goldman Sachs, that found 97 percent of shoppers
said they would buy through on-line companies again. In the survey
of 4,742 Internet shoppers, 95.6 percent reported their experience
``met, exceeded or significantly exceeded'' their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Meierhoefer, an e-commerce analyst for PC Data Online,
said he suspected the inability of some retailers _ most notably
Toys R Us and Wal-Mart _ to meet stock and delivery needs this
season as well as complaints by consumers over poor customer
service and long downloading times were more the exception than the
norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised. Most people were pretty happy with their
experience,'' Meierhoefer said. He said he was also surprised by
the breadth of what people were buying over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was the concentration of spending in the traditional
gift categories _ toys, electronics, apparel _ but that flowed over
to some non-traditional sites like drugstores. I think people got
intrigued by all that was available out there,'' said Meierhoefer,
adding that the addition of well-known brands and retailers to the
Web also contributed to increased consumer confidence in cyber
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix Inc., a New York-based company that tracked the
most popular sites, crowned Amazon.com Inc. the top e-commerce site
for the five-week period from Nov. 14 through Dec. 26. Amazon was
followed closely by eBay Inc. and then, after a considerable drop
in numbers, eToys Inc., barnesandnoble.com and Toysrus.com.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: On the baby-go-round
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ So far this year, I'm averaging a new grandson
every week.
</P>
<P>
   First came William Joseph Langston, son of my daughter Kate and
her husband, Keith, born New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's Edward Wesley Bonner, son of my daughter Erin and
her husband, Jessie, born Jan. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Both are named for their grandfathers _ my middle name is Edward
_ and everybody is doing just fine. Never mind that it's put a lot
of miles on me.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, who has been in Waco helping with William Joseph,
called on the morning of Jan. 13 to tell me the other baby was on
the way, and for me to come get her and we'd drive from there to
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   There was no real reason to rush. By the time I got to Waco,
word had reached us that Edward Wesley already had made his
appearance. The two hours to Dallas were interstate all the way, a
hard fight but I won. All the while the mix-master in downtown Big
D was waiting for me.
</P>
<P>
   Any city where interstates intersect ought to be closed off,
paved over and boarded up. It's the traffic jam that never jells.
Makes no difference if you arrive at high noon or 3 a.m., cars will
be backed up to the suburbs of El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   All the way to Dallas, my wife hadn't said a word. Old married
couples are that way. We can go 100 miles without acknowledging
each other's presence. Now, all of a sudden, she was making
conversation that only made things worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that tall building? Isn't that a hotel? Didn't we stay
there one time? ... That sign said 45. I thought we were supposed
to be on 30. ... Are you in the right lane? The others are moving
faster. ... I think there's a wreck up ahead. I bet a lot of cars
ran together. Yes, I'm right. Look at all those smashed cars. ...
Why is that man honking at us? I'm going to give him a dirty
look.''
</P>
<P>
   We made it past the mix-master, past the tall building where we
may have stayed before, past all those wrecked cars, past the man
who blew his horn at us ... and, finding our way onto I-30,
eventually found the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Wesley is one fine looking boy. At 6 pounds, 11 ounces,
he has hands like catcher's mitts and feet the size of snowshoes. I
have no doubt he'll follow in his father's footsteps. His father
wears size 15 shoes.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, be it noted that husband Jessie distinguished
himself in the delivery room. I have it from the highest authority,
my daughter Erin. He even assisted the doctor's staff with
recording vital signs and such.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when he and I were alone, he asked if I ever had to be in
the delivery room for the birth of any of my three daughters. I
told him no, that back then the man's responsibility ended at the
curbside. All that was expected of the husband was to get his wife
to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Jessie sighed. ``That sounds a lot easier,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I shrugged. ``It depended on the traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   My wife stayed in Dallas to help with the baby when they come
home from the hospital. I drove on back to Lufkin that night. It
had been a round trip of 500 miles. I made it a point to honk and
wave when I met myself coming.

 &HT;    Photographer keeps MLK's image, ideas alive

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Flip Schulke last saw Martin Luther King
Jr. alive in late 1967.
</P>
<P>
   King was flying from Atlanta to Montgomery, Ala., to serve jail
time for trespassing during marches in Birmingham. King had asked
Schulke, a freelance photographer chronicling the civil-rights
movement, to come along.
</P>
<P>
   Schulke sat down next to King and told him he was worried. Why
was he was moving about through airports and other public places
with so much advance notice? Racial tension was flaring, and
Schulke had heard talk about the need to ``get rid of Martin Luther
King.''
</P>
<P>
   King sat with a Bible on his lap. He said he was sure he would
be around as long as God wanted him to be.
</P>
<P>
   The photographer replied that he didn't place that much trust in
the Almighty.
</P>
<P>
   King looked at Schulke and said: ``We're going to talk about
your faith.'' And the Baptist preacher, who already had plenty to
worry about, proceded to minister to the photographer.
</P>
<P>
   Schulke, now 69, chokes up at the memory. ``He was more
concerned about me than his own troubles,'' he says at his office
in West Palm Beach. ``It's hard to talk about it sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The next time Schulke saw King was in a coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Life magazine ran his memorable photo of Coretta Scott King,
veiled and grieving at her husband's funeral, her chin held high,
on its cover. For his effort, Schulke won a first place in the
prestigious Pictures of the Year competition. But he had lost a
hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. King was the greatest man I ever met,'' he says. ``By
far.''
</P>
<P>
   Flip Schulke was one of the most influential photojournalists of
the civil-rights movement, shooting primarily for Life. His
friendship with and access to King helped get the movement's
message out across the land. The two met in 1958 after a rally in
Miami, staying up all night to talk about civil rights. The talk
forged a trust between them.
</P>
<P>
   King was 29, and Schulke was 28.
</P>
<P>
   Schulke, who turns 70 in June, doesn't shoot anymore. He has
lost some feeling in his legs, and going up a flight of stairs is
difficult for him, never mind the nimbleness photojournalism
requires. Still, he projects vitality and passion and remains
deeply committed to King's teachings of nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to claim to be a goody two-shoes,'' he says.
``It's a matter of trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulke is immersed in a half-million-dollar project to place
his archive of more than 300,000 photos _ including 11,000 related
to King and the civil-rights movement _ at the Center for American
History at the University of Texas. Some 9,000 of his pictures will
be digitized on CD-ROM. ``I'm just trying to do my little bit to
keep history accurate,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year project is funded by the University of Texas
primarily and Macalester College, Schulke's alma mater in St. Paul,
Minn. Initially only students in those two states will have access
to the photos, but Schulke hopes that eventually all students will.
</P>
<P>
   Schulke also is working on his seventh book, this one about the
Berlin Wall. His latest book, ``Muhammad Ali: The Birth of a
Legend: Miami, 1961-1964,'' was published last fall. ``He's
committed to journalism and to a general fight for justice,'' says
Matt Schudel, co-author of the Ali book. ``He's not out there just
to take pretty pictures. He wants his photographs to make a
difference in how the world works.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulke, who never joined a staff but worked as a freelancer and
kept the copyrights to all his photos, covered more than the
civil-rights movement. He shot pre-Castro Cuba, sports figures, the
space program, auto racing, hurricanes and the rise and fall of the
Berlin Wall. Associated his whole career with the Black Star photo
agency, he has contributed not only to Life but also to Time,
Newsweek, National Geographic, Jet, Ebony and many other magazines.
</P>
<P>
   But it is his vast and powerful collection of images of the
civil-rights movement for which is he most recognized. By virtue of
his passion for the cause, he had thorough access to some of the
major figures of the time, visiting King, for instance, at home
many times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was more than someone with a camera,'' says U.S. Rep. John
Lewis, D-Atlanta, a civil-rights activist who knew Schulke in the
'60s. ``The photographs that he made are some of the most powerful
images of that period. ... He was so talented, and at the same time
he was very committed and dedicated to the ideal of a just and open
society.'' Covering the civil-rights movement in the South was
dangerous work, even for a white man. ``I was very careful,''
Schulke says. ``I had short hair, and I kept my mouth shut.'' A
naturally talkative man, Schulke feared his Northern accent would
give him away. Even taking precautions, Schulke was threatened by
hostile whites, tear-gassed by police, and locked in squad cars so
he couldn't shoot demonstrations. On assignment in the South, he
rented Cadillacs because they could outrun pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   If Schulke's admiration of King violated journalism's goal of
absolute objectivity, it was because the photographer felt the
cause was right and violence and racism were wrong. Period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very strongly that you don't win anything by hitting
people,'' Schulke says. His own difficult childhood reinforced his
ideals. His alcoholic father was so abusive that at 15 Schulke ran
away from home in New Hampshire to live with relatives in Ulm,
Minn. ``I've never told anybody about the worst parts of the
violence. It would just make me feel bad _ for him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ulm, he took up gymnastics, earning the name he has gone by
for more than half a century: ``Flip.'' (His given name is Phelps.)
At 17, Flip sold his first photos. He'd snapped pictures with his
first camera, a Baby Brownie Special, of a town parade, then
discovered that people would pay for copies. He used his earnings
to buy a better camera.
</P>
<P>
   Today he's a tall man, 6 foot 3, with sparkling eyes and long
gray hair combed back from his forehead. He has traveled the world,
and is married, for the fourth time. Days and nights on the road
took a toll on his earlier marriages. Softly he says they were
``the only failures in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   As a sought-after freelancer, Schulke could pick his assignments
_ or refuse them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, a federal court ordered Alabama Gov. George Wallace to
integrate schools in Mobile, Montgomery and Huntsville. Life sent
Schulke and a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Schulke was shooting in Wallace's office when the governor,
using a degrading racial slur, talked about deploying the state
police to keep blacks out of white schools. Wallace assumed what
was said would go unreported because the Life reporter had been
ushered from the office. But Schulke excused himself and went to
the men's room, where he told the reporter what he had heard.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Schulke was banned from the governor's office, but that was
fine with him. He told Life he couldn't photograph Wallace with any
fairness, anyway, because he disliked him so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a mean face, and it was very hard to make good pictures
of him _ besides mean pictures,'' Schulke said.
</P>
<P>
   Access is crucial for any journalist. King, in particular, had a
way of giving it to the empathetic photographer from Life. King was
intent on urging photojournalists to record the suffering of
American blacks so other Americans would know. ``King had a very
savvy appreciation about how ... very politically important the
photojournalism coverage was,'' says David J. Garrow, a historian
and expert on King at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important to get these images out across the land to
build up the political and moral support for the movement,'' Lewis
says. Without the media, people leading the movement ``would have
been like birds without wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Schulke, whose family lived in Miami, couldn't make it
home for weekends, and King would invite him to his Atlanta home
for Sunday lunch after church. Schulke, who like King had four
children and loved fried chicken, usually left his cameras in the
car. But the November 1964 day King learned he had won the Nobel
Peace Prize, King invited Schulke to bring in the cameras. Schulke
snapped intimate photos of the King family at the dining table,
with a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi looking over them, and of King
playing with his children in the yard. ``He loved his family,''
Schulke says.
</P>
<P>
   The year earlier, he visited another civil-rights leader's home,
but under much different circumstances. Medgar Evers, of the NAACP,
had been gunned down in front of his house in Jackson, Miss. When
Schulke got there, reporters and photographers were camped outside.
Schulke knocked on the door, and Myrlie Evers let him in, he says.
He was the only member of the press with access to the family.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Evers and her children went to the funeral home to
view Evers's body, Schulke was there. He disliked intruding, he
says, but remembered King's words about documenting the pain.
Still, he couldn't hold back his tears. Four years later, Myrlie
Evers published her book ``For Us, the Living.'' In it she
describes the day she stood at her husband's casket:
</P>
<P>
   I sensed that I was not alone. I turned and the Life
photographer was there. His eyes were filled with tears. For the
first time since Medgar's death the hatred I had felt for all
whites was gone. It never returned.
</P>
<P>
   These days, to Schulke's delight, his photos are selling well as
art photography, and at least one celebrity has opened his wallet.
Last spring, at a show in Manhattan, Jerry Seinfeld bought works
featuring John F. Kennedy at the Orange Bowl, Schulke says. ``I'm
name-dropping,'' he says with a laugh, ``but it impressed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulke himself focuses on impressing students. He carries
King's message of nonviolence _ and 160 slides from the
civil-rights movement _ to schools throughout Palm Beach County,
under the aegis of the local attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes history come alive,'' says Renalda Mack, chief of the
attorney general's civil rights unit.
</P>
<P>
   A West Palm Beach high school girl wrote to Schulke: ``I was
really troubled about something that someone did to me and I wanted
to get revenge. But after listening to you talk in our class I
changed my mind about the whole situation. I've decided just to
drop it. ... Thanks for helping me decide on doing the right things
in life.''
</P>
<P>
   When Schulke organized his slide show for students, he included
images of King in death. But he was careful not to end the
presentation there. Instead he shows a barrage of pictures of the
living King: the father playing with his children, the minister
smiling while leaving church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he's not dead,'' Schulke says, tears shining in his
eyes again. ``His spirit isn't dead.''

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Flip Schulke last saw Martin Luther King
Jr. alive in late 1967.
</P>
<P>
   King was flying from Atlanta to Montgomery, Ala., to serve jail
time for trespassing during marches in Birmingham. King had asked
Schulke, a freelance photographer chronicling the civil-rights
movement, to come along.
</P>
<P>
   Schulke sat down next to King and told him he was worried. Why
was he was moving about through airports and other public places
with so much advance notice? Racial tension was flaring, and
Schulke had heard talk about the need to ``get rid of Martin Luther
King.''
</P>
<P>
   King sat with a Bible on his lap. He said he was sure he would
be around as long as God wanted him to be.
</P>
<P>
   The photographer replied that he didn't place that much trust in
the Almighty.
</P>
<P>
   King looked at Schulke and said: ``We're going to talk about
your faith.'' And the Baptist preacher, who already had plenty to
worry about, proceded to minister to the photographer.
</P>
<P>
   Schulke, now 69, chokes up at the memory. ``He was more
concerned about me than his own troubles,'' he says at his office
in West Palm Beach. ``It's hard to talk about it sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The next time Schulke saw King was in a coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Life magazine ran his memorable photo of Coretta Scott King,
veiled and grieving at her husband's funeral, her chin held high,
on its cover. For his effort, Schulke won a first place in the
prestigious Pictures of the Year competition. But he had lost a
hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. King was the greatest man I ever met,'' he says. ``By
far.''
</P>
<P>
   Flip Schulke was one of the most influential photojournalists of
the civil-rights movement, shooting primarily for Life. His
friendship with and access to King helped get the movement's
message out across the land. The two met in 1958 after a rally in
Miami, staying up all night to talk about civil rights. The talk
forged a trust between them.
</P>
<P>
   King was 29, and Schulke was 28.
</P>
<P>
   Schulke, who turns 70 in June, doesn't shoot anymore. He has
lost some feeling in his legs, and going up a flight of stairs is
difficult for him, never mind the nimbleness photojournalism
requires. Still, he projects vitality and passion and remains
deeply committed to King's teachings of nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to claim to be a goody two-shoes,'' he says.
``It's a matter of trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulke is immersed in a half-million-dollar project to place
his archive of more than 300,000 photos _ including 11,000 related
to King and the civil-rights movement _ at the Center for American
History at the University of Texas. Some 9,000 of his pictures will
be digitized on CD-ROM. ``I'm just trying to do my little bit to
keep history accurate,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year project is funded by the University of Texas
primarily and Macalester College, Schulke's alma mater in St. Paul,
Minn. Initially only students in those two states will have access
to the photos, but Schulke hopes that eventually all students will.
</P>
<P>
   Schulke also is working on his seventh book, this one about the
Berlin Wall. His latest book, ``Muhammad Ali: The Birth of a
Legend: Miami, 1961-1964,'' was published last fall. ``He's
committed to journalism and to a general fight for justice,'' says
Matt Schudel, co-author of the Ali book. ``He's not out there just
to take pretty pictures. He wants his photographs to make a
difference in how the world works.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulke, who never joined a staff but worked as a freelancer and
kept the copyrights to all his photos, covered more than the
civil-rights movement. He shot pre-Castro Cuba, sports figures, the
space program, auto racing, hurricanes and the rise and fall of the
Berlin Wall. Associated his whole career with the Black Star photo
agency, he has contributed not only to Life but also to Time,
Newsweek, National Geographic, Jet, Ebony and many other magazines.
</P>
<P>
   But it is his vast and powerful collection of images of the
civil-rights movement for which is he most recognized. By virtue of
his passion for the cause, he had thorough access to some of the
major figures of the time, visiting King, for instance, at home
many times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was more than someone with a camera,'' says U.S. Rep. John
Lewis, D-Atlanta, a civil-rights activist who knew Schulke in the
'60s. ``The photographs that he made are some of the most powerful
images of that period. ... He was so talented, and at the same time
he was very committed and dedicated to the ideal of a just and open
society.'' Covering the civil-rights movement in the South was
dangerous work, even for a white man. ``I was very careful,''
Schulke says. ``I had short hair, and I kept my mouth shut.'' A
naturally talkative man, Schulke feared his Northern accent would
give him away. Even taking precautions, Schulke was threatened by
hostile whites, tear-gassed by police, and locked in squad cars so
he couldn't shoot demonstrations. On assignment in the South, he
rented Cadillacs because they could outrun pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   If Schulke's admiration of King violated journalism's goal of
absolute objectivity, it was because the photographer felt the
cause was right and violence and racism were wrong. Period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very strongly that you don't win anything by hitting
people,'' Schulke says. His own difficult childhood reinforced his
ideals. His alcoholic father was so abusive that at 15 Schulke ran
away from home in New Hampshire to live with relatives in Ulm,
Minn. ``I've never told anybody about the worst parts of the
violence. It would just make me feel bad _ for him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ulm, he took up gymnastics, earning the name he has gone by
for more than half a century: ``Flip.'' (His given name is Phelps.)
At 17, Flip sold his first photos. He'd snapped pictures with his
first camera, a Baby Brownie Special, of a town parade, then
discovered that people would pay for copies. He used his earnings
to buy a better camera.
</P>
<P>
   Today he's a tall man, 6 foot 3, with sparkling eyes and long
gray hair combed back from his forehead. He has traveled the world,
and is married, for the fourth time. Days and nights on the road
took a toll on his earlier marriages. Softly he says they were
``the only failures in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   As a sought-after freelancer, Schulke could pick his assignments
_ or refuse them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, a federal court ordered Alabama Gov. George Wallace to
integrate schools in Mobile, Montgomery and Huntsville. Life sent
Schulke and a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Schulke was shooting in Wallace's office when the governor,
using a degrading racial slur, talked about deploying the state
police to keep blacks out of white schools. Wallace assumed what
was said would go unreported because the Life reporter had been
ushered from the office. But Schulke excused himself and went to
the men's room, where he told the reporter what he had heard.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Schulke was banned from the governor's office, but that was
fine with him. He told Life he couldn't photograph Wallace with any
fairness, anyway, because he disliked him so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a mean face, and it was very hard to make good pictures
of him _ besides mean pictures,'' Schulke said.
</P>
<P>
   Access is crucial for any journalist. King, in particular, had a
way of giving it to the empathetic photographer from Life. King was
intent on urging photojournalists to record the suffering of
American blacks so other Americans would know. ``King had a very
savvy appreciation about how ... very politically important the
photojournalism coverage was,'' says David J. Garrow, a historian
and expert on King at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important to get these images out across the land to
build up the political and moral support for the movement,'' Lewis
says. Without the media, people leading the movement ``would have
been like birds without wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Schulke, whose family lived in Miami, couldn't make it
home for weekends, and King would invite him to his Atlanta home
for Sunday lunch after church. Schulke, who like King had four
children and loved fried chicken, usually left his cameras in the
car. But the November 1964 day King learned he had won the Nobel
Peace Prize, King invited Schulke to bring in the cameras. Schulke
snapped intimate photos of the King family at the dining table,
with a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi looking over them, and of King
playing with his children in the yard. ``He loved his family,''
Schulke says.
</P>
<P>
   The year earlier, he visited another civil-rights leader's home,
but under much different circumstances. Medgar Evers, of the NAACP,
had been gunned down in front of his house in Jackson, Miss. When
Schulke got there, reporters and photographers were camped outside.
Schulke knocked on the door, and Myrlie Evers let him in, he says.
He was the only member of the press with access to the family.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Evers and her children went to the funeral home to
view Evers's body, Schulke was there. He disliked intruding, he
says, but remembered King's words about documenting the pain.
Still, he couldn't hold back his tears. Four years later, Myrlie
Evers published her book ``For Us, the Living.'' In it she
describes the day she stood at her husband's casket:
</P>
<P>
   I sensed that I was not alone. I turned and the Life
photographer was there. His eyes were filled with tears. For the
first time since Medgar's death the hatred I had felt for all
whites was gone. It never returned.
</P>
<P>
   These days, to Schulke's delight, his photos are selling well as
art photography, and at least one celebrity has opened his wallet.
Last spring, at a show in Manhattan, Jerry Seinfeld bought works
featuring John F. Kennedy at the Orange Bowl, Schulke says. ``I'm
name-dropping,'' he says with a laugh, ``but it impressed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulke himself focuses on impressing students. He carries
King's message of nonviolence _ and 160 slides from the
civil-rights movement _ to schools throughout Palm Beach County,
under the aegis of the local attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes history come alive,'' says Renalda Mack, chief of the
attorney general's civil rights unit.
</P>
<P>
   A West Palm Beach high school girl wrote to Schulke: ``I was
really troubled about something that someone did to me and I wanted
to get revenge. But after listening to you talk in our class I
changed my mind about the whole situation. I've decided just to
drop it. ... Thanks for helping me decide on doing the right things
in life.''
</P>
<P>
   When Schulke organized his slide show for students, he included

presentation there. Instead he shows a barrage of pictures of the
living King: the father playing with his children, the minister
smiling while leaving church.

&HT;     COMMUNITY LEADERS WARY OF CENSUS CLAIMS THAT THE COUNT WILL BE
ACCURATE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JULIE CHAO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The director of the U.S. Census Bureau has come
to town to make sure that Census 2000 does not repeat the disaster
of the last decade, in which 837,000 Californians, a
disproportionate number of them children and immigrants, were
missed.
</P>
<P>
   However, despite Kenneth Prewitt's assurances that he is
committed to getting an accurate count, some community leaders
expressed concerns at a local forum in Oakland on Thursday, saying
grass-roots groups are being left out and the national media
campaign is not reaching its intended targets.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, a state census committee met in Sacramento to
announce how $24.7 million allocated last July for census outreach
will be distributed.
</P>
<P>
   With millions of census questionnaires set to be mailed out in
mid-March, community groups are eager for the money to be
distributed as quickly as possible so that hard-to-reach groups
such as immigrants, ethnic minorities and homeless will be ready
and willing to fill them out.
</P>
<P>
   Massive demographic shifts in the last decade, spurred largely
by immigration from Asia and Latin America, will help make the
United States a majority-minority country by 2050, when no racial
group will make up more than 50 percent of the population, Prewitt
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are creating the first world nation, the first country made
up of people from every other country,'' he said. ``We need a
complete picture if we're going to build the kind of society we
want to build.''
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting Thursday morning hosted by U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee,
D-Calif, Prewitt met with about 40 East San Francisco Bay clergy
members to discuss ways they can encourage their congregation to
return census forms.
</P>
<P>
   At an afternoon meeting with community members involved in the
census count in Oakland and Alameda County, several people
complained that the Census Bureau's national media strategy was not
reaching African Americans in the East Bay.
</P>
<P>
   To lead the $160 million ad campaign, the Census Bureau hired
the New York advertising firm Young &AMP; Rubicam, which then
subcontracted with four ad agencies to target the main minority
groups _ blacks, Asians, Latinos and American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   As for reaching East Bay blacks, a single one-page ad in the
Oakland Post, a black-owned newspaper, ran last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Dillard, president of the Oakland Black Board of Trade and
Commerce, said no other ads have run on the radio or TV stations
most popular with African Americans in the East Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to do this repetitively to get people's consciousness
level raised,'' said Dillard. ``We get one shot at this. If we
don't do it right, we get 10 years to suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt responded that he expected the second phase of the media
campaign, which is just rolling out, to have more targeted ads.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said part of the problem is that the ad campaign, led by the
New York-based Chisholm-Mingo Group, which specializes in reaching
black audiences, is skewed toward the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Congressional Black Caucus is engaged in ``daily
warfare'' on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed the requirement wasn't there to contract
with regional advertising agencies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Sacramento, the California Complete Count Committee, created
by Gov. Gray Davis last November, divvied up $24.7 million
allocated by the legislature last summer for census outreach.
</P>
<P>
   Among the disbursements, it will give $5 million to individual
counties, $3.9 million to community groups and $1.2 million for
school-based outreach efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Wang, policy director of Chinese for Affirmative Action, a
San Francisco civil rights group, said that because the state took
longer than expected to decide how to spend the $24.7 million, it
will be a challenge for community groups and counties to reach
hard-to-count groups.

HILLARY SCORES, DAVE EaSES UP, BUSH ROLLS ON 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Random comments on people in the news:
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY CLINTON: The first lady may be losing _ or at least
trailing in the polls _ in her still-unofficial campaign for the
U.S. Senate, but she scored a resounding victory in her highly
hyped appearance on David Letterman's TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton traded quips with the host, breezed through a quiz on
New York minutiae such as the state bird, offered her own version
of a Letterman Top Ten List and sneaked in a clever cheap shot on
her expected opponent in the Senate race, New York City Mayor Rudy
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Her best line came in response to Letterman's comment that
``every idiot in the area'' would be driving by her house and
honking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was that you?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary is as smart as her boosters say she is, she'll get
herself booked on the Letterman show as often as he'll have her.
</P>
<P>
   DAVID LETTERMAN: Some of the morning-after babblemeisters were
critical of Dave for parking his usual slashing sarcasm and giving
Hillary a free ride with softball questions and hanging-curve
straight lines that a trained chimp could have hit out of the park.
So what's wrong with that?
</P>
<P>
   Hillary is the nation's first lady, after all, and Letterman had
been carving her up for weeks. Giving her a break was the decent
thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ELIAN GONZALEZ: Do you suppose any of the folks who want to
decide what happens to this kid have given a moment's thought to
what he wants? All these politicians, bureaucrats, activists and
even relatives who claim to have his best interests at heart know
exactly what sort of life they want for Elian, but none seems
interested in what he wants for himself. He must have an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   JANET RENO: The attorney general has hardly been the epitome of
decisiveness where Elian Gonzalez is concerned, but Reno made a
statement Thursday that ought to guide the decision-making of all
those involved in the controversy: ``The issue is a father who
wants his son home and grandparents who want their grandson home,
and these are bonds that should be honored.''
</P>
<P>
   That is definitely the issue. So why can't the world's lone
remaining superpower figure out a way to do the right thing for a
6-year-old boy who has been manipulated by everyone who's come
within a country mile of him in recent weeks?
</P>
<P>
   DAN BURTON: The Indiana congressman who once called the
president of the United States a ``scumbag'' and who recently
subpoenaed Elian Gonzalez to testify before a congressional
committee was mentioned during Indiana native Letterman's chat with
Hillary Clinton. Dave called his home state congressman a
``bonehead.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave apparently decided to go easy on everybody the other night.
</P>
<P>
   The president has earned whatever scorn is tossed his way, but
Burton is richly deserving in his own right. ``Bonehead'' doesn't
begin to describe him; he's an arrogant, self-aggrandizing moron.
The people of Indiana should give this jerk his walking papers.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE W. BUSH: There's bad news for Bush-bashers. Despite the
reported surge by John McCain in New Hampshire, despite the nightly
sniping by Letterman and Leno, despite the relentless criticism by
assorted pundits _ despite all that, a new USA Today/CNN/Gallup
Poll gives Bush a commanding lead over McCain in the race for the
Republican presidential nomination. The poll shows Bush ahead of
both would-be Democratic nominees in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   So much for those predictions that Bush would self-destruct,
that familiarity would breed contempt, that the front-runner would
be done in by his participation in a series of televised debates
with the other candidates. It just hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   While his opponents continue to spin their wheels, the Bush
bandwagon keeps rolling on.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised, in fact, if Bush wins the Feb. 1 New
Hampshire primary _ making a spectacular comeback in a race that
many pundits have chalked up for McCain. And if McCain doesn't win
in New Hampshire, he'll be right back where he started: nowhere.

remaining superpower figure out a way to do the right thing for a
6-year-old boy who has been manipulated by everyone who's come
within a country mile of him in recent weeks?
</P>
<P>
   DAN BURTON: The Indiana congressman who once called the
president of the United States a ``scumbag'' and who recently
subpoenaed Elian Gonzalez to testify before a congressional
committee was mentioned during Indiana native Letterman's chat with
Hillary Clinton. Dave called his home state congressman a
``bonehead.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave apparently decided to go easy on everybody the other night.
</P>
<P>
   The president has earned whatever scorn is tossed his way, but
Burton is richly deserving in his own right. ``Bonehead'' doesn't
begin to describe him; he's an arrogant, self-aggrandizing moron.
The people of Indiana should give this jerk his walking papers.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE W. BUSH: There's bad news for Bush-bashers. Despite the
reported surge by John McCain in New Hampshire, despite the nightly
sniping by Letterman and Leno, despite the relentless criticism by
assorted pundits _ despite all that, a new USA Today/CNN/Gallup
Poll gives Bush a commanding lead over McCain in the race for the
Republican presidential nomination. The poll shows Bush ahead of
both would-be Democratic nominees in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   So much for those predictions that Bush would self-destruct,
that familiarity would breed contempt, that the front-runner would
be done in by his participation in a series of televised debates
with the other candidates. It just hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   While his opponents continue to spin their wheels, the Bush
bandwagon keeps rolling on.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised, in fact, if Bush wins the Feb. 1 New
Hampshire primary _ making a spectacular comeback in a race that
many pundits have chalked up for McCain. And if McCain doesn't win
in New Hampshire, he'll be right back where he started: nowhere.

ORIGINALITY WOULD BE GOOD MEDICINE FOR `ANGELS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
CITY OF ANGELS 
Starring: Blair Underwood, Vivica A. Fox, Phil Buckman, Robert
Morse, Michael Warren, Hill Harper, Maya Rudolph, Viola Davis 
On: CBS 
Time: Premieres Sunday at 8 p.m., then moves to its regular
timeslot this Wednesday at 8 p.m. 
Rated: TV14 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new hospital drama ``City of Angels'' arrives with some
heavy baggage riding on its gurney.
</P>
<P>
   A network series with a predominantly African-American cast,
it's being called the most significant event of the TV season, a
season that opened with an NAACP critique of prime-time diversity.
And it's being viewed as a test balloon on whether white people _
the majority of viewers _ are ready to bond with a non-comedic show
that doesn't quite look like them. So far, largely black dramas
like ``South Central'' in 1994 and ``Under One Roof'' in 1995 have
failed quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath all the expectation and symbolism, of course, there
is a TV show that will be good or bad regardless of the racial
composition of its cast. And ``City of Angels,'' which premieres
Sunday before moving to its home on Wednesdays at 8, is both good
and bad. It has some obvious strengths (a strong, easy-to-like
cast, a distinctive urban look) and one or two structural
weaknesses (conventional plots, flat attempts at humor). If the
creators _ including Steven Bochco _ can edge ``City of Angels'' a
few more inches into the originality zone in the next few weeks, it
has the potential to join TV's growing collection of quality
hour-long series.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the show is a state-of-the-art ensemble drama set in
an underfunded LA hospital called Angels of Mercy. That means that
the staff _ doctors, nurses, residents, administrators _ cope with
plenty of juicy interpersonal affairs as they work together running
the busy facility. Vivica A. Fox plays Lillian Price, a new
director brought in to generate money and accreditation, and Blair
Underwood is Ben Turner, the acting chief of surgery. Turns out the
two were engaged seven years ago, but Turner jumped ship shortly
before the wedding. That promises to create melodrama in the weeks
to come, particularly since Price has inadvertently befriended
Turner's current girlfriend. Michael Warren is also on hand as a
businessman, and Robert Morse plays a mysteriously powerful board
president.
</P>
<P>
   While ``City of Angels'' doesn't rely on racial issues for most
of its story lines, a few of its best moments do have a racial
component. A black patient ribs a white resident, Dr. Weiss, for
being Jewish; a black resident accuses Turner of favoring Weiss
because Weiss is white; Weiss panics when he sees a young black
girl with a residue on her legs, not realizing it's simply ash _
dry skin. ``It's a black thing,'' the girl tells the befuddled
Weiss. These are the sort of relevant scenes that, despite its
black cast members, ``ER'' seems to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   But too many of the little stories on ``City of Angels'' feel
like standard fare. You know, a noble older woman doesn't want to
get a needed operation because she's caring for her grandchildren,
an anesthetized man accidentally ends up in the morgue, like that.
It may be that, in the wake of ``ER'' and ``Chicago Hope,'' both of
which have been churning out medical vignettes for six-plus years,
there's nothing new to show about the daily operations of a
hospital. Even the quirky silly business on ``City of Angels'' _ a
gay man with a Golden Globe award stuck in a very bad spot _ seems
cliched.
</P>
<P>
   But ``City of Angels'' moves slower than the fever-pitched
``ER,'' and that gives it the advantage of being able to explore
characters and issues more thoroughly. The show could distinguish
itself by delving deeper into the ambivalences and conflicts of
both the regular characters and the guest stars. If the medical and
romantic situations have to be familiar, at least they can be done
with added complexity. The actors, particularly Underwood, are
clearly up to it. ``City of Angels'' is a promising hour that, with
some tinkering and growth, could take flight.

TAKING A FIRM STAND AGAINST CLUTTER
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Jan. 20)  
(dw) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   c.2000
N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, you make this resolution to clear out all the old nests
around the house and you end up with a giant head cold and
collapsed on the couch, surrounded by a menacing tower of old
magazines and a nagging box of Christmas lights that needs to be
picked over for rejects before being packed away.
</P>
<P>
   In the bedroom is a starter stack of clothes to go and in the
kitchen there are pitiful jars of pickles and months-old marmalade
waiting for a thumbs up or down.
</P>
<P>
   It's too exhausting to de-clutter. The end result is supposed to
be less chaos in our lives but the very effort sends some of us to
bed. Not everything is an easy yes or no, go or stay. Some items
are in transition. That's why we have junk drawers and dark
recesses in bedroom closets. That's why one bathroom cupboard is
full of nothing but bubble pack because I may need it someday,
there's no place else to store it and if I throw it out I'll be
adding to the landfill burden.
</P>
<P>
   How long do you save magazines? Do you wait until they encroach
on every flat surface or do you get tough? On the other hand, will
you some day wish you had that great New Yorker cover from 1996 of
Whistler's Mother glaring at the telephone? And the 1997 Newsweek
story on Dylan?
</P>
<P>
   What about the recipes optimistically ripped from the newspaper
and piling up on the kitchen table? Will you ever copy them over on
note cards to add to your recipe file box so that you can gather
the ingredients and dazzle your guests? Or will they end up jammed
in a seldom-used cookbook, maybe the one on New Orleans favorites,
now shelved between the five-year-old bottle of Triple Sec and a
vintage Boggle game.
</P>
<P>
   What about that shopping bag full of photographs from two
vacations ago? How about those instructions for installing the
battery backup for the computer? How long do you save the box the
answering machine came in, in case you need to take it back?
</P>
<P>
   What loony thought she needed all of this? Here's five different
hair conditioning products, none of which made me look like Rene
Russo. Here are several crusty bottles of nail polish from the
mauve period.
</P>
<P>
   Why did I save all these lone earrings after losing their mates?
Am I secretly planning to get something pierced?
</P>
<P>
   I am pretty sure I will never wear these socks that say ``Life's
a bitch and so am I.'' But I'm not giving up my three goddesses
T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Some things are obviously no longer essential. It takes effort
but you can let them go, laughing gaily as you toss them into the
proper recycling bin.
</P>
<P>
   But others beg for one last chance and sometimes they are right.
People who write books on how to streamline your life by getting
rid of clutter say to dump any article of clothing that has gone
unworn for more than a year. But they don't know about coming
across a soft gray crewneck abandoned by your husband in the back
of his closet but which now fits you. Or about rediscovering a lacy
blouse that you held onto only because it came from your
mother-in-law but was suddenly perfect one night for a party.
</P>
<P>
   In purging some old newspaper files I found a yellowed column by
the late writer Charles McCabe whose words are perfect for a book I
will someday write. And when I was ransacking my book shelves I
found a dusty copy of the Hite Report on women and sex that
provided hours of fascinating reading.
</P>
<P>
   I have made some progress. I deleted a whole bunch of e-mail
messages, dating from June 1997 and am looking sternly at a food
processor that's been missing a part for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The nail polish is history. I think that's enough decluttering
for a year.

NEW HEAT SAVER ON SMOKESTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 16, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have had a heat saver on the smokestack of my heater for
many years, and it has served well, transferring heat from the
smokestack to the basement. It was set on the horizontal part of
the smokestack. Now I have to replace it, but the only replacement
that I can find is designed to attach to a vertical stack. I have
no vertical stack; it is all horizontal. Now what?
</P>
<P>
   RUSSELL SMITH, Auburn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Those heat savers were developed during the big oil crisis of
the 1970s, and served quite well in heating basements, whether the
heat was needed or not. I am surprised one has lasted this long, 20
to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   In my opinion, virtually any heat saver (heat exchanger) can be
installed on a vertical or horizontal smokestack. The standard
exchangers transfer heat from the stack through a series of pipes
in the exchanger, inserted in the smokestack. They are powered by a
small electric motor, which blows the warmed air into the basement,
and while set in a section of the smokestack, they are airtight, so
should be able to be installed vertically or horizontally.
</P>
<P>
   If you have the least bit of doubt, then don't. Let a pro do it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The electric service in my condo is served by a fuse box. My
lights flicker and dim often, especially when another light is
turned on or an appliance starts up. What can I do? Can I put a
20-amp fuse in a 15-amp socket? Should I switch to circuit
breakers?
</P>
<P>
   LINDA BAKER, Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It sounds as if one or more circuits are overloaded, and the
lights dim and flicker when an extra load is put on the circuit.
This is particularly true when a motor or toaster starts up.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent this, use fewer lamps and appliances on each circuit.
For a permanent fix, have an electrician put in an extra circuit
that you could put those excess appliances on.
</P>
<P>
   But do not put a 20-amp fuse in a 15-amp socket. You already
have an overload, and putting in a high fuse would override that
overload; in doing so it would heat up the wires, often enough to
start a fire. So it is a real hazard.
</P>
<P>
   I don't see any need to switch to circuit breakers, except to
bring the system up to code (I think existing fuse boxes are
grandfathered) and to make it easier for the homeowner to flip the
breaker back into position; easier than replacing a fuse. But a
fuse will show why it blew, while a breaker will not. You can tell
why a fuse blew by looking in its window. A fuse blown by an
overload will be all smoky; a fuse blown by a short circuit will
show a broken filament. Because of this, you can make repairs
faster and more easily.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I moved into a brand-new house last September. The concrete
cellar floor has hairline cracks. Is this important or significant?
</P>
<P>
   BOB ALLEN, Pembroke, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If there is no water oozing or gushing up through the cracks,
the cracks are neither important nor significant. If water were
seeping up, it would do so, along the border, even if there were no
cracks. The slab is not structural, so there is no concern for
that, either.
</P>
<P>
   The house is in warranty for a year, so the contractor is
responsible for anything that goes wrong. Often a contractor,
responding to such a complaint, will fill the cracks with mortar or
hydraulic cement, to make the homeowner feel better, and make him
look like a nice guy. But it is strictly cosmetic.
</P>
<P>
   As to why the slab cracks, it could be for several reasons: 1.
The slab is too thin (less than two inches) and cracks under foot
pressure. 2. The slab is not reinforced with steel mesh or rods. 3.
Some of the ground on which the slab was poured sagged a bit,
causing the ssag. 4. The slab was poured directly on the
ground, not crushed stone for drainage, and water pressure under it
caused the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am having a tough time keeping turnpike noise out of my
house, which faces the turnpike not far away. I replaced my old
windows and storms with double-glazed windows, without much help.
What can I do to reduce the sound further? Will triple glazing
work? The sound is particularly disturbing in my bedroom at night.
</P>
<P>
   DAHLIA, too near the turnpike
</P>
<P>
   A. Triple glazing (a third layer of glass) will help, but there
is no need to replace your present windows with triple-glazed ones.
You can add a third layer of glass by putting in exterior storms,
or interior storms, or both. A good exterior storm is True Channel
by Harvey Industries. Interior storms are getting hard to find, but
a good one is by Innerglass of Simsbury, Conn., 800-743-6207,
860-651-3951.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the windows are properly weatherstripped and airtight.
Another way to get interior storms is to fasten thin polyethylene
to the inside casing. Home centers carry these kits.
</P>
<P>
   You can do the entire front of the house facing the turnpike or
just the bedroom windows. Heavy draperies on those windows will
also help.

 &HT;    HAITIANS CHEERS OVER DECISION TO REJOIN KIDS WITH MOM, MUTED BY
CRIES OVER DISPARITIES WITH CUBAN IMMIGRANT TREATMENT
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS

<P>
   MIAMI _ He's on the cover of Time magazine. Presidential
candidates have weighed in on his case. Television cameras have
tracked his every move for the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez isn't the only
heart-rending immigration story in Miami sparking protests and
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of angry Haitians marched on the Immigration and
Naturalization Service regional office in Miami this week,
protesting what they charged was the unfair treatment of a pregnant
Haitian woman separated from her children when a rickety boat
carrying 400 people from the impoverished island was intercepted
off Miami on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The children were sent back to Haiti with most of the other
people on the boat, while the mother, Yvena Rhinvil, 33, was taken
to Miami because she was ill.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials announced late Thursday they will allow
the children to join their mother in the U.S. while she awaits an
asylum hearing she hopes will allow her to stay permanently in this
country. The children had been staying with an aunt in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great news,'' Cheryl Little, director of the Florida
Immigrant Advocacy Center, told reporters. ``These children should
have been with their mother all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Haitians celebrated the news, but the case points out the touchy
relations among South Florida's diverse population of immigrants
and refugees.
</P>
<P>
   For years, many Haitians here have charged that Cubans receive
preferential treatment when they reach this country and that the
disparity is racially motivated. Immigration officials firmly deny
the charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitian protest came just as the national furor over little
Elian Gonzalez reached a peak.
</P>
<P>
   While the case of the Cuban boy, who survived a boat trip from
Cuba that left his mother and nine others dead, sparked a national
debate over whether he should be sent back to his father in Cuba,
the episode involving the Haitians drew little attention outside
South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, thousands of Haitians marched peacefully through
Miami's Little Haiti district. Many held signs saying ``Stop
Racism,'' while others carried black coffins to represent people
who have died on the seas or in Haiti after they were sent back
there by U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Rhinvil and two of her children were on a packed, 60-foot boat
run by smugglers who reportedly charged thousands of dollars per
person. They tried to reach U.S. shores during the New Year's
holiday, hoping that the celebrations would divert attention from
their attempted landing.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers later told reporters they spent three days at sea
under appalling conditions. Several people died, they said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Coast Guard officials stopped the boat and four women who
were ill _ including Rhinvil _ were brought ashore. The rest were
taken back to Haiti, including Rhinvil's children, Marc Dieubon,
10, and Germanie Dieubon, 8
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials said they didn't realize they had
separated Rhinvil from her children.
</P>
<P>
   While granting Rhinvil's children temporary parole so they can
join their mother, INS officials insisted their policies are not
discriminatory and are based on laws passed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no difference whatsoever in INS policies and
practices,'' said INS spokesman Russ Bergeron. ``If there is any
disparity at all, it's a product of an act of Congress called the
Cuban Adjustment Act.''
</P>
<P>
   That 1966 law, a product of the Cold War, allows Cubans to apply
for permanent immigrant status if their asylum claim is not acted
upon within a year and a day.
</P>
<P>
   Many Haitians in Miami feel Cubans have an easier time getting
asylum because their country is controlled by a Communist dictator,
while most Haitians are sent back home because U.S. officials
determine they are fleeing the extreme poverty of a Democratic
country, not political persecution.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Haitians are celebrating what they feel is an
all-too-rare victory in the immigration arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision ends a frightening episode and addresses a major
wrong that was done to this mother and her young children,'' said
U.S. Rep. Carrie Meek, D-Fla., who led efforts to reunite Rhinvil
and her children.

 &HT;    Army scrutinizing Apache flight-control system
 &HT;    (Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 16. A longer version will move
also. A graphic on the BUCS system is available.)
 &HT;    By Russell Carollo
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The U.S. Army has launched a special
investigation into a complex flight-control system suspected in
more than 60 aviation incidents involving Apache helicopters,
including a fatal crash last year near Kosovo that helped ignite a
national debate over the readiness of the Apache fleet.
</P>
<P>
   At least three major accidents since 1985 are linked to problems
with the Apache's flight-control system, a Dayton Daily News
examination found. In addition, the examination found, the same
system remains a suspect in at least two other major crashes.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is the May 5, 1999, crash near Kosovo that killed
both pilots. That crash _ the second in nine days _ is now part of
a separate U.S. Justice Department examination, the Daily News has
learned.
</P>
<P>
   The other is a December 1997 crash near Fort Hood, Texas, that
also killed both pilots and is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit
against the companies that manufactured the flight-control system.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News examined never-before-released computer records
from the Army Safety Center, hundreds of pages of Army accident
reports and interviewed former and current pilots, accident
investigators and employees of the companies that helped design and
produce the AH-64 Apache and its flight-control system.
</P>
<P>
   The examination found that much of the suspicion by the Army and
its aviators over problems in the flight-control system is directed
at BUCS, the helicopter's unique emergency backup control system.
</P>
<P>
   The BUCS was designed to control the movements of the Apache
electronically if the helicopter's mechanical controls become
jammed or severed during combat or other emergency. But the BUCS
had problems, and the system was disconnected in the first 529
Apaches to roll off the assembly line in the 1980s, and is still
disconnected in a majority of the fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The BUCS is just one of several problems plaguing the Apache _
problems raising questions about whether the Apache, the military's
most advanced and lethal attack helicopter, is capable of
performing its mission.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the Apache fleet of 743 helicopters remains
grounded to replace bearings in the tail rotors or to replace
transmission parts.
</P>
<P>
   From 1998 to 1999, the rate of serious accidents involving
Apaches nearly doubled, from 2.97 accidents per 100,000 flight
hours to 5.72 _ a rate of one major accident every 17,500 hours.
And during a nine-day period last year, the Army lost two of the 24
Apaches it brought to Albania to support operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At least seven other countries also fly the Apache. Just last
month, Armed Forces News Wire Service reported that the Israeli Air
Force faulted Boeing and the U.S. Army for the fatal crash of an
Israeli Apache in June. The Israelis charged Boeing with
``systematic design flaws in the Apache's hydraulic system and
auxiliary power unit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Apache was developed by Hughes Helicopter as the Army's
newest attack helicopter. In 1983, the company was purchased by
McDonnell Douglas, and in 1997 McDonnell Douglas was purchased by
Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Though the military bought the expensive BUCS system to help
Apaches become better able to survive combat, the Army acknowledged
that the percentage of Apaches sent to Desert Storm with the BUCS
turned on was ``very low.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to the Daily News, the Army called 55 of
the 61 incidents linked to BUCS minor, resulting in less than
$2,000 in damage or the disruption of a mission. At least four
incidents, the Army says, are classified as Class A accidents,
currently defined as causing a death or total permanent disability,
at least $1 million in damage or loss or an aircraft regardless of
the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Three helicopters, the Army says, were ``saved'' by BUCS. The
Army did not identify the incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has not been a single incident during the life of the
aircraft where BUCS failure has been identified as the direct cause
of an accident when the aircraft was operated in accordance with
Army flight manuals,'' said Ken Jensen, a Boeing spokesperson at
the company's Apache plant in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   A special ``Red Team'' of aviation experts began investigating
the Apache's flight-control system last year. In December, the Army
released two safety messages related to BUCS. One announced that
the Red Team had identified specific actions required to ``reduce
risk,'' including increased training for pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The September 1999 issue of the Army's own aviation safety
magazine, Flightfax, says BUCS has ``become synonymous with . . .
aircraft loss of control and, in general, demons in the Apaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aviators fear the system, crew chiefs avoid it when possible,
armament personnel loathe the system and maintenance officers are
in awe of it,'' the article says.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Bowers, pregnant with her second child when her husband's
Apache crashed near Fort Hood in 1997, said she first learned about
BUCS at her husband's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just told it was the BUCS,'' Bowers said. ``I think all
the pilots know there has been a problem with it (BUCS), but what
can they do? They're like slaves to the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Army records show a part linked to BUCS was suspected to have
malfunctioned on a helicopter that crashed at Fort Hood, Texas, in
1990, resulting in only minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In its written response to the newspaper regarding that crash,
the Army acknowledged that one of the linear variable differential
transducer (LVDT) probes had malfunctioned ``just prior to or
during the accident sequence.'' LVDTs, located throughout the
flight-control system, monitor coordination between movements of
the control sticks and pedals and movements of the servocylinders.
</P>
<P>
   Should an LVDT sense a problem, it can trigger an activation of
BUCS. If the LVDT is not set properly _ called setting the nulls _
it can signal danger when there is none, activating BUCS when
pilots aren't expecting it.
</P>
<P>
   However, a written response from Boeing says, ``The broken
(LVDT) probe was not the cause of the accident.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, the BUCS in an Apache flying at Fort Knox, Ky.,
unexpectedly came on, although the pilot was able to land the
helicopter. After the incident, the Army again became concerned
about LVDTs, the part replaced after the 1990 Fort Hood crash.
</P>
<P>
   After the Fort Knox incident, the Army acknowledged in its
written response to the Daily News, it prepared a safety message,
but the draft copy was misplaced when personnel and files were
moved from St. Louis to a new office in Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Fatal Texas crash
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 4, 1997, Chief Warrant Officer Phillip Wayne Bowers and
Capt. Donald J. Lee, the Army Aviation Association of America's
1996 Aviator of the Year, were flying a BUCS-active Apache on a
daytime training mission near San Saba, Texas. The crew of a nearby
Apache saw the accident happen.
</P>
<P>
   With no warning and for no apparent reason, the Apache Bowers
and Lee were flying banked left and flew into a rocky hillside at
100 mph, breaking the helicopter into pieces thrown more than 200
feet away as it burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of pilots were considered as talented at Lee,
making the possibility of pilot error at least questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a BUCS activation is the most plausible explanation
for the crash at this point,'' said Dallas attorney Jon Kettles,
one of several lawyers representing the two women left widowed by
the accident. ``It was a smooth left turn right into the ground,
and pilots just don't do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not normal for two pilots to voluntarily kill
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Kettles, a former Army helicopter pilot and former engineer at
the Army Safety Center, said he suspects the LVDT null settings
were not checked as required.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Fort Hood accident, the Army was still more
than a year away from releasing its safety message concerning LVDT
settings _ the message prepared after the 1996 Fort Knox incident
but later lost.
</P>
<P>
   An Army investigation found that all four shear pins, designed
to break and activate BUCS during emergencies, had broken and that
the ``BUCS-ON'' light was illuminated. In addition, the report
says, the LVDTs were found in a position ``suggesting that a
possible uncommanded BUCS-on condition may have occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   But the investigation also found that the shear pins, the
``BUCS-ON'' light and the LVDTs could be explained by the impact of
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not enough evidence to support anything,'' said
Marvin Armour, an Apache test pilot who assisted in the Army's
safety investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But Armour, who officially leaves the Army next month, said
eyewitness accounts seemed to point to some type of uncommanded
flight input.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't believe they would have made such a stupid
mistake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's public report on the 1997 Fort Hood crash does not
pinpoint a cause, but two of the five recommendations in the report
concerned flight controls: One calling for improved BUCS training
and another calling for the Army to initiate an investigation of
uncommanded flight control inputs.
</P>
<P>
   Fatal Albania crash
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999 _ 16 months after the fatal Fort Hood crash and 2
1/2 years after the original safety message was misplaced _ the
Army issued a Safety of Flight message warning that LVDTs ``may
move out'' of position.

   On May 5, two days before the compliance deadline for the safety
message, an Apache helicopter conducting a night training mission
in preparation for combat in Kosovo was leading a formation of five
helicopters over mountainous terrain in Albania when it began to
slow and move right. As the crew of another helicopter watched, the
nose of the Apache then pitched up as the helicopter rolled rapidly
to the right, falling 150 feet to the ground and exploding in
flames.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Warrant Officer David Gibbs, 38, of Massillon, Ohio, and
Chief Warrant Officer Kevin Reichert, 28, of Chetek, Wis., were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The crash _ the second in nine days involving one of the 24
Apaches sent to Albania _ raised serious questions about the
readiness of the fleet of Apaches, which never entered combat in
Kosovo. There's no indication the first crash was related to BUCS.
</P>
<P>
   Findings, conclusions, recommendations and witness statements of
Army safety investigations usually are secret. Releasable portions
of the final report are not expected to be made public until as
late as April.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army won't give me anything,'' said Reichert's wife,
Ridgely. ``I've asked for the safety report. I've asked them for
updates on how the safety report is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   In its written response to the Dayton Daily News, the Army
refused to discuss the accident in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``This accident is still under investigation, and it would be
improper to speculate on the final results of the investigation,''
the Army's response says.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department is now conducting its own
examination into the fatal crash in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did BUCS cause the accident? Unknown,'' Mark Metzger, Boeing's
flight operations manager for the Apache program, says in a memo
about the crash. ``The physical data doesn't support it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 23, the Army released two more safety messages
concerning BUCS.
</P>
<P>
   One of the messages called for an inspection of all BUCS
servocylinders to ensure that a sealant is applied to the threads
of the LVDT probe. A movement of the probe out of the null setting,
the message says, ``will cause BUCS system activation.''
Application of the sealant, the message says, ``eliminates this
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The other safety message announced that a special Army ``Red
Team'' of aviation experts had identified specific actions to
``reduce risk'' involving BUCS, including increasing training for
pilots.

 &HT;    Army scrutinizing Apache flight-control system

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The U.S. Army has launched a special
investigation into a complex flight-control system suspected in
more than 60 aviation incidents involving Apache helicopters,
including a fatal crash last year near Kosovo that helped ignite a
national debate over the readiness of the Apache fleet.
</P>
<P>
   At least three major accidents since 1985 are linked to problems
with the Apache's flight control system, a Dayton Daily News
examination found. In addition, the examination found, the same
system remains a suspect in at least two other major crashes.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is the crash near Kosovo, which is now part of a
separate U.S. Justice Department examination, the Daily News has
learned.
</P>
<P>
   The other is a December 1997 crash near Fort Hood, Texas, which
also killed both pilots and is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit
against the companies that manufactured the flight control system.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News examined never-before-released computer records
from the Army Safety Center and hundreds of pages of Army accident
reports and interviewed former and current pilots, accident
investigators and employees of the companies that helped design and
produce the $16 million Apache and its flight control system.
</P>
<P>
   The examination found that much of the suspicion by the Army and
its aviators over problems in the flight control system is directed
at BUCS, the helicopter's unique emergency backup control system.
</P>
<P>
   The BUCS was designed to control the movements of the Apache
electronically if the helicopter's mechanical controls become
jammed or severed during combat or other emergency. But the BUCS
has had problems, and the system was disconnected in the first 529
Apaches to roll off the assembly line in the 1980s, and it is still
disconnected in a majority of the fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The BUCS is just one of several problems plaguing the Apache _
problems raising questions about whether the military's most
advanced and lethal attack helicopter is capable of performing its
mission.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the Apache fleet remains grounded because of
problems with bearings in the tail rotor system, and in November,
the Army announced it would begin inspecting the entire fleet of
743 helicopters for problems in the transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   From 1998 to 1999, the rate of serious accidents involving
Apaches nearly doubled, from 2.97 accidents per 100,000 flight
hours to 5.72 _ a rate of one major accident every 17,500 hours.
And during a nine-day period last year, the Army lost two of the 24
Apaches it brought to Albania to support operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven other countries also fly the Apache. Just last
month, Armed Forces News Wire Service reported that the Israeli Air
Force faulted Boeing and the U.S. Army for the fatal crash of an
Israeli Apache in June. The Israelis charged Boeing with
``systematic design flaws in the Apache's hydraulic system and
auxiliary power unit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Apache was developed by Hughes Helicopter as the Army's
newest attack helicopter. In 1983, the company was purchased by
McDonnell-Douglas, and in 1997 McDonnell-Douglas was purchased by
Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Though the military bought the expensive BUCS system to help
Apaches become better able to survive combat, the Army acknowledged
that the percentage of Apaches sent to Desert Storm with the BUCS
turned on was ``very low.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to the Daily News, the Army called 55 of
the 61 incidents linked to BUCS minor, resulting in less than
$2,000 in damage or the disruption of a mission. At least four
incidents, the Army says, are classified as Class A accidents,
causing a death or total permanent disability, at least $1 million
in damage or loss of an aircraft regardless of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Three helicopters, the Army says, were ``saved'' by BUCS. The
Army did not identify the incidents.
</P>
<P>
   A special ``Red Team'' of aviation experts began investigating
the Apache's flight control system last year. In December, it
released two safety messages related to BUCS. One announced that
the Red Team had identified specific actions required to ``reduce
risk,'' including increased training for pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The September 1999 issue of the Army's own aviation safety
magazine, Flightfax, says BUCS has ``become synonymous with ...
aircraft loss of control and, in general, demons in the Apaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aviators fear the system, crew chiefs avoid it when possible,
armament personnel loathe the system and maintenance officers are
in awe of it,'' the article says.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Bowers, pregnant with her second child when her husband's
Apache crashed near Fort Hood in 1997, said she first learned about
BUCS at her husband's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just told it was the BUCS,'' Bowers said. ``I think all
the pilots know there has been a problem with it, but what can they
do? They're like slaves to the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Backup control system
</P>
<P>
   Like other helicopters, the Apache is controlled by sticks and
foot pedals linked mechanically to hydraulic servocylinders. The
servocylinders control the movements of the main and tail rotors,
which determine the direction of the helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other helicopters, the Apache's mechanical control
system is backed up by an electronic system, BUCS. If the Apache's
mechanical controls become jammed or severed during combat or other
emergency, BUCS is designed to allow pilots to operate the
helicopter's hydraulic servocylinders electronically.
</P>
<P>
   But pilots and other experts suspect that BUCS is taking control
of the helicopters when there is no emergency, causing so-called
``uncommanded flight control inputs'' _ steep banks, sharp turns or
other unusual maneuvers not initiated by the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Once BUCS is engaged, there's no turning back. To return to
mechanical flight control, a helicopter has to land and undergo
ground maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they first came out with the BUCS system, I had some
concerns about it,'' said Richard Langer, former chief Apache
quality assurance supervisor for McDonnell-Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   BUCS was deactivated on the first 529 Apaches because the system
wasn't working correctly, Langer said. To deactivate BUCS, shear
pins that were designed to break and activate BUCS during
emergencies were replaced with solid steel pins.
</P>
<P>
   But even shutting off BUCS proved to be hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   The Apache that Henry Fowler and fellow test pilot Stu Park
climbed aboard on June 17, 1985, had solid steel pins in it, Fowler
said.
</P>
<P>
   As Fowler and Park started the engines, the helicopter _ the
31st production helicopter to come off the assembly line _ rolled
left and came to rest on its side, causing nearly $300,000 in
damage. BUCS was blamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was supposed to be shut off,'' said Fowler, who now works
for Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   That same month, the Army issued a Safety of Flight message, a
directive designed to inform pilots and mechanics of potential
aircraft dangers and of solutions the military has proposed to
mitigate those dangers. The message instructed Apache units to
``totally disable the BUCS.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said crews began removing BUCS parts in the hydraulic
servocylinders to make sure the system wouldn't come on again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on in the Apache fielding, aviator mistrust of the BUCS,
exacerbated by an incident at the aircraft plant involving
inadvertent BUCS activation, led to a decision to inactivate
BUCS,'' the article in the Army's safety magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   BUCS turned on
</P>
<P>
   The decision to deactivate BUCS was reversed in 1988, and for
the first time Apaches began leaving the assembly line in Mesa,
Ariz., with the BUCS turned on. In November 1989, the 530th Apache
to roll off the assembly line was delivered to the Army as the
first helicopter with an activated BUCS.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots began referring to their Apaches as either
``BUCS-active'' or ``non-BUCS,'' and they became very aware of
which type they were flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an argument since BUCS hit the flight line
whether to turn it on or turn it off,'' said Thomas Boucher, who
flew Apaches for 10 years and trained Army instructor pilots before
retiring in 1994. ``There are a lot of concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those concerns is training. Pilots must make
life-and-death decisions in the critical seconds it takes BUCS to
engage, and the helicopter handles differently when BUCS moves the
controls electronically. But ``training on BUCS had never been
considered a critical task item,'' the Flightfax article says.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 minutes of the Army flight controls portion of the
aircraft qualification course is devoted to BUCS, the article says,
and, ``There is no simulator or BUCS flight training.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 15, 1990, one year after the first BUCS-active
helicopter was delivered to the Army and as 430,000 American troops
were assembling in the Persian Gulf, Warrant Officers James D.
Ellis and Samuel D. Gentsch were flying an Apache on a daytime
training mission in Texas when they heard a loud noise while
hovering at 50 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter began falling, its tail and main rotor blades
mowing down several small trees before the aircraft hit the ground
_ impacting with enough force to send a 2.75-inch rocket pod into
the main rotor blades, knocking the pod 84 feet from the crash
site. Gentsch carried Ellis from the wreckage, which had started to
catch fire.
</P>
<P>
   Both pilots escaped with only minor injuries, but the helicopter
was destroyed. The Army estimated the total cost of the accident at
$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Army records examined by the Daily News show a part linked to
BUCS was suspected to have malfunctioned on the helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   In its written response to the newspaper, the Army acknowledged
that one of the linear variable differential transducer (LVDT)
probes had malfunctioned ``just prior to or during the accident
sequence.'' LVDTs, located throughout the flight control system,
monitor coordination between movements of the control sticks and
pedals and movements of the servocylinders.
</P>
<P>
   Should an LVDT sense a problem, it can trigger an activation of
BUCS. If the LVDT is not set properly, it can signal danger when
there is none, activating BUCS when pilots aren't expecting it.
</P>
<P>
   A written response from Boeing says, ``The broken probe was not
the cause of the accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Although investigators did not positively identify the source of
the malfunction in the 1990 crash, the Army response says, they did
determine that an LVDT failed because of a ``substandard weld.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1991, two months after the accident, the Army issued
a Safety of Flight message for BUCS-active Apaches warning of
problems with welds on LVDTs. The message said 108 aircraft would
get replacement servocylinders.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's written response says that after the accident it quit
using LVDTs made by the same manufacturer and began using LVDTs
that had two methods of attachments.
</P>
<P>
   Another crash and more questions
</P>
<P>
   Less than two years later, on Sept. 28, 1992, civilian test
pilots James Mecklin and John Tulloch were flying a new BUCS-active
Apache over Delaware as part of a test for a classified project.
The test involved rapid movements of the flight controls _
movements that could cause the helicopter to believe it was
experiencing control problems and activate BUCS.
</P>
<P>
   As the controls moved during a 60-foot hover, the helicopter
went into an unexpected right roll and began to fall. Tulloch moved
his controls to stop the helicopter from rolling, but in seconds
the main rotor hit the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Mecklin broke his left arm and was pinned in the helicopter.
Tulloch suffered back injuries. The helicopter was destroyed, and
the Army estimated the total cost of the accident at $10.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher, the Apache pilot assigned by the Army to assist in the
investigation, said the cause of the accident was identified as a
malfunction in a microswitch used to activate BUCS. The
malfunction, he said, was linked to how certain BUCS parts were
being removed from the helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   In its written response, the Army blamed the accident on
``unauthorized maintenance at the factory during manufacture.'' No
other Apaches were found to have malfunctioning microswitches, the
Army response says, but new procedures were implemented as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   After the accident, Boucher said, the Army grounded all
BUCS-active Apaches to inspect the microswitches. The inspections,
he said, generated 86 reports on a variety of issues concerning
BUCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them were potential accidents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after the accident, in November 1992, the Army issued
a Safety of Flight message, warning that a recent accident
investigation had identified a problem with a BUCS microswitch. The
message recommended inspecting 220 aircraft. An inspection already
completed, the message said, found that several helicopters were
``shown to have relatively minor quality problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Mecklin, a former Air Force maintenance test pilot who flew
helicopters for 40 years before retiring in 1994, has a different
opinion on the accident. Mecklin said the shear pins designed to
activate BUCS simply break too easily.
</P>
<P>
   The time lapse between breaking a shear pin and activating BUCS
is critical. The Army says there is a one- to three-second delay
before BUCS engages.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 2 1/2 seconds, we were on the ground,'' Mecklin said. ``So
much for your backup control system.''
</P>
<P>
   The September 1992 crash wasn't the helicopter's only incident
involving BUCS. Records from the Army Safety Center show that on
Jan. 29, 1992, one of the shear pins designed to break during an
emergency and activate BUCS accidentally broke while the helicopter
was on the ground. The pin, records show, was replaced the same
day.
</P>
<P>
   Accidents trigger `null' concerns
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, the BUCS in an Apache flying at Fort Knox, Ky.,
unexpectedly came on, although the pilot was able to land the
helicopter. After the incident, the Army again became concerned
about LVDTs, the part replaced after the 1990 Fort Hood crash.
</P>
<P>
   If the LVDT is not set properly, it can signal danger when there
is none, activating BUCS when pilots aren't expecting it.
</P>
<P>
   Setting the LVDT _ called setting the nulls _ is much like
setting the alignment of an automobile's front end. A properly
aligned front end should not turn a car when the steering wheel is
in the neutral position, and when the nulls are properly set on
LVDTs, the devices should sense no movement of the flight controls
and should not activate BUCS.
</P>
<P>
   After the Fort Knox incident, the Army acknowledged in its
written response, it prepared an Air Safety Action Message, a
safety directive similar to a Safety of Flight message but carrying
less urgency.
</P>
<P>
   But the draft copy of that message was misplaced when personnel
and files were moved from St. Louis to a new office in Huntsville,
Ala.
</P>
<P>
   It would be 2 1/2 years before the Army issued a new message.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in February 1997, McDonnell-Douglas became aware of
the Fort Knox incident and initiated an investigation, according to
a company memo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been determined that two failure modes could cause
inadvertent BUCS engagement,'' the memo says.
</P>
<P>
   One cause was a part that was found to be functioning properly,
the memo says. The other cause, the memo says, is an unexpected
movement of an LVDT probe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk assessment determined the worst mishap from a probe
movement to be catastrophic, and the probability that a hazard will
occur during the planned life of the system is remote,'' the memo
says.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, on Dec. 4, 1997, Chief Warrant Officer Phillip
Wayne Bowers, whose wife was expecting their second child, and
Capt. Donald J. Lee, the Army Aviation Association of America's
1996 Aviator of the Year, were flying a BUCS-active Apache on a
daytime training mission near San Saba, Texas. The crew of a nearby
Apache saw the accident happen.
</P>
<P>
   With no warning and for no apparent reason, the Apache Bowers
and Lee were flying banked left and flew into a rocky hillside at
100 mph, breaking the helicopter into pieces thrown more than 200
feet away as it burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of pilots were considered as talented as Lee,
making the possibility of pilot error at least questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a BUCS activation is the most plausible explanation
for the crash at this point,'' said Dallas attorney John Kettles,
one of several lawyers representing the two women left widowed by
the accident. ``It was a smooth left turn right into the ground,
and pilots just don't do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not normal for two pilots to voluntarily kill
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Kettles, a former Army helicopter pilot and former engineer at
the Army Safety Center, said he suspects the LVDT null settings
were not checked as required.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Fort Hood accident, the Army was still more
than a year away from releasing its safety message concerning LVDT
settings _ the message prepared after the 1996 Fort Knox incident
but later lost.
</P>
<P>
   An Army investigation found that all four shear pins, designed
to break and activate BUCS during emergencies, had broken and that
the ``BUCS-ON'' light was illuminated. In addition, the report
says, the LVDTs were found in a position ``suggesting that a
possible uncommanded BUCS-on condition may have occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   The battalion, the investigation found, reported 10 uncommanded
flight control inputs in the 18 months preceding the accident.
Though pilots were able to recover each time, investigators warned
that ``an accident can occur.''
</P>
<P>
   But the investigation also found that the shear pins, the
``BUCS-ON'' light and the LVDTs could be explained by the impact of
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not enough evidence to support anything,'' said
Marvin Armour, an Apache test pilot who assisted in the Army's
safety investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But Armour, who officially leaves the Army next month, said
eyewitness accounts seemed to point to some type of uncommanded
flight input.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't believe they would have made such a stupid
mistake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The maintenance records he researched during the investigation,
Armour said, showed one of the BUCS hydraulic servocylinders in the
helicopter had been replaced just prior to the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The Apache, like many other military aircraft, carried no flight
data recorder, and much of the helicopter was destroyed, making it
nearly impossible for investigators to determine if electronic
flight controls could have malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   The latest model of the Apache, the Longbow or D model, has a
maintenance data recorder that should solve that problem, Armour
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots, originally interviewed as witnesses to the Fort Hood
crash, told investigators about their own experiences with Apache
flight control problems.
</P>
<P>
   One pilot recalled an incident in which he was flying at 3,400
feet when, for no apparent reason, the helicopter pointed down,
rolled right and started falling before he was able to regain
control. Another pilot told investigators of a November 1995
incident in which he was flying his helicopter at 600 feet when it
suddenly began rolling left and shuddered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked the front seat pilot whether he was on the controls,
and the response was, 'No,''' an accident investigator quoted the
pilot as saying.
</P>
<P>
   A flight surgeon who arrived at the 1997 Fort Hood crash site
told accident investigators that six pilots, during discussions
about the accident, told her of previous incidents of uncommanded
flight control movements. The surgeon, a captain, gave
investigators a list containing names of the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's public report on the 1997 Fort Hood crash does not
pinpoint a cause, but two of the five recommendations in the report
concerned flight controls: One calling for improved BUCS training
and another calling for the Army to initiate an investigation of
uncomsmanded flight control inputs.
</P>
<P>
   Crashes draw world attention
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year after that accident, on Oct. 7, 1998, the
flight controls of a new D model Apache Longbow flying at Fort Hood
became damaged when the barrel of a 30mm gun exploded, according to
the Army. The BUCS engaged, Army records show, but the ``very
senior standardization instructor pilot'' was unable to
successfully land the helicopter, and it crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The crew escaped virtually uninjured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did BUCS work as advertised? If so, why couldn't a capable
master aviator regain control of the aircraft,'' the Flightfax
article says.
</P>
<P>
   It was this accident, along with other incidents, that sparked
the special Red Team investigation, the Army said.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999 _ 2 1/2 years after the Fort Knox incident that
prompted the message that was later lost _ the Army issued a Safety
of Flight message warning that LVDTs ``may move out'' of position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investigation into a BUCS activation in flight has revealed a
suspect condition in the BUCS ... servocylinders,'' the message
says. ``If the LVDT probe moves out of the null condition, this
will cause a BUCS system activation.''
</P>
<P>
   The safety message set a reporting deadline of no later than May
7, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before that deadline, on May 5, an Apache helicopter
conducting a night training mission in preparation for combat in
Kosovo was leading a formation of five helicopters over mountainous
terrain in Albania when it began to slow and move right, according
to an Army account of the incident obtained by the Dayton Daily
News.
</P>
<P>
   As the crew of another helicopter watched, the nose of the
Apache then pitched up as the helicopter rolled rapidly to the
right, falling 150 feet to the ground and exploding in flames, the
Army account of the incident says.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Warrant Officer David Gibbs, 38, of Massillon, Ohio, and
Chief Warrant Officer Kevin Reichert, 28, of Chetek, Wis., were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The crash _ the second in nine days involving one of the 24
Apaches sent to Albania _ raised serious questions about the
readiness of the fleet of Apaches, which never entered combat in
Kosovo. There's no indication the first crash was related to BUCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army won't give me anything,'' said Reichert's wife,
Ridgeley. ``I've asked for the safety report. I've asked them for
updates on how the safety report is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   In its written response to the Dayton Daily News, the Army
refused to discuss the accident in Albania, saying it was still
under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A memo from Boeing's flight operations manager for the Apache
program says there's no record Army maintenance personnel checked
the LVDT settings as required by the Safety of Flight message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The personnel said that they had done the work but not
recorded the data,'' Boeing manager Mark Metzger wrote in the memo
obtained by the Dayton Daily News. ``Did it really get done?
Unknown. I believe the team consensus was sloppy paperwork.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the possibility that some type of uncommanded flight control
input caused the accident, Metzger wrote: ``This is the condition
that has been experienced a couple of times in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did BUCS cause the accident? Unknown. The physical data
doesn't support it.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Justice now is conducting its own
examination into the fatal crash in Albania, the Dayton Daily News
has learned. The Department of Justice did not respond to requests
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 23, the Army released two safety messages concerning
BUCS.

   One called for an inspection of all BUCS servocylinders to
ensure that a sealant is applied to the threads of the LVDT probe.
A movement of the probe out of the null setting, the message says,
``will cause a BUCS system activation.'' Application of the
sealant, the message says, ``eliminates this condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The other safety message announced that a special Army ``Red
Team'' of aviation experts had identified specific actions required
to ``reduce risk'' involving flight controls. Those actions include
increased training for pilots, something recommended after the
fatal Fort Hood crash two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``My recommendation was disable them all,'' said Armour, the
former Apache test pilot. ``I think the drawbacks of BUCS outweigh
the benefits.''

ANOTHER LABOR DEPARTMENT BULLET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman has said that she wants to make
sure labor laws adapt to new work arrangements. But it appears as
if she's thinking more like she's back in the Industrial Revolution
than on the threshold of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   After criticism forced her to backpedal last week over the Labor
Department's proposal to ask employers to inspect the safety
conditions of their employees who work at home, her department has
issued another onerous opinion that has far-reaching implications.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Wage and Hour Administration recently indicated that
companies that give stock options to hourly wage workers may have
to figure as part of base pay the profits an employee makes on
exercised stock options when calculating overtime wages.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion, written a year ago but made public just recently,
is causing a stir among the growing number of employers who give
employees stock options. Employers predict that if the Labor
Department tries to broaden the opinion from what the department
said was its narrow focus, companies will be discouraged from
providing what has become the hottest employee benefit in this bull
market.
</P>
<P>
   Stock options were once a perk reserved for upper management,
but recently many innovative companies have extended the benefit
all the way down the corporate ladder. They work the same way on
the shop floor as they work in the executive suite: Stock options
tie an employee's compensation to a company's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Options have become so popular that the Bureau of Labor
Statistics is studying how important they are in a typical
compensation package.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Labor Department opinion, employers who offer the
options are subject to a new payroll liability along with a new
administrative headache. The overtime component would have to be
calculated individually for each employee using a complicated
formula of overtime hours and stock profits.
</P>
<P>
   That would be expensive and time-consuming, said William R.
Bufkins, director of special projects _ including compensation
design _ for Spacehab, a space manufacturing and services company
in the Clear Lake area.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SCOPE WAS NARROW, AGENCY SAYS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department is quick to point out that the opinion
doesn't apply to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   It was a specific response to a specific set of circumstances,
said department spokesman Howard Waddell. It was never intended to
be a general statement on stock option plans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But compensation consultants are treating the opinion as a
signal of how the agency will handle future overtime wage
complaints in cases where stocks options are given.
</P>
<P>
   Ed McGaughey, who leads the compensation practice for Buck
Consultants in Houston, said it's an opinion employers must pay
attention to because if the department determines they're
responsible for overtime wages based on options, they could end up
paying up to two years of back pay.
</P>
<P>
   The stock option plan that was described by the unidentified
employer in the opinion was a typical arrangement, said Tim Bartl,
assistant general counsel for LPA, a Washington, D.C., trade group
that represents senior human resource executives in large
companies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A DEPARTURE ON OPTIONS ISSUE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The interpretation is a departure from the way the department
treated options in the past _ or at least how employers thought it
treated them.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal wage law, bonuses aren't typically used as part of
base pay when calculating overtime pay unless a bonus is tied to
performance. If the bonus is discretionary _ such as a Christmas
bonus given to everyone _ it's not considered part of the wage
base. Neither are profit-sharing plans.
</P>
<P>
   In the case involved in the opinion, the stock options were not
considered a gift like a Christmas bonus because employees had to
work for the company for three months before becoming eligible for
the options, Waddell said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as Chase Bank of Texas that offer all their
employees stock options said they weren't even aware of the
department's opinion letter. That's not because they aren't paying
attention to the department's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   It's virtually impossible to know about the opinion letters,
said Bartl. Although they can be found in the department's library,
it typically takes months before they're put there, he said. They
can also be found on online legal databases, but they're hard to
search unless you know what you're looking for, he said.

 eBAY CALLED A `BLACK MARKET' FOR ANIMAL PRODUCTS   By RON MATUS   The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Products being made from endangered species
are being sold on the Internet at a growing rate, alarming
conservation groups who fear the sheer volume of transactions will
revive markets for goods they want to eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   Items like statues made from elephant ivory and jewelry made
from sea turtle shells can't be sold across state lines because of
federal laws protecting endangered species. But every day, such
items are sold across cyberspace on the online auction outlets.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, conservation groups and federal wildlife
officials have raised concerns about trading on eBay.com, by far
the largest of hundreds of Internet trading companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like there's a zillion items there, but you have to
realize that every week there's new stuff,'' said Gary Appelson
with the Caribbean Conservation Corp., a Gainesville-based group
that works on issues related to endangered sea turtles. ``eBay may
be the world's largest online black market for endangered species
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservation groups say the problem is likely to get worse as
the popularity of online trading grows.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which is charged with
enforcing laws banning sales of such products, says it does not
have the resources to deal with the problem, but has been
consulting with eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials say they are working to reduce illegal sales
through increased monitoring and user education. But they say there
is no way to stop every illegal item from being listed.
</P>
<P>
   They also say it's often difficult to know for sure that an item
is illegal unless it is examined by an expert.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce restrictions might apply to one species of animal, such
as Indian elephants, but not a related species, such as African
elephants. It is also possible that items such as jewelry made from
sea turtle shells could be made from other, similar-looking
materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, eBay doesn't have a team of sea turtle
scientists,'' said Rob Chestnut, the company lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation groups say it is likely that many people posting
such items on e-Bay do not realize it is illegal to sell them. Many
of the products are trinkets, antiques and heirlooms, such as a
cigarette holder made from turtle shell that was posted on the site
this week.
</P>
<P>
   But whether they know it or not, conservationists say, people
selling those products are broadening markets that lead to
increased killing and poaching of everything from sea turtles to
elephants.
</P>
<P>
   Based in San Jose, Calif., eBay provides a forum for buying and
selling millions of products around the clock. With eBay, items
that used to be in garage sales can now be put on display in a
global flea market. More than 400,000 new items are posted daily.
</P>
<P>
   Company policy prohibits the listing of items made from sea
turtles, bears, leopards and other rare animals, but such items
could be quickly found on the site this week.
</P>
<P>
   Appelson said an eBay search last week turned up 50 items
believed to be made from hawksbill sea turtles, a critically
endangered species. Jewelry, eyeglass frames and even cigarette
holders are made from hawksbill shell, which is known commonly as
``tortoise shell.''
</P>
<P>
   A search by the Washington, D.C.-based U.S. Humane Society found
more than 400 ivory products on eBay, said Teresa Telecky, the
organization's director of wildlife trade. Laws dealing with the
ivory trade are complicated, but Telecky said the Humane Society
determined from a description of the products listed that many of
them could not be legally traded.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the items posted on eBay are pictured and contain a
short description and history.
</P>
<P>
   Telecky said online trading has ``defeated the normal
import/export systems that are used to keep these things out of the
country.'' Law enforcement officials who want to sniff out illegal
wildlife products can't just check bags at airports anymore, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The interstate sale of products made from endangered species was
outlawed by the Endangered Species Act in 1973. The act applies to
products made before the ban was implemented, wildlife officials
say _ at least as far back as the turn of the last century.
Violating the act is punishable by up to one year in jail and
$100,000 in criminal fines per person. Civil fines can be assessed
up to $25,000 per violation.
</P>
<P>
   The Humane Society and other conservation groups say the trading
problem is getting worse as online shopping grows. Currently, there
are 3.4 million items listed on eBay in 2,900 categories. Every
day, more than $8 million worth of merchandise is sold.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jane Lavin, a senior special agent with the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, said Internet trading poses problems that
traditional commerce does not. There's more volume, more speed and
more anonymity, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin said wildlife officials have been devising a strategy to
deal with the problem, but she said she could not disclose details
at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Pursglove, eBay's spokesman, said eBay users have the
responsibility to abide by an agreement with the company not to
sell illegal items. If they persist in doing so, they can be barred
from using the service.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials agreed to step up monitoring after talking
with conservation groups in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut, the company attorney, said the difficulty in
enforcement goes beyond sales volume.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company immediately notified the Fish and Wildlife
Service after the Caribbean Conservation Corporation raised
questions about turtle products. But the federal agent said it was
difficult to tell which items were illegal without looking at them.
</P>
<P>
   Some items advertised as ``tortoise shell'' are made from
plastic or other products, not sea turtle. Others are old enough to
be legal to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want a reputation for selling illegal things,''
Chestnut said. But if a federal agent had problems easily
recognizing illegal products, ``it's a lot to expect us to
recognize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Telecky, with the Humane Society, said there's an easy answer to
selling items that may be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   When in doubt, ``they should just say no,'' she said.

&HT;     YOUNG MAY GET OK TO PLAY FOR 49ERS AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ Steve Young, who sat out the last 13 games of
the San Francisco 49ers' season after suffering back-to-back
concussions, will probably be cleared medically to play this year,
his agent said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite probable he will,'' Leigh Steinberg said Thursday
while watching practice for Saturday's Shrine Bowl game. ``He could
pass a physical. It's just his choice. Steve still wants to play.
He's weighing his options. His goal has always been to retire a
49er, and he's not ready to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the 49ers never admitted it, Young apparently did
suffer a concussion on Sept. 19 against New Orleans when blitzing
safety Chris Hewitt used his helmet as a projectile in hitting the
quarterback head-on. The hit knocked Young into a supine position
on the Candlestick Park sod.
</P>
<P>
   A week later in Arizona, cornerback Aeneas Williams slammed into
Young on a blitz and knocked him out for a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Concussions in consecutive weeks compelled Young's neurologist,
Dr. Gary Steinberg of Stanford Medical School, to recommend that he
not play for the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Young has now had enough time to recover that agent Steinberg,
no relation to the neurologist, expects that Young will be cleared
to play again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the risk is his,'' Leigh Steinberg said. ``Steve's
decisions now are: Does he feel like he wants to do another season
or two? What will the 49ers' protection be like next year? We need
to hear their plans, how they plan to protect him.''
</P>
<P>
   Something else that may influence Young's football decision is
his impending marriage to Barbara Graham, 30, of Phoenix. They are
planning to wed sometime in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters for the 49ers is the NFL's unexpected new
date for the start of free agency, Feb. 11. That means teams have
to be in compliance with the salary cap for 2000 by Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers must slash $24 million from their player payroll to
get in line with the per-team cap of $61 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It squeezes the timetable down,'' general manager Bill Walsh
said. ``It forces us to make our decisions quicker. It's the
accountants now, basically, trying to work this out. Maybe Feb. 10
is fine. When you first hear it you say, `Oh, my God,' then you
just face it and get to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said that if the 49ers are successful in slashing Young's
salary while offering him contract incentives to make up the
difference, the other five players targeted for salary reductions
might fall in line. Those players are linebacker Ken Norton, strong
safety Tim McDonald, left guard Ray Brown, wide receiver Jerry Rice
and center Chris Dalman.

THE GREAT BLACK HOPE: CAN A BLACK DRAMA DRAW A MAINSTREAM
AUDIENCE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``City of Angels'' arrives on CBS Saturday night toting
enormously heavy baggage, so the least of its concerns is the
pre-hype view that it's nothing more than a darker (read: cheaper)
version of ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   And I mean that literally and figuratively.
</P>
<P>
   Try as one might to judge the black-cast series as just another
drama to be dissed or defended on the merits of its writing and the
strength of its characters, ``City of Angels'' isn't just another
drama.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be. For one thing, I can't recall a black drama ever
sustaining life well into a second season. For another, black
dramas are asked to jump through the most impossible of hoops: to
be the social, political, cultural and emotional everything to all
black people, most of whom can't agree on real-life issues like
affirmative action, reparations and Louis Farrakhan, let alone TV
tastes. And on top of that, predominantly black series often work
as repellents to white viewers convinced that shows with ethnic
sensibilities will eventually wrap dramatic story lines around
white-on-black oppression.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is unfortunate, considering that the overarching
vision of co-creators and producers Steven Bochco and Paris Barclay
is to avoid focusing directly on issues relating to race. Bochco,
who chose the medical genre because of its life-and-death morality
plays, offers in ``City of Angels'' a mainstream series where the
medical heroes aren't black doctors as much as doctors who just
happen to be black.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, add this to the litany of hurdles this
series must clear to keep going: How do you write a show that's
universal enough to attract white viewers, yet culturally authentic
enough to satisfy viewers of color who want to see people who talk
and walk like them?
</P>
<P>
   ``City of Angels'' is already a cut above most black dramas _ it
at least looks like quality. It has the muted colors and shadowed
lighting of ``NYPD Blue'' and even ``Hill Street Blues,'' and, in
Blair Underwood, a real star presence _ or, at the very least, a
new fashion statement with that African-print surgical cap he
wears.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional Angels of Mercy hospital, nestled in a poor
neighborhood in Los Angeles, is a large sweat-on-the-walls place
where the equipment is third-generation, the floors are dirty, the
lights always seem to be flickering, and angry patients always seem
to be waiting.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of talk of money _ wanting it, finding it, getting
it _ which presents the hospital as a woefully underfunded,
understaffed operation that's essentially pieced together with duct
tape.
</P>
<P>
   If ``ER'' looks shabby compared to the country club corridors of
``Chicago Hope,'' then ``City of Angels'' looks like a Third World
country. It's home for those whose choices in life are slim to
none. These aren't doctors as much as Peace Corps workers.
</P>
<P>
   The backbone of the series is Dr. Ben Turner, played with
dashing passion by Underwood, who has incorporated quite a swagger
since he last worked with Bochco as a buppie lawyer on ``L.A.
Law.'' As acting surgical chief, he's overseeing a batch of
residents, including Dr. Williams (Hill Harper), a hothead quick to
play the race card in a turf war against a white resident (Phil
Buckman as Dr. Weiss).
</P>
<P>
   When not putting out that fire, he's tussling with Lillian Price
(Vivica A. Fox), a former flame hastily brought in to replace a
fired medical director.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Warren supplies suspicious conviction as the hospital's
CEO, and there's a wonderfully vulgar performance by Robert Morse,
who plays the hospital board president as though he's a
power-hungry mobster.
</P>
<P>
   Morse and Buckman are the only two playing main characters who
aren't black or Hispanic, and if viewers are jolted by this, ``City
of Angels'' will have a difficult road.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the first three episodes, few things happen you
haven't seen in another Bochco show or hospital drama: There's lots
of earnestness but little energy. But how it manages to squeeze its
ethnic sensibilities inside its mainstream jar is subtle and
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The lighter, clunkier scenes include a white doctor
misdiagnosing a little girl's ashy legs as some kind of allergic
reaction (''It's a black thang,'' responds the girl, as two black
female doctors crack up laughing). The heavier stuff includes a
situation next week in which Williams makes a judgment call about a
black patient he thinks is a gangbanger (he's a doctor). ``ER's''
Dr. Greene was accused of the same thing, but black-on-black
prejudice presents quite a novel twist.
</P>
<P>
   Bochco and Nicholas Wooton wrote the pilot episode, and their
vision will remind you of ``Hill Street Blues'' in its look and
feel and ``L.A. Law'' for its attempt to provide us with a loftily
principled drama that refuses to take itself too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``City of Angels'' is rife with Bochco's signature quirkiness,
including a chairman of the hospital supervisory board with a foot
fetish, a sedated gallbladder patient who is mistaken for dead and
sent to the morgue, and a man who needs a Golden Globe Award
removed from his, well, ``there.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also far too many contrived scenes, the most
unbelievable being when Price gets a drugged-out mother released
immediately from jail and has the woman undergo a rather miraculous
turnaround to care for her children and mother.
</P>
<P>
   CBS plans to give ``City of Angels'' time to find an audience,
but I wonder what kind of audience it'll attract at the sitcom hour
of 7 p.m. I also wonder if all this publicity will eventually do
this drama in.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to come out with a show that carries historical
significance. But one has to wonder about the risk of getting
buried under its heavy burden. We'll see.

   SCHOOL-MICROCASTS _ WASHINGTON _ Only 300 or so of the nation's
115,000 schools have applied for and gotten one of the 1,000 free
satellite dishes offered by Echostar Communications of Littleton,
Colo., so that school leaders can get monthly briefings on
security, violence reduction and detection of serious mental health
problems in youth. The first monthly ``microcast'' will be Jan. 20.
Three federal departments, the National Education Association and a
dozen other big associations of K-12 educators co-sponsor the
effort, which was announced by President Clinton last June.
Organizers say they still expect success because lots of schools
already had satellite dishes. (Mollison, Cox News Service).

   APACHE-INVESTIGATION _ DAYTON, Ohio _ The U.S. Army has launched
a special investigation into a complex flight-control system
suspected in more than 60 aviation incidents involving Apache
helicopters, including a much-publicized May 5, 1999, crash near
Kosovo that killed both pilots. At least three major accidents
since 1985 are linked to problems with the Apache's flight control
system, a Dayton Daily News examination found. In addition, the
examination found, the same system remains a suspect in at least
two other major crashes. One of them is the crash near Kosovo,
which is now part of a separate U.S. Justice Department
examination, the Daily News has learned. The other is a December
1997 crash near Fort Hood, Texas, which also killed both pilots.

<P>
   I must be getting old. My frenetic seed-ordering self seems to
have flown off, leaving me to wade through my flood of catalogs
with a dry voice in my ear: ``You have plenty of seed packets
stuffed in the old ham boiler, so cool it.'' Is that you,
Grandmother?
</P>
<P>
   This year, I'm concentrating on improving the soil for the
20-some old roses I ordered, and I don't need another plant to
plague me. OK, so I had the fever, but I'm over it.
</P>
<P>
   My advice to anyone right now would be to spend the year
planting old seeds (or ones from friends), pruning and dividing the
plants you have, composting and tending your soil. You will do your
garden, and your bank account, a favor.
</P>
<P>
   But that's no fun, and besides, all those tantalizing seed
catalogs are pouring into the mailbox. There are too many good ones
to mention, and the famous old-timers, like Burpee, Cook's Garden,
Johnny's Selected Seeds and White Flower Farm, can fend for
themselves. So I want to give the best little guys some play, for
the sake of biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   A few cutting-edge types who sold out to big companies but
apparently missed running their own show have created themselves
anew: Brent and Becky Heath, of Gloucester, Va., who sold their
superb Daffodil Mart to White Flower Farm, are now Brent &AMP; Becky's
Bulbs. It is offering some fine summer bulbs this year, like seven
different crocosmias and four different Colocasia esculentas, or
elephant ears, like Black Magic, which has an 18-inch dark purplish
leaf (877-661-2852; free catalog).
</P>
<P>
   Renee Shepherd, who sold Shepherd's Garden Seeds, also to White
Flower Farm, has resurfaced as Renee's Garden in Felton, Calif.
(831-335-7228; she also sells her seeds through Garden.com:
800-466-8142). Ms. Shepherd swears that Mignonette, a hardy
French-style alpine strawberry, can be planted from seed in spring
and bear sweet little berries by summer.
</P>
<P>
   I usually order my tomato seeds from Southern Exposure Seed
Exchange, in Mineral, Va. (540-894-9480; catalog, $2), because it
has everything from the reliable Rutgers to a heat-tolerant
Brandywine.
</P>
<P>
   Select Seeds, in Union, Conn. (860-684-9310; catalog, $1), has a
growing collection of unusual old-fashioned flower seeds and
plants. The vines are tempting, particularly the creeping gloxinias
(Asarina scandens), like Joan of Lorraine, a deep violet-blue
bell-shaped flower from Mexico, and Sky Blue, with arrowhead-shaped
leaves and tubular blue flowers with striped white throats.
</P>
<P>
   The owner, Marilyn Barlow, is excited about a very fragrant
night-blooming tobacco (Nicotiana x sanderae) in shades of white
and pale pink to rose and purple, which originated from the Flower
and Herb Exchange in Decorah, Iowa, and a claret-red Polish
amaranth (Amaranthus cruentus), ``a nice tall, sturdy plant, with
very airy flower heads, so it stands by itself without having to
tie it.'' Hear, hear.
</P>
<P>
   As for unusual trees and fruiting plants, Oikos Tree Crops, in
Kalamazoo, Mich. (616-624-6233; free catalog), offers American
persimmon, beach plum, pawpaw, hazelnut, black gum, medlar and many
others. Edible Landscaping, in Afton, Va. (800-524-4156; free
catalog), is another favorite, with its figs, peaches, plums,
persimmons, grapes, apples and even saffron crocus bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite for wildflowers is still the New England Wildflower
Society (508-877-7630; catalog, $2.50) in Framingham, Mass., a
nonprofit conservation group offering more than 200 species of
seeds and spores, from rare speckled wood lilies and dwarf
fothergillas to the spectacular giant wood fern, Dryopteris
goldieana.
</P>
<P>
   Territorial Seed Co., in Cottage Grove, Ore. (541-942-9547; free
catalog), has a good collection of vegetable and flower seeds,
including artichokes; cover crops like oats and buckwheat for
improving soil; and many medicinal herbs, from St. Johnswort to
stinging nettle.
</P>
<P>
   Seeds of Change, an organic seed company in Santa Fe, N.M.
(888-762-7333; free catalog), also offers medicinal herb seeds,
from Vitex agnus-castus, the chaste tree, to Papaver somniferum,
the poppies that put Dorothy out in ``The Wizard of Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Meadow Farm, in Montague Center, Mass. (413-367-2394;
catalog, $3), is a family-run nursery specializing in unusual
annuals and perennials, like Osteospermum ecklonis Silver Sparkler
(a white African daisy with electric blue centers and blue on the
reverse side of the petals) and seven different baptisias.
</P>
<P>
   Siskiyou Rare Plant Nursery, in Medford, Ore., which specializes
in alpine and rock garden plants, sells everything from bog
rosemary to a hardy daisy from South Africa (541-772-6846; catalog,
$3).
</P>
<P>
   Niche Gardens, in Chapel Hill, N.C. (919-967-0078; catalog, $3),
has unusual plants, from Eupatorium rugosum Chocolate, a native
with creamy white 6-inch flowers on chocolate-colored leaves and
purple stems, to Equisetum scirpoides striatum, a tiny, ancient
horsetail.
</P>
<P>
   Ronniger's, the old seed-potato farm in Moyie Springs, Idaho,
has sold its business to Greg Anthony's Seed Co., in Ellensburg,
Wash. The new company, called Irish Eyes With a Hint of Garlic, is
offering a great collection of organic seed potatoes, as well as
sweet potatoes, cover crops, onions, alliums and garlic, the last
for fall planting (509-925-6025; catalog, $2). Ronniger's now
specializes in heirloom beans (208-267-8218; free catalog).
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't know about J.L. Hudson, you must order ``The
2000 Ethnobotanical Catalog of Seeds,'' for $1, to keep up with
Hudson's views on invasive plants (``the myth of the menace'') and
benefit from his seed collection and encyclopedic knowledge. He
famously has no telephone (``If your phone doesn't ring, it's me,''
he writes), so you must use a pen, if you remember what that is:
J.L. Hudson, Star Route 2, Box 337, La Honda, Calif. 94020.
</P>
<P>
   You may read the catalogs, but don't forget all those seeds in
the ham boiler.

   TV-COMPUTER-GAMES (Undated) _ Many viewers today who were raised
on video games and science fiction movies are noticing how much new

   TIES-FASHION (Undated) _ For years we've been hearing that the
traditional uniform of male power was over. Casual Fridays gave way
to casual summers to polo-and-chinos year-round at Wall Street
firms like American Express. Cybernerds made it cool to wear ``I'm
With Microsoft, Stupid'' T-shirts to big meetings. But it seems
that reports of the tie's death have been greatly exaggerated. At
the men's wear shows in Milan last week, Prada and Gucci walked
suits and ties down the runway. Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, a house known for
shunning such formality, also knotted ties on its models. Hot
designers are now telling us we really (italics)do(end italics)
want to wear ties. Ideally, very expensive ones. By Rick Marin. &QL;

theme music from ``Shaft,'' and wrapped up in a joint appearance
with Samuel L. Jackson, who is starring in the remake of the 1971
movie, about a Harlem police officer with few problems getting
women to have sex with him. The designer is doing the costumes. By

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 59, single, and have no outstanding debt and no pension.
My current income is $50,000 a year. My assets are $61,000 in CDs,
a $13,000 annuity, $19,000 invested in Vanguard Health Care,
$14,000 in Vanguard Index 500, $11,000 in Vanguard Index Value,
$12,000 in Vanguard Prime Money Market, $24,000 in AARP Growth and
Income, $34,000 in AARP Capital Growth, and $7,000 in checking,
cash, and miscellaneous accounts. In addition, I have these IRA
accounts: $36,000 in Vanguard Windsor II, $21,000 in Vanguard
Wellington, and $42,000 in bank CDs. I would like to retire at 62
with a minimum of $36,000 a year. What can I do? What is realistic?
</P>
<P>
   D.B., Coopersburg, Pa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think your expectations are too high. With your fairly
conservative portfolio, you can't expect a lot of growth over a
three-year period, and at current levels you would need a yield in
excess of 12.2 percent to deliver a $36,000 annual income stream
without invading principal.
</P>
<P>
   You don't mention whether you will be eligible for Social
Security in a few years, and that could make a lot of difference.
But I don't think you should count on this portfolio to deliver
much more than $20,000 in annual income _ and that may be pushing
it, too.
</P>
<P>
   You also don't say whether you're continuing contributions to
any of these accounts. If there are no further contributions and
you realize average annual returns of 7 percent over the next three
years, you might expect to accumulate a total of $360,168; if you
fully funded your IRAs to the tune of $2,000 a year, the
accumulation would be $366,804.
</P>
<P>
   Given that nearly 46 percent of the portfolio is on the
fixed-income side, you should not realistically count on more than
7 percent returns.
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems with that $20,000 projection is that you
would need to have almost all of your principal _ about $310,000 _
in fixed-income securities to deliver it; this would leave you with
very little principal devoted to growth to protect you against
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you could rebudget to live on $25,000 a year, you would
probably be best off thinking of deferring retirement to a more
traditional age, say 65; at that point, you might project a
$412,356 total accumulation with no further contributions, or
$424,227 if you funded the IRAs but did no further saving.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the most logical approach is to save more than the 4
percent of your annual income that is represented by maximum IRA
contributions. If you could double that, the three-year
accumulation would rise to $373,441, and the five-year figure would
be $436,100.
</P>
<P>
   Another option you might consider, whether you retire at age 62
or 65 or even later, would be to look for a part-time job during
the early years of your retirement.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you could budget yourself to live on $30,000 a
year, retired at age 65, and then earned $12,000 a year for the
first five years of retirement, the picture would be a little
brighter.
</P>
<P>
   If you had $424,227 at age 65 saved and withdrew only $1,500 a
month for the first five years, you would still have have $346,745
at age 70. You could then withdraw $2,500 a month for a little more
than 12 years before depleting the funds. Both of those projections
are based on projected average portfolio returns of 6.5 percent
after retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether a gloomy picture _ but as I said at the outset, if
Social Security is in the cards, things would be much brighter.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 50 and my husband is 44. Our combined annual salary is
$118,000. Our long-term financial goals are to retire in 10 years
and to purchase a home and significantly pay down the mortgage by
the time we take early retirement. I estimate we will need $36,000
to $40,000 a year when we retire. I am not sure how much we need to
save to take this early retirement; it would be helpful to know,
because this number affects the amount of the mortgage we can take.
For the home purchase, we have saved $160,000 in CDs and money
market accounts. We also have $30,000 in emergency savings. Our
investments include a $56,000 portfolio of Vanguard stock mutual
funds, to which we add $12,000 a year. I have $333,000 in 403(b)
and Roth IRA accounts, and the contributions plus employer matches
come to $18,2100 a year. My husband has $165,000 in similar
accounts, with total contributions of $10,400 a year, including the
match. We both fully fund our Roth IRAs each year. I estimate that
we will be eligible for $16,000 a year in Social Security benefits
at age 65. Will this savings plan be sufficient to allow us to take
early retirement and save sufficient money as a hedge against
inflation? Should we increase our savings rate and not prepay the
mortgage?
</P>
<P>
   S.F., Brighton, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you keep saving at the aggressive current rate for a
decade, your current $554,000 (not including the down payment and
emergency savings money) would grow to $2,178,819, projecting
average annual portfolio growth of 10 percent. If inflation
averages 3.5 percent, you would need $56,423 in the year 2010 to
buy what $40,000 buys today.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, you would be in the enviable position of relying on less
than half of your savings pool to provide your income stream,
leaving you with well in excess of $1 million as a capital pool
that could be left in growth vehicles to protect you against
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, after five years of retirement, your Social Security
benefits would kick in, further reducing your need to rely on your
retirement portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   As for prepaying the mortgage, if you were to divert the entire
$12,000 a year that is now going into your Vanguard portfolio into
mortgage prepayments, you would still accumulate $1,978,768 over
the course of a decade _ again a pool that would allow you to
maintain a $1 million growth portfolio to deal with inflation.
You're in lovely shape, whatever course you take.
</P>
<P>
   The question whether to prepay the mortgage or to continue
building the retirement portfolio is really a matter of personal
preference. A paid-up home gives you a wonderful sense of security.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the mortgage provides tax advantages, in
direct proportion to the size of the balance, and if you take a
10-year view of your investments, they are likely to produce higher
returns than the level of interest that frugal people with a very
large down payment such as yourself should be able to obtain.

ELLIOT LEE RICHARDSON: POLITICIAN WITH CHARACTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 16, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I wish I could buy the argument that what voters want most in
leaders is ``character.'' I've seen evidence to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   No Massachusetts politician more epitomized character in public
life than Elliot Lee Richardson, the rectitudinous Yankee lost to a
brain hemorrhage on New Year's Eve at age 79. But Richardson, the
record holder for sitting in different Cabinet posts, a Dudley
Do-Right who almost always tried to do the right thing _ whether
marching across Utah Beach in the Normandy Invasion or standing up
against the perfidious Nixon gang over Watergate _ had too much
character for his own party, if not his own good.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents Reagan and Bush cut and ran from the expectation that
this senior and principled Republican should be given an important
government post. Richardson was too hot to handle for the party
that couldn't get over Nixon's crooked legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1984, Richardson lost, and lost badly, in a fight for a
US Senate nomination _ repudiated by Bay State Republicans. Against
the advice of friends, he had insisted on traveling to the 1984 GOP
convention, and challenging the precepts of Reaganism and
brain-dead tax cutting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a disaster,'' said Beacon Hill's Ann Kramer, one of
many Richardson admirers in Washington for the memorial service
held Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were up 27 points in June, then he goes to the national
convention and comes out against the Reagan platform on national
television, and we dropped 20 points in four weeks. It was a
killer. The '84 loss was very traumatic at the time, it really did
change his life. But the politics never won out over his
conscience. I just feel very blessed that I knew the man, not the
myth.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Massachusetts attorney general and lieutenant governor, as
a corruption-busting US attorney and as a sophisticated
undersecretary of state, then as the federal government's secretary
of various departments _ Commerce; Health, Education and Welfare;
Defense; and Justice _ he was one of the brainiest and most
high-minded of bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   But what people say they want in a public servant and what they
choose can be starkly different. In 1973 Richardson quit as Nixon's
attorney general rather than fire Archibald Cox, the special
Watergate prosecutor. Richardson's refusal on principle
precipitated the infamous Saturday Night Massacre that helped bring
Nixon down.
</P>
<P>
   But his quitting also gutted the stellar career to which
Richardson had dedicated himself. His own Republican Party spurned
him. Under eight years of Ronald Reagan, and then four years of
President Bush, Richardson was ostracized from his most cherished
work: public service. ``He told me that all government jobs were
more satisfying than any private-sector job,'' said Michael Deland,
a Bay State Republican now in Washington. ``The height of irony is
that he was sent to Siberia by his own party.''
</P>
<P>
   Deland called him ``a Renaissance man, who could have made a
career as a painter of landscapes or portraits. He had the
intellectual acuity of a real scholar. When Richardson was 33,
Deland said, Felix Frankfurter recommended him to be president of
Harvard. ``He relished risk, loved to fight. He often told me the
highlight of his life was landing on the beach at Normandy.''
</P>
<P>
   Deland, himself in a wheelchair, recalled encountering
Richardson in his own wheelchair downtown. ``With his impish grin,
he challenged me to a wheelchair race up High Street, risking life
and limb, tearing up High Street. He just relished a race.''
</P>
<P>
   To Marty Linsky of Harvard's Kennedy School, Richardson had an
undeserved reputation ``as a cold and distant person,'' belied by
the lively interest he took in colleagues and their families.
``Once when he was campaigning with me at a subway stop on Beacon
Street, he lectured me on how voter contact is all about touching,
and eye contact, but he did it in his intensely cerebral way, so
focused that he didn't hear the subway car coming. It brushed him
and spun him around into a mailbox.'' Linsky called him ``a man of
passion trapped in this WASP body and intellect. He believed in
what he believed in.''
</P>
<P>
   To retired Globe editor Tom Winship, a Richardson buddy for half
a century, ``Elliot had a tremendous wit, honed at Harvard. He got
A's automatically, but his whole life was the Lampoon,'' the
university's famous humor magazine. ``He was quite a painter, and a
terrific birder _ Roger Tory Peterson was one of his teachers at
Milton Academy. He had a huge amount of guts.'' Richardson, twice
wounded, came home from World War II with a Bronze Star. Winship
said he and Richardson went to Namibia as UN election observers
after apartheid was ended.
</P>
<P>
   In Namibia, said Winship, ``He was just a terrific spokesman for
decency and took on all those terrors, the apartheid people.'' The
two attended a soccer match one day. ``We turned out to be the only
two white people there in a sea of about 10,000 blacks,'' said
Winship. ``As we left, we were attacked by two crazed guys who
tried to steal our wallets. I had my money in my shoe. One guy
reached for Elliot's wallet. Elliot swung at the guy; he'd been a
helluva middleweight boxer at Harvard. The guy raked Elliot with a
broken beer bottle, which sent him to the hospital. But it was
typical of Elliot to fight rather than hand over his wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   To UMass President Bill Bulger, who once flashed a mock headline
at Richardson on St. Patrick's Day ``Vote Elliot _ he's better than
you are!'' Richardson had a fine sense of humor. ``He called me
`Muggsy.' When Richardson had to retire his 1984 campaign debt, he
got Bulger and Art Buchwald to host.
</P>
<P>
   It was two Democratic presidents who honored Richardson. Jimmy
Carter gave him the Law of the Sea Treaty, the longest and most
difficult of Richardson's many chores. President Clinton pinned him
with the Medal of Freedom, calling him ``a man of uncommon
integrity . . . (who) put the nation's interests first even when
the personal cost was very high.''
</P>
<P>
   To Harvard's Jonathan Moore, Richardson's reserve limited his
appeal on television, and masked ``this sweetness, this incredible
ability to connect on a spiritual level.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said Richardson's commitment to public service was inbred.
`` `We all have the defects of our qualities, Jonathan,' he'd say;
it meant that within our strengths lie our limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Mass. General's Dr. Tom Durant gives this example of the
Richardson clan's Yankee humor: ``After Mass. General merged with
the Brigham, I asked Elliot's brother, George, a doc here for 50
years, what he thought of the merger. He said, `Tom, I was raised
all my life to have three enemies: Russia, the Brigham, and Yale.
Now I have only Yale.' '' What Elliot Richardson's career showed
was that you cannot always choose your enemies, but your friends
choose you, and the people closest to him thought highly of him _
no doubt on that score.

AUDI S4 QUATTRO IS HIGH-PERFORMANCE VERSION OF AUDI'S A4 COMPACT
SEDAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G, CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is one of my favorites, no question.
</P>
<P>
   It's the all-new Audi S4 Quattro, a high-performance version of
Audi's entry-level A4 compact sedan.
</P>
<P>
   The S4 isn't for everyone; it's a bit pricey at $37,900 (plus
transportation and options), quite a bit higher than the price of
the base A4 1.8T, which lists for just $23,990.
</P>
<P>
   So what makes the S4 worth $14,000 more? After all, you could
buy the A4 1.8T and add a nice Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla for
the extra 14 grand, and have two cars instead of one.
</P>
<P>
   But as nice as the A4 is, it doesn't come close to the fun of
the S4, which is a virtual rocket on wheels _ not just with power,
but also with the precise control needed to make the driver feel
secure with all of that power.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a vehicle such as the Dodge Viper, full of raw muscular
power but short on precision roadhandling, the S4 does an
outstanding job of combining the two into a package that is equally
at home on the track as on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   The S4 is a wolf in sheep's clothing. On the exterior, it looks
almost like an A4, and there is nothing that tips nearby drivers to
its true nature: a street-legal race car that can carry four adults
in relative style and comfort.
</P>
<P>
   One of the keys to the S4's outstanding performance lies under
the hood. It's the 2.7-liter, 30-valve, twin-turbo V-6 engine,
rating at 250 horsepower and 258 foot-pounds of torque. With a curb
weight of less than 3,600 pounds, that's a lot of go-power. Turbo
lag is virtually eliminated by using two small turbochargers, one
on each side of the V-6.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with the standard six-speed manual transmission, the
turbo V-6 pushes this car from zero to 60 mph in 5.9 seconds. Top
speed is electronically limited to 143 mph for the U.S. market.
Without the governor, this car would go a whole lot faster, I'm
sure. A five-speed automatic with the Porsche Tiptronic clutchless
manual shifting feature is optional at no extra cost. You can let
it shift for you, or do it yourself
</P>
<P>
   Some of the superb handling comes from patented Audi Quattro
full-time all-wheel-drive system, which eliminates the torque-steer
problems associated with front-drive cars such as the base A4. The
S4's Quattro system comes with Audi's new electronic differential
locking, which works with both front and rear differentials to
virtually eliminate wheel spin. With this system, the S4 can get
moving if only one of the four wheels has at least some traction.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't one of those modern disabling traction-control
systems that reduces engine speed or applies a brake to a spinning
wheel to control the spin; instead, this is a true enabling system
that reads pavement conditions and applies power automatically to
the wheels that have traction.
</P>
<P>
   The Quattro system is available on all Audi models sold in the
U.S., but it is standard on the S4. I wouldn't want all of that
power without it, either.
</P>
<P>
   Steering is amazingly precise, and there is plenty of torque
throughout the low- and mid- power range (that 258 foot-pounds is
available from 1,800 to 3,800 rpm). The wide tires riding on
17-inch Avus alloy wheels manage to grip the road firmly.
</P>
<P>
   Driving is believing: Once you're behind the wheel of the S4,
putting it through a series of tight turns while adding more and
more power, it's easy to forget you're driving a sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is a sedan, and quite a nice one at that. The rear
seat is a bit tight for adults, especially on long trips, but it's
great for local trips, and can hold up to three kids. Up front, the
driver and passenger are in the lap of luxury in the pearl nappa
leather bucket seats.
</P>
<P>
   Leather interior is standard throughout the car, including the
armrests, steering wheel, shift knob and door-panel inserts. There
is gray-stained bird's-eye maple wood trim, too.
</P>
<P>
   Other interior features include automatic climate control,
10-way power sport seats up front (including electric lumbar
adjustment and lockable head restraints), and a three-spoke
steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   An 80-watt AM/FM/cassette/compact-disc stereo with eight
speakers is standard, but our test car came with the optional Bose
premium audio system ($650) and trunk-mounted CD changer ($550).
</P>
<P>
   Front and side air bags are standard. The side air bags are
large enough to protect the front and rear passengers from hitting
the windows or side pillars in a side impact. Unlike the front air
bags, which stay inflated for only a fraction of a second, the side
bags stay full for five seconds to protect the occupants in the
event of a rollover.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard features include a driver information display
with a six-function trip computer, power windows and door locks,
cruise control, power outside mirrors with defogger, 60/40
split-folding rear seat, full-size spare tire with matching allow
wheel, and both front and rear fog lights. There are disc brakes
all around, and the antilock system is standard. Rack-and-pinion
power steering is included, too.
</P>
<P>
   Our test car came with two options packages. The convenience
package ($1,200) added a power sunroof, built-in universal
garage-door opener, and auto-dimming inside and outside mirrors.
The cold-weather package ($575) tacked on heated front seats and an
expandable ski storage sack. The only other option on our vehicle
was the integrated hands-free mobile phone ($495), which I never
noticed during my weeklong test drive. I'm not sure where it was.
</P>
<P>
   Total sticker for our vehicle was $41,895, including $525
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   My only real gripe (other than the tight back seat and the high
price) was the absolutely awful ``imola yellow'' exterior paint.
Just about everyone I know who saw me driving this car felt obliged
to comment first about how ugly the color was. I call it either
``New York taxicab yellow'' or ``French's mustard yellow.'' Ugh!!!
</P>
<P>
   It does come in other colors, thank goodness.
</P>
<P>
   The yellow is one of only two colors that are unique to the S4
model, however; the other is ``Nogaro blue pearl effect.'' (Who
thinks up these silly names for car colors, anyway?) The other
colors offered are available on all A4 models.
</P>
<P>
   The trunk is big enough for a lot of stuff: It measures 13.7
cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   All of that power does eat up some gas. EPA fuel-economy ratings
are 17 miles per gallon in the city and 24 mpg on the highway.
Unleaded premium fuel is recommended, and the tank holds 16.4
gallons.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   AT a GLANCE: 2000 Audi S4 sedan
</P>
<P>
   THE PACKAGE: Compact, five-passenger, all-wheel-drive,
twin-turbo, V-6 powered, four-door premium performance sedan.
</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS: New for 2000, this is a souped-up version of Audi's
entry-level A4 sedan, but at a premium price. It offers pure
driving enjoyment with lots of power and extraordinary
roadhandling.
</P>
<P>
   NEGATIVES: A bit pricey; back seat a bit tight for adults; truly
yucky yellow color on our test car.
</P>
<P>
   MAJOR COMPETITORS: BMW 328i, Lexus GS 300, Infiniti I30t,
Mercedes-Benz C280/C43, Saab 9-3 Viggen.
</P>
<P>
   EPA FUEL ECONOMY: 17 mpg city/24 highway.
</P>
<P>
   BASE PRICE: $37,900 plus $525 transportation.
</P>
<P>
   AS TESTED: $41,895 (including transportation).
</P>
<P>
   ON THE ROAD RATING: A-plus (what a ride!).

<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ Quick question: Who won last year's Shrine
Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   Quick answer: Who really cares?
</P>
<P>
   We do know who didn't win. It wasn't the North or the South.
</P>
<P>
   Or the Blue or the Gray.
</P>
<P>
   Or the Shirts or the Skins.
</P>
<P>
   That one team actually wins and another loses is among the more
insignificant factors of the Shrine Bowl, which isn't about winning
or losing as much as it's about exposure for kids trying to reach
the next level.
</P>
<P>
   College kids trying to live the NFL life.
</P>
<P>
   And hospitalized kids trying to live a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   The 75th Shrine Bowl, Saturday at Stanford Stadium, is expected
to generate nearly $250,000 for the 22 Shriners Hospitals, which
rely solely on donations and fund-raisers for operations.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, last year's winner was the East by a 20-10 score
over the West. Remember?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the few all-star games where the players and
coaches are not paid,'' said Florida's Steve Spurrier, the head
coach of this year's East squad. ``We do it because it's a good
cause. Nowadays, unfortunately, society is such that a lot of
people don't look at it that way. They say, `What's in it for
me?'''
</P>
<P>
   That may explain the no-shows. For various and obvious reasons,
not all of college's elite players will suit up on Saturday _
nobody from Florida State, the national champion that showcased
Peter Warrick. And nobody from runner-up
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech after center Keith Short (injury) and kicker Shane
Graham (family conflict) bailed out.
</P>
<P>
   Also absent is Heisman Trophy winner Ron Dayne of Wisconsin.
Dayne is reportedly playing in next week's Hula Bowl, where the
Badgers' Barry Alvarez will be coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Other players chose different all-star games that guarantee a
paycheck. Others listened to their agents and stayed home to avoid
possible injuries. And, of course, others were ineligible because
they're not seniors.
</P>
<P>
   But the Shrine organizers maintain there's no lack of talent
this year and point to the hundreds of NFL officials swarming the
sidelines for every Shrine practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 goal for the Shrine Bowl is to provide publicity for
Shriners Hospitals,'' said game coordinator Jeff Foster, ``and the
talented players we have here this week _ and the last 74 years _
have provided a vehicle for us to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second goal is to provide these players an opportunity to
show their talents.''

&HT;     YOUNG MAY GET OK TO PLAY FOR 49ERS AGAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ Steve Young, who sat out the last 13 games of
the San Francisco 49ers' season after suffering back-to-back
concussions, will probably be cleared medically to play this year,
his agent said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite probable he will,'' Leigh Steinberg said Thursday
while watching practice for Saturday's Shrine Bowl game. ``He could
pass a physical. It's just his choice. Steve still wants to play.
He's weighing his options. His goal has always been to retire a
49er, and he's not ready to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the 49ers never admitted it, Young apparently did
suffer a concussion on Sept. 19 against New Orleans when blitzing
safety Chris Hewitt used his helmet as a projectile in hitting the
quarterback head-on. The hit knocked Young into a supine position
on the Candlestick Park sod.
</P>
<P>
   A week later in Arizona, cornerback Aeneas Williams slammed into
Young on a blitz and knocked him out for a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Concussions in consecutive weeks compelled Young's neurologist,
Dr. Gary Steinberg of Stanford Medical School, to recommend that he
not play for the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Young has now had enough time to recover that agent Steinberg,
no relation to the neurologist, expects that Young will be cleared
to play again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the risk is his,'' Leigh Steinberg said. ``Steve's
decisions now are: Does he feel like he wants to do another season
or two? What will the 49ers' protection be like next year? We need
to hear their plans, how they plan to protect him.''
</P>
<P>
   Something else that may influence Young's football decision is
his impending marriage to Barbara Graham, 30, of Phoenix. They are
planning to wed sometime in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters for the 49ers is the NFL's unexpected new
date for the start of free agency, Feb. 11. That means teams have
to be in compliance with the salary cap for 2000 by Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers must slash $24 million from their player payroll to
get in line with the per-team cap of $61 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It squeezes the timetable down,'' general manager Bill Walsh
said. ``It forces us to make our decisions quicker. It's the
accountants now, basically, trying to work this out. Maybe Feb. 10
is fine. When you first hear it you say, `Oh, my God,' then you
just face it and get to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said that if the 49ers are successful in slashing Young's
salary while offering him contract incentives to make up the
difference, the other five players targeted for salary reductions
might fall in line. Those players are linebacker Ken Norton, strong
safety Tim McDonald, left guard Ray Brown, wide receiver Jerry Rice
and center Chris Dalman.

PSYCHIATRISTS ASK, IS RACISM ABNORMAL?  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Del., Mass., Pa.)   By EMILY EAKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1851, Dr. Samuel A. Cartwright, a Louisiana surgeon and
psychologist, filed a report in the New Orleans Medical and
Surgical Journal on diseases prevalent among the South's black
population. Among the various maladies Cartwright described was
``drapetomania'' or ``the disease causing slaves to run away.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a serious mental illness, drapetomania, wrtwright,
was happily quite treatable: ``The cause, in the most of cases,
that induces the negro to run away from service, is as much a
disease of the mind as any other species of mental alienation, and
much more curable. With the advantages of proper medical advice,
strictly followed, this troublesome practice that many negroes have
of running away can be almost entirely prevented.''
</P>
<P>
   A particularly absurd chapter in the annals of racist
19th-century science?
</P>
<P>
   Without question, but for Alvin Poussaint, a clinical professor
of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, Cartwright's hopelessly
unscientific diagnosis is of more than just historical interest. It
is a vivid illustration of how definitions of normal and abnormal
behavior are shaped by the values of the society that makes them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture influences what you consider pathology,'' says
Poussaint. ``Cartwright saw slavery as normative. So when slaves
deviated from the norm, he called them mentally ill. The business
of deciding what's normal and what's psychopathology gets
influenced by culture and politics. It's not hard science.''
</P>
<P>
   Poussaint says that when it comes to understanding racism,
contemporary psychiatry is as in the dark about its own biases as
the benighted Cartwright. Poussaint's argument is not with racist
psychiatrists but with the psychiatry of racism. Is racism a mental
disorder?
</P>
<P>
   The debate is decades old, but was recently reignited when John
Rocker, a pitcher for the Atlanta Braves, made bigoted statements
about blacks, homosexuals and foreigners last month in the pages of
Sports Illustrated. Last week Rocker was ordered by the
commissioner of major league baseball to undergo a psychological
evaluation. Since then, fans, therapists, pundits, sports figures,
talk show hosts and columnists have all weighed in on the degree to
which his comments and the league's decision were based on science,
stupidity, financial concerns and spin control.
</P>
<P>
   For most psychiatrists, the answer is clear: racism is
unacceptable social behavior, but not evidence of a mental
disorder. There is no entry for racism in the latest edition of the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, a compendium of mental illnesses
known as DSM-IV.
</P>
<P>
   ``If psychiatry were to define racism as a mental disorder,
you'd have to include the Nazis, and the Serbs who hate Muslims _
there would be no end,'' says Dr. Robert Spitzer, a psychiatrist at
the New York State Psychiatric Institute and a consultant on the
DSM-IV. ``Almost everyone would be ill.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Spitzer concedes that prevalence alone does not
negate a need for diagnosis. To meet the American Psychiatric
Association's criteria for a distinct mental disorder, he says,
psychiatrists would have to show that a racist's mental processes
interfered with normal functioning.
</P>
<P>
   Poussaint says he can do that. Arguing that racism can sometimes
_ though not all the time _ be a mental disorder, he says that
racists frequently exhibit symptoms associated with major
psychopathology, including paranoia (feeling threatened
unrealistically by a particular group), projection (imbuing this
group with traits that have negative associations) and fixed
beliefs (categorical opinions like ``all foreigners are dumb'').
</P>
<P>
   The real reason the psychiatric association hasn't made racism a
mental health issue, he argues, is because ``it hasn't been a
mental health issue for them.'' To pathologize racism, he said,
would require its members ``to look at their friends, their
relatives, and themselves'' in an uncomfortable light.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the APA is predominantly white and male. Of its
current 38,200 members, only 865, or 2.3 percent, are
African-American and 1,720, or 4.5 percent, are Hispanic. Some
12,000, or 31 percent, are women. There is no doubt that psychiatry
has been susceptible to some of the same biases harbored by the
society at large, most notably toward women and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Until well after World War II, instruction in now-discredited
Freudian concepts like ``penis envy'' and ``castrating female'' was
a routine part of psychiatric training. More egregious was the
theory of the schizophrenic mother, whose bad parenting was
supposedly to blame for her child's schizophrenia. Widely accepted
well into the 1970s, the theory has been supplanted by explanations
focusing on brain chemistry and biology.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexuals fared little better. Until the early 1970s, the APA
regarded homosexuality as a pathology. After heavy lobbying from
gay rights activists, including a psychiatrist who was a member of
the APA and who spoke at the 1972 annual meeting, his face
concealed by a mask to preserve his anonymity, the board of
trustees voted to remove homosexuality from the DSM-IV. The
membership followed suit in 1974. (One bemused observer labeled it
``the single greatest cure in the history of psychiatry.'')
</P>
<P>
   Poussaint credits politics _ the women's movement and gay rights
activists _ not better science, for overturning faulty psychiatric
doctrine. His own politicking to change the association's opinion
on racism has so far been less successful. In the mid-1960s,
Poussaint joined other civil rights workers in Mississippi, where
he helped desegregate the hospitals. The bigotry he witnessed among
the region's white psychiatrists as well as a spate of racist
killings convinced him to act.
</P>
<P>
   Along with seven other black psychiatrists, Poussaint appealed
to the organization to add racism to the DSM-IV. Their request was
turned down. ``Let's say that group of black psychiatrists had been
in control of establishing what the diagnoses should be in the
DSM,'' Poussaint says now. ``In some way, racism would be in that
book.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Today, many of Poussaint's black colleagues say a DSM
label would actually be counterproductive. ``Racism is so deeply
ingrained in our culture that to try to identify individuals who
are racist is in some ways to trivialize the depth and breadth of
the problem,'' says James Jones, a professor of social psychology
at the University of Delaware and the director of the minority
fellowships program at the American Psychological Association.
Others believe that pathologizing racism would inadvertently give
racists a legal defense for hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, psychiatrists were probably more disposed to treat
racism as a mental illness 50 years ago than today. In the 1950s,
the profession even flirted with a quasi-medical definition of
racism, although at the behest of the American Jewish Committee,
not American blacks. In 1950, four scholars published an
influential study titled ``The Authoritarian Personality.'' Three
of the authors were Jewish. Two of them, including the philosopher
Theodor Adorno, were refugees from Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal was to explain Hitler's genocidal anti-Semitism.
Based on their evaluations of more than 2,000 American adults, the
authors concluded that extreme racist tendencies were associated
with an abnormal ``personality syndrome'' that they labeled
authoritarian. Not a DSM-IV diagnosis exactly, but almost.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the decade, however, the theory underlying ``The
Authoritarian Personality'' had been substantially revised. The
book was found to have serious methodological problems, and efforts
to test the hypothesis yielded mixed results. The Harvard
psychologist Thomas Pettigrew struck a decisive blow. Pettigrew
examined racist attitudes in eight American towns, four in the
North, four in the South. In the Northern towns, he found some
correlation of racist attitudes with the syndrome described in
``The Authoritarian Personality.''
</P>
<P>
   In the South, however, he found that racism was so common it was
merely a social norm. ``You almost had to be mentally ill to be
tolerant in the South,'' says Pettigrew, now a retired professor at
the University of California at Santa Cruz. ``The authoritarian
personality was a good explanation at the individual level but not
at the societal level.''
</P>
<P>
   By the dawn of the civil rights era, the psychiatric profession
had largely abandoned racism to social psychologists like Pettigrew
who helped formulate the model in currency today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racism has very much been depathologized,'' says Janet
Schofield, a social psychologist at the University of Pittsburgh
who studies racial attitudes among children. ``There's been a major
shift from being influenced by things like the authoritarian
personality to thinking of stereotyping and prejudice as a
consequence of normal psychological processes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bombarded with more information than the brain can handle, she
explains, people are apt to rely on general concepts. Just the way
Americans divide daybeds, settees and chaise longues into the
general categories ``chairs'' and ``sofas,'' they divide groups of
people into categories based to some degree on stereotypes.
``Racism,'' says Ms. Schofield, ``may be the result of inevitable
processes.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an explanation for racism, not an excuse. But for
Poussaint, at least, it is not likely to be the last word. His
final appeal is to common sense: ``If you have a mental process
that leads some people to commit genocide, how can you not think
that's a mental disorder?''

GENTS: IT'S TIME TO TIE ONE ON AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 16)  
(lh) 
 By RICK MARIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tie or no tie?
</P>
<P>
   Tie, if you are the head of a new-media company trying to look
grown-up enough to merge with one of the world's biggest old-media
companies.
</P>
<P>
   No tie, if you are the head of that old-media company trying to
look like you can swing with the new.
</P>
<P>
   It did not go unnoticed, to say the least, that at the press
conference last week announcing the proposed marriage of America
Online and Time Warner, Steve Case, 41, of AOL put on a tie and
Gerald Levin, 60, of Time Warner took his off. Maybe they should
have e-mailed each other that morning. Maybe they did, and the
whole thing was a public relations ploy. But that is unlikely,
since one man looked so much more powerful than the other. It was
clear who was buying whom.
</P>
<P>
   For years, we have been hearing that the traditional uniform of
male power was over. Casual Fridays gave way to casual summers to
polo-and-chinos year-round at Wall Street firms like American
Express. Cybernerds made it cool to wear ``I'm With Microsoft,
Stupid'' T-shirts to big meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems that reports of the tie's death have been greatly
exaggerated. At the men's wear shows in Milan, Italy, last week,
Prada and Gucci walked suits and ties down the runway. Dolce &AMP;
Gabbana, a house known for shunning such formality, also knotted
ties on its models. Hot designers are now telling us we really do
want to wear ties. Ideally, very expensive ones.
</P>
<P>
   So what's an aspiringly hip guy to do? Start wearing them to the
office on Fridays, at the risk of being asked repeatedly if he has
a job interview? When he goes out at night to tie one on, should he
tie one on?
</P>
<P>
   Say, for instance, a young Silicon Alley entrepreneur wanted to
spend some of his IPO loot at a four-star French restaurant. Le
Cirque 2000 still calls for a jacket and tie. But at Le Bernardin,
ties are optional, the new dress code meaning, ``We'd rather you
wore a tie, but if you're rich enough to pay $250 for a Burgundy,
please step right this way, sir.'' Even La Cote Basque gave up the
good fight a year ago, because, said Jean-Paul Zaremba, the
manager, ``We were running out of ties to give people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ties peaked in the early 1990s. Gerald Anderson, executive
director of the Neckwear Association of America, said that sales
swelled during the '80s power-tie era, then crescendoed with the
creative-executive look that called for novelties like the Jerry
Garcia tie: Dead from the neck down.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of ties sold is down since then, from about 117
million in 1994 to 105 million in 1998, Anderson said. But in
dollar terms, sales are up, from about $1.5 billion to $1.6
billion. Fewer men are buying ties, but they're buying more
expensive ones. ``The people who bought $15 to $20 ties went
casual,'' Anderson said. Maybe so, but the average price of a tie
has risen from $13.16 to $15.16 _ news that may shock shoppers
whose idea of a cheap tie is $80 at a Barneys New York half-price
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Did Levin blow his big media moment by not wearing one? ``Of
course I would say he did,'' Anderson said. ``Because there was
Case looking like a million bucks. More than that, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Calacanis, the editor and chief executive of The Silicon
Alley Reporter, which covers the new media industry in New York,
put the contrast between the younger Case and the elder Levin more
bluntly: ``Retired people don't need to wear ties.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, slackers shunned ties because they hated the
``Dilbert'' jobs that required them. But now that some of those
slackers have become titans of industry, ties have become what they
always were _ symbols of corporate success. ``The age of showing up
for meetings on Rollerblades is long over,'' Calacanis, 29, said.
``The funkiness was good because it said we're not afraid to do
something different. But dressing up now is also courageous because
it says we're not afraid to make this into a business.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about ``wearing a uniform,'' said Allen Questrom, chairman
of Barneys. Questrom is a staunch tie man and has a running joke
with Patrick McCarthy, the editorial director of W and Women's Wear
Daily, who never wears one. ``Patrick happens to be a very
attractive guy, and I think his appearance would benefit greatly
from putting on a tie,'' said Questrom, who does not believe in
casual Fridays. When his employees go tieless, he said, ``I can
literally see people's attitude toward work change.''
</P>
<P>
   For Calacanis' generation, dressing up rather than down might
have started up again with the whole ``Swingers'' cocktail-culture
movement of the late '90s. You can't wear a sharkskin suit without
a tie.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who dined last summer at Colina, the short-lived
restaurant in ABC Carpet &AMP; Home, could hardly have failed to notice
the sommelier's prominent neckwear. One evening, this hipster wine
guy was asking customers what they thought of his tie. The knot was
the size of a ham hock. It looked like something Ted Baxter would
have worn. Anyway, he was polling diners to settle a bet about
whether a fat tie looked phat or not. Apparently he spent hours
every morning tying the thing. The knot was so precarious that one
clumsy tug would collapse it. But to him, the effect was worth the
extra effort.
</P>
<P>
   DNR, the men's wear trade daily, says skinny ties are next. But
judging from the mostly moderate widths on display in Milan this
week, it may be a while before men feel ready to revive the New
Romantics look and start dangling bacon strips of red leather
around their necks again.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Steve Case starts wearing one.

GET EVERY BENEFIT YOU ARE ENTITLED TO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SHANNON BUGGS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I accepted my first full-time reporting job, I negotiated
my salary, relocation allowance and vacation time. However, I
didn't ask one question about the 401(k) program or the pension
plan included in my benefits package.
</P>
<P>
   I figured I'd be moving on in two years or less and wouldn't get
vested in either plan. It never dawned on me that such job-hopping
meant I had to start planning for retirement as soon as I started
working.
</P>
<P>
   If I didn't, ``retiree'' might never be a word I could use to
describe myself.
</P>
<P>
   Changing jobs just to get a higher salary is a great short-term
strategy that can hurt you in the long run. Job hoppers have to
make sure each jump gets them closer to their retirement goals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Negotiate, negotiate, negotiate. Before accepting a job,
determine the dollar value of every benefit being offered. Each
perk _ or the lack of it _ affects your compensation bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a $20,000 raise might make anyone jump ship.
However, if the new company has a lower 401(k) match, a health
insurance plan that requires more out-of-pocket fees, a lower
mileage reimbursement rate, fewer stock options and no pension
plan, then that raise actually could be a $5,000 reduction in pay.
</P>
<P>
   If the new job doesn't pay you what you're making at your
current position, you've got two options: Turn it down or push for
more.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Schefft, director of corporate financial planning in KPMG's
Houston office, often counsels his executive clients to request
stock options that vest immediately. If that's not possible, he
tells them to ask the new employer for a loan to buy company stock,
with the loan being forgiven over a period of time.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggests they ask for immediate participation in the
health insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Join the 401(k) program. Even if the time you spend in a job
is best measured in weeks, you need to store money in a 401(k) plan
as soon as you're eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, employees must work three to five years before they
vest or can keep the money the company adds to their 401(k)
accounts. So, if you're not going to be around long enough to vest,
you need to make up for that lost company match.
</P>
<P>
   You can do that by contributing the maximum pretax amount
allowed by federal law. This year it's $10,500.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've done that, you also can contribute the maximum
after-tax amount, if your company allows that. This is especially
important for people making more than $85,000 a year, who are
deemed ``highly compensated'' by the IRS and, therefore, may not be
allowed to contribute the maximum pretax.
</P>
<P>
   _ Leave the money where it is. Moving to a new job often means
waiting a year before you can participate in your new company's
401(k). Since rolling your money into your new employer's plan
isn't an immediate option, leave it in your former employer's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way, you don't have to worry about management fees or IRA
set-up fees,'' Schefft says. ``Your old company takes care of all
the management fees for you until you can roll it into your new
401(k) plan and your new company starts taking care of them.''
</P>
<P>
   If the amount you have saved is less than $5,000, your former
employer may insist on cashing you out of its plan.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you are in the most dire circumstances, don't take a lump
sum payment. The tax consequences _ a mandatory 20 percent withheld
for federal taxes and 10 percent excise tax, if you are under age
59 1/2 _ are too severe. It's better to roll it into an Individual
Retirement Account, even if you have to pay management fees.
</P>
<P>
   _ Invest on your own. If fat bonuses are a part of the package
you get whenever you jump to a new job, don't blow them on
Brazilian vacations or down payments on sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   Invest in mutual funds. As you make more money, diversify your
portfolio by buying stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Do the same thing with any raises you receive. Take half of the
raise and invest it and use the other half to reward yourself for a
job well-done.
</P>
<P>
   _ Know before you go. Don't turn in your letter of resignation
until you fully understand your company's vesting policies.
Quitting a week before you're eligible to get 100 percent of the
pension the company has set aside for you is not a smart move. You
could wind up with nothing or much less than you would have
received.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than saying goodbye to my first paper in two years, I
accepted a promotion after 14 months. I wound up working for that
paper five years, two weeks and one day. Just long enough to vest
in the pension plan and get an extra month of health insurance
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   I figured it didn't make sense to leave any money on the table.

DON'T REMOVE OLD OPERATING SYSTEMS WHEN UPGRADING UNLESS PC IS
SLOW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I've got a 233-megahertz Pentium II computer, one of the
first ones, which came with Windows 95. I put Windows 98 on it, and
recently upgraded to Windows 98 SE. A friend said I should format
my hard drive and do a fresh install of Windows 98 SE, and that all
those old versions of the operating system are going to cause me
problems. I hate to go through that, but I want my computer to stay
trouble-free. Is he right?
</P>
<P>
   A: John Dvorak, the bellicose computer columnist who seems to
turn up in every Ziff-Davis publication available, has a theory
that operating systems undergo ``OS decay.'' Over time, they
collect digital detritus that wears down reliability and
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who's had the misfortune of having to reformat a hard
drive, then reinstall the Windows operating system, has found a
silver lining. The fresh installation does feel peppier.
</P>
<P>
   However, I'm not sure the problem is related to upgrades to the
operating system. When you install a new version of Windows, the
setup routine overwrites the old versions of key files with the
latest versions.
</P>
<P>
   (The one exception is the backup that Windows makes of the
previous installation. When you install a new version of the OS, it
rolls everything up into a big, compressed data file of about 100
megabytes. If you choose to uninstall the new version of the
operating system, Windows' setup just unpacks everything and
restores your drive to its previous state.)
</P>
<P>
   However, the installation routine will leave behind files that
may relate to the older version but aren't part of the operating
system itself. For example, those who upgrade from Windows 95 to
Windows 98 often have problems with their modems. That's because
the Windows 95 modem drivers are often quite different from the
Windows 98 versions. Downloading the latest drivers from the modem
manufacturer's Web site is the fix.
</P>
<P>
   You can suffer this sort of OS decay if you install and
uninstall different kinds of software, and if you change hardware
components frequently. For example, when you upgrade to a new video
card, chances are there are still some video drivers left on your
system. There may even be lines in the Windows Registry that try to
load them. My approach to doing a fresh installation is the old
saw, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' If your computer is
running well, leave it alone. If not, start backing things up and
get ready for a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I upgraded to Internet Explorer 5 and Outlook Express 5. Now,
I no longer have a spell checker in Outlook Express 5. Why not?
</P>
<P>
   A: Microsoft got in trouble with the federal government for
tying one product to another when Internet Explorer became
integrated into Windows 98. Seems like the feds may have missed
another one ...
</P>
<P>
   In Outlook Express 5, you must have Microsoft Word 95, 97 or
2000 on your computer with its spell-checking feature installed
before you can check your spelling in the e-mail program. No Word,
no spell-check. This is spelled out in the help file that comes
with Outlook Express 5. Just do a search in the Help function for
``spelling.''

AOL MUST SPURN AD-BLITZ TEMPTATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know the 21st century has arrived when America Online and
Time Warner get together for a megabucks corporate dance, and AOL
takes the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The astonishing thing about the deal is that an Internet company
came out on top. Who would have thought that Time Warner, a merger
of the largest Old Media companies in the world, would be bought by
a relative newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is not just any newcomer, but the one that has
done more to get ordinary people online than any other technology
company. AOL understands better than anyone what it takes to bring
the Internet revolution down to the grass roots.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is not to make it feel like a revolution, which
implies that a lot of hard work must be done. Instead, AOL has
presented the online world like a giant party, and one where
everyone with a computer and a modem is welcome _ if you've got
$21.95 a month to spend, that is.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, this galls a lot of people who seem to think
that easy computing is not real computing. The whole idea that
someone might need some hand-holding and an attractive, simplified
interface to get around online is repugnant to them _ and that's an
elitist, arrogant attitude.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CASE'S VISION LIKE GATES' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's nothing new to AOL, or its chairman and founder, Steve
Case, who's been swimming upstream ever since he started the
company in 1985. But now it has become clear that Case's vision is
as important to the growth of a connected planet as Bill Gates'
original vision for Microsoft, which was a computer on every desk
and in every home.
</P>
<P>
   Case, in fact, understands better than anyone the implications
of Metcalfe's Law. This axiom, coined by Ethernet inventor Robert
Metcalfe, holds that the power of the network increases
exponentially by the number of computers connected to it.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, when more people link up, more information and
services are available, and the network to which they're connected
becomes more useful.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is the grand example of this. It is a far more
useful network than it was in its earliest days because there are
more people and businesses using it. But you don't need the vast
expanse of the Internet to see what Steve Case sees. You can ``get
it'' on a much more personal level.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the first person in your family to get connected to the
Internet? He or she likely told other members of your family and
friends how cool it was. That inspired others to get on. And once
your personal circle hit critical mass, the Net suddenly became an
important way for you to stay in touch with the ones you love. Your
personal network became more important as more people you knew
hopped on.
</P>
<P>
   Case understood from the beginning that computers are just too
hard for most people to use, but too important for them not to.
AOL's mantra has been to make its software easy to use, even if
that means leaving out features that some users would like to have.
The company has mastered the art of keeping it simple, stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream home computer users don't care about the geek-level
details about PCs beloved by many of AOL's critics. Spend some time
browsing the member profiles in AOL and you'll notice that, under
the category ``Computer,'' many AOL subscribers type something
like, ``Who cares?!?!?'' For them, a PC is a tool, a means to an
end, and not the end itself.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
AOL ARROGANCE SURFACING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is not to say that AOL is perfect. The company
has stumbled more than once, and is beginning to show the signs of
arrogance endemic to a bloated organization. For example, its
recent insistence on forcing people to once again set their
marketing preferences to avoid pop-up ads and internal spam was
reprehensible. You should only have to say no to that kind of junk
once.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, AOL sometimes comes dangerously close to allowing its
marketing to overwhelm the vision of a simple, pleasant online
experience. With its pop-up ads and windows increasingly cluttered
with advertising, it's getting harder to tell the real information
from the come-ons. This blurring of the line between marketing and
useful information has always been a hazard online, but AOL has
made an irritating art of it.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies a danger inherent in AOL's acquisition of Time
Warner. If the marketing of this behemoth becomes more important
than the product itself, then the combined entity of AOL Time
Warner runs a serious risk of alienating its customers. Just
because the masses want an online experience that's simple and easy
to use, doesn't mean they want to face a constant barrage of
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   If AOL becomes little more than a vehicle for pushing Time
Warner's brands and products, then Case &AMP; Co. will have killed the
goose that laid this golden, $162 billion egg.
</P>

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Very cold air will cover much of Canada as unseasonably mild air
prevails in most of the Southwest and southern Plains. The large
temperature difference will provide energy for a fast west-to-east
jet stream that will direct moisture-starved disturbances across
the northern United States and southern Canada. Meanwhile, a plume
of Pacific moisture will bring damp weather from central California
to coastal Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning will dawn with an arctic chill in the
Northeast, but temperatures will gradually moderate, especially
west of the Appalachians. Sunshine will mix with some high clouds
near the coast, while mostly cloudy skies develop near the Great
Lakes as milder air is forced to rise over the cold air that is in
place over the region. Intermittent snow will develop near the
eastern shores of the Great Lakes where winds from the southwest
gather moisture over the water.
</P>
<P>
   A broken band of light snow will fall to the north of the track
of a low as it moves from the northern Plains to the northern Great
Lakes. South of the low, mild breezes will prevail from the Plains
to the southern Great Lakes. Afternoon temperatures will be 20 to
30 degrees above seasonal values in most of the central and
southern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Rain will become heavier later on Saturday from southern Oregon
to central California. More than a foot of snow will accumulate by
early Sunday at elevations above 6,500 feet, although snow levels
will rise overnight. Lighter valley showers and mountain snow will
spread toward the central Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Arctic Sea Smoke
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the ocean east of New England looked like a giant cup
of hot tea as wisps of steam danced near the surface of the water.
The phenomenon, known as arctic sea smoke, forms when water vapor
is added to air that is much colder than the vapor's source. Vapor,
which is water in its gaseous form, is invisible. The vapor rising
above the mild waters mixed with air with temperatures in the
teens. The cold air quickly became saturated producing the visible
sea smoke. About 30 feet higher, the fog particles evaporated
creating the appearance of a steaming hot beverage.

<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ When Giorgio Armani took a bow on Wednesday, at
the end of a show concluding the Milan men's-wear collections for
fall, he did it with a glimmering bracelet on his wrist and a star
in hand. The show opened with the theme from ``Shaft,'' and wrapped
up in a joint appearance with Samuel L. Jackson, who is starring in
the remake of the 1971 movie. The designer is doing the costumes.
</P>
<P>
   This was a message delivered with considerably more oomph than
whatever it was that Armani was saying with the clothes he sent
down the runway. The show amounted to a hodgepodge of references _
to utility fashion, Las Vegas in the 1970s, hip-hop and old Armani
_ and an overall vision of not much at all.
</P>
<P>
   Preceded by a ``Shaft'' party on Tuesday night that Armani gave
with Vibe magazine, the whole show felt as though it were taking
place to promote a movie and to advance the idea that Armani really
does have something to say to the kids.
</P>
<P>
   A few nights earlier, Armani had run into the traditionalist
Nino Cerruti, a former boss of his, for the first time in 28 years.
Cerruti, who presented his collection last Sunday, happens to be
doing the clothes for the coming movie ``American Psycho,'' based
on the infamous novel about a status-crazed serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   Young fashion editors whine that Cerruti's clothes are boring
and irrelevant, but at least when his show ended, he didn't trot
out with the novel's author, Bret Easton Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   The point of a men's show is tricky to begin with. It's supposed
to be attention-getting, fantastical even; as with women's
collections, most of the clothes retailers buy are never paraded on
the runway in the first place. But the range of outlandish things
one can do with pants, a jacket and a shirt is pretty narrow, so
most of what's on view seems even more contrived than what appears
on the women's runways.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is worsened when designers try to justify the affair
with pronouncements about what men want, generally as well grounded
in reality as an episode of ``Gilligan's Island.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall it seems that what men want, according to those who
make clothes for them, is evening wear. The look was played up in
the clothes of Jean Paul Gaultier and the label Richard Edwards.
Stefano Gabbana, who with Domenico Dolce turned out a surprisingly
salable collection within the context of their outrageousness,
explained that just as women want to change out of work wear to go
out, a man wants a different outfit for going to dinner and ``to
the discotheque'' than for the office.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise at Costume National Homme, Ennio Capasa, who turned out
velvet and shiny silk and things most men who aren't Pet Shop Boys
would never approach, declared knowledgeably that men want
something special to go out in.
</P>
<P>
   John Bartlett, who held his show in Florence, said his
collection was based on the idea of the night. Certainly the sheer
silk-pleated shirt that was part of an Imperialist Russia theme in
his collection was nothing to go trading commodities in.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, to his credit, didn't just throw glitter on pants and
call it design. He created a full-length military coat, jodhpurs
and other pieces beautiful to look at, if useless outside an ``Anna
Karenina'' production.
</P>
<P>
   To return to common sense, as usual, one sought refuge in Calvin
Klein and Jil Sander. Klein worked almost entirely in black, and
his short-cropped suits and pants were youthful and practical
without seeming gimmicky. When Ms. Sander was asked whether she
thought men wanted to go home after a grueling day and put on
something sexy, she said simply, ``No, I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   She turned out lots of light gray flannel and perfect-looking
neat suits and sweaters. Ms. Sander is a skilled reader of modern
living.
</P>
<P>
   She is apparently a good teacher, too. Roberto Menichetti, who
used to work for Ms. Sander and is now designing at Burberry, drew
raves from the mostly male fashion editors who attended his show.
And from the women, too.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes were well made and colorful without seeming
clownlike. Best of all, they came without pretensions of being
anything other than sporty.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the Gucci show a couple of days later, one female editor
said of what she'd just seen: ``I loved it as fantasy. If a guy
turned up in my door in any of it, I'd shoot him.''
</P>
<P>
   If a guy turned up in Burberry, he'd probably get a second
date. &QL;

INTERFAITH RETREAT FORGES FRIENDSHIPS, RESPECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes it amazes me how vastly different religions and
denominations can peacefully exist side-by-side in our nation. But
it happens.
</P>
<P>
   A good example of that came last week in the Texas Hill Country,
when 50 students from Jewish, Baptist, Catholic, Episcopal,
Presbyterian, Quaker and Methodist graduate theology schools came
together for a three-day retreat.
</P>
<P>
   They clashed at times, debated about sin and suffering, but came
away as friends.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are David Cantor, who is studying to be a rabbi at
the University of Judaism in Bellaire, Calif., and Greg Tomlin, a
doctoral student at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Cantor, 28, and Tomlin, 29, became stellar friends during the
retreat, which has been sponsored for 11 years by the Fort Worth
chapter of the National Conference for Community and Justice,
formerly the National Conference of Christians and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hot topics that came up in small groups was the
insistence by evangelical Christians that Jesus is the only way to
salvation, said Tomlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Jewish seminarian thought I was saying Judaism was
useless, but I certainly wasn't saying that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was not a topic at the retreat, Cantor and Tomlin,
who roomed together, had several late-night discussions about a
Baptist effort to evangelize Jews, Muslims, Hindus and others,
including sending out prayer guides on the holy days of those
faiths.
</P>
<P>
   They also talked about tensions over a Baptist evangelism blitz
planned this summer in Chicago. Several religious leaders urged
Baptists to cancel, but they refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everyone was like my friend David Cantor, we would not have
any problems,'' said Tomlin. ``He understands we are witnessing to
people out of our love for them. We became friends. And it's a
friendship I want to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Cantor said he realizes that Baptists and many other Christians
believe they are commanded by God to share their faith, although he
disagreed with some of the Baptists' methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Jews are governed by God's Commandments, too. So I
understand and respect that,'' said Cantor. ``They can witness to
me, but I'll just say, `Thank you very much,' and go on my way.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``To me, it's like walking on a mountain path. If
a person believed there was a blind drop-off up ahead, they would
be morally obligated to tell me about it. But since I don't believe
there is this blind drop-off, I just keep walking.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Ralph Mecklenburger, one of the faculty members, said the
retreat was a excellent chance for seminarians to learn about other
faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody would deny that we have differences,'' he said. ``But
it is good to find that we have a great deal in common, too. In an
overwhelmingly secular society, people of faith are natural allies,
not opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   Having interfaith retreats is even more important in a day when
tensions arise among faiths, said Mecklenburger, rabbi of
Congregation Beth-El in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if those national Jewish leaders and Southern Baptists
would sit down face-to-face with one another and discuss their
problems, rather than trading press releases, they would do a lot
better,'' Mecklenburger said.
</P>
<P>
   Seminarians attended Jewish and Christian worship services and
held discussions on how different faiths view suffering. The event
was held in the tranquil setting of Laity Lodge in Leakey, and had
Jewish and Christian faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Students also came from Assumption (Catholic) Seminary in San
Antonio, Texas Christian University's Brite Divinity School in Fort
Worth, Episcopal Seminary of the Southwest in Austin, Baylor
University's Truett Theological Seminary, Austin Presbyterian
Theological Seminary, Houston Graduate School of Theology and
Southern Methodist University's Perkins School of Theology in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Stan Hagadone, director of admissions at Brite Divinity
School, said those in the many Christian traditions also found
themselves in disagreement during the seminar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like Christians on one side and Jews on the other,''
he said. ``We all learned more about each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi B. Allison Bergman, assistant rabbi of Temple Beth-El in
San Antonio, said the retreat broke down stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have meals together and take strolls together in
absolutely fabulous country, you begin to put a face on the people
of different religions and different cultures,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Trantham, retreat coordinator and executive director of
the Fort Worth branch of the National Conference for Community and
Justice, said she watched the seminary students change day-by-day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what so fascinating about this,'' Trantham said. ``At
first they don't realize other people feel as strongly about their
faiths as they do about theirs. When they see that, respect
develops. When you have respect, it goes far beyond mere tolerance.
And it doesn't go away.''

 &HT;    Musician donates $37,000 to N.C. town because of `Prince' in
name
 &HT;    By Viola Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCEVILLE, N.C. _ The musical artist formerly known as Prince
recently contributed $37,000 to the town of Princeville, just
because of the ``Prince'' association in his own name.
</P>
<P>
   The pop-rock music celebrity responded after reading articles
about the devastation in this flood-ravaged town of 2,100
residents. The floodwaters had swept through in September, after
Hurricane Floyd, and submerged Princeville, the first town in the
nation incorporated by blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Knight, Princeville zoning officer, said the money was
earmarked to purchase building materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although $37,000 will not go very far when you talk about
building supplies, we're very grateful to him for thinking about
us,'' Knight said. ``Even though you can't tell it from his music,
he's a very religious man who wanted no publicity about his gift to
the town.''
</P>
<P>
   Princeville public relations coordinator Kim Burwell said the
musician sent a representative to the town to assess its needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sent a representative from his charitable organization in
Ohio,'' Burwell said. ``We took her over to the distribution center
and gave an overview of some of the town's immediate needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Adams, the musician's representative, spent three days at
the center, talking to workers and residents who came for supplies.
When she returned to Ohio, the artist formerly known as Prince
signed off on the list.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing about the superstar's generosity, Some Princeville
residents said they wish he would come to town and perform a
concert. Knight said other obligations, such as a tour to Europe,
prevented him from doing the concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been cool if he had come to Princeville,''
27-year old Bertha Ransome said. ``I've loved his music for a long
time. He could have raised a lot of money for the town.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rave,'' the latest CD by the artist formerly known as Prince,
is rising steadily on the music charts.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 100 residents have returned to the town since water and
sewer became available. This is far from the 2,100 residents
estimated to have lived in Princeville, incorporated by blacks in
1885 on what's known as Freedom Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Knight said his office would be taking applications from
residents interested in getting some of the money donated by the
musician.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to set some kind of criteria first,'' Knight said.
``As I said, it won't go a long way, so we will definitely have to
take applications. Sheet Rock and other items are costly.''

tent flap, illuminating who we are, how we think why we do what we
do.
</P>
<P>
   If I provoke comments or questions from you, I invite responses.
My e-mail address is at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   I hope wire editors will pass this along to managing editors,
executive editors, department heads _ anybody who might be
interested.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ON THE WIRE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A new column by  &UR; Paul Krugman &LR;  is now appearing twice a week on
The Times' Op-Ed page. Krugman is the widely known MIT economics
professor known for his theories on international trade and
economics _ and, with his lively writing, known for his ability to
make the dismal science not so. The new column ``Reckonings,'' is
The Times' first regular Op-Ed column devoted to economics,
business and finance. Editorial and op-ed editors will find it on
the wire on Saturdays and Tuesdays slugged BC-KRUGMAN-COLUMN.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN THE FIELD  &LR;  As you may have noticed the past couple of days,
 &UR; Nicholas D. Kristoff &LR;  has left the foreign reporting staff and
joined the national staff, covering the presidential campaign. His
dateline yesterday _ Sloan, Iowa _ is a long way from his last
assignment, Tokyo, where he was bureau chief, or from Beijing,
where he won a Pulitzer Prize in 1990 for coverage of the Tiananmen
Square uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Nick shared that prize, with  &UR; Sheryl WuDunn &LR; , his wife, who is
also undertaking a new job far removed from her former journalistic
posts in Asia. She is going to head a new marketing initiative in
The Times' circulation department aimed at attracting the next
generation of readers. (In addition to her many other credentials,
Sheryl has an MBA from Harvard.)
</P>
<P>
   The new bureau chief in Tokyo is a byline well known to foreign
editors,  &UR; Howard W. French &LR; . In Tokyo with him are  &UR; Calvin Sims &LR; 
and  &UR; Stephanie Strom &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN THE HOUSE  &LR;  Another familiar byline won't be in the news
columns anymore, although the name will be on the masthead.  &UR; Craig
R. Whitney &LR;  has returned to New York to become an assistant
managing editor in overall charge of the night news operation.
Craig has been played leading roles at The Times for many years. In
his 20s he was the Saigon bureau chief. He has also been bureau
chief in Moscow, Bonn, Washington, London and, most recently,
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Also assuming a new title as of the first of the year is
 &UR; Stephen Engelberg &LR; , who becomes senior editor for investigations.
Steve, who guided Pulitzer Prize-winning projects the last two
years, will head a small swat team of reporters, editors and
database experts. They will function not as an elite investigative
fiefdom that competes with beat reporters, but rather will be
available to parachute in on investigations and act as a ``force
multiplier'' for the departments that are conducting the projects.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month (the week of the 17th, to be exact),  &UR; Elvis
Mitchell &LR;  will join The Times' culture staff as a film critic.
Elvis is coming from The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, one of our
partner papers, so his reviews have been available to NYT News
Service clients on this wire. But he is perhaps best known
nationally as the entertainment critic on NPR's ``Weekend
Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   Another new film critic already writing for The Times is  &UR; A.O.
Scott &LR; , formerly the Sunday book critic at Newsday. Tony wrote a
piece a while back on Martin Scorsese for the Web magazine Slate
and it caught the eye of Joe Lelyveld, The Times' executive editor.
Joe began wondering if Tony could transfer his literary expertise
over to films. Early indications seem a resounding yes.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis and Tony will join the veteran  &UR; Stephen Holden &LR;  as The
Times' film criticism team. As you perhaps know,  &UR; Janet Maslin &LR;  has
stepped down from the job of senior film critic. After the
extraordinary run of 22 years of film criticism, with the volume of
movies increasing every year, she decided last fall that it was
time to rest.
</P>
<P>
   For me, and I suspect for you, it is now time to get back to
work.

 &HT;    TEXAS MEAT PLANT REMAINS OPEN DESPITE FAILING FOOD SAFETY TESTS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) national categories

<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The federal government's embattled food inspection
program may face a new challenge from a small Texas meat packing
company that continues to sell beef to the public despite failing a
yearlong series of safety tests.
</P>
<P>
   The government could try to close H&AMP; B Packing Co. here, but it
has not.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture says the
agency is not afraid to act, but is likely to allow H&AMP;B to remain
open as it tries to improve.
</P>
<P>
   The H&AMP;B case comes at a critical time for the government.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Supreme Beef Processors Inc. in Dallas failed the
same kind of tests but a federal district court judge there
prevented the Agriculture Department from closing that facility.
Judge A. Joe Fish ruled that the plant can continue to sell its
meat while he decides if the government has the authority to close
the Supreme Beef facility.
</P>
<P>
   Although Supreme Beef and H&AMP;B are both operating under the
government's new science-based inspection program, which is
supposed to make inspections more objective than the old
poke-and-sniff method, the judge's ruling raises questions about
whether federal officials can enforce their new food safety
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that USDA would be embarrassed to be faced with
another Supreme Beef situation and thus I think they are going to
work extra hard to keep that from happening,'' said Rosemary
Mucklow, executive director of the National Meat Association, which
represents meat packers.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Blake, a spokesperson for the Agriculture Department, said
that while her agency is still mulling its next step, it is likely
the government will allow the plant to remain open while the
company tries to improve sanitation. But she said the Agriculture
Department is not being more lenient with H&AMP;B Packing because the
agency wants to avoid another test of wills with the meat industry.
</P>
<P>
   Blake said that H&AMP;B packing has been very cooperative and has
submitted a formal corrective plan that the government is
reviewing. She said this was in contrast to Supreme, which never
submitted a formal plan.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dennis Johnson, an attorney in Washington who
represents H&AMP;B Packing, said he will go to court ``in a heartbeat''
if the government tries to shut down the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Blake said the government began testing in November 1998 for the
bacteria Salmonella in meat produced by the plant. While federal
rules require that a company can have no more that 7.5 percent of
its samples test positive, Salmonella was found in 22.6 percent of
the H&AMP;B tests done over a four-month period. Thirteen percent of
the samples were positive during the second round of tests that
started in April 1999 and another 12 percent failed during the
third round. The plant was notified on Dec. 15 that it had failed
the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Blake said the public can take comfort from the fact that the
plant's record has improved after each round of tests. Both the
government and the meat industry also advise consumers to
thoroughly cook meat to kill any bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Supreme Beef, the H&AMP;B plant is a small family-owned
business with approximately 80 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're shocked we didn't pass last time,'' Said Benjy Bauer,
the plant manager. ``We want to work within the system and make
things better. We do feel all of our products are safe to eat. We
stand by them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said improvements have cost ``a pretty good amount of
money,'' but he declined to give a figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truthfully, we don't sell that much hamburger. Let me
emphasize, that was the only item we had a problem with. We're
working together with the USDA on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said that it sells its product locally and to brokers who
distribute it nationwide. There have been no reported illnesses
from meat coming from the H&AMP;B plant during the testing period.
</P>

 &HT;    `Green Mile' serves up modern gospel
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Every Christian teen-ager in the country
should go to this movie.
</P>
<P>
   Send them to ``The Green Mile,'' a profound 20th-century
allegory of the life of Christ _ and superb entertainment to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood may be a moral wasteland, but, occasionally, Tinsel
Town can do what most churches seldom seem to manage _ proclaim the
gospel in a fresh, compelling way.
</P>
<P>
   Unless churches can find new forms to tell old stories and a new
idiom to weave ancient truth, the third millennium may see
Christianity slip into irreversible decline.
</P>
<P>
   This film does some of their work for them. As a potential Oscar
winner, it should be in movie houses a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The story is about convicts and guards on Death Row in a
Louisiana prison. The floor of the proverbial last mile is a green
linoleum, explaining the film's title.
</P>
<P>
   The mile is a metaphor for life, one filled with warmth and
anger, petulance, pettiness, humor and grace. The movie has an R
rating for an ugly scene in the electric chair and some foul
language, but the story is about good news.
</P>
<P>
   Four guards _ or guardian angels _ ind this particular mile,
care for prisoners awaiting the electric chair and try to keep a
calm atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   A convicted black man, huge beyond imagination, illiterate,
unattractive, and all too human is brought into a cell.
</P>
<P>
   John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, is as authentic a
Christ figure as Hollywood has ever produced, and the industry did
a pretty good job with the television version of ``The Fugitive.''
Every episode of that series involved a convicted hero changing
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Coffey is light and life itself, a miracle of a man, afraid of
the dark, but, as in the Gospel of John, the darkness cannot
overcome him. Everyone he meets is changed.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted of the rape and murder of two little girls, he was
arrested embracing their corpses crying into the wilderness that he
had not been able to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase meant restore them to life, but that is not clear
until the story unfolds. On the mile, he heals a nasty urinary
infection in a guard, played by Tom Hanks, and brings a dead mouse,
a jailhouse pet, back to life as Jesus did Lazarus.
</P>
<P>
   The miracles take place among convicts, foul language and
hideous images of human injustice, the arena in which Jesus served.
This is not an insipid Sunday School film but a profoundly
Christian drama.
</P>
<P>
   Coffey heals the wife of a prison employee from a cancerous
brain tumor by literally inhaling the illness into himself.
</P>
<P>
   He transfers a bit of his life-giving spirit to Hanks, who can
then ``see'' that he is innocent. Still, nothing can be done to
save him. Coffey goes innocently and willingly to his death.
</P>
<P>
   No analogy is perfect. Skeptics will find flaws in Coffey as a
Christ figure, but he and his work vividly recall Isaiah's
suffering servant, who has long been considered an example of the
life of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was despised and rejected by others, a man of suffering.
... Surely he has borne our infirmities and carried our diseases.
... He was wounded for our transgressions and crushed for our
iniquities. ... `` (Isa. 53)
</P>
<P>
   That is a portrait of Christ _ and Coffey.
</P>
<P>
   Youth groups would do well to skip Sunday School to see the
Gospel honestly presented in this modern guise.

It is unclear whether the USDA can enforce its new food-safety

separated from her children when a rickety boat carrying 400
Haitians was stopped off the Florida coast on New Year's Day.
Haitians were happy Thursday when immigration officials said they

COLOR US SKEPTICAL: NETWORKS HAVE MADE EMPTY PROMISES ABOUT
DIVERSITY BEFORE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ah, yes, deal-making in fantasyland.
</P>
<P>
   What a concept.
</P>
<P>
   What a way for TV networks to create some wiggle room and avoid
this chronic nuisance they have either no clue about, or no
inclination to solve.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement announced this week between the NAACP and two of
the four major networks is, sad to say, another example of the
networks extending one hand in a solidarity handshake while using
the other to cover their mouths and mute the laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Go right ahead and believe that ABC and NBC will beef up their
ranks of minority writers, producers, directors and executives via
``training programs'' and other initiatives, and that CBS and Fox
will soon follow in their footsteps. Have faith that the presence
of African-American, Hispanic and Asian characters in sitcoms,
dramas and news programs will last beyond this initial period of
forced enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what it is, isn't it? Nothing like a threatened
protest and a wave of negative publicity to bring out the
compassion in network executives who, if track records speak for
future endeavors, are awfully good illusionists when it comes to
doing what's fair and just.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, network heads have met with NAACP President Kweisi
Mfume to cop a plea and save their hides. They've gleefully
announced ``bold, new'' initiatives establishing goals and
timetables to increase opportunities for people of color at the
network level.
</P>
<P>
   But is the joke on us?
</P>
<P>
   The agreement at NBC, for instance, calls for more deals with
minority-owned production companies, going so far as to pay for a
writer on the staff of every second-year show. (To help develop a
pipeline of talent, they say.)
</P>
<P>
   ABC's diversity plea bargain does not include funding for
additional series writing staff positions. But it does outline a
number of new and ongoing executive-outreach, production,
programming and advertising initiatives, like setting a goal of
buying some $10 million of products and/or services from
minority-owned businesses over the next 18 months. Hold your breath
on that one.
</P>
<P>
   If you think these initiatives are examples of TV bending over
backward to appease whiny, greedy racial groups, consider that 55
of the fall season's 839 writers are African-American; 11 are
Latino, three are Asian-American, and none is American Indian. No
people of color are heads of TV studios. Few are in programming,
period.
</P>
<P>
   Most influential series _ the ``ERs,'' the ``Practices,'' the
``Law &AMP; Orders,'' the ``NYPD Blues,'' not only come from white
Americans but white men. No minority producer can greenlight a
project, not even three-time Emmy winner Paris Barclay, who had to
partner with Steven Bochco to get ``City of Angels'' on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   This is vital because it's widely believed that the more
diversity there is among show creators and programming executives,
the more diverse programs will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that you can have as many minorities as actors but you
have to have the words on the page to make it work,'' said Scott
Sassa, president of NBC West Coast. ``Television is a writer's
medium. And we thought the writing numbers were really the issue.
So we felt that attacking it at the writer level was the most
important way to make a real change over time rather than just a
cosmetic change.''
</P>
<P>
   Sassa's right, which makes it even more appalling that the
networks hadn't thought of this before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks won't do anything unless their arms are twisted,
and to them, addressing the nuts and bolts of diversity is nothing
more than saying they'll address it,'' said writer/producer Robert
Townsend, whose family series ``Parent'Hood'' was axed by The WB to
make way for dramas featuring mostly white characters.
</P>
<P>
   To veteran observers of the network song-and-dance, like
Townsend, these initiatives are not above suspicion. There's a
pattern to this: First there's acknowledgment, followed by public
acceptance of blame, followed by a brief deflection of the issues,
followed by the promise of changes that never come. Which is where
we are now.
</P>
<P>
   ``People move on to something else, people forget, pressure
subsides,'' Townsend says. ``And they're off the hook until next
time, because the black people and the Hispanic people they deal
with every day feel the inequity but don't say it because rent is
due.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, deal-making in fantasyland.
</P>
<P>
   What a concept.

   UNDATED _ This is one of my favorites, no question. It's the
all-new Audi S4 Quattro, a high-performance version of Audi's
entry-level A4 compact sedan. The S4 isn't for everyone; it's a bit
pricey at $37,900 (plus transportation and options), quite a bit
higher than the price of the base A4 1.8T, which lists for just
$23,990. So what makes the S4 worth $14,000 more? After all, you
could buy the A4 1.8T and add a nice Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla
for the extra 14 grand, and have two cars instead of one. By G.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (For release: Jan. 16 or thereafter)  
 &HT;    Like so many Americans, I first met Martin Luther King Jr. on
television. I was 9. He was dead.
 &HT;    ``Martin Luther King Jr. has just been shot in Memphis, Tenn.,''
the news bulletin announced.
 &HT;    I was sitting on the living-room floor watching a Western with
my father. As my mother joined us, the camera switched to King's
last speech.
 &HT;    ``We've got some difficult days ahead,'' King said as he peered
intensely at his throng of followers.
 &HT;    ``But it really doesn't matter with me now, because I've been to
the mountaintop.'' The audience erupted in cheers and with shouts
of ``Oh, yes!'' ``Go 'head!'' and ``Yes, sir!''
 &HT;    Before the applause subsided, he continued: ``Like anybody, I'd
like to live a long life. But lon-ge-vi-ty has its place.'' He
paused, deliberately letting the audience's cries ratchet up the
emotional pitch of his rhetoric. By now, I had goose bumps all over
my body.
 &HT;    ``I may not get there with you,'' he said, reaching his
thrilling climax. ``But I want you to know tonight that we as a
people will get to the promised land.''
 &HT;    That was the image of King that was scorched into my brain: a
Christlike leader who prophesied his people's redemption and his
own imminent martyrdom in the same breath. Countless books and
articles portrayed him as the Prince of Peace, an American Gandhi,
a latter-day Jefferson or Lincoln.
 &HT;    Schoolteachers extolled him as the superhuman ideal of eloquence
and restraint toward which all black people should strive. As his
talents were celebrated again and again, an official story began to
fall into place: King had been a humble minister who pricked
America's conscience, and America had responded by eagerly righting
all its historical wrongs.
 &HT;    It was a compelling story, but more than that, it was a useful
story. For millions of blacks, his saintly stature enhanced their
collective moral standing. For many whites, his public canonization
relieved their otherwise troubled racial conscience.
 &HT;    And for a fragmented nation still reeling from the social
upheavals of the 1960s, his public acclaim afforded a rare moment
of healing consensus.
 &HT;    But the hagiography of King harbored a distinct political
morality. In the name of unity, the official story silenced the
more radical aspects of King's challenge _ his advocacy of racial
compensation, his attempt to destroy poverty, his democratic
socialist beliefs, his opposition to the Vietnam War. And it
whitewashed the painful truth that America had harshly resisted his
call to do the right thing.
 &HT;    Most of all, it placed him far beyond the reach of mere mortals.
His flesh-and-blood struggles _ and failures _ became easily
dismissed as mere preamble to his inevitable ascension. And the
courageous role played by ordinary black folks and their supporters
was forgotten altogether.
 &HT;    I first started to question the official representation when, as
a 19-year-old minister in training, I heard whispers about King's
rampant womanizing.
 &HT;    Then in the late '80s, I discovered that one of King's sermons,
``Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution,'' strongly resembled
the sermon of a white minister, Halford Luccock, that had been
published many years earlier.
 &HT;    King's adulterous liaisons eventually came into fuller view with
the publication of ``Bearing the Cross,'' by David Garrow, and
``Parting the Waters,'' by Taylor Branch; Keith Miller later
explored King's plagiarism at great length in his well-publicized
book, ``Voice of Deliverance.''
 &HT;    The awestruck 9-year-old I once was would have been horrified by
these facts, but as I became more conscious of my own moral lapses
and hypocrisies, I found them deeply moving. I felt that for the
first time I was able to grasp what King accomplished in its true
proportions.
 &HT;    When I shared these revelations with others, however _ in
publications and speeches in observance of his holiday _ I
encountered tremendous resistance.
 &HT;    Of course, it's easy to understand why black people are
suspicious of anyone who claims the need to scrutinize King: He was
torn apart in life, so shouldn't he be protected in death? But
protecting him from critical inquiry preserves his image at the
expense of his message.
 &HT;    Consider his current political fortunes. Since his elevation to
the position of national saint, his bowdlerized legacy has been up
for grabs by any and all. On the 1997 anniversary of King's birth,
Ward Connerly, the black conservative, opened his national campaign
against affirmative action by invoking (out of context) King's wish
for his children not to be judged by the ``color of their skin but
by the content of their character.''
 &HT;    This despite the fact that King advocated ``special,
compensatory measures which could be regarded as a settlement'' for
the ``exploitation and humiliation of the Negro in America down
through the centuries.''
 &HT;    Indeed, his image has been appropriated in electoral bids,
hip-hop songs, church sermons and fast-food ads _ of such diverse
and contradictory meanings that he couldn't possibly have approved
of all of them.
 &HT;    Worse yet, investing in King's perfection allows us to dismiss
the humanity of the underregarded, like many beleaguered black
youth, whose violence-drenched culture is said to prove their
distance from King's stature and dream.
 &HT;    King's real danger to American society is buried in all these
romantic portrayals; after all, he wasn't killed for preaching
nonviolence. With a more nuanced view of King in play, we should be
inspired to create social change in our own communities, armed with
the belief that good things can be done by imperfect people. It is
to our national advantage to recuperate the King who tested
America's mettle by challenging us to live right.
 &HT;    And it would benefit us personally to grasp hold of a King whose
blotches and brilliance live on the same block, if for no other
reason than to destroy the self-righteousness that King so rightly
deplored.

the ``exploitation and humiliation of the Negro in America down
through the centuries.''
 &HT;    Indeed, his image has been appropriated in electoral bids,
hip-hop songs, church sermons and fast-food ads _ of such diverse
and contradictory meanings that he couldn't possibly have approved
of all of them.
 &HT;    Worse yet, investing in King's perfection allows us to dismiss
the humanity of the underregarded, like many beleaguered black
youth, whose violence-drenched culture is said to prove their
distance from King's stature and dream.
 &HT;    King's real danger to American society is buried in all these
romantic portrayals; after all, he wasn't killed for preaching
nonviolence. With a more nuanced view of King in play, we should be
inspired to create social change in our own communities, armed with
the belief that good things can be done by imperfect people. It is
to our national advantage to recuperate the King who tested
America's mettle by challenging us to live right.
 &HT;    And it would benefit us personally to grasp hold of a King whose
blotches and brilliance live on the same block, if for no other
reason than to destroy the self-righteousness that King so rightly
deplored.

MINIMUM-AGE DEBATE ON MILITARY SERVICE FINDS U.S. WITH FEW ALLIES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The United States, which wants to keep the option of
sending soldiers into combat at 17, found itself with few allies in
negotiations this week on an international agreement to set a new
minimum age for recruitment and active military service.
</P>
<P>
   American officials insisted that any global pact allow
volunteers younger than 18 to fight for their country. Currently,
17-year-olds can volunteer, with parental consent, for active
service in the United States. Britain recruits volunteers at 16 and
sends them into active duty.
</P>
<P>
   This practice has been denounced by human rights campaigners who
are seeking to raise the current minimum, from 15, as spelled out
in the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, to 18, as the
surest way to reduce the number of child soldiers in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that 300,000 child combatants are involved in
30 conflicts, including fighting in Mexico, elsewhere in Latin
America, Africa and Chechnya. Human rights groups say most are
recruited or pressed into hostilities by, or on behalf of,
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Some 35 countries spoke out in support of a ban on soldiers
under 18. The U.S. position was backed by Britain, Egypt, Kuwait
and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of countries recruit people younger than 18, although
many do not send soldiers into combat until they reach 18.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time recently that the American position on
youths under 18 has encountered international opposition. At
American insistence, the text of an International Labor
Organization treaty negotiated last year that is intended to end
exploiting children does not prohibit those under 18 from
voluntarily enlisting in the military. A number of other countries,
along with unions, supported a minimum of 18.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials, in a suggested compromise on the
rights-of-the-child treaty, proposed a flat ban on soldiers younger
than 18 for rebel armies. That would allow governments to continue
to recruit and deploy minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of whether the age is 15 or 18,'' Michael
Southwick, the State Department official who led the U.S.
delegation here, said in an interview. ``The real problem is the 9-
and 10-year-olds in places like Northern Uganda,'' where a rebel
movement is fighting the government. ``There should be no forced
recruitment under age 18. The problem here is that there are
differences between the ages for recruitment and deployment. We
believe there is nothing wrong with volunteering at age 17, and
deployment is part of that volunteering.''
</P>
<P>
   Jo Becker, of the Human Rights Watch and head of the Coalition
to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, opposes allowing any exceptions
to a blanket ban on child soldiers. ``What possible justification
can there be to make an exception for sending children into
combat?'' Ms. Becker asked.
</P>
<P>
   Southwick said that 40,000 of the 200,000 American soldiers
recruited annually were 17-year-olds. In six months of training,
many turn 18, leaving 2,000 such soldiers on active duty, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that the tradition of 17-year-old volunteers ``was
preferable to forced recruitment at 18.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We reject the assertion that support for 18 should be a litmus
test for whether a country cares about the fate of its children,''
Southwick told delegates from some 50 countries assembled for the
negotiations, which have been proceeding for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates of the higher age limit hope to finalize the
accord next week.

 &HT;    A collection of works by African-Americans looms so large in the
lives of one atlanta couple that they built their house around it
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoe for Sunday, Jan. 16.
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the decade since Danny Boston and his wife,
Catherine Ross, began collecting art, they have discovered, as have
many before them, that the art they acquire ends up owning them.
</P>
<P>
   Their 3-year-old brick and limestone house in Atlanta tells the
story. They had planned originally to designate one room to
showcase their 80-piece collection of African-American art.
Instead, the Bostons, who met in the registration line the first
semester of graduate school at Cornell University, ended up turning
the whole place into a gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a daily relationship with the art,'' says Ross, a
former professor of planning at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, who is
executive director of the Georgia Regional Transportation
Authority, Gov. Roy Barnes' new transportation superagency.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the house is an intersecting pair of gracious halls
with crisp white walls and shiny marble floors. The halls provide
an intimate yet uncrowded space for displaying art. Architect
Michael Glass, who conceived the central space, also made sure that
the adjoining rooms offer ample wall space for more. The upstairs
landing serves that purpose as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a wonderful thing to do _ to build a house to prepare for
building a collection,'' says Atlanta art appraiser Ben Apfelbaum.
``The halls are deep, so that you can stand back and look at the
art.''
</P>
<P>
   The paintings and prints reveal an eclectic eye. An abstraction
by Atlanta artist Freddie Styles is around the corner from a
lithograph from Jacob Lawrence's John Brown series. Atlanta
sculptor Curtis Patterson's first lithographs hang in the yellow
living room.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, Boston and daughter Shani, 14, (son Linje, 19, attends
Carnegie Mellon University, studying computer
</P>
<P>
   science) will be adjusting to bare walls for six weeks.
Sixty-eight works from their collection are on display at Georgia
Tech through Feb. 28. But they are excited about sharing their art
with the student body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very concerned that the students be able to understand
and connect with it,'' say Boston, professor of economics at Tech,
who is overseeing the project. ``I would not like for them to be as
old as I was when I first began to appreciate fine art.''
</P>
<P>
   That process started in 1976, when Boston, then 29, joined the
faculty at Clark Atlanta University. He shared an office with Tina
Dunkley, director of the Clark Atlanta University Gallery, and
began going to shows there. His interest piqued, he and Ross
started spending time in museums, got hooked and began
investigating the how-tos of beginning an art collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we read suggested that it should have a focus,'' he
says. ``Since we couldn't collect older masters, we decided to
collect artists who were either born or spent some time in
Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   That covers a broad spectrum, from patriarch Henry Ossawa
Tanner, who briefly had a photographic studio in Atlanta, to the
wealth of contemporary artists who live in metro Atlanta. The
collection includes Ulysses Marshall, Kevin Cole, John Dowell and
Stefani Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``They buy with their own eye,'' says friend Jimmy Allen, an
Atlanta dealer whom Boston approached after overhearing him talking
about the collection of Malcolm X papers he had acquired. ``Their
choices are not out of a manual, of what African-American
collectors should get, but what appeals to them. That is
adventurous.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta printmaker Michael Ellison occupies a special place in
the collection. As part of their focus, they decided to acquire one
artist in depth, and they own 40 Ellisons, one of every print he
has made. Their dining room is a homage to the artist, who has a
mini one-man-show called ``The Art of Storytelling'' within the
Tech show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the simplicity of the scenes and the complexity of the
way he captures it,'' Boston says. ``The themes are of everyday
life of African-Americans _ the church, street scenes, night life.
He so vividly captures the experience of life in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison has been able to count on their patronage for half of
his 20-year career. ``It means a lot,'' he says. ``Artists are at
the mercy of the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston commissioned Ellison to make the images for the covers of
his two-volume book, ``Different Vision,'' about black economics,
which the artist considers the highlight of his career. The
professor has continued the practice with other artists for other
publications. ``Inner City,'' essays on urban poverty and
revitalization strategies for inner cities co-edited with Ross,
uses a Jacob Lawrence piece.
</P>
<P>
   The couple has developed friendships with Ellison and
Philadelphian Jonas Allen. Allen lived with the family for two
months while he painted a large piece for a specially created niche
on the second floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bit of a trial,'' Boston laughingly remembers. ``He
would sleep all day, get up around 6 or 7 p.m., go out or entertain
friends and get to work about 2 or 3 a.m. He said he had to do it
when the inspiration hit him. The problem is, that was usually
before sunrise.''
</P>
<P>
   Collecting art has not only affected the architecture of their
home and expanded their circle of friends. It is part of family
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never visit a city that we don't go to a gallery,'' says
Ross. ``The kids used to complain, but now they're into it. They
have developed some expertise. It's rewarding to have them develop
an appreciation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really encouraging and wonderful about the Bostons is
their level of commitment to learning and keeping informed about
the visual arts,'' says Dunkley. ``So many people who have the
means to buy art don't have the values, interest and knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The late dealer Thurlow Tibbs of Washington helped them build
their collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave him a list of artists we were looking for, and he
would call us when he found something,'' Boston says. ``He would
discourage us, too, if he thought a work didn't fit. The more I
pull together the wall texts, the more I realize how important he
was in directing and curating our collection.''
</P>
<P>
   They have also benefited from a relationship with master printer
Lou Stovall, who runs Workshop Inc. in Washington. Boston is
excited about a recent purchase, a print by the late James Lesesne
Wells made in collaboration with Stovall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's consumed,'' Ross says of her husband. ``I have to watch
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection is growing in scope as well as number. A
photograph by Albert Chong is a new acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are beginning to expand in new directions,'' Ross says.
``Abstraction. Sculpture. It's a process of educating oneself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Survival: An Exhibition of African American Art, Selections
From the Collection of
</P>
<P>
   Drs. Thomas D. Boston and Catherine L. Ross''
</P>
<P>
   Through Feb. 28. Noon-6 p.m. Tuesdays-Saturdays. Ferst Center
for the Arts, Georgia Tech, 349 Ferst Drive N.W. 404-894-9600.

 &HT;    Sundance fest solid as a film launching pad
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, the best Sundance Film Festival stories have little
to do with what's projected on a big screen.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax Films co-chairman Harvey Weinstein, whose studio helped
catapult ``Shakespeare in Love'' over ``Saving Private Ryan'' at
last year's Oscars, once reportedly stormed into a restaurant at
the fest and began yelling and screaming at a rival. Weinstein had
just been outbid for the distributing rights to a little Australian
movie about an abused piano prodigy. It was called ``Shine.''
</P>
<P>
   Following a screening of his much-praised documentary ``Gates of
Heaven,'' Errol Morris (``The Thin Blue Line'') got caught in a
snowstorm _ one of the festival's seemingly annual pet peeves in
its picturesque mountaintop setting in Utah _ and tried to get back
to his out-of-the-way condo in freezing weather by hitchhiking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was picked up by two people who'd been in the theater and
had hated the movie,'' he says. ``They asked me what I thought, and
since I had no alternative means of transportation, I said I, too,
was extremely disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   10 days of movies
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bernard, co-president of Sony Pictures Classics, made a
reported $700,000 distribution deal last year for the documentary
``American Movie'' with Athens-based R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe, a
financial backer of the film, sitting at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I had lunch with these guys, and I didn't even know who
he was,'' Bernard says. ``After we made the deal, I found out he
was in the rock 'n' roll business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sundance Film Festival, Robert Redford's annual 10-day fete
of independent movies in Park City, Utah, ushers in the new century
Thursday with all the behind-the-scenes dealmaking,
front-and-center celebrity preening and sheer movie fan mania
that's marked the festival for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Soderbergh's ``sex, lies and videotape,'' which first
underscored profitability and mass-market acceptance of independent
films, took off there. So did the Oscar-winning ``Shine,''
``Affliction,'' ``Gods and Monsters,'' ``Hoop Dreams,'' ``El
Mariachi,'' ``Clerks'' and Quentin Tarantino's ``Reservoir Dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sundance is the premier American film festival,'' says Mark
Ordesky, president of Fine Line Features.
</P>
<P>
   John Anderson, film critic for Newsday, a newspaper on Long
Island, N.Y., has attended nine consecutive Sundance fests and
calls it ``among the three or four most prestigious in the world.
It is always a barometer of a film-crazy culture's national
cinema,'' he writes in his new book ``Sundancing.''
</P>
<P>
   The stars do come out. Robert Altman, Kenneth Branagh and Glenn
Close have all touted films there.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the 112 full-length movies, documentaries and film
shorts will feature such talent as Kevin Spacey, Ben Affleck,
Cameron Diaz, Heather Graham, Danny DeVito, Christian Bale, Emilio
Estevez, Omar Epps, Nia Long and Stanley Tucci.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most anticipated films: the opening night
Thanksgiving-themed ``What's Cooking?,'' starring Alfre Woodard,
Joan Chen and Julianna Margulies, from English-Indian director
Gurinder Chadha; and ``American Psycho,'' with Bale, Willem Dafoe
and Reese Witherspoon in director Mary Harron's adaptation of Bret
Easton Ellis' controversial Wall Street psycho-killer drama.
``American Psycho'' opens in theaters in April.
</P>
<P>
   This year's festival features more movies from women filmmakers
than ever before. Plus, there will be digital screenings of 17
films at theaters equipped with special projectors installed by
Kennesaw's Digital Projection Inc. It's a process that some expect
to revolutionize independent filmmaking, drastically reducing
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Deals and steals
</P>
<P>
   Among other Georgia connections: The Georgia Film and Videotape
Office will hold a breakfast to lure more filmmakers to the state.
(Recently, Redford filmed ``The Legend of Bagger Vance'' in
Savannah, and Denzel Washington made ``Remember the Titans'' in
metro Atlanta and North Georgia.) And Pat Mitchell, president of
CNN Productions and Time Inc. Television and board member of the
Sundance Institute, will serve on a panel also involving
representatives from HBO, PBS, Artisan Entertainment and other
outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Over two decades, Sundance has been a virtual breeding ground
where independent filmmakers can peddle their movies to Hollywood
studios. The festival has been a mixture of world premieres (Altman
debuted ``Cookie's Fortune'' last year), documentaries and
brand-new voices. Other films that made their mark at Sundance
include ``The Opposite of Sex,'' ``Longtime Companion,'' ``The
Waterdance,'' ``love jones,'' ``In the Company of Men'' and ``Pi.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is ``The Blair Witch Project.'' A midnight
darling at last year's festival, ``Blair Witch's'' creators
brokered a distribution deal with Artisan Entertainment for roughly
$1.1 million and then stunned the movie industry as the horror
flick amassed more than $140 million at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Sundance, there were a number of people who walked out of
`Blair Witch,''' says Tom Ortenberg, co-president of Lions Gate
Releasing. ``There was not even unanimity within Artisan that they
had bought a picture worth buying. Believe me, at the end of the
day, Sundance is nothing but a crap shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a bet many studios lose big time.
</P>
<P>
   Hand in hand with all the success stories are plenty of
multimillion-dollar deals that end up bombing at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax paid anywhere from a reported $2.5 million to a rumored
$10 million-plus for last year's ``Happy, Texas,'' which has sold
only $1.9 million in tickets. Miramax also shelled out $6 million
for 1998's ``Next Stop Wonderland,'' only to see it earn a paltry
$3.4 million at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Several festival winners _ including last year's ``Three
Seasons,'' the filmed-in-Vietnam debut from director Tony Bui,
which won the grand jury prize and audience award in drama _ hardly
registered nationwide in ticket receipts.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpected finds
</P>
<P>
   Often, the beauty of Sundance isn't what always sells or wins
awards, but what more quietly emerges.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Thomas Anderson, for example, debuted the film short
``Cigarettes and Coffee'' in 1993. It raised the young filmmaker's
profile, and over the next six years he wrote and directed ``Hard
Eight,'' ``Boogie Nights'' and ``Magnolia.''
</P>
<P>
   At last year's festival, Kimberly Peirce had roughly 20 minutes
of footage available for distributors to see of her
work-in-progress about a Midwestern woman posing as a man. The end
result: ``Boys Don't Cry,'' which could bring Oscar nominations
this year for stars Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very organic festival,'' Fine Line's Ordesky says.
``The people who program the festival don't program it for
commerce, they program it for the best independent film has to
offer. The perception that Sundance is becoming more commercialized
is there because more studios are using it as a launch pad for
films they've already bought.''
</P>
<P>
   ``American Psycho'' is a prime example.
</P>
<P>
   The film, getting its world premiere at Sundance and set to
debut in theaters April 7, previously landed a distribution deal
with Lions Gate Releasing. It's one of several film premieres at
the fest designed to use Sundance as a way to market independent
movies to the press and public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think `American Psycho' will appeal to both the 18-year-old
demographic and highbrow movie audiences,'' Lions Gate's Ortenberg
says. ``The timing of Sundance is perfect and makes it a great
platform. It coincides with the deadlines for many national
magazines' April issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Other world premieres will include director Keith Gordon's drama
``Waking the Dead'' with Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly, and
director Valerie Breiman's dating flick ``Love and Sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the heart of the festival is its as-yet unsold dramas and
documentaries that compete for prizes. Among the full-length
dramas: Jenniphr Goodman's ``The Tao of Steve,'' about a cool guy
who attracts women naturally, and Kenneth Lonergan's ``You Can
Count on Me,'' with Laura Linney and Matthew Broderick, in a tale
of orphaned siblings who grew up apart.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more anticipated documentaries: Elizabeth Barret's
``Stranger With a Camera,'' about the 1967 slaying of a
documentarian in Appalachia, and Daniel McCabe and Paul Stekler's
``George Wallace: Settin' the Woods on Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   It's with unsold films like these that backstage deals get done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opening night film _ `What's Cooking?' I was told that $6
million could take it off the table today,'' Sony Pictures' Bernard
says. ``No one's seen it. Every year, every movie has some bizarre
amount of money, sight unseen. And that's the number they'll get if
they have a huge bidding war going. It's the most ruthless pack of
filmmakers in one place.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine Line's Ordesky says last year's fest was ``busy,''
producing five or seven pricey picture deals. ``There's usually not
less than three, and I've rarely seen more than five to seven.''
</P>
<P>
   What's decidedly more plentiful are the great off-screen
stories.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ben Affleck nearly getting crushed in a crowd's frenzy to
get into a screening. Or who the makers of ``Judy Berlin'' once
found living with them in their rented Park City house _ a groupie,
who melded into the ``Berlin'' team after a screening and even
joined them in their Jacuzzi.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sort of living in our house, but nobody really knows
him,'' ``Berlin'' actress Edie Falco (an Emmy winner for HBO's
``The Sopranos'') recalls in the book ``Sundancing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems harmless enough, but nobody speaks to him really,
nobody knows him, and he kind of sits there and watches us,'' Falco
says. ``Everybody thought he was someone else's friend. Finally, we
all sort of said, `No, I don't know him either!'''

 &HT;    Faith is not reserved just for the sabbath, researchers find
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a typical 24-hour period, many Americans are busy praying,
sharing their faith and reading Scripture.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the Princeton Religion Research Center set out to show
just how many Americans engage in religious or spiritual
activities.
</P>
<P>
   The center is a nondenominational organization that uses the
facilities and resources of Gallup International. Its executive
director, George Gallup Jr., calls the survey a ``snapshot'' of
American spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see data on the country as a whole for specific
items,'' said Gallup, who is also co-chairman of the Gallup
Organization. ``But it's very helpful to see them all in
relationship to each other. Is there a rhythm in spirituality? Does
it ebb and flow? Do people sense God's presence in a positive way?
In a negative way?''
</P>
<P>
   The recent survey, the result of interviews with 100 Americans _
a representative sample of a larger Gallup poll of randomly
selected people _ reinforced findings from earlier Gallup research,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those studies show that the percentage of Americans who say they
feel the need for spiritual growth surged 24 points in just four
years _ from 58 percent in 1994 to 82 percent in 1998 _ but that
the increased interest in spirituality is not coming at the expense
of organized religion. Religious preference and church attendance
have changed little in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great deal of spiritual and religious activity
going on,'' said Gallup. ``It's not just a Sunday thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallup said he believes the most important questions his
organization can ask these days are about the inner life of
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The depth of spirituality, the depth of faith commitment,
really have a lot more to do with who we are than a lot of other
things, such as region or political party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How does Gallup, a 69-year-old Episcopalian, answer his own
questions?
</P>
<P>
   In the 24 hours before the interview, he said, he prayed at a
meal, talked to someone about God, shared his faith, read the Bible
and other spiritual literature, counseled someone from a spiritual
perspective, attended a worship service and listened to a religious
cassette tape. He did not watch religious television, listen to
religious radio, visit a religious computer Web site or use the
Internet to explore a matter of faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't use the Internet,'' he said. ``I'm a typewriter man.''
</P>
<P>
   55% PRAYED AT A MEAL
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim and I grew up in families where the focus around the
evening meal was that you said the blessing and then talked about
the day's activities. Sometimes that's the time when you reflect
back on what God's done that day. It's a time of quiet in all the
hecticness that goes on. For us it's a time of not only blessing
the food but for other prayers and petitions.''

activists, they don't see the spiritual side. They see the
rabble-rousing, demonstrating side. But for me, it's my faith, my
belief in Jesus, and my sense of his calling me into ministry that
undergirds that. I hope that doesn't get lost in the persona of the

unison, which is also mentioned in the Bible. I believe as we
combine our voices, we create a stronger presence before God and
that singing pleases God. Even though you can sing alone, it's a
lot more meaningful, a lot more warming to the soul to sing
together.''

 &HT;    34 party tips for Super Bowl XXXIV
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta is hosting Super Bowl XXXIV. You are hosting a Super
Bowl party.
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks, the city will be bustling with scores of the rich
and the famous, the corporate and the connected.
</P>
<P>
   Your den will be packed with neighbors and co-workers; friends
and true football fans.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, a few lucky ducks get to spend the day at the Georgia
Dome. But the rest of us are carrying on a tradition that may as
well be a national holiday. The Super Bowl is the biggest at-home
party of the year, according to Hallmark Cards research.
</P>
<P>
   And even those who shy away from entertaining find this gig
manageable. After all, the theme is set _ football. And so are the
activities _ watch TV and eat.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, since we are the host city, Super Bowl party
hosts may want to go an extra few yards to make the evening
special.
</P>
<P>
   You'll need a good game plan because usually there's a two-week
break between the final playoff game and the Super Bowl. This year,
there's only one. The final two teams won't be decided until
Sunday, Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no need to procrastinate. We've got ideas _ 34 of
them in fact _ to keep you busy, from today until it's time for the
antacid.
</P>
<P>
   INVITING
</P>
<P>
   I. Draft a guest list. The average number at a Super Bowl party
is 17, Hallmark Cards research shows. Take into consideration the
size of your house and the number of TVs.
</P>
<P>
   II. Seek balance among the fanatical football fans and those who
don't know a first down from first base. (And have a plan for
keeping these two groups at a safe distance from each other.)
</P>
<P>
   III. Issue the invites. This is a casual party, so phone calls
and e-mails are okay. Be ready with a list of needs (beer, chips)
to offer when guests ask what they can bring.
</P>
<P>
   VIEWING
</P>
<P>
   IV. Count your televisions. It's a good idea to have more than
one. The kids may want their own tube; the football fanatics won't
want to miss a moment, even in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   V. And measure them, too. Don't even think of crowding a dozen
people around a 13-inch screen. If you don't have a large screen
television, move the party to someone else's house. Or get one. The
National Electronic Dealers Association reports sales of large
screen televisions increase five times during Super Bowl Week.
</P>
<P>
   VI. Hook up the main television to the stereo. Nothing short of
surround sound will do for that stadium feel.
</P>
<P>
   VII. Gather enough chairs (you may have to ask guests to bring a
folding chair or two) and arrange chairs so that everyone can see.
Try forming a semi- circle ``stadium style.''
</P>
<P>
   DECORATING
</P>
<P>
   VIII. Once the teams are decided, think team colors in
everything from jerseys to streamers to paper plates. Or go with
football logos. The NFL licenses 50 companies to produce products
bearing the Super Bowl logo, from aprons to chip-and-dip sets.
Party goods stores will be a sure bet. There also are some online
sources such as partyforless.com.
</P>
<P>
   IX. Convert your ping pong table into a buffet table. Use white
duct tape to mark off yard lines and create goal posts using tubes
from rolls of paper towels, drinking straws or white pvc pipes.
</P>
<P>
   X. Raid your 10-year-old son's room and move the team posters
out to the TV room. Then raid your college-aged son's room and
borrow some beer posters.
</P>
<P>
   EATING
</P>
<P>
   XI. Speaking of beer, it would be tragic to forget you can't buy
beer to take home on Sunday. So make the beer run on Saturday at
the latest. Remember, if you get a keg, pick up several bags of ice
to keep it cool until you tap it. (A cold snap in the weather sure
could help.) Remember some folks don't imbibe, so have plenty of
soft drinks, tea and juice on hand.
</P>
<P>
   XII. And don't forget the chips and dip. An estimated 14,500
tons of chips and 4,000 tons of popcorn are eaten on Super Bowl
Sunday. And Americans average 8 million pounds of guacamole. So
start hoarding bags of chips like it's Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   XIII. But don't bother with the sparkling water. This isn't that
kind of party. Nor do you need to fuss over prissy appetizers or a
meal that requires attention at the stove while the game is in
play.
</P>
<P>
   XIV. Think make-ahead crowd pleasers for main courses. Lasagne
is great. So is chili. We'll give you some fan-tastic recipes in
Thursday's Food section.
</P>
<P>
   XV. Mix and match some of your favorites, advises Allan Souze,
owner of Divine Events Catering in Roswell, which will be catering
the Fox SportsNet tent during Super Bowl week. For instance, rather
than cocktail sauce, serve lightly breaded shrimp with the buffalo
sauce usually doused on chicken wings.
</P>
<P>
   XVI. Think football shapes. Some things are naturally oblong,
like deviled eggs and black olives. Others, like meatballs, can be
easily molded by hand. Football-shaped cookie cutters and molds can
be used to make cookies, cupcakes, sandwiches and Jell-O to
resemble footballs.
</P>
<P>
   XVII. If pizza is the plan, jot down the number for pizza
delivery and stick it by the phone now. Come game day, call early
to find out what time you should place your order. Super Bowl
Sunday is the busiest day of the year for pizza delivery.
</P>
<P>
   XVIII. Carryout can do. Load up at your favorite barbecue joint,
chicken wing shack or grocery deli. If you want to go fancy,
eatZi's is offering mini beef Wellingtons and Szechuan beef spring
rolls by the dozen, along with a full menu of Super Bowl favorites.
Order by Friday, Jan. 28. (404-237-8646.)
</P>
<P>
   XIX. Talk the kids into being vendors. Make some vendor boxes
that hang from their necks and have them move from room to room
hawking popcorn and peanuts to the hungry fans. Tell them they can
keep the tips.
</P>
<P>
   XX. Paper plates are proper. Anyone who complains can wash the
pots and pans during the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINING
</P>
<P>
   XXI. Just because you aren't going to the game, doesn't mean you
can't have a tailgate party. For festive pregame fun, talk everyone
on your street into pulling their SUV's to the end of the driveway,
dropping down the tailgate and putting on a spread of Super Bowl
snacks.
</P>
<P>
   XXII. While you're tailgating, organize a little street
scrimmage of touch football. Losers can host the winners for the
big game (or send them home with an extra beer or two.)
</P>
<P>
   XXIII. Set up a face painting station and encourage everyone,
not just the kids, to slap some color on their face.
</P>
<P>
   XXIV. Pull out the sports almanacs and write up a trivia game.
You can arrange it in the style of Jeopardy! and play rounds before
the game, during commercials and halftime. Or read questions from
the Sports edition of Trivial Pursuit or the sports category of the
genus?? edition. Award prizes.
</P>
<P>
   XXV. Play football party bingo. Instead of letters, players are
looking for first downs, completed passes, etc. For details visit
footballpartybingo.com or call 1-888-436-6822 to order a game set
with cards. Order no later than Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
   XXVI. Wouldn't a little wager make the game more interesting?
Encourage folks to place bets on the winners, but set a reasonable
cap in the $1 to $5 range. Then place penny or quarter bets on
everything from who will win the coin toss to which beer commercial
will be on next.
</P>
<P>
   XXVII. Start choreographing now. Recruit some guests (including
kids) to stage a halftime show with skits and songs. Just about
anything could be more entertaining than the real thing. (Remember
the video camera. )
</P>
<P>
   XXVIII. For the real couch potatoes, make it a day-long event
and rent videos of football movies (''The Longest Yard'', ``Black
Sunday'', ``North Dallas Forty'') or highlights from previous Super
Bowls to screenbefore the game.
</P>
<P>
   XXIX. Rather than take care of all the details yourself, party
at a sports bar instead. The new ESPN Zone in Buckhead (3030
Peachtree Road) plans to make it's debut Super Bowl week. The
33,000-square-foot complex combines eating, viewing and playing.
With 210 screens for sports viewing _ including in the restrooms _
fans won't miss a moment of the action. ABC will broadcast portions
of their pregame show from there. Advance tickets will be required.
The cost will be $20 and will include a t-shirt; only 200 will be
sold beginning 9 a.m. Monday, Jan. 23 at ESPN Zone.
</P>
<P>
   GIVING
</P>
<P>
   XXX. Think prizes to reward folks for trivia knowledge, lucky
bets and winning bingo cards. Party favors are nice too, especially
for those who don't know squat about football trivia, who cheered
for the losing team or who drew a bingo card destined for the paper
shredder. Small footballs, pennants, posters and tickets to
sporting events are all good ideas.
</P>
<P>
   XXXI. Organize a ``Souper'' bowl at your church. Souper Bowl of
Caring is an effort that began a decade ago to get church goers to
donate a dollar each on their way out the door Super Bowl Sunday
for hunger relief efforts. To find out more, call 1-800-358-7687 or
go to www.souperbowl.com.
</P>
<P>
   XXXII. Ask guests to bring along some of those Y2K canned goods
they stocked up on to make a group donation to a food bank. Have
them load them directly into the back of a car or truck.
</P>
<P>
   RECOVERING
</P>
<P>
   XXXIII. Get ahead of the game and pick up the antacid at the
same time you buy the chili fixin's and hot salsa. The 7-Eleven
stores report sales of antacid increases 20 percent the day after
the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   XXXIV. Call in sick. While most of us fumble our way into the
office, about 6 percent opt for a longer post-game recovery time
and take the day off.

 &HT;    `Angels' starts slow but potential's there
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a real hospital in Atlanta or other major cities, it wouldn't
be a shock to see mostly African-American doctors, administrators,
staff and patients.
</P>
<P>
   On a prime-time TV show, it's exotic, almost jarring, which of
course says a lot more about television than it does about black
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to ``City of Angels,'' the new medical drama from Steven
Bochco (``NYPD Blue,'' ``L.A. Law,'' ``Hill Street Blues'') that
carries the unfair burden of being the Great Black Hope of Prime
Time. CBS and Bochco already had the series in the works before the
NAACP charged the networks last year with ``a virtual whitewash.''
Now it's become TV's symbol of diversity, when what it really is is
a decent drama with potential.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional Angels of Mercy Hospital is the last place you
want to be in an emergency, or a non-emergency. A living patient is
shipped to the morgue. The medical director just got fired for
posing for photos with a corpse. Accreditation is a distant dream.
They can't even schedule a fire drill properly. The problem isn't
the staff, which is mostly dedicated and hard-working, but funding,
or the lack of it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lillian Price (Vivica A. Fox) is the new medical director,
determined to get Angels accredited. She runs into Dr. Ben Turner
(Blair Underwood), a surgeon with whom she has a history, some
issues, and, we learn in Episode 2, still some sparks. Also regular
are the run-ins with Ron Harris (Michael Warren), the hospital's
CEO, who's a little too slick at the gamesmanship his job requires.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Edwin O'Malley (Robert Morse, one of the few
white faces), the seemingly avuncular chairman of the board of
supervisors, whose antics in the first couple of shows are puzzling
at best, and possibly sinister.
</P>
<P>
   Race is a subtext rather than a rallying cry on ``Angels,''
which is a smart move; ``Do the Right Thing'' may have been a great
film, but it wouldn't play as a weekly TV series designed to sell
Toyotas and Web portals.
</P>
<P>
   Bochco has wisely stocked his show with actors who aren't just
talented but are familiar friends. Underwood was Jonathan Rollins
on ``L.A. Law,'' Warren was Bobby Hill on ``Hill Street Blues,''
and Fox played Will Smith's girlfriend in the film ``Independence
Day.'' To his credit, Bochco is also using African-Americans behind
the camera, to write and direct.
</P>
<P>
   Any hospital show, no matter the color, has to cope with the
huge shadow of ``ER,'' and ``Angels'' feels dwarfed by that series'
show-off adrenalin and dizzying body count. Of course, this is CBS,
where things move a little more slowly, including, one hopes, any
urge to pull the plug if the ratings don't soar right off.
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, the concern. There has never been a
majority-black network drama that has lasted more than one season.
(``Under One Roof,'' ``413 Hope Street'' and ``Paris,'' an early
cop show by Bochco starring James Earl Jones, are among the
commercial, though not critical, failures.) For reasons that have
prompted a lot of speculation, the white TV audience has embraced
black comedies more easily than black dramas. And there is anxiety
in the African-American community that if ``City of Angels''
doesn't score in the Nielsens _ meaning it has to attract a lot of
whites, who are 79 percent of the TV audience _ it will be a long,
long time before the next black drama.
</P>
<P>
   That anxiety is more than justified. It doesn't help that after
Sunday's premiere, ``Angels'' moves to 8 p.m. Wednesdays, a time
slot too early for the show's serious tone and Bochco's sometimes
wickedly tasteless sense of humor. ``City of Angels'' doesn't kick
off with the impact of a ``Hill Street'' or ``NYPD,'' but it
deserves to run its race without carrying so much baggage.
</P>
<P>
   ``City of Angels''
</P>
<P>
   8 p.m. Sunday on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Ignore the baggage, watch the show.

<P>
   Martin Luther King Jr. Day is much more than a holiday to me.
</P>
<P>
   I am a 42-year-old African-American woman who grew up in
Huntsville, Ala. My parents strategized and marched with Dr. King.
I learned about civil disobedience and protests from them when I
was 4 years old. I heard them talk of taking part in sit-ins at
segregated lunch counters. And I remember them explaining to me why
we would not be buying new clothes from our town's segregated
stores during Easter because Dr. King had organized a boycott. The
logic was simple: If we couldn't shop at these stores by entering
the front door, then we wouldn't patronize them.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Easter clothes and accoutrements were important among
African-Americans in the South. It was a time when we put on our
finest new clothes _ and everything was new, from our underwear to
our gloves.
</P>
<P>
   It was a very big deal to join that boycott. In fact, our
strategy on that Easter Sunday in 1962 was to wear blue jeans to
church. Little black girls never wore pants to church in the '60s,
much less jeans. But it was a visible way to demonstrate our
displeasure with stores that discriminated against us.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. King knew this would be a hard sell in the black community,
but he also understood its significance.
</P>
<P>
   I never met Dr. King, but my father so vividly described the
meetings and organizing sessions involved in the boycott that in my
young mind I felt as though I had met the great man. Plus, in a lot
of black homes during the '60s three pictures hung on the walls:
those of Jesus Christ, John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   My father, who was just three years younger than Dr. King, spoke
of him as both a good friend and a genius. Dr. King's oratory
skills were legendary, and I'm not simply referring to his ``I Have
a Dream'' speech. You had a chance to hear Dr. King preach, you
made a point of being there. His down-home preaching was so good
that it made you want to holler and fan yourself at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder what Dr. King, who would have been 71 this year, would
make of America in the year 2000. No doubt he would appreciate the
national holiday and all the streets named after him, but I imagine
he would not be impressed. Dr. King was a man of substance. Stamps,
holidays and street names were not in his master plan.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure he would be shocked to know that more than 30 years
after his death, African-Americans still experience discrimination,
despite state and federal legislation; shocked to learn that a
digital divide exists between white people and people of color.
That there are only five African-Americans and one Latino on the
boards of companies in Silicon Valley. That many cabs still will
not stop for African-American men, and that racial profiling
abounds.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure all this would sadden Dr. King, and he would question
whether it really was the year 2000 or the year 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. King was an advocate for diversity and demanded an end to
discrimination. His ``dream'' has not been realized.
</P>
<P>
   These days, many people simply ``talk the talk'' rather than
``walk the walk'' when it comes to the diversity Dr. King hoped
for. Many of us spend the majority of our time with people who look
like us rather than with those who may reflect the diversity of
which we speak.
</P>
<P>
   So I will honor the anniversary of Dr. King's birth as I did in
the years before it became a federal holiday. I will shed tears
over the loss of a great man and a philosopher. I will rue the fact
that there are still so many people who know little about his life
and legacy. And I will remember that the best way to honor Dr. King
is by reading his speeches and making a commitment to ``walking the
walk'' of diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Actions do speak louder than words.

 &HT;    King's sister remembers tight-knit, loving family
 &HT;    EDs: EMBARGOED for Monday, Jan. 17
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Today, Christine King Farris will go to Ebenezer
Baptist Church and listen to the Vice President of the United
States talk about the significance of her brother's life. She'll
join others there in song and prayer and visits to Martin Luther
King Jr.'s tomb.
</P>
<P>
   Then she'll go home and think about him _ her way. ``He is not
an icon to me. Just my brother,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of three children in a tight-knit, religious family
headed by ``Daddy'' and Alberta King, Farris is the only surviving
sibling of the family. She said that she and her two brothers,
Martin and A.D., were extremely close and although she was older,
the brothers were protective of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin and I never had a fight, but he would fight A.D.,''
recalls Farris, who wrote the children's book, ``Martin Luther King
Jr.: His Life and Dream,'' in 1986. ``I remember one time, A.D. got
angry with me and was about to hit me. Martin got in the middle of
it and threatened to hit him with the telephone. One of those old
big telephones. A.D. stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Violence as a response would eventually disappear from Martin
King's life. The effectiveness of his use of nonviolent civil
disobedience for the cause of human rights led to the establishment
of a national holiday commemorated today in his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm appreciative of the fact that people are concerned enough
to want a holiday for him,'' Farris said. ``I want people to think
about Martin on this day because he was concerned about helping
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Farris' wood-paneled den is a shrine to her two favorite things
_ family and learning. Books are everywhere and a baby bed filled
with her granddaughter's toys sit in one corner of the room.
</P>
<P>
   A 1948 photo of her father in front of Ebenezer sits above the
sofa. Nearby is a photo taken of her and her brothers when they
were teen-agers. She notes that in the photo, she was taller than
both her brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She and her brothers were incredibly close,'' said Farris'
niece, Alveeda King, daughter of A.D. King. ``She misses her
brothers tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously absent from the photos are pictures of Farris on
the front lines. She recalls only one instance when she was
photographed with her brother at a civil rights march, although she
rarely missed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role was support for Martin when he was out there. He had
to have our support and love,'' said Farris. ``So I was at every
march, except the March on Washington, because I was ill.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, although she is the vice president and treasurer of
the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change, she remains in the
background, deferring most things relating to King to her
sister-in-law, Coretta Scott King, or his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never taught to be out front. I do lots of things that
people don't know about and that is fine,'' Farris said. ``I don't
need the attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she prefers not to make news, the lifelong Atlantan has
seen her share of news and tragedy, with the deaths of both her
brothers and her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have strong faith in God,'' said Farris. ``For some reason,
this is all mine to face. I know I am in His hands.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same house she lives in now, Farris said she listened to
Chet Huntley tell America that her brother had been shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sewing and I had gone in the other room and I heard him
say `Dr. King had just been shot in Memphis,' '' said Farris.
``Then he said it was critical and I just screamed. I knew that was
it. When JFK died, he (King) said that is how he was going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, in July 1969, A.D. King accidentally drowned in a
swimming pool at his home. Then in June 1974, Alberta King was shot
and killed during a church service by a deranged 23-year-old man,
whom witnesses testified specifically targeted her as she played
``The Lord's Prayer'' on the church's new organ.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult when you think about it, so I try not to think
about it. I try to stay pre-occupied with other things,'' Farris
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she stays busy with activities that would make her
parents and brothers proud, like working in the church,
volunteering and teaching, which she has done at Spelman for the
past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always was very strong,'' said Alveeda King, a business
professor at Atlanta Metropolitan College and the national campaign
co-chair for Steve Forbes' presidential campaign. ``The younger
members of the family always turn to Aunt Chris for council or
advice.''
</P>
<P>
   As the world remembers her little brother today, Farris will
think about the last sermon he delivered in February 1968. In it,
he said he didn't want a long funeral with people standing up
talking about how great he was and that he won a Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said remember him because he tried to give his life to
serve others. That he tried to love others,'' said Farris. ``That
is what we were brought up on. And when I start thinking back, I
think about what it would be like if he were here. How things would
be different.''

 &HT;    King's sister remembers tight-knit, loving family
 &HT;    EDs: EMBARGOED for Monday, Jan. 17
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Today, Christine King Farris will go to Ebenezer
Baptist Church and listen to the Vice President of the United
States talk about the significance of her brother's life. She'll
join others there in song and prayer and visits to Martin Luther
King Jr.'s tomb.
</P>
<P>
   Then she'll go home and think about him _ her way. ``He is not
an icon to me. Just my brother,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of three children in a tight-knit, religious family
headed by ``Daddy'' and Alberta King, Farris is the only surviving
sibling of the family. She said that she and her two brothers,
Martin and A.D., were extremely close and although she was older,
the brothers were protective of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin and I never had a fight, but he would fight A.D.,''
recalls Farris, who wrote the children's book, ``Martin Luther King
Jr.: His Life and Dream,'' in 1986. ``I remember one time, A.D. got
angry with me and was about to hit me. Martin got in the middle of
it and threatened to hit him with the telephone. One of those old
big telephones. A.D. stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Violence as a response would eventually disappear from Martin
King's life. The effectiveness of his use of nonviolent civil
disobedience for the cause of human rights led to the establishment
of a national holiday commemorated today in his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm appreciative of the fact that people are concerned enough
to want a holiday for him,'' Farris said. ``I want people to think
about Martin on this day because he was concerned about helping
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Farris' wood-paneled den is a shrine to her two favorite things
_ family and learning. Books are everywhere and a baby bed filled
with her granddaughter's toys sit in one corner of the room.
</P>
<P>
   A 1948 photo of her father in front of Ebenezer sits above the
sofa. Nearby is a photo taken of her and her brothers when they
were teen-agers. She notes that in the photo, she was taller than
both her brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She and her brothers were incredibly close,'' said Farris'
niece, Alveeda King, daughter of A.D. King. ``She misses her
brothers tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously absent from the photos are pictures of Farris on
the front lines. She recalls only one instance when she was
photographed with her brother at a civil rights march, although she
rarely missed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role was support for Martin when he was out there. He had

QUIZ SHOWS MAKE EVERY CONTESTANT A VIDEO GLADIATOR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JULIA CHAPLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When David Karraker, a computer games fanatic who works for the
Sega company in San Francisco, first tuned in to ``Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire'' and ``Greed'' last fall, what he noticed right away
was how similar they were to some of his favorite video games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire,'' the blockbuster quiz show that revived ABC, had
a circular glass stage raked by beams of light, while the host,
Regis Philbin, perched face to face with a single contestant
surrounded by a black void, like the gladiatorial arenas in games
like Virtua Fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greed,'' the me-too entry from Fox with a more sinister tone,
featured a set painted to look like stone blocks, reminiscent of
the torch-lighted medieval castles in games like Doom and Soul
Calibur.
</P>
<P>
   And when Philbin intoned his Yoda-like line, ``Are you confident
that's your final answer?'' _ suggesting a warrior guru, a stock
figure in fantasy games _ the case was sealed for Karraker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' said Karraker, 31, whose Sega job is in
public relations. ``Here was this fluffy, friendly person like
Regis hosting a show with extremely dark undercurrents that was
very similar to the video games I play. I thought, `This is
stranger than anything I've seen on network TV before.'''
</P>
<P>
   What he and other viewers who were raised on video games and
science fiction movies are noticing is how much new television game
show sets resemble computer games and special effects from films
like ``Star Wars'' and ``The Matrix'' and futuristic music videos
like TLC's ``No Scrubs.''
</P>
<P>
   The look of interactive computer games has come to that
stodgiest of television formats, the quiz show, and with it has
come an unexpected mirror of the anxiety felt by many Americans
over computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   As no television viewer can have escaped noticing (try though
one might), the programming phenomenon of last fall, when
``Millionaire'' ran 18 consecutive nights, has spread to the other
leading networks. Quiz shows consume more hours of weekly prime
time _ six and a half _ than at any point since the 1950s. They
have also spread to cable, where MTV's version, ``webRIOT,'' allows
viewers to participate via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning Lines,'' the latest network entry, which made its
debut on CBS last weekend, has a look and format described by Ron
Pearson, a comedian warming up the audience, as ``the Jetsons on
acid.'' Now, any game show with so much as a visible microphone
seems as archaic as an eight-track cassette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action films with special effects and home video games like
Sony's Play-station have definitely influenced the look of these
new game shows,'' said Michael Davies, the executive producer of
``Millionaire,'' which now runs three nights a week. ``Whole
generations of people have grown up playing video games. The last
thing you want on prime time is something that looks outdated.''
</P>
<P>
   Game show staples from the ``Jeopardy!'' era, like catchy theme
songs and circus lights, are as passe as yesterday's fashions. The
new game show staging calls for music throughout the show, beating
like a heart when danger lurks and crescendoing for victory; black
backgrounds that resemble a galactic void; graphics that lie atop
one another as in a Windows computer program; and cockpitlike
chairs in front of computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   The ageless Dick Clark, who is now the host of ``Winning
Lines,'' which airs on Saturday nights, sounded amazed as he
explored his latest domain. ``Have you ever seen a set like that?''
he asked the audience in a pilot episode of the show. ``It's going
to be launched into outer space later on.''
</P>
<P>
   The producers of ``Winning Lines,'' a British import, like
``Millionaire,'' aimed to recreate the feel of an arcade video
game, particularly during the hectic final minutes, when a player
must defeat the Wonderwall to win as much as $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a black seat modeled after a video arcade chair, the
contestant holds a kind of joystick and maneuvers among three huge
video screens, shouting out the answers to questions in a race
against time.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Walmsley, 33, the English set designer responsible for both
``Millionaire'' and ``Winning Lines,'' said he was surprised when
he took a tour of the sets of ``Jeopardy!'' and ``Wheel of
Fortune'' while in Los Angeles recently, because they were so out
of date. ``They were still using video walls made out of plain
glass TV screens, instead of the flat plasma screens,'' he said.
``It was so '80s-looking.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their history, game shows have held up a mirror to
the times. In the '50s, the set of ``What's My Line'' mimicked a
cozy suburban parlor, complete with seating area and pleated
drapes. Other shows spoke of the newness of television itself by
mimicking radio conventions like ``On the Air'' signs and isolation
booths.
</P>
<P>
   The most infamous of these shows, ``Twenty-One,'' which
precipitated a scandal over rigged questions, has just been revived
by NBC. Many elements of its vintage set remain intact, including
the isolation booths. (It is the only one of the new batch of
prime-time game shows not notably influenced by video games.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In the late '60s and early '70s, psychedelia arrived on the sets
of shows like ``The Dating Game,'' with its bubble-shape lettering
and big plastic daisies. After the '70s, game-show ratings were
poor, and the no-frills set of ``Tic Tac Dough'' reflected the
lower budgets.
</P>
<P>
   But then came ``Millionaire,'' with its nerve-rattling music,
eerie blue lighting and space age metallic set. ``The set and
format is a look toward the next platform of programming, which is
a converged medium between the TV, telephone and the computer,''
Davies, its producer, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' embraces high-tech effects to heighten the
drama, which the new shows have emphasized over the mere answering
of questions. The show is shot almost entirely in close-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the contestants first walk out on the set, they're
terrified about falling through the glass floor or making too much
noise with their shoes on the metal,'' Davies said. ``They never
feel that comfortable, and here they are, ordinary people in a new
city, across from Regis Philbin, having to make the most important
decision of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Cuomo, the designer of ``Greed,'' noted that the overtones
of science fiction incorporated in his set, which was inspired in
part by the Starship Enterprise from ``Star Trek'' and by the
castle settings familiar from video combat games, contribute to a
sinister atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer technology does represent a level of anxiety to the
middle generation,'' he said. ``It's like, `Do you really want your
credit card number out there in this void where people can steal
it?' There is a scary element. So computers and technology, or at
least the symbolism of them, can heighten the tension that's part
of the appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, MTV's game, ``webRIOT,'' which is pitched to a
younger audience, 12- to 24-year-olds, imparts a different vision
of technology. The colorful set was described by its producer,
David Salles, as having the ``user-friendly optimism of iMacs and
VW Bugs, rather than the foreboding hacker look of `Millionaire'
and `Greed.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our viewers don't have those same kinds of dark issues with
computers,'' Salles said.
</P>
<P>
   The four contestants on ``WebRIOT,'' shown daily at 4:30 p.m.,
are suspended in cartoonishly round pods and are referred to by
their screen names (as in, ``Vid-kitten, what's the answer?''). The
zany host, bullet-headed Ahmet Zappa, speaks remotely via a video
screen, which enlarges his image to four times life size.
</P>
<P>
   The audience, projected onto multiple screens, is also virtual.
The show goes further than any of the others in marrying life in
front of a computer screen to a television game show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept for the show was that everyone lives in their own
private suspended reality now,'' said Brian Graden, MTV's head of
programming. ``You don't have conversations with people in the same
room. You communicate with people behind a screen via the Internet.
Players of computer games like Quake and Doom relate to each other
in an abstract space, and we want these kids to feel like MTV is an
extension of their community, much like the game worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Which vision of computer technology, sunny or dark, exerts the
more powerful psychic hold on viewers just now? In a week in which
America Online, Pac Manlike, swallowed Time Warner, Karraker of
Sega made a case for the grimmer version, a view of everyday life
as mortal combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in this booming economy right now, where everyone is
reaching for that brass ring,'' he said. ``People read these
articles about kids making millions in IPOs. They're asking
themselves, `How do I get in on an Internet start-up?' There's a
desperate need to catch up, to have millions, and it's made us more
battle-oriented.''

 &HT;    NEW PROGRAM LETS AIRLINE EMPLOYEES REPORT SAFETY CONCERNS
WITHOUT REPRISALS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox Newspapers 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Airline pilots, mechanics and flight crews will be
able to report their own errors and other safety concerns with no
fear of reprisals under a new program President Clinton announced
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, said Clinton, is to improve airline safety by creating
a new channel for employees to report on improper practices or
equipment problems without worrying about retaliation from their
companies or federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be encouraged to share their valuable insights about
doing the job more safely,'' said Clinton, and ``they will be freed
from the fear of being disciplined for admitting that something
went wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration will still have the right to
take action against airline employees who deliberately violate
regulations, use alcohol or drugs on the job or engage in criminal
activity.
</P>
<P>
   And, if an airline feels it is warranted, it could respond to an
incident report by issuing a letter of reprimand to an employee or
requiring additional training.
</P>
<P>
   But under the so-called Aviation Safety Action Program, or ASAP,
employees who file a written report on a specific incident within
24 hours of its occurrence would be otherwise protected against
disciplinary action. Fear of such action has been a deterrent to
open reporting in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a completely different way of looking at safety,''
Clinton told reporters during a brief announcement ceremony in the
ornate Roosevelt Room of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It requires business, labor and regulators to work together in
a completely different way _ as partners, not adversaries,'' said
Clinton. ``Everyone must focus on fixing problems, not fixing
blame.''
</P>
<P>
   The program is voluntary, at the discretion of each airline
company.
</P>
<P>
   FAA flight standards director Nick Lacey said the country's 18
major airline companies _ including Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines
Inc. _ and some cargo companies _ including Atlanta-based UPS _
have applied to participate. It will likely take several months for
the program to be up and running, he said, citing the need for
corporate and employee training.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a moral imperative to have that exchange of
information going, where it concerns aviation safety,'' said Delta
president and chief executive officer Leo Mullin, who accompanied
Clinton at the White House ceremony. ``This is really a win for the
industry and for the general public.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, each airline would set up a three-person
committee, with a safety expert representing the company, its
employees and the FAA, to review incident reports. The review
committee would decide whether to recommend corrective action.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based American Airlines has operated its own ASAP plan,
in cooperation with the FAA, since June of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In that time American employees have filed some 18,000 incident
reports, according to the FAA. Many of these have resulted in
changes to operations, modifications of airport practices or even
the signs indicating how aircraft should move along runways or
taxiways.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots, mechanics and even flight attendants routinely encounter
glitches, mostly minor, in procedures employed during the course of
airline or airport operations. Equipment, also, doesn't always
function as smoothly as operators would like.
</P>
<P>
   Many such problems go unreported, however, unless they cause an
accident or near miss.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has operated anonymous hotlines in the past to allow
airline employees to report safety concerns. And employees have
long had the option _ or, in the case of serious incidents, the
requirement _ of filing an incident report with the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   But voluntary incident reports are, by law, stripped of their
identification, to protect the airline and its employees from
punitive action. That sharply limits the FAA's ability to ferret
out additional information about the incident or to recommend
corrective action on all except the most blatant of problems.
</P>
<P>
   The ASAP program will help to remedy that, said Capt. Rhea
Nichols, a jumbo jet pilot with 30 years experience with a major
airline.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols said pilots will feel free to report incidents _ even if
they are at least partly to blame. And safety officials with the
airlines, labor unions or the FAA will be able to follow up, if
need be, to try to prevent such problems from occurring again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can come back to you for additional information and
you'll still have immunity to help them solve problems before they
cause a disaster,'' said Nichols, of Naples, Fla. ``It's going to
increase the safety of the entire system.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the industry safety record is a good one, but not
good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already there is less than one fatal crash for every 1 million
commercial flights,'' Clinton said. ``But we know we can do better

ALARM VOICED ON ANTIDRUG SCRIPT CHANGES AT US BEHEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As federal regulators squint at media mergers and Congress
clamors for a crackdown on TV sex and violence, the networks may
have viewed the addition of antidrug messages to prime-time
programs as a harmless way to win points in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrangement with the White House _ under which the six
TV networks consulted on scripts with President Clinton's drug
policy office and reaped financial benefits by weaving antidrug
themes into shows _ strikes a variety of critics as a slide down
the slipperiest of slopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm horrified,'' said longtime TV activist Peggy Charren.
``With the government funding content, the government could stick
anything it damned well pleased in there. It's the institution of
free speech that suffers when this kind of thing happens.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's spokesman said Friday that the arrangement
does not ``dictate or infringe on any creative process,'' and said
the president considers it ``a very important and innovative'' way
to reduce drug use.
</P>
<P>
   But Charren and others, even as they said they agree with the
need to combat drugs, that when it comes to government involvement
with the content of TV programs, the networks should just say no.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are opening a Pandora's box with this,'' said TV Guide
columnist J. Max Robins. ``It is dangerous, because the history of
television is littered with examples where the government has tried
to influence news coverage, all sorts of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex McNeil, the author of ``Total Television,'' said that ``the
traditional demarcation line has been muddied.'' McNeil likened it
to a newspaper agreeing to run antidrug messages in news stories
and then gaining additional advertising space as a consequence.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lee Goldberg, executive producer of CBS's ``Martial
Law,'' said he feels so strongly about the evils of drugs that he
isn't bothered by the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Though he said he has not been asked to change a script by any
government agency, Goldberg said that ``I don't see a downside to
putting in a show the negative effects of heroin or cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government were putting a different message in, like
`You should sign up for military service, go join ROTC,' I could
see people getting up in arms,'' he added. ``But it's hard to get
in a lather about putting on antidrug messages.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the government's role on such entertainment programs
as NBC's ``ER,'' Fox's ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' and the WB's
``Smart Guy.'' The networks have insisted that they never
surrendered creative control of such shows to the government.
</P>
<P>
   However, the networks did allow the White House drug policy
office to review scripts on those and other shows and to suggest
ways they could accurately depict drug abuse. The networks entered
into a deal whereby programs containing antidrug content could be
used to reduce the number of public service announcements networks
are required by law to air. The freed-up ad time could then be sold
at higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement between the networks and the government, first
reported in the online magazine Salon, attracted wide media
attention. It was the No. 2 story on ABC's ``World News Tonight''
on Thursday, and stories appeared Friday in most major daily
newspapers. In addition, the arrangement was the subject of lively
debate on CNN's ``TalkBack Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on that program, White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey
insisted ``there is zero government approval on how the shows are
produced and run,'' adding that his office is ``not involved in the
decisions the creative community makes.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Fischoff, a professor of media psychology at California
State University in Los Angeles who formerly wrote for television,
suggested the eagerness to cooperate by the TV industry, which is
often at loggerheads with Washington, may be a preemptive act
designed to ward off federal laws or regulations governing other
aspects of program content.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have people breathing down their necks about sex and
violence,'' he said. ``They have fought tooth-and-nail on sex and
violence, but their money is not in drugs. They can give the drug
thing away. They draw lines elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts wondered if the recent spate of mergers and
acquisitions involving television networks played a role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to draw those direct kinds of lines, but the
networks are in businesses that are heavily regulated,'' said
Robins, of TV Guide. ``They want Washington on their side, they're
looking for relief with the FCC. It doesn't hurt them to work
hand-in-glove with the government.''

`SUPERNOVA': A BUBBLE-HEADED MONSTER OF A MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes are at the end of the review) 
(lh) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A funny thing happened to ``Supernova'' on its way to the
theaters. Its director abandoned ship and was replaced by a
phantom.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad that the director could not have been joined by the
stars, good actors like James Spader, Angela Bassett and Lou
Diamond Phillips, who are trapped aboard this vehicle in the
deepest reaches of outer space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supernova'' demonstrates that when a space adventure is
combined with a soap opera and sufficient scientific mumbo jumbo
about explosive ninth-dimensional matter encased in a
three-dimensional shell, sufficient critical mass is achieved to
create a bubble-headed monster of a movie.
</P>
<P>
   The director of record is the nonexistent Thomas Lee, a name
assigned after Walter Hill, whose directing credits include ``Hard
Times'' and ``48 Hours'' and whose producing credits include
``Aliens'' and ``Aliens 3,'' distanced himself from the project.
</P>
<P>
   Light on originality and low on suspense, though high on design
and special effects, ``Supernova'' belongs to the class of
futuristic space films that indicate that a tough, suspicious
customs officer with a tendency to bar imports at the door should
be part of every craft that explores the galaxy and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Asking its audience to wonder on the one hand whether its young
lovers will be allowed to breed and whether the chief medical
officer will warm to the advances of the new co-pilot,
``Supernova'' also poses a question about the future of Earth after
a villain from a supposedly abandoned moon comes aboard with some
unusual cargo and begins to renew acquaintance and foment evil.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest clone of the species that began with ``Alien'' in
1979, the craft in question is the medical rescue vessel
Nightingale 229, cruising space in the 22nd century while two of
its medical technicians, Yerzy and Danika (Phillips and Robin
Tunney) fornicate; the computer engineer, Benj (Wilson Cruz) plays
chess with his true love, the ship's computer, Sweetie (Vanessa
Marshall), and the captain (Robert Forster) works on his doctorate
in anthropology, an analysis of 20th-century television cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   New aboard ship is its co-pilot, Nick Vanzant (James Spader), a
recovering narcotics addict who is attracted to the chief medical
officer, Kaela Evers (Ms. Bassett), whose coolness toward him comes
from the heart hardened by Karl Larson, a long-ago lover who
suffered from a similar addiction.
</P>
<P>
   The plot thickens into overused sludge 12 days into the ship's
mission, when the Nightingale receives a distress signal from a
rogue moon in unmapped space 3,432 light years away.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, for most moviegoers, it's familiar territory.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   `SUPERNOVA'
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   With: James Spader (Nick Vanzant), Angela Bassett (Kaela Evers),
Robert Forster (A.J. Marley), Lou Diamond Phillips (Yerzy
Penalosa), Vanessa Marshall (Sweetie), Peter Facinelli (Karl
Larson), Robin Tunney (Danika Lund) and Wilson Cruz (Benj
Sotomejor).
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 91 minutes. &QL;

includes simulated sex, nudity, amputation, bloody violence and a
couple of words of familiar profanity and street language.

CONFERENCE LOOKS BACK ON DPS, PEOPLE WHO WILLED THEMSELVES TO LOOK
FORWARD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Austria, Poland, Fla., N.Y.)   By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Edmund Goldenberg looked up one spring
afternoon in 1945 and finally saw American soldiers, not Germans,
perched on tanks outside the Ebensee concentration camp in Austria,
he was a fleshless shadow of the vigorous young man he had been
before the war.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 10 inches, he weighed 100 pounds, so weak and
emaciated he required a two-week hospital stay. Worse than the
physical pain was his unrelievable sorrow. His parents, Polish Jews
from Krakow, were dead, his father shot, his mother gassed. Of a
family of 300 uncles, aunts and cousins, only 26 emerged from the
war alive, he learned later.
</P>
<P>
   Yet within weeks, he was not only sheltered and regularly fed in
a refugee camp, but he was working again as a doctor, for which he
had been trained, ministering to other undernourished and heartsick
survivors of Ebensee in a makeshift hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``You resume the spirit for life,'' Goldenberg said. ``This is
biologically necessary. You have to start living or you perish. We
had people who emotionally or mentally perished.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Goldenberg, more than 230,000 European Jews who survived
the concentration camps, or hid out during the war or fled to the
Soviet Union, found themselves after the Allied victory shorn of
homes and families, with no country ready to take them. Along with
more than a million non-Jews uprooted by the war or fleeing
communist control in Eastern Europe, they became known as displaced
persons. For a period that lasted six years for many of them, the
Jewish refugees were housed in more than 90 camps in Germany and
Austria, sometimes, as in the Bergen-Belsen camp, in former German
military barracks near the grounds of a concentration camp.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in those crowded, jostling refugee camps, most of the
displaced people found the will to go on, to prepare themselves for
lives in the countries to which they would eventually be admitted.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the DP's, as they were called, is one that is
little remembered today, but it is a remarkable chapter of the
Holocaust era and is the subject of a three-day conference that
began here on Friday night: ``Life Reborn: Jewish Displaced Persons
1945-1951.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel, sponsored by
the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, has registered 840 people,
including onetime refugees who have not seen each other for half a
century, and scores of graying men and women who were born in the
camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people think that once you got liberated that was it,
you were free, you were happy,'' said Goldenberg, now 82 and still
practicing, among nursing home residents in Binghamton, N.Y. ``Not
so. You never forget it. The DP camp was a slow revolution of
faith. The DP camp was trying to re-establish our life, whatever
was left.''
</P>
<P>
   Testimony at the conference and the artifacts and photographs at
concurrent exhibits at the Holocaust museum and the B'nai B'rith
Klutznick National Jewish Museum will show that the displaced
people, while living on hardtack, Spam and other rations, were able
to recreate communities out of the shreds of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   They found lovers _ sometimes ill-fitting matches with whom they
shared little but horrible memories _ so they could establish
families to replace those they had lost. Among the displays is a
white wedding dress that Lily Friedman, a resident of
Bergen-Belsen, patched together out of a German airman's nylon
parachute and then passed along to 17 other women for their
weddings.
</P>
<P>
   On their own initiative the DPs set up schools and nursery
schools. In the Bergen-Belsen camp, where the grounds held the
corpses of more than 60,000 Jews, 2,000 children were born from
1945 through 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Relief agencies provided assistance and taught trades like
carpentry and tailoring. But the DP's refused to be passive and in
the chaotic economy of the time, many smuggled contraband
cigarettes and chocolate across porous Allied occupied zones to
earn money they would need on their journeys to new lands.
</P>
<P>
   Though many had yet to forgive God for what he had permitted to
happen, they held prayer services and Passover seders. From more
destitute Germans, they bought used cameras to photograph their new
children and porcelain figurines to add a touch of beauty to their
lives. Among compatriots who understood in their marrow the anguish
they had been through, they made friends that often substituted for
family.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about the Holocaust, the survivor is looked down
upon as a victim,'' said Rositta Ehrlich Kenigsberg of North Miami,
Fla., who was born in the Bindermichel camp in Austria. ``This is
the time when the survivors were in charge of their own fate. In
the aftermath of the Holocaust, to pick up all the pieces and bring
life into a world when they witnessed only death, is quite a great
act of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust museum features evidence of the craving to return
to a semblance of normal life, to reclaim personal and occupational
dignity. Goldenberg's wood stethoscope, the boxing gloves Abraham
Malnik used in camp matches, a child's fur coat made for Miriam
Levitt _ now a Scarsdale pediatrician _ by a father who wanted to
keep his daughter warm on the journey to America, a poster
advertising a performance by an operatic troupe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from camp to camp and gave concerts to people who
didn't know what opera was,'' said Rena Berliner, who was able to
sing operatic and Yiddish songs after losing her entire family
except for her mother, who hid out with her. ``They were absolutely
enthralled, in seventh heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After losing everybody, people still had a will to live,''
said Mrs. Berliner, now a 74-year-old grandmother in Queens County,
N.Y. ``That doesn't mean I have forgotten. I live with it everyday
of my life. I think of my sister. I mourn my father. But life goes
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The camps for those displaced by the war were hardly idyllic,
especially in the early months. Some of the residents were penned
behind barbed wire and needed passes to leave, as though they had
committed crimes. In many cases, they were mixed in with the
Baltics, Poles and Hungarians who had helped the Germans round up
and slaughter Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. George S. Patton referred to ``the Jewish type of DP'' as a
``subhuman species.''
</P>
<P>
   The DP's also had excruciating waits for resettlement. For
political reasons, the British made it hard for them to get into
Palestine, and many in the U.S. Congress were reluctant to relax
immigration quotas if it meant taking in penniless Jewish families.
</P>
<P>
   The children who were born in the DP camps now speak of the era
as a heroic time, a sharp contrast to the degradation and
powerlessness their parents experienced during the war. Menachem Z.
Rosensaft's parents, Josef and Hadassah Bimko Rosensaft, were
leaders of Bergen-Belsen, drove hard bargains with the British
about their treatment of the refugees and made sure 100 war orphans
were settled in Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's remarkable because they were no longer willing to be a
victim for one moment more than necessary,'' said Rosensaft, a
Manhattan lawyer who was born in Bergen-Belsen in 1948 and is one
of the conference organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Dorit Mandelbaum, a Manhattan painter whose parents, Auschwitz
survivors, gave birth to her in the Landsberg camp near Munichin
1946, has a whimsically bittersweet way of looking back at her
family's refugee experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DP camps,'' she said, ``were the last Jewish shtetls in
Europe.''

SPANISH JUDGE WANTS NEW TEST TO ASSESS PINOCHET'S FITNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By AL GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ The Spanish judge behind efforts to try Gen.
Augusto Pinochet for human rights abuses asked Britain on Friday
for a second medical examination of the former Chilean dictator to
determine if earlier tests erred in finding him unfit to stand
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Baltasar Garzon, in a written opinion, appealed to
Home Secretary Jack Straw, who announced Tuesday that he was
inclined to release Pinochet, 84, after nearly 15 months of house
arrest in Britain, because four British doctors recently deemed him
unfit for trial.
</P>
<P>
   The results of that examination, conducted Jan. 5, were released
only to the British government and general's defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon said that two forensic doctors appointed by his Madrid
court should take part in the new examination and that his court
should get the results of both tests. Under Spanish law, Pinochet
could be excused from trial only if he were mentally impaired and
could not understand the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It constitutes a universal negative precedent,'' the judge
warned the British government, ``to avoid a criminal proceeding for
unknown medical reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Straw has set a deadline of Tuesday to receive comments from
Spain and other parties to the case. But in a fresh sign of the
political overtones of the proceedings, the Spanish government said
it might not send Garzon's petition through diplomatic channels to
London if it does not contain new elements for the case.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Abel Matutes said Friday that the judge's
document had arrived at his ministry, but he promised only that it
would be studied over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's conservative government has publicly maintained
neutrality in the case, which has put relations with Chile under
strain. But many advocates of trying Pinochet for rights abuses
during his 1973-90 military rule say that Madrid has been working
behind the scenes to undercut Garzon's effort.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Joan Garces, a Spanish lawyer representing victims of repression
in Chile, expressed confidence that Garzon's petition would reach
London by next week's deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The Chilean government has readied a military jet to whisk
Pinochet home to Chile if Straw sets him free.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon wrote that physical impairment and old age would not be
sufficient grounds for exclusion from trial. He cited the cases of
Klaus Barbie, a Gestapo official in occupied France, and the French
Nazi collaborator Maurice Papon, who were tried and convicted of
war crimes despite their advanced ages and physical ailments.
</P>
<P>
   England's highest court, the Law Lords of the House of Lords,
has ruled that Pinochet is not immune from prosecution for acts
committed while he was a head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon indicted Pinochet in December 1998, after his arrest on
Oct. 16, 1988, on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture in
connection with the killing or disappearance of more than 3,000
people. But Britain's highest court later limited the charges to 35
counts of torture and conspiracy to torture alleged to have
occurred after 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon's petition said it was ``repugnant'' to consider the
release of Pinochet on humanitarian grounds without knowing his
medical condition.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge acknowledged the power of the Home Office to make
what he termed a ``political decision'' to end the extradition
proceeding. ``This seems to be the last step of this troubled
extradition process,'' he said.

HBO'S `SOPRANOS' RETURNS AMID A CHORUS OF HYPE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by SOPRANOS-THE FAMILY) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The year is barely 2 weeks old, and already HBO's gangster saga
``The Sopranos'' is an early candidate for Hype of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the Entertainment Weekly and TV Guide cover stories
that make it a candidate _ those you expect. It's not the features
in magazines such as Vanity Fair and Mirabella _ you expect those,
too.
</P>
<P>
   But the ad in The New Yorker, with four of the esteemed
magazine's cartoonists contributing ``Sopranos-''themed cartoons _
that you don't expect.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the billboards, the Web site, the CD, and the
second-season premiere party that drew 1,800 guests _ including
Christopher Walken and Stephen King _ in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   All this for a show that has aired only 13 original episodes,
all of them months ago, on a pay-cable service that only 25 percent
of TV viewers subscribe to. HBO has spent a good part of this month
making a fuss again, airing back-to-back-to-back repeat episodes as
a refresher course leading up to ``The Sopranos''' second-season
premiere at 8 p.m. CST Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Which might leave the HBO-less hordes among us _ who include me
_ wondering what all the fuss is about. Fortunately, through the
magic of TV-savvy colleagues who do subscribe to HBO, I've been
able to take a crash course in ``The Sopranos''' first season, as
well as get a sneak peek at a few of the second season's new
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   And now I understand. And then again, I don't.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't subscribe to HBO, you probably know the basic
premise behind ``The Sopranos,'' at least if you care about TV.
Here's a quick primer: Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), the brains
behind a New Jersey crime family, begins passing out from anxiety
attacks. So he reluctantly enlists the services of a psychiatrist
(Lorraine Bracco) who shares his ethnic heritage. This doesn't
necessarily sit well with Tony's colleagues, but when you get a
look at his life, you sympathize: His friends, his enemies, his
work and his family _ especially his manipulative mother (Nancy
Marchand) would be enough to send anyone into therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The show can be addictive, especially when viewed in several
episodes back-to-back. It can be tremendously funny _ my favorite
moment came when a topless dancer, having just overheard a bit of
bad news, says, ``I'll always remember where I was at this
moment,'' which happens to be a, er, ``gentleman's lounge'' called
the Bada-Bing Club.
</P>
<P>
   And it can be unpredictable _ its characters are volatile, and
often a scene will be so innocuous that it will lull you to
distraction, only to erupt in violence. It's also often lauded for
its authenticity _ HBO even runs a promo in which real-life crime
figures wonder whether the inspiration for ``The Sopranos'''
plotlines comes from an inside source.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was the best show of 1999, as both of Entertainment
Weekly's TV critics and many others called it, is up for debate. If
anything, it earns the honor by default, as former TV giants such
as ``ER'' and ``NYPD Blue'' begin to wheeze and critical faves such
as ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' vanish. Because ``The
Sopranos'' is not without its problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' is derivative, and gleefully honest about it,
boldly quoting ``The Godfather'' saga, ``GoodFellas'' and
``Scarface.'' But it's also derivative in ways you might miss: The
upper-class suburb where the Soprano family seems out of place,
calling to mind ``The Beverly Hillbillies''; Tony's frustrations
and longing for the old ways is reminiscent of Hank Hill of ``King
of the Hill.'' The show has a whiff of ``The Addams Family'' about
it as well, especially with Robert Iler's Pugsley-esque performance
as Tony's son. And like much of HBO's original programming, ``The
Sopranos'' has a little too much of a ``We're this sexy, violent
and foul-mouthed because we can be'' feel about it.
</P>
<P>
   The characters are what makes ``The Sopranos'' work, especially
Tony, whom Gandolfini portrays with sly smiles and menacing
authority, and his mother, played by ``Lou Grant's'' Marchand as
someone who would drive anyone up a wall _ but also with just
enough ambiguity to make you wonder if her actions are intentional.
Tony's Uncle Junior (Dominic Chianese), his rival for control of
the family, and his ambitious screw-up nephew Christopher (Michael
Imperioli) are also characters who keep you coming back, but that's
more because of Chianese's and Imperioli's performances than any
compelling plotlines or wildly original writing. Edie Falco, who
won an Emmy as Tony's frustrated wife, is also good, but her role
often requires her to react more than act and comes off a little
underwritten.
</P>
<P>
   The writing flaws could be a problem with the new season,
although it's difficult to tell from the handful of tapes that HBO
sent to the Star-Telegram. It begins beautifully, with a montage
set to Frank Sinatra's ``It Was a Very Good Year'' updating us on
all of the series' characters _ and with a key mystery from Season
One solved within minutes. But when Aida Turturro shows up as
Tony's mooch of a sister, who's possibly even more manipulative
than their mother, the series threatens to become a family saga of
the wrong kind.
</P>
<P>
   You can't judge a show's season by a couple of episodes, though,
and perhaps the writers have something more interesting in store
for the Turturro plotline. The series' potential for a quick
flameout looks high, however, thanks in large part to all the hype
surrounding it. It's often good, and if you already have HBO, it's
a reason to be glad. But if you don't have HBO, missing ``The
Sopranos'' is no reason for you to cry into your baked ziti.

YES, `THE SIMPSONS' HAS BEEN TELLING US TO NOT HAVE A COW FOR A

<P>
   The hit television show ``The Simpsons'' has celebrated its
10-year anniversary as one of the most irreverent ... (editor's
note: blah blah blah; who cares, let's get to the funny stuff) _
</P>
<P>
   OK, OK. But first I need to tell readers that ``The Simpsons,''
which began as a series of short animated skits in 1987 and had its
nonseries debut as a Christmas special in 1989, has become one of
America's most beloved (editor's note: How cliche; you stink, get

 &HT;    Bush improving during debates
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ Six weeks and six debates ago, Gov. George W. Bush
looked like a back-of-the-classroom kid hiding from the teacher and
trying to say as little as possible when discovered.
</P>
<P>
   At that first debate in New Hampshire in early December, Bush,
smirkingly confident by nature, spoke only when spoken to and
rarely used all his allotted time in offering up stump-speech sound
bites as answers.
</P>
<P>
   But by last Monday's debate in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Bush was
more like the hyperactive kid the teacher has trouble controlling,
constantly looking for ways to get as much attention as possible in
a six-man egofest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm listening, George,'' candidate Steve Forbes said after
challenging Bush to ``pledge'' not ``hedge'' on an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Bush snapped back scoldingly. ``You're interrupting.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the GOP combatants head today to a TV studio here for
their seventh debate, political scientists around the country say
Bush has grown into the format.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, he looked like a scared schoolboy,'' said
University of Texas government professor Bruce Buchanan. ``He is,
at least, relaxed now. He has not deviated from his standard
pronouncements, but he seems more comfortable in his skin.''
</P>
<P>
   After drawing criticism for skipping some early presidential
debates, Bush (who had only one debate in each of his two
gubernatorial races) has become more willing to mix it up and run
the risk of popping off inappropriately. Sometimes the mouth takes
him where he might not have planned to go, such as last week's
promise to cut taxes, ``so help me God.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has shown a penchant for rambling in search of a precise
answer when a questioner injects a new topic. In Grand Rapids,
responding to a question about ``racial profiling'' by police, Bush
took a relatively long time to go a relatively short distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants racial profiling to take place in any state,'' he
began as he wound his way to the conclusion that ``This is a nation
where all people are created equal.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the occasional verbal walkabout, experts say Bush has
benefitted from the debates. On Friday, after a town-square
campaign swing in Glenwood, Iowa, Bush was asked what viewers may
have learned about him in the debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've learned I've got a couple of nice red ties,'' he
joked.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aide Karen Hughes said her boss' personality ``is showing
more and more each time'' he debates. The Bush personality includes
a wise-guy mode, in the more non-pejorative sense of the term. In
Michigan, the increasingly-famous Bush smirk showed up as an
involuntary sign that he didn't think much of a panelist's question
about the racist comments of Atlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought for a minute you were going to bring up the Sosa
trade,'' Bush said dismissively, referring to another debate when
he joked that the biggest mistake he had made was approving the
Texas Rangers' trade of Sammy Sosa, who later became one of
baseball's greatest sluggers.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Linda Fowler of Dartmouth's Rockefeller Center for
Public Policy and Civic Leadership said Bush seems to have finally
hit on a package that works.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems more in control of what he is saying,'' she said.
``He is still giving a canned speech, but it doesn't sound quite so
canned.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler gives Forbes the prize for ``staying on message'' and
credits Arizona Sen. John McCain for getting less ``fidgety.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Iowa political scientist Arthur Miller said Bush
has cleared the lowest of hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was so concerned that he was just going to fall on
his face and get up there and babble and not really have any
substance to him,'' said Miller. ``I think people have learned that
he didn't do that. On the other hand, I don't think he has really
risen above the other contenders who are on the stage with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman for top challengers McCain and Forbes say Bush has
improved since the first debate. Forbes aide Greg Mueller gives
Bush credit for looking ``a lot calmer.'' McCain spokesman Dan
Schnur said Bush has figured out the format.
</P>
<P>
   ``It begs the question of why his handlers were so reluctant to
let him debate early on,'' said Schnur, diagnosing a case of
``frontrunner-itis.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the debates have appeared on a patchwork of local
stations and cable, nobody has a clear handle on who has been
watching. A survey by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the
University of Pennsylvania found that 38 percent of New Hampshire
respondents and 26 percent of those questioned in Iowa had watched
at least one debate. Nationwide, only 15 percent said they had
watched any.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to tradition says there are usually two major
debates in Iowa and two in New Hampshire. But in 1988, eventual
nominee Michael Dukakis participated in 21 during the primary
season.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a less-wired world then and few of the debates were
televised anywhere. Now, with the increase in cable outlets, almost
any debate can find a TV home.

A PRESBYTERIAN'S ADVICE: LOOK FOR THE ELUSIVE PRESENCE OF GOD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt., Switzerland)   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words, coming from many people, would be a command, and
not necessarily a friendly one. But when spoken this week by
Frederick Buechner, a Presbyterian minister widely known as the
author of more than 30 works of fiction and non-fiction, they came
across as both advice and a statement of principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay attention to what happens to you,'' he said, in an
interview in New York this week. ``It's so easy not to do that, so
easy to go through life on auto-pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   Buechner (pronounced BEEK-ner) was responding to a question he
had just been asked: what does it mean to write from a religious
perspective?
</P>
<P>
   He was sitting in an office at the Episcopal Church Center, a
building housing the denomination's headquarters, where he was to
give a reading from his latest memoir, ``The Eyes of the Heart''
(HarperCollins, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   To write from that perspective, he said, does not mean
``pitching propaganda,'' as some people might fear. Instead, he
said, it means keeping one's eyes open for ``the elusive presence
of the holiness of God.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate, Buechner recalled an experience he had about two
decades ago, when one of his three daughters was ill and he was
feeling deeply anxious. He was sitting in his car by the roadside
in a Vermont town, he said, when another car swung into view and
sped past him. As he looked up, he caught sight of its license
plate, which spelled out the word ``Trust.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't been paying attention, I wouldn't have noticed
it,'' Buechner said. ``Of all the words in the lexicon, that was
the one I needed to hear. Trust your daughter, trust yourself,
trust God.''
</P>
<P>
   Much later, after he had written about that epiphanic moment in
one of his books, he opened the door of his Vermont home to a
stranger who had come knocking. It was the driver of the passing
car, come to give Buechner his old license plate. The man worked in
a bank's trust office.
</P>
<P>
   Buechner is a tallish, slender man, with a high forehead and a
baritone voice. His historical novel ``Godric,'' about an early
English saint, was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   His most recent book, from which he read aloud to the audience
at the Episcopal center, is an excursion through personal and
family memories, and a meditation on death as part of life. He
offers recollections of his friend the poet James Merrill, his
mother, his brother and others.
</P>
<P>
   But a central character is his long-dead maternal grandmother,
known in his family as ``Naya,'' who appears in the book's very
first sentence, when Buechner invites her into a conversation as he
sits in his study, a part of his house he calls the Magic Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   He asks her about death: ``You've already set sail. What can you
tell me about it?'' She responds that she considers it misleading
to speak of people as having passed away. ``It is the world that
passes away,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Buechner said he did not grow up in a
religious environment, which makes his journey an anomaly in his
family context. Moreover, he could point to no single conversion
experience.
</P>
<P>
   But there were formative moments, like the one in 1953, when he
was a young writer in Manhattan and often attending Madison Avenue
Presbyterian Church, to hear the preaching of the Rev. George
Buttrick.
</P>
<P>
   One Sunday, Buttrick used the news of Britain's coronation of
Queen Elizabeth II as a starting point from which to say that in
the Gospels, Jesus is in effect offered the crown of worldly rule
by Satan and rejects the temptation. Yet, Buttrick said (as
Buechner recalled), Jesus is continually crowned in the hearts of
believers, ``amidst confession, and tears and great laughter.'' The
phrase struck Buechner so deeply he can quote it verbatim half a
century later.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Eyes of the Heart,'' he recalls other encounters with
unexpected words. One occurred in Switzerland, where he and his
wife were visiting their grown daughter and her children. On a
family hike in the Alps, they came across a picturesque cowshed,
where a previous visitor had scrawled something. Buechner took a
closer look at the graffitti, wondering if it would be ``a Swiss
version of the crudities'' one sees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But instead the words declared (in German), ``God is love and
life,'' a phrase that seemed, he writes, as ``serene and
transcendent as the snow-capped mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust says the crumpled green license plate that hangs in my
office,'' he writes in his memoir. ``Trust what? Trust that it is
worth scratching on the wall that God is Life and Love because, all
appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, it may be true. Trust
that if God is anywhere, God is here, which means there is no
telling where God may turn up next _ around what sudden bend of the
path if you happen to have your eyes and ears open, your wits about
you, in what odd small moments, almost too foolish to tell.''

   SCOTUS-ABORTION (Washington) _ Adding an abortion case to its
docket for the first time in eight years, the Supreme Court agrees
to decide whether a Nebraska law banning a procedure the state
calls ``partial birth abortion'' is constitutional. The justices
plan to hear the case in April and decide it by early summer. The
election-year ruling could have a substantial impact on the
fractious politics of abortion, although it may not resolve
questions about all the similar, but differently worded,
prohibitions that 30 states have adopted in recent years. By Linda

   RUSSIA-SECURITY (Moscow) _ Underscoring its darkening view of
the West, the Kremlin issues a new national security strategy that
inveighs against an expansionist Europe and United States and
contemplates the use of nuclear weapons in war ``if all other means
of resolving the crisis have been exhausted.'' By Michael Wines.

   BRADLEY-IMAGE (Undated) _ In the race for the Democratic
presidential nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley has tried to cast
himself as his party's gruff truth-teller. But in style as well as
substance, Bradley can be curt and uncommunicative. He sometimes
ignores questions he considers silly or intrusive. Former
colleagues have said he is aloof. To his supporters, traits like
these are part and parcel of what make Bradley a different kind of
politician. But to the undecided voters who are vital to his
success, Bradley runs the risk of being viewed as simply surly. By

   STOCKS-FAST-TRADES (New York) _ Investing in the stock market
for the long term, the strategy that has made the most sense and
the most money for people over the years, is all but dead. And new
numbers show the betting has become faster and more furious there
than at any time since the 1920s. Last year, investors held stocks
for just over eight months on average, well short of the two years
that was typical a decade ago. The figures confirm what some market
analysts have suspected for some time: the rapid-fire trading
mentality of a very small group of hyperactive investors known as
daytraders has altered the behavior of large numbers of investors
and is seeping into the overall market. The consequences are large,
since studies show that investors who trade frequently get lower
returns and heavy trading contributes to wide swings in the market.

JUSTICES TO DECIDE BOY SCOUT BAN ON HOMOSEXUAL LEADERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to decide
whether the Boy Scouts have a constitutional right to bar
homosexuals from becoming troop leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts of America, saying its goal is to impart moral
values to youngsters, argues that its First Amendment rights to
speak and associate freely would be stripped away if it were
required to hire a known homosexual to lead a group of boys.
</P>
<P>
   But James Dale, an assistant Scoutmaster who was fired after
disclosing his homosexuality, counters that the Boy Scouts have no
constitutional right to exclude gays and must abide by a New Jersey
law that bans job discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's highest court ruled in Dale's favor in August,
prompting the Scouts to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to render their decision in the case,
Boy Scouts of America vs. Dale, by July.
</P>
<P>
   The Girl Scouts are not a party to this case.
</P>
<P>
   Under a policy the Boy Scouts have followed since at least 1978,
no boy or man can be admitted to Scouting, or remain a Scout or
leader, if he is an ``avowed homosexual.'' The policy regards
homosexuality as morally wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Dale had been in Scouting for 12 years, rising to the rank of
Eagle Scout and becoming an assistant scoutmaster in New Jersey. He
was fired in 1990 after he publicly declared while a student at
Rutgers University that he was gay. He served as co-president of
the school's Lesbian/Gay Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Dale then sued the Boy Scouts, alleging illegal discrimination.
The trial court, however, threw out his case, ruling that the
organization had a First Amendment right to express its views about
homosexuality by dismissing him.
</P>
<P>
   But the state Supreme Court resurrected Dale's lawsuit, saying
the New Jersey law barring the Scouts from firing gays did not
interfere with the group's right to speak out against
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts, in its successful request that the U.S. Supreme
Court hear its appeal, argued that its freedom to speak on moral
issues and advance that message through association ``involves
constitutional rights at the heart of our free society.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization, in its legal brief to the justices, conceded
that many people might consider its blanket exclusion of
homosexuals to be evil but argued that the Constitution protects
even unpopular views and their expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``These principles of freedom of speech and freedom of
association are essential to preserving what many call `civil
society' _ the network of private institutions, societies and
congregations between the individual and state that enable free
people to work together for common ends,'' wrote the Scout's
attorney, George Davidson of New York City. ``These ends may
include moral beliefs that are controversial in society at large.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate his point about freedom of association, Davidson
said no one would object if the Scouts rejected a Ku Klux Klansman
to be a scoutmaster because having such a leader would interfere
with the group's message of racial harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``In analogous contexts, churches and synagogues have an
absolute right to choose their own ministers and rabbis; political
parties have the right to select their own leaders,'' the lawyer
added. ``Expressive associations enjoy a comparable protection to
select their leaders without governmental interference.''.
</P>
<P>
   Countering the Scouts, Dale's attorney urged the justices in
vain not to hear the group's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney, Evan Wolfson, argued that the Boy Scouts, despite
its purported message of morality, had no right to fire Dale simply
because he acknowledged his homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations are free to fire people for what they advocate but
not for who they are, added Wolfson, a lawyer with the gay-rights
group Lambda Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Treating a gay person's simple honesty and openness about his
or her identity as inherently disqualifying `advocacy' that removes
him or her from the protections of an anti-discrimination law _ let
alone inferring from such identity any particular viewpoint _
typifies the overbroad assumptions, stereotypical notions and
`sexual stereotyping'' that the Supreme Court has rejected as
illegal in prior civil-rights cases, Wolfson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cannot be that Jews, Catholics, Puerto Ricans, lesbians and
gay men, or others whose identity may initially go unnoticed, shed
all protection _ or can have viewpoints or positions ascribed to
them and then used with impunity as the basis for discrimination _
the moment they identify themselves,'' the lawyer added.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson also argued that the Scout's purported stand against
homosexuality is belied by the group's appeal to all young men and
its welcoming as sponsors many religious, civic and corporate
groups that undoubtedly support the rights of homosexuals, Wolfson
said.

 &HT;    Manhiem to purchase competitor for $1 billion
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Manheim Auctions will pay $1 billion in cash to buy a competitor
in a deal that gives the Atlanta-based company nearly 40 percent of
the U.S. sites for auto auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Manheim is already the nation's largest auto auctioneer, with 67
sites in the United States. But the company will extend its reach
through the purchase of ADT Automotive, a unit of Tyco
International. It owns 28 sites.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of ADT, Manheim will own 95 of the 260 auto
auction sites in the country. Many of ADT's sites represent new
markets for Manheim. Among them are Albuquerque, Honolulu and
Colorado Springs. Manheim also operates auto auctions in Canada and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``ADT is an excellent operator,'' said Hal Logan, Manheim's
senior vice president of marketing. ``It gives us a lot of new,
desirable locations.''
</P>
<P>
   Manheim is a unit of privately held Cox Enterprises, which also
owns the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Both auction companies sell used cars wholesale, primarily to
dealers, not consumers. The vehicles usually come from rental
fleets, manufacturers, financial companies or other dealers. ADT
does conduct some retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very glamorous, but it's a very important part of the
business,'' said Sheldon Sandler, owner of Bel Air Partners, a
Princeton, N.J.-based adviser to auto dealers. ``Every dealer uses
these services either to find access to used cars they want to get
or to get rid of cars when they have too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Manheim has been moving into the Internet. The
company owns a stake in AutoTrader.com, a leading consumer used-car
sales site with about 1.25 million listings. Manheim Online, which
provides wholesale listings and other services for dealers,
reported selling $625 million worth of cars last year. That's up
sharply from the $58 million it sold online three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect them to be an even more aggressive retail
marketer over the Internet,'' said Chris Denove, director of
consulting operations for J.D. Power &AMP; Associates in Agoura Hills,
Calif. ``They're becoming an increasingly vital link between buyers
and sellers of used vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   While growing rapidly, online sales represent a tiny part of
Manheim's overall business. The company's overall revenue was $1.4
billion. It sold 6.5 million cars at auction valued at $36 billion
in 1998. ADT sold 2.3 million cars in 1999. Tyco does not break out
sales figures for ADT.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco International is the world's largest manufacturer of
electrical and electronic components, including undersea
telecommunications systems. It is based in Hamilton, Bermuda, and
has projected sales of $26 billion for this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``ADT Automotive is an excellent business but one that does not
directly fit with our four key segments,'' said Dennis Kozlowski,
Tyco's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Manheim owns three auto auctions in metro Atlanta, and ADT owns
Southern States auto auction in Newnan.
</P>
<P>
   The sale is subject to regulatory review. It will generate a
one-time gain of $300 million for Tyco, company officials said.
Tyco had acquired ADT Automotive in its 1997 purchase of ADT Ltd.,
the security systems maker. On Friday, Tyco International shares
rose 18 3/4 cents to $34.56 1/4.

 &HT;    King Center set to award Coke, Winfrey
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tonight, when the King Center honors the Coca-Cola Co., it will
do so with J. Paul Austin in mind, not the recent controversy
embroiling the beverage company.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Ivester, chairman and CEO of the company, and Oprah
Winfrey will receive the King Center's ``Salute to Greatness''
awards.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Hill, co-chair of tonight's dinner and the former chairman
of the board of the King Center, said award recipients are chosen
based on their King-like works.
</P>
<P>
   But while Coke is being honored for what Hill and the Center say
are efforts to promote diversity, the company is being sued over
allegations of systematic discrimination against blacks in pay,
promotions and performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   Eight plaintiffs are seeking class action status to represent
more than 2,000 black, salaried employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are current and former Coca-Cola employees.
</P>
<P>
   A federal suit was filed in April, and a decision on class
certification by the federal judge is still months away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ambassador Young (the dinner's other co-chair) and I decided
long ago that in 2000 Coke would be honored because of what J. Paul
Austin did,'' said Hill. ``This is a tribute to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill said that Austin, the former chairman and CEO of Coca-Cola,
played a huge moral, supportive and financial role during the early
planning stages of the King Center. ``The driving influence was the
unique partnership and contribution Austin provided Mrs. King,''
said Hill. ``And they have, until this suit, made enormous
contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill admitted that during recent meetings, the issue of the
lawsuit did come up, although there was never any discussion to
change anything.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he and Young also met with civil rights leaders to
discuss the Center's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came up in a natural context with all of the publicity
involving the suit,'' said Hill. ``We are very sensitive to that.
But this selection was made before all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke and Winfrey will receive their awards at an 8 p.m. dinner
at the Hyatt Regency.

 &HT;    Retailing heavyweights on way to N.Y. for national show
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Metro Atlanta retailers will be heading to New York
City next week to join counterparts from across the nation for the
industry's largest trade convention.
</P>
<P>
   Rich's Chairman and Chief Executive Arnie Orlick, Ahold USA
President and CEO Robert G. Tobin and Haverty Furniture Chairman
Rawson Haverty will be among the thousands of department store and
specialty retail executives dissecting the latest trends and issues
at the National Retail Federation's 89th annual convention and
exposition.
</P>
<P>
   They'll rub elbows with other such notables as Jay Walker,
founder of Priceline.com, and J. Daniel Nordstrom, a co-president
of Nordstrom. The convention will be held at the Jacob Javits
Convention Center from Sunday to Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the topics include how retailers are dealing with
technological advances that are transforming the industry. Orlick
will be on a panel discussing the strategic importance of fashion
accessories to retailers' bottom lines. Scarves, jewelry, purses
and other accessories typically bring in the highest gross margins
in store sales and play an important role in overall profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of technology companies will demonstrate the wares that
are often used behind the scenes in retailing. For instance,
Motorola plans to tout the importance of its two-way radios used
for security or customer service in such stores as the Gap and in
malls, including Underground Atlanta.

DEBIT-CARD DRAWBACK: CASH PLACED ON HOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CAROL BENFELL   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press-Democrat   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Use of a debit card, a credit-card
look-alike that pulls money from your checking account, could leave
you with bouncing checks even though there is plenty of money in
your account.
</P>
<P>
   Without a card-holder's knowledge, some merchants who accept a
debit card can direct your bank or credit union to hold an amount
greater than the actual purchase from your checking or savings
account and block your use of the money for up to three days.
</P>
<P>
   This little-known practice, which is perfectly legal and is
sometimes called ``blocking,'' happens most often at the gas pump
but can occur whenever you run a debit card through a machine
before you know how much you'll be spending.
</P>
<P>
   Other instances include checking in at a hotel or taking out a
rental car, said Liz Tung, a spokeswoman for VISA, which operates
both credit-card and debit-card systems.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer agencies say they have not received complaints about
the practice, but bankers say customers sometimes complain when a
debit-card purchase has been declined. Many consumers will not
notice a hold placed on a debit card for a gas purchase because
they don't buy gas that often and their checking account balances
are high enough to cover the blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one reason for the lack of complaints may be that many
people don't know what is happening. The blocking policy is not
disclosed in the informational material that accompanies debit
cards, and bank statements don't record blocks.
</P>
<P>
   J. Anderson, 47, of Sebastopol learned the hard way during a
motorcycle tour of the Pacific Northwest last summer. Because a gas
tank on a motorcycle usually holds only enough to go 100 miles,
Anderson stopped four or five times in a single day on his trip
across Washington state. Each time, he used his debit card. That
night when he tried to pay a restaurant bill, the debit card was
rejected for lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson knew his account had more than enough money to cover
his expenses, called his bank and complained. After more than an
hour on the phone, he was able to use the debit card to pay for the
meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really disconcerting,'' he said. ``Then the next day
when I went to Bainbridge Island to get gas, they rejected the card
again. I made another angry call that night, and the rest of the
way down the coast I didn't have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank never satisfactorily explained the event, Anderson
said. It wasn't until he talked to fellow bikers who had had
similar experiences that he learned about the debit card hold.
``Then it made perfect sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What happens in cases like these is that the card machines at
gas station pumps are programmed to seek pre-authorization before
the sale is made. So the pump sends an electronic message to the
bank asking if the buyer's account holds an arbitrary amount of
money pre-determined by the station owner. The amount is generally
large enough to cover the largest gasoline purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The block is used by merchants to ensure there is enough money
to pay the bill when the final amount is known, Tung said. No block
is used at grocery or retail stores, where the amount of purchase
is known at the time the card is used.
</P>
<P>
   But the practice of blocking can mean other debit-card purchases
may be rejected and, if your checking account is delicately
balanced, a check can bounce and you may be stuck with bounced
check charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all send a pre-authorization transaction, which comes to
the financial institution, and asks if the customer has the dollar
amount,'' explained Brad Hunter, vice president of Exchange Bank.
``Some will send $35, some $50, some $100, depending on their risk
management philosophy. Some will send a $1 message, basically
saying all they need to know is if this is a valid account.''
</P>
<P>
   When the pre-authorization is approved by the bank's electronic
circuitry, the customer can pump the gas.
</P>
<P>
   A similar hold occurs when you use a credit card to reserve a
hotel room. The hotel doesn't know what your final bill may be, or
how much you may run up in room service or meals or telephone
calls. So it blocks a large chunk of money on your credit card to
assure the final bill will be paid.
</P>
<P>
   Blocking usually doesn't make a difference with a credit card
because consumers generally have thousands of dollars more in
credit allowance than they have spent. For that reason, bankers
urge consumers to use credit cards, not debit cards, for lodging
and car rentals.
</P>
<P>
   With a gas purchase, the debit card hold is lifted when the bank
processes the final transaction amount by matching account numbers
on the pre-authorization message to those on the sale message,
Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the pump's programming, this process can be
automatic and happen immediately after the customer finishes
pumping or it can happen later, when the merchant clears his
machine, said Dennis DeCota, executive director of the California
Gas Station and Automotive Repair Association in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Stations of major gasoline brands have satellite disks that
allow the sale to be processed immediately and the hold lifted,
DeCota said. Older stations, off-brands or stations in rural areas
sometimes do not have that kind of technology and the sales may
clear more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   To protect customers from holds that could last for weeks, banks
automatically lift a hold after a few days even if the transaction
has not cleared, Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Exchange Bank lifts the hold after two days. Banks
on the VISA debit card system are required to lift it after three
days, said spokeswoman Tung.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debit cards work well most of the time, but they don't work
well for all people,'' Hunter said. ``I don't like the delayed
settlement aspect of it, there's not that much reason for it. It's
just the architecture of the processing systems.''

 &HT;    Lend Lease CEO to be baseed in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Tony Wilbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lend Lease Real Estate Investments will relocate only one
position to Atlanta this spring, but the move will be significant.
</P>
<P>
   The investment management company said Friday it hired Sheryl
Pressler to take over as CEO in March, and she will be based in
Atlanta. When she arrives in Atlanta, Lend Lease effectively will
end its practice of having dual headquarters in Atlanta and New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, with Sheryl there _ the CEO _ and with the
other officers there, Atlanta really is the headquarters,'' said
Jonathan Miller, senior vice president of corporate communications.
</P>
<P>
   Currently chief investment officer for California Public
Employees Retirement System (CalPERS), Pressler said she needs to
be in Atlanta, where Lend Lease has the bulk of its U.S. employees.
``You got to be where your people are,'' she said. ``You can't be
an absentee leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Lend Lease is the largest adviser to pension funds in the United
States. It advises more than 500 pension funds and institutional
clients, and manages about $31 billion in real estate funds in the
United States. Its annual Emerging Trends reports are considered a
key prognosticator of the country's real estate market.
</P>
<P>
   CalPERS, the nation's largest public pension fund, has been a
client of Lend Lease and its predecessor since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Lend Lease employs 1,500 in 30 cities on five continents. When
Lend Lease completes its announced acquisition of five mortgage
business units of Amresco in March, it will have about 750
employees in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Lend Lease grew by acquiring Boston Financial.
</P>
<P>
   At CalPERS, Pressler led the restructuring of its $8 billion
portfolio, which includes office, apartment, warehouse, retail and
other space. When she replaces current Lend Lease Real Estate
Investments CEO Matthew Banks in March, Pressler will be one of the
few women to lead a national real estate company.
</P>
<P>
   Banks will remain in New York as chief executive of Lend Lease's
international operations. He said he will work with Pressler over
the next several months to ensure a smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
   Lend Lease Real Estate Investments was formed in 1997 when Lend
Lease Corp. of Australia acquired Equitable Real Estate Investment
Management of Atlanta and merged it with the Yarmouth Group.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception, Lend Lease had claimed dual headquarters in
Atlanta and New York. ``Atlanta has been the center of our
operations for many years,'' Miller said.

MAGIC MAN: A CONVERSATION WITH DAVID COPPERFIELD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BILL DeYOUNG   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Copperfield knows that people everywhere are trying to
unravel his latest trick: How did he make Claudia Schiffer
disappear? The master illusionist and the drop-dead gorgeous
supermodel were inseparable for six years. Maybe ``how'' isn't the
question; maybe it's ``why?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like every relationship,'' Copperfield sighs during a
telephone interview. ``We both had careers and dreams that took us
apart a lot. And like a million other couples, we're still really
good friends. She's a very, very nice person, I care about her
very, very much, and we're just doing our own things.''
</P>
<P>
   With that out of the way, Copperfield settles down to the
business at hand: Talking about his reputation as the greatest
magician since Houdini, and about the 2000 version of his touring
stage show.
</P>
<P>
   Copperfield, 44, whose real name is David Seth Kotkin, has been
a working prestidigitator since the age of 12. The native of
Metuchen, N.J., has built an empire around his talents, and is
currently one of the top 10 highest-paid entertainers in the world.
</P>
<P>
   He's very careful to make the distinction between illusion and
magic. ``I'm clearly an illusionist who does magic,'' Copperfield
says. ``The effect is magic. But I'm honest; I'm an illusionist.
I'm not claiming to have any supernatural powers _ I may have them,
but I'm not claiming to have them.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if I call myself an illusionist, then you know
everything's fair. I'm going to create illusions, and you're not
supposed to believe anything, but I'll try to make you believe it.
But you're not supposed to, and my truth is, it's all illusions.
I'm going to make them look like magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Copperfield became famous in the 1970s for his large-scale
illusions. He made the Statue of Liberty disappear, escaped from
Alcatraz, walked through the Great Wall of China and levitated
across the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Even his sleight-of-hand routines involve more than rabbits and
hats. He once destroyed and restored a priceless Honus Wagner
baseball card in the presence of its nervous owner, hockey great
Wayne Gretsky.
</P>
<P>
   Copperfield's shows are big, loud, showy affairs, with the star
surrounded by beautiful, scantily clad women (``We walk the line
very carefully,'' he says. ``We try not to go too far, but on TV
you can see stuff that's way more risque'').
</P>
<P>
   The show's production quality, he explains, ``is a Broadway
conceit. Or a movie musical. I love doing things that are very
grand in scale, because I'm kind of known for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I also love the intimate, `unplugged' section. Getting out
there and showing what I can do, without all the fluff and stuff,
you know? And I think that contrast is very good. There's a lot of
that in the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Television's recent run of ``Secrets Revealed'' programs, in
which illusions such as Copperfield's are explained in detail to
the audience, annoys him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been guessing my things for years. They get on the
Internet, they come up with theories, and some theories are better
than what I actually do,'' he says. ``Those shows, mostly, are just
guesses. They're not really how to do it.'' The Copperfield team
has developed ``four or five'' different ways to climax each
illusion, to throw off the party-poopers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are thousands of performing magicians out there who
don't have the resources to change the way they do an illusion.
These are people who are trying to feed their families, and it's
hurtful to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a recent performance in Turkey, a reporter printed, in
detail, exactly how one particular illusion was accomplished. ``It
was a huge scandal,'' Copperfield says. ``It wasn't a scandal for
us; it got us great publicity. We just kept the illusion and
changed the method.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was rooting for me. Because even though they're
curious to see how it works, they really don't want to know how it
works.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was only six years ago that Subcomandante Marcos and his
masked Zapatista rebels rose up in Chiapas, Mexico, ostensibly
against NAFTA, or the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On the very eve the trade treaty became law, the army of peasant
guerillas marched into the plaza of San Cristobal de las Casas, in
Mexico, identifying themselves and declaring open war on the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The free trade agreement is a death certificate for the Indian
peoples, which are expendable for the government of Carlos Salinas
de Gortari,'' Marcos said, catching the pro-NAFTA patriciate
off-guard.
</P>
<P>
   By now, of course, the insurgents and their revolutionary
movement leaders have tailored their demands to more modest aims,
hidden their dismally few weapons and essentially gone back into
the hills. As such, the Chiapas rebellion belongs more to Mexico's
history books than to its everyday political life. And an
assessment of its impact is more properly a historical exercise
than a political one.
</P>
<P>
   But part of the Zapatista rebellion's legacy lives on, if only
through its promise, in recent events in Seattle: the
demonstrations and riots during the Nov. 30-to-Dec. 3 World Trade
Organization meeting. Once again the protest was, at least in part,
about the enormous gap between the have-nots and the beneficiaries
of world ``free'' trade.
</P>
<P>
   There always was a missing party during the entire 1992-'93
NAFTA debate involving Mexico, the United States and Canada. The
latter two nations were aptly represented not merely by governments
and industry but also by social and political forces such as
grassroots activists, NGOs or non-govermental organizations, labor
unions and environmental groups. But where were their Mexican
counterparts?
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions _ a scattering of women's and human-rights
groups, a tiny band of intellectuals, occasionally Mayor Cardenas
of Mexico City and his Party of the Democratic Revolution _ the
civil society and political forces of Mexico did not participate in
the NAFTA debate.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe the reason for this absence was the fact that all
Mexican interests were totally identified with those of the former
Salinas administration and the business community. Why, even
environmentalists and maquiladora workers found themselves
``represented'' by the Salinas technocrats and plutocrats or the
Monterrey magnates.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe that the social silence and absence sprung from
the repressive remnants of the Mexican authoritarian political
system.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, there certainly were critics of the free-trade
treaty in Mexico. They supported, for example, the inclusion in
NAFTA of chapters on stringent protection for labor, environmental,
human and consumer rights, with real sanctions and teeth in them.
They also advocated transparent, expeditious and accessible
mechanisms for complaint and conflict resolution. Ironically, these
critics and their demands enjoyed far more support in Washington
than in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until Marcos and his troops burst forth upon the scene.
</P>
<P>
   As Tim Golden wrote in The New York Times on Jan. 9, 1994, ``In
timing their strike to NAFTA's implementation, the rebels took aim
at the official faith that by fixing their economic destiny to that
of wealthier nations, all Mexicans would be raised into a modernity
of more jobs ... and a fuller democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now this was a strange occurrence, in certain ways, because one
might have imagined that the best way to accomplish, for example,
the unionization of more than 1 million maquiladora workers in
northern Mexico, given the difficulties of prying open the Mexican
labor movement, would be through international means. But it did
not happen at the time.
</P>
<P>
   And it did not really happen in Seattle either. All the
governments from the rich ``North'' and the poor ``South'' were at
the event. Every protester and his or her cousin from the United
States and Western Europe, it seemed, was also there, clamoring at
the convention center against corporate greed, global
commercialism, the rich-poor gap and so forth. But grassroots
organizers, non-governmental organizations, ``greens,'' labor
unions, consumer protection groups _ as well as women's-rights,
child-labor and student activists from the South were largely
absent.
</P>
<P>
   Partly this relates to cost and distance. For many, the plane
fare is too expensive; so are hotel rooms and accompanying travel
costs. But there are social factors too, such as the well-founded
fears of many Indonesian, Pakistani and Egyptian activists to
openly voice their complaints. Also a nationalistic reluctance in
many left-wing quarters of the ``South'' to acknowledge any
international alliances as totally kosher.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, what Seattle and other global venues (such as the 50th
anniversary World Bank celebration) have shown is quite instructive
_ for instance, that if Indonesian workers organizing for better
conditions in local sports-shoe factories are to find any allies,
it will be most likely among the up-scale consumers of Nike
footwear in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles _ though not
necessarily among the teen-agers in the projects and ghettoes.
</P>
<P>
   Or that if sweatshop workers in El Salvador fighting for their
basic rights are to have any chance of winning their struggles, it
will likely be thanks to consumers boycotting GAP jeans and
clothing in the United States. Or that if child-labor adversaries
in Pakistan and India are to find support, it will probably be from
groups that force governments to compel Pakistani or Hindu
importers to desist from employing children _ those under 14, at
least.
</P>
<P>
   Or that if indigenous groups in Chiapas, Ecuador or the Amazon,
or environmentalists in Mexico and Brazil, or fruit pickers in
Chile are to make any headway in their demands, it largely will be
as a result of alliances with consumer groups, ``greens,'' labor
unions and citizens' organizations in the ``North'' who, for their
own reasons, and with their own agendas, will bring their
burgeoning power to bear on the defects of the globalization
process.
</P>
<P>
   Capital has become fluid and terribly footloose today, mobile
and transient across state and continental borders. That, we are
told by economists and globalization boosters, is why any form of
national regulation, taxation, protection or ambition is hopelessly
condemned to irrelevance. However self-serving or plainly false
such an argument may be, it does contain a grain of truth, as well
as several positive implications.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, indeed, capital can move anywhere, and make it possible
to manufacture elegant leather goods or trendy clothes, exotic
fruits and cheap but sophisticated electronics. But there are only
a limited number of consumers of these items, and they are all
grouped together in 20-or-so nations. Moreover, these consumers are
linked by the same networks _ of advertisers, activists, Internet
servers and lifestyles; they belong to the same ``niches'' for
marketing purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In these countries, small, active and dedicated groups of
minorities can move mountains _ particularly if they are made up of
social strata with increasing leisure time, money to spend, causes
to back and '60s nostalgia and liberal ideals to nourish.
</P>
<P>
   At some point soon _ maybe at the next round of WTO talks _
those folks who were so notably absent from the Seattle summit will
show up. Perhaps they'll meet their U.S. and European counterparts
and begin to bridge the gaps between North and South in a way few
would have imagined just a few years ago _ for instance, the way in
the Seattle streets the protesting Teamsters allied with
environmentalist supporters of an international ban on the kinds of
tuna nets that pick up turtles.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, the labor, consumer, environmental,
human-rights, gender and generational rules in international trade
treaties will begin to bite. Their advocates will no longer be
written off as misguided anti-trade protectionists or blind
isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want a more humanitarian, balanced and
environment-friendly type of free trade will perhaps become part of
the same globalized world that today's corporate beneficiaries are
so enthusiastically promoting.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was only six years ago that Subcomandante Marcos and his
masked Zapatista rebels rose up in Chiapas, Mexico, ostensibly
against NAFTA, or the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On the very eve the trade treaty became law, the army of peasant
guerillas marched into the plaza of San Cristobal de las Casas, in
Mexico, identifying themselves and declaring open war on the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The free trade agreement is a death certificate for the Indian
peoples, which are expendable for the government of Carlos Salinas
de Gortari,'' Marcos said, catching the pro-NAFTA patriciate
off-guard.
</P>
<P>
   By now, of course, the insurgents and their revolutionary
movement leaders have tailored their demands to more modest aims,
hidden their dismally few weapons and essentially gone back into
the hills. As such, the Chiapas rebellion belongs more to Mexico's
history books than to its everyday political life. And an
assessment of its impact is more properly a historical exercise
than a political one.
</P>
<P>
   But part of the Zapatista rebellion's legacy lives on, if only
through its promise, in recent events in Seattle: the
demonstrations and riots during the Nov. 30-to-Dec. 3 World Trade
Organization meeting. Once again the protest was, at least in part,
about the enormous gap between the have-nots and the beneficiaries
of world ``free'' trade.
</P>
<P>
   There always was a missing party during the entire 1992-'93
NAFTA debate involving Mexico, the United States and Canada. The
latter two nations were aptly represented not merely by governments
and industry but also by social and political forces such as
grassroots activists, NGOs or non-govermental organizations, labor
unions and environmental groups. But where were their Mexican
counterparts?
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions _ a scattering of women's and human-rights
groups, a tiny band of intellectuals, occasionally Mayor Cardenas
of Mexico City and his Party of the Democratic Revolution _ the
civil society and political forces of Mexico did not participate in
the NAFTA debate.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe the reason for this absence was the fact that all
Mexican interests were totally identified with those of the former
Salinas administration and the business community. Why, even
environmentalists and maquiladora workers found themselves
``represented'' by the Salinas technocrats and plutocrats or the
Monterrey magnates.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe that the social silence and absence sprung from
the repressive remnants of the Mexican authoritarian political
system.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, there certainly were critics of the free-trade
treaty in Mexico. They supported, for example, the inclusion in
NAFTA of chapters on stringent protection for labor, environmental,
human and consumer rights, with real sanctions and teeth in them.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the news came over the radio Monday that AOL intended to
buy Time Warner, I couldn't help but think that something like
another big television network was in the process of creation.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's a super-duper kind of smart TV that AOL will offer. It
will propagate its signal mostly via fiber-optic cable and
satellite instead of broadcast waves in the atmosphere. It will
offer more kinds of products than simple programming: games,
software applications, e-mail, and all the rest. But what did the
new company really have that I wanted?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos.'' And I didn't want that very much.
</P>
<P>
   The new technology is full of stories like this one. Where there
was a Dow Jones broadtape in my office now there is a Bloomberg
terminal. Where there was a mail tray now there is a fax machine.
Where there had been typewriters now there are PCs and printers.
Downstairs, the linotypes are gone, and most of the colorful guys
who operated them. That's a real difference. Colorful designers
with Apple computers have taken their place.
</P>
<P>
   At home, instead of a phonograph there is a compact disc player.
Where there was a telephone there is a telephone, wireless,
perhaps, but still a telephone. There is a television and a VCR.
Where there was a radio by the bed, there's still a radio, and on
the front porch, a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   A few doors down from the once-busy magazine stand at the corner
is a video store. The movie theater across the street is thriving,
too, and the used-book store.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing that is really new in all this is the
Internet, with its distribution wizardry and all-but-free messaging
system. It is very new indeed. Whether it will be able to preserve
its singularity in an otherwise commercial world remains to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   The really interesting aspect of the AOL-Time Warner story has
been the markets' reaction to the deal. In the first three days
after the deal was announced, AOL's shares fell 19 percent to as
low as $60 a share on Wednesday. By Friday it had regained a
little, to close at $63. There was an abiding sense of fragility
about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The reason usually given was that ``momentum'' investors had
jumped off, recognizing that the nature of AOL's business had
changed. Indeed it has. A comparison of price earnings ratios shows
how differently the firms are valued by investors. AOL, one of the
few dot.coms to make money, is valued at something like 55 times
earnings, while Time Warner, which only recently returned to
profitability, had a multiple of about 14.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time anyone had used high-priced dot.com
shares to buy a real operating business. The markets' reaction just
may have signalled the beginning of the end of the wacky Internet
stock bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Without Time Warner, AOL was just another pure play on hope,
like Yahoo and Amazon.com and other companies whose shares have
traded as high as 400 times their meager earnings. With Time
Warner, AOL is . . . well, just a new-fangled television network in
the making with a lot of extras bundled in and a media conglomerate
on the side. It is a much less magical proposition. To get some
perspective on the matter, I went back to see what George Gilder
was saying about the subject 10 years ago. For all his bombast,
Gilder is a shrewd and energetic technology reporter, who now sells
his newsletter (www.gildertech.com) for $295 a year and commands a
loyal following in several industries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 he wrote a little book called ``Life After Television:
The Coming Tranformation of Media and American Life.'' It was one
of those short-lived Whittle Communications books, with glossy ads
for Federal Express every few pages.
</P>
<P>
   Gilder then was concerned mainly with disparaging the boomlet
for high-definition TV _ widely supposed to be a great new Japanese
threat to US leadership in electronics. He sure got that one right.
His big bet was what he called the ``telecomputer'' _ a PC hooked
up to a new fiber optic highway of incredible efficiency. He was
right there, too.
</P>
<P>
   It was when Gilder came to industrial organization that he began
to lose me. He was convinced that the great capacity of fiber-optic
to carry signal _ its enormous bandwidth _ would spell the end to
monopolies, hierarchies and pyramids of all sorts.
</P>
<P>
   By changing the balance of power between the distributors and
creators of culture, he wrote, ``the telecomputer will forever
break the broadcast bottleneck. . . . The creator of a program on a
specialized subject _ from fly-fishing to quantum physics _ will be
able to reach with one video everyone in the United States, Europe
and Asia who shares the interest.'' Not a bad guesstimate of a
technological capability that came to fruition with the World Wide
Web!
</P>
<P>
   But Gilder foresaw in 1990 that this would spell the end of big
business _ at least the end of big communications business. It was
true, he allowed, that the mass-market magazines such as The
Saturday Evening Post and Life had yielded their position at the
pinnacle of national culture to the three great broadcast
television networks. But in the future there would be no more need
of such organizations. ``Appealing to a mass audience works only
when people cannot gratify their special interests,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, what's a nice distributor of culture like
AOL doing paying $165 billion or so for a mediocre producer of
culture like Time Warner? Futuristic Megadeal? Century of the
Internet? Or just a way for AOL to add another 30 million HBO
cable-TV subscribers to its list of 22 million AOL subscribers,
acquire Cable News Network, pick up Time Warner's extensive cable
holdings across the country, and add a grab-bag of movies, music
and magazines to its home-grown inventory of ``content.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL achieved its astonishing growth in the '90s by understanding
that consumers wanted a ``dashboard'' through which to connect to
an increasingly interconnected world. It described itself as
selling ``branded convenience in a box.'' Soon enough all the other
giant companies in the computer-Internet, infotainment, and
telecommunications industries will be following its example.
``Pipeowners'' and content providers will mix and mingle and sort
themselves out. Eventually a few new oligopolies will emerge.
</P>
<P>
   The next big battle, however, will be over telephony. With the
advent of Internet switching, no longer is there a need to meter
the service through giant central switching stations, when
decentralized routers and servers will do. The regional telephone
companies will fight hard _ and probably fail _ to maintain their
monopolies; they'll become parts of pipeline companies instead. At
that point, the great telecommunications restructuring that began
in 1982 with the breakup of the old AT&AMP;T will mostly be complete.
</P>
<P>
   How long before AOL restructures itself to look more like a
network, with news, entertainment, and services divisions, complete
with ``Chinese walls'' aimed at protecting. AOL chairman Steve
Case, 41, slowly will morph into a media mogul, on the order of
Bill Gates: more important in his day than Henry Luce, who founded
Time; more important than William Paley, who founded CBS. Others
will join him at the small top of a very big heap.
</P>
<P>
   The new Supernets will be important in the manufacture of
opinion _ but probably not as important as newspapers and magazines
that manage to preserve their respectability and independence.
People will still want their referees.

CUBAN BOY STIRS MOUNTING POLITICAL BATTLE ON CAPITOL HILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Southern Exposure is the weekly political notebook from the
Washington Bureau of the New York Times Regional Newspapers) (lh) 
 By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy who
survived his mother's ill-fated bid to reach U.S. shores, is
quickly becoming the center of attention on Capitol Hill as
lawmakers bicker over his fate, each side accusing the other of
injecting politics into the emotional controversy.
</P>
<P>
   While Elian's Cuban father demanded his son's return and federal
immigration authorities ordered it, GOP lawmakers and a few
Democrats argued for his remaining in Florida, citing Cuba's
communist rule. They've lavished gifts on Elian and trotted him
before the media. Their critics say he should be returned and
contend other nationalities are treated unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   A vote on U.S. citizenship for the boy could occur quickly once
Congress convenes later this month as the result of a push by
conservatives such as Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a longtime foe of Fidel
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost inconceivable that a court in the United States
of America would conclude that it is in the best interests of a
6-year-old boy to be returned to a totalitarian government, which
will in essence tell the little boy what he can learn, what he can
think, what he can say, what he can become,'' said Sen. Connie
Mack, R-Fla., a chief citizenship backer.
</P>
<P>
   Another congressman subpoenaed the boy to testify before a
congressional panel to delay his ordered return to Cuba though
Elian is not expected to have to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many black lawmakers are beginning to complain of a
double standard. They point out that illegal Haitian immigrants are
routinely turned away from U.S. shores while illegal Cuban
immigrants are welcomed as heroes.
</P>
<P>
   And they question why Republicans who love talking about strong
families are intent on keeping a boy from his father and
grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something wrong with that,'' said Rep. Jim Clyburn,
D-S.C., chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. ``That doesn't
sound like family values to me.''
</P>
<P>
   AT THE MOVIES
</P>
<P>
   Two thumbs down.
</P>
<P>
   That's the review from one tobacco executive about the movie
``The Insider,'' a thoroughly unflattering look at how the industry
makes and markets its cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were defamed,'' declared Nick Brookes, CEO of Brown &AMP;
Williamson Tobacco Corp. Speaking at the National Press Club,
Brookes said the movie wrongly suggested his company threatened a
whistle-blower who told ``60 Minutes'' that tobacco companies
manipulate their products to make them more addictive.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Brookes _ who has not seen the movie but
caught the previews _ allowed there are ``some fairly critically
acclaimed acting performances.'' But he concluded that the movie's
poor box-office showing demonstrated the American public doesn't
buy the ``premise'' of the film.
</P>
<P>
   GOING SOUTH
</P>
<P>
   They're talking about taxes in New Hampshire and farm policy in
Iowa, but expect some new themes once the presidential candidates
head South.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll probably see the social messages increase,'' said Dan
Hazelwood, a Republican consultant. ``You'll even see more social
messages from the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   But more pressure appears to be on the GOP contenders. With the
South Carolina primary _ the gateway to the South _ set for Feb.
19, Republican candidates are being asked to weigh in on such
issues as the flying of the Confederate flag and abortion
restrictions. For conservative activists, a strong base in the
party in the South, these can be make-or-break issues.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, anti-abortion groups are already running ads,
saying that Arizona Sen. John McCain, who is running a strong
challenge to Texas Gov. George W. Bush, is not sufficiently
pro-life.
</P>
<P>
   ET TU, NEWTUS
</P>
<P>
   It had to hurt. Ex-Speaker Newt Gingrich was on television,
predicting Republicans were going to have trouble holding on to the
House this year unless the GOP presidential candidate wins in a
landslide. He wasn't putting any blame on his own political
missteps or his nasty divorce. No, it was strictly a numbers game.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I read the tea leaves right now, there are 21 Republicans
who announced that they're retiring or they're running for another
office,'' said Gingrich. ``There are only six Democrats who are
leaving at this stage. That's a terrific advantage. ... I believe
that Governor Bush or Senator McCain or someone is going to have to
win by a pretty decisive margin to keep the House Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats quickly pounced on the forecast, proclaiming that even
Gingrich has given up on the House GOP. Republicans were no doubt
happy they did not invite the ousted speaker to their recent
celebration marking five years of House control.

LET FREEDOM RING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monda, Jan. 17, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a sunny spring day three decades ago, my kindergarten teacher
in Miami wrote a long word on the blackboard. She asked her class
of 5- and 6-year-olds to repeat it after her. It wasn't like the
words on our weekly spelling list; it took us several tries to get
out so many syllables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ass-ass-in-ation,'' we chanted shakily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does anyone know what an assassination is?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Too young to wait for a school bus without supervision, we were
not too young to learn what a political killing was. It was April
5, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   I knew what an assassination was. Sort of. It had been explained
to me the night before in the rush of emotion that followed the
first reports that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had been gunned down
in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I didn't know who King was; I knew only that all the
grownups around me were in shock. My mother was sobbing; my father
tried to snap a picture of King from the television set.
</P>
<P>
   My mother tried to explain. She told me he was a great man, that
he was killed by white people for trying to free black people. But
there was little more she could say. She was in the throes of a
private grief. My classmates and I would learn that this public
tragedy would cause personal pain for a lot of us.
</P>
<P>
   A little less than 32 years later, we are left with a holiday, a
postage stamp, and a lot of history, not all of it true. Millions
will take today off with only a vague idea of what they are
commemorating. Among black kids who absorb much of their history
from hip-hop music, King is dismissed as an ``accommodationist''
who suffers in comparison to Malcolm X's forceful stand for black
power. Even among those who understand how absurd that is, the
unique moral force of King's crusade is fading.
</P>
<P>
   Please, let's all take a moment to remember what today is really
about. It marks more than one great man's birthday, it honors the
most successful, historically important people's political movement
America has ever seen. It's about the triumph _ the tragically
short-lived triumph _ of the idea that right could prevail, that
America could not only be challenged to live up to its cherished
ideals but could, to some degree, meet that challenge.
</P>
<P>
   King, and the anonymous thousands he led and inspired, put their
lives on the line for more than a decade to give flesh to a century
of empty promises of equal opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   As revolutionaries, ultimately they failed. Most revolutions
fail. King's tactics did not translate well to the North, where
civil rights issues were different, and where blacks often equated
nonviolence with weakness. Even before King died, the movement had
shattered, in terms of serving as a unifying force for black
America. In his genius, King recognized that the issues of voting
and public accommodation would be much more easily addressed than
the economic and social issues that would later prove so divisive _
and have remained so.
</P>
<P>
   We still have ``civil rights leaders'' _ but the movement
expired on that night in Memphis. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton
claim to lead black America, but whom they lead and where they are
leading them has never approached the clarity of King's grand
crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Recent years have not been kind to the King legacy. Lieutenants
have revealed his infidelities; his doctoral dissertation at Boston
University was the subject of an embarrassing plagiarism probe. His
children have faced charges of being mercenary keepers of the flame
after selling a piece of their father's legacy to corporate giant
Time-Warner. Absent from most contemporary civil rights debates,
they have spent years attempting to prove that James Earl Ray, long
ago convicted of King's murder, was part of a shady conspiracy
involving the Mafia, the US government, and, for all the sense
they've made, an army of flying saucers.
</P>
<P>
   King's message was that the path to freedom lies not only in the
Constitution but in the personal courage and dignity of each of us.
His challenge to us was to be true to our better selves. He
anticipated his death, but did not fear it; he made the movement
was his life, but understood it belonged to each person willing to
sacrifice for its ideals. In that belief he lives, and continues to
inspire.
</P>
<P>
   Let freedom ring.

ANOTHER DROUGHT THREATENS TEXAS FARMERS, RANCHERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas' third drought in four years is
devastating livestock producers, endangering crops and threatening
municipal water supplies, state officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While assuring farmers and ranchers that state officials are
working diligently to address drought-related problems, Agriculture
Commissioner Susan Combs said the best solution can only come from
above.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it does not start raining soon, many areas of the state may
see no little or no spring planting,'' said Combs. ``The needed
moisture is not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Huge sections of the state had below-average rainfall last year,
and aside from one brief soggy spell, this year is looking like a
rerun with ``potentially devastating'' consequences, Combs said.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five of the state's 254 counties have been declared
disaster areas and 13 more are seeking that status from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of rain causes more than cracks in the dirt, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stock tanks are drying up in many counties. Some ranchers are
now hauling water or moving livestock to other pastures ... Forage
supplies are short. Grazing is limited in most areas,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of the state's pastures are rated in poor or
very poor condition, she said, offering more telling statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state's overall reservoir storage capacity is the lowest
that it's been in 22 years at this time of year. In addition, 55
public water systems have already imposed voluntary or mandatory
water use restrictions to prevent outages. There are 115 counties
that have imposed an outdoor burning ban to prevent wildfires,''
Combs said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, San Antonio is the only sizable Texas city that has
warned of imposing water-use limitations. That city said it may
have to implement restrictions as early as March if relief isn't
felt.
</P>
<P>
   Citing estimates that the droughts in 1996 and 1998 cost the
state's farmers and ranchers $4 billion for lost income, blown away
soil and other repercussions, Combs enumerated steps her agency and
others have taken to address urgent drought woes.
</P>
<P>
   Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Federal authorities have been petitioned for financial aid and
expertise and for permission to allow grazing on protected lands.
</P>
<P>
   _ State officials have pleaded with bankers and their regulators
to be flexible with agribusiness borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   _ State transportation officials have been petitioned to allow
farmers and ranchers to mow and bail grasses along highway rights
of way.
</P>
<P>
   _ Agriculture officials in Colorado, Kansas, Mississippi,
Nebraska, New Mexico and Oklahoma have been asked to locate grazing
pastures and water resources for use by Texas ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Texas is operating a toll-free ``hay hotline''
(1-877-429-1998) to help ranchers find food for their livestock.
</P>
<P>
   Longer-term solutions also are being sought, Combs said. They
include:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Stepping up brush control programs to help conserve water.
</P>
<P>
   _ Continuing a 25-year-old weather modification, or
``rain-making'' initiative.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expanding efforts to remove salt from brackish water to make
it drinkable.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pressing ahead with university research to improve drought and
heat tolerance of crops.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ``unless we have a very substantial downpour, there is
no quick fix,'' Combs said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For Sopranos neophytes, we offer this guide to who's who.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini): Head of a New Jersey crime
organization, specializing in ``solid waste management.'' Prone to
anxiety attacks and depression, though you'd never know it by the
authoritative way he handles colleagues and the ruthless way he
rids himself of rats within the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Livia Soprano (Nancy Marchand): Tony's extremely hard-to-please
mom, who at least implicitly allowed a hit on her son after he put
her in a nursing home _ er, retirement community. May have had a
stroke. May be suffering from Alzheimer's. May be such an
accomplished manipulator that she's using one or both of the
ailments as an act.
</P>
<P>
   Carmela Soprano (Edie Falco): Tony's wife, who's so sexually
frustrated that she had designs on a handsome young Catholic
priest. Typically suburban mom who wants the best for her family,
and is willing to ignore many, but not all, of Tony's
indiscretions. Often sweet-natured, but her patience only goes so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Janice Soprano (Aida Turturro): Tony's sister, a new arrival who
quickly begins kissing up to Mom. She's after something, but so
far, it's unclear what.
</P>
<P>
   Meadow Soprano (Jamie Lynn Sigler): Tony's smart, athletic,
attractive daughter, who's about to enter college and has pretty
much figured out what dad's real job is.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Soprano Jr., aka A.J. (Robert Iler): Tony's
not-so-bright son, who's entering puberty and has a tendency to say
the wrong thing at the wrong time.

Tony when he discovered that Tony was seeing a psychiatrist.
Escaped Tony's revenge when he was thrown into prison.

<P>
   Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli): Tony's
short-tempered, movie-loving nephew. Trying to figure out what to

smarter than she acts but not as smart as she thinks. Now working

with Christopher, only to inexplicably be back together with him

<P>
   For Sopranos neophytes, we offer this guide to who's who.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini): Head of a New Jersey crime
organization, specializing in ``solid waste management.'' Prone to
anxiety attacks and depression, though you'd never know it by the
authoritative way he handles colleagues and the ruthless way he
rids himself of rats within the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Livia Soprano (Nancy Marchand): Tony's extremely hard-to-please
mom, who at least implicitly allowed a hit on her son after he put
her in a nursing home _ er, retirement community. May have had a
stroke. May be suffering from Alzheimer's. May be such an
accomplished manipulator that she's using one or both of the
ailments as an act.
</P>
<P>
   Carmela Soprano (Edie Falco): Tony's wife, who's so sexually
frustrated that she had designs on a handsome young Catholic
priest. Typically suburban mom who wants the best for her family,
and is willing to ignore many, but not all, of Tony's
indiscretions. Often sweet-natured, but her patience only goes so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Janice Soprano (Aida Turturro): Tony's sister, a new arrival who
quickly begins kissing up to Mom. She's after something, but so
far, it's unclear what.
</P>
<P>
   Meadow Soprano (Jamie Lynn Sigler): Tony's smart, athletic,
attractive daughter, who's about to enter college and has pretty
much figured out what dad's real job is.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Soprano Jr., aka A.J. (Robert Iler): Tony's
not-so-bright son, who's entering puberty and has a tendency to say
the wrong thing at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   Corrado ``Uncle Junior'' Soprano (Dominic Chianese): Tony's
uncle and rival for control of the family. Spent most of the first

ONE-TIME WISE GUY RATES ANOTHER KIND OF MOB HIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tommy Del Giorno will be watching critically when the much-hyped
television mob series ``The Sopranos'' begins its second season on
HBO Sunday night at 9. ``I get a kick out of the show,'' said Del
Giorno, who has lived the mob life.
</P>
<P>
   Del Giorno, 59, who admitted in court to taking part in five mob
hits, is a former capo with the Scarfo mafia family led by Nicodemo
``Little Nicky'' Scarfo, who is currently serving a life sentence.
The family controlled mob operations in Philadelphia and southern
New Jersey during the 1980s and '90s. Del Giorno has been in
hiding, living under an assumed name since he turned informant and
entered a federal protection program in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Del Giorno was once a swaggering figure among colleagues with
nicknames like Faffy, Crow, Frankie Flowers, Pat the Cat, Chicken
Man, Crazy Phil, Tony Bananas and Nicky Whip. Like most real
mafiosi, he is a mob movie buff who worshipped Godfathers I and II,
hated III, loved ``Goodfellas'' but had contempt for recent comedy
efforts like ``Analyze This'' and ``Mickey Blue Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   In telephone interviews this week, Del Giorno agreed to critique
``The Sopranos.'' He said that he admired much about the dramatic
narrative of the show, which, he said, ``tries to stay level about
the real mob life and still be entertaining.'' But as they say at
Hollywood script meetings, he had some notes:
</P>
<P>
   General characterization: ``One thing good, it makes people
realize these guys ain't that smart. `The Sopranos' shows how dumb
some of these guys really are. You know when you say somebody don't
have peripheral vision? Well, a lot of mob guys don't have any
peripheral thinking, if you know what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   On motivation: ``There's not enough fear in the ranks. They
ain't afraid of none of their people. But in real life, there are
some guys in charge that you had to be very afraid of. Take Nicky
Scarfo. He'd turn on you in a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Giorno had a lot to say about the characters:
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Malfi, Tony Soprano's psychiatrist, ``is a bit out in left
field. I never knew anybody in the mob that went to a shrink, not
even court-ordered.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Carmella, Tony's wife, who in an episode last year shared an
intimate dinner with her parish priest and confessor in the Soprano
home while Tony was away on business: ``She's realistic most of the
time, but the priest goes to the house? Come on! I mean, a mob
wife, she might go to church, but she don't bring the priest home
with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Tony's mother, Livia, who gave the nod to a set-up to have
her son whacked: ``Who the hell's going to kill their own kid? Get
out of here with the mother! Things like that are way out!''
</P>
<P>
   Of Uncle Junior, the passive, craven, publicity-shy Soprano
family boss, whose wardrobe trends toward Ban-Lon shirts and
Sansabelt slacks: ``He don't seem very real for a modern boss. Take
Nicky Scarfo. Scarfo always wanted his name in the paper. He got
mad when somebody else's name got in the paper. Now, Scarfo didn't
have no taste, but he would always dress up in expensive clothes.
He'd be in a restaurant and, like, there'd be six or seven of us at
the table. He'd talk real loud, start making sure people were
noticing he was there. He would curse, too, almost to a point where
you got embarrassed, because I didn't like the cursing. Mentally,
there was a guy probably should have seen one of them
psychiatrists, but of course he didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Giorno also had some thoughts about the context of the show:
``Except for the strip bar, nobody in `The Sopranos' seems to go to
a job. We didn't all have jobs, but some of us had businesses.
Sometimes we had numbers businesses and some guys had loan shark
(operations). Also, they seem to have money. A lot of guys in our
mob, let's say we had 80 guys, well 60 of them were always broke.''
</P>
<P>
   And he had suggestions for new episodes: ``You got to make them
a little more violent. Sometimes they let things go too far. They
let fresh guys get away with too much. Also, they have to bring in
more characters. If you look at it right now, basically you got
four mob guys besides the old uncle: the head guy, the two friends
and the young kid. I'm not counting the wife and mother. You got to
have characters start interacting with the mobs in New York. I
would put him (Tony) in charge and have that young kid get real
strong and give him a threat just like he gave the uncle a threat.
He has to have an enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the writers of ``The Sopranos'' are probably going
to want to create an informant who is relocated under a new
identity. Del Giorno, who knows of such things, says this will be
an opportunity to expand on one of the secrets to the show's
success _ the dramatic idea that the world outside can be even more
morally disillusioning than the violent, but codified mythology of
mob life.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the time I was in the mob, I never really wanted to kill
anybody. Out here in the legitimate world, there's 10 people I've
met that I would kill. These legitimate people are worse than mob
guys. They can do things and get away with it, and there's no
consequences. When you're in the mob, there's certain things you
can't say to people and get away with.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some mob guys that are really kind. Guys like Faffy
(Francis Iannarella Jr., a Scarfo capo convicted of murder), he's
got a nice heart. And Joey Punge (Joseph Pungitore, a Scarfo
soldier also in prison), he's got a good heart. They wouldn't hurt
people unless they're put in a position where they had to.''
</P>
<P>
   For Del Giorno, living in the legitimate world is a big
disappointment: ``You don't know how disappointed I am. You have
people out here that are supposed to be legitimate _ my God, they
wouldn't give you a drop of blood. They wouldn't give you air. I've
met legitimate people that if you gave them that kind of power over
life and death like Nicky Scarfo had, they'd kill a thousand
people.''

 &HT;    A whirlwind tour for Perez: `Going, going, going ... '
 &HT;    By Joe Capozzi
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tony Perez returned to work at Pro Player Stadium on Thursday
for the first time as the newest inductee to the Baseball Hall of
Fame. And he arrived in style _ emerging from a stretch limousine
to find a battery of television cameras recording his every move.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it was off to a press conference. Then three hours
live on WQAM's Baseball with Boog radio show. A cocktail party with
the Florida Marlins tonight at the Coral Gables Hyatt. And finally,
Hall of Fame induction ceremonies on July 23.
</P>
<P>
   The whirlwind that hasn't stopped since he got the news Tuesday
that he had received baseball's highest honor. He was at home in
Puerto Rico when he got the call. Then the phones rang nonstop: Lee
May. Pete Rose. Sparky Anderson. Johnny Bench kept yelling into the
phone, which didn't leave Perez's ear until he left for the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, he was in New York City with Carlton Fisk for
the official presentation of the Hall's Class of 2000. The flight
from San Juan was delayed four hours. ``I didn't sleep much but I
didn't want to,'' Perez, 57, said. ``I was afraid I would wake up
and I would still be in Puerto Rico.''
</P>
<P>
   The special assistant to the general manager strolled into Pro
Player Stadium concourse to a hearty applause from about 100
Marlins employees and friends, including his former teammate George
Foster.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask me how I feel the last two days? I don't care if I go
through a wall,'' Perez said. ``I'm still going and going and
going, like the rabbit, but it feels great.''
</P>
<P>
   It feels great because it's been a long time coming. Nine years,
which perhaps was meant to be for a player known more for his
clutch hitting with the Cincinnati Reds than for his 379 home runs
and 1,652 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son, Eduardo, was asked in Puerto Rico (how) it took me
nine years to get into the Hall,'' Perez recalled. ``He said,
'Well, it didn't surprise me because my dad came out with a big hit
in the ninth inning all the time. This time he did the same.'''
</P>
<P>
   As Perez stepped to thepodium, after a warm introduction General
Manager Dave Dombrowski, a wall of television monitors behind him
showed a 25-year-old Perez hitting a home run in the 15th inning to
win the 1967 All-Star Game for the NL. ``That was really my career
start,'' he would say later.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, his career start came at age 17, when he left his
native Cuba to play baseball in Puerto Rico. That's where he met
his wife, Pituka.
</P>
<P>
   Perez said Hall of Famer Frank Robinson is the player who
influenced his early baseball career and Pete Rose is another. ``I
hope one day the right people will do the right thing and he'll
make it in (the Hall).''
</P>
<P>
   There were other people, too: ``Bench. (Joe) Morgan. Rose.
(Cesar) Geronimo. (Dave) Concepcion _ I can name them all _ Lee
May. Bobby Tolan. They all helped me be what I am today.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned toward his wife. ``But Pituka, you helped the
most ... She is my inspiration. She is everything.''
</P>
<P>
   She was sure this day would come. It was in the numbers, she
said. ``(Son) Victor was born May 11 (1966). Eduardo was born Sept.
11 (1969). The home run he hit in the All-Star Game was July 11.
And Tuesday was Jan. 11. Everything good happened on the 11th.''

SUPREME COURT AGREES TO HEAR A `PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION' CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Iowa, Ark., Ill., Wis., Mo.)  (lh) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Adding an abortion case to its docket for the first
time in eight years, the Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide
whether a Nebraska law banning a procedure the state calls
``partial birth abortion'' is constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The justices plan to hear the case in April and decide it by
early summer. The election-year ruling could have a substantial
impact on the fractious politics of abortion, although it may not
resolve questions about all the similar, but differently worded,
prohibitions that 30 states have adopted in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The Nebraska law, which is broadly written and lacks an
exception to protect the health of pregnant women, was declared
unconstitutional last year by a federal appeals court, which also
struck down similar laws in Iowa and Arkansas. Nearly
simultaneously, a different appeals court upheld laws in Wisconsin
and Illinois, creating the judicial conflict that the Supreme Court
is acting quickly to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   In their order late Friday granting Nebraska's appeal, the
justices indicated that they are not interested in revisiting the
basic question of the constitutional status of abortion. Nebraska
had asked the court to reconsider its decisions establishing a
right to abortion, but the justices granted review only on specific
questions of whether the Nebraska law is consistent with those
precedents.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other states' laws, the Nebraska law applies to
procedures used to terminate pregnancies in which the fetuses
cannot yet live outside the womb. At this stage of pregnancy, the
Supreme Court ruled eight years ago in Planned Parenthood vs.
Casey, states may not place an ``undue burden'' on a woman's access
to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In striking down the Nebraska law in its ruling last September,
the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in St. Louis, said that
because the Nebraska law would have the effect of prohibiting ``the
most common method of second-trimester abortion,'' it constituted
an ``undue burden'' and meant that the court had a ``duty to
declare the statute invalid.''
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion for the appeals court, which sits in St. Louis,
Judge Richard S. Arnold said that the phrase partial birth
abortion, ``though widely used by lawmakers and in the popular
press, has no fixed medical or legal content.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nebraska law, which was passed in 1997 but has been blocked
from taking effect, contains this description of the abortion
technique it prohibits: ``an abortion procedure in which the person
performing the abortion partially delivers vaginally a living
unborn child before killing the unborn child and completing the
delivery.'' The term ``partially delivers'' is in turn defined as
``deliberately and intentionally delivering into the vagina a
living unborn child or a substantial portion thereof.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said the phrase ``substantial portion'' was
the law's ``crucial problem'' because it meant that the prohibition
applied to a range of abortion procedures used quite early in
pregnancy, in which a doctor pulls fetal parts from the uterus
through the birth canal. Although Nebraska argued that its
legislature had in fact not intended to ban this common procedure,
known as dilation and evacuation, the appeals court said that ``we
cannot, however, twist the words of the law and give them a meaning
they cannot reasonably bear.''
</P>
<P>
   In its Supreme Court appeal, Stenberg vs. Carhart, No. 99-830,
the state is arguing that the appeals court should have adopted a
narrower reading of the law to prohibit only a variant of a
procedure known as intact dilation and extraction. In this
procedure, which is used infrequently but became widely known
through its graphic depiction during congressional debates on the
issue, a more fully developed fetus is brought feet first through
the birth canal, leaving the largest part, the head, inside the
uterus. The skull is then collapsed and its contents suctioned in
order to enable it to pass through the cervix.
</P>
<P>
   While this procedure is often referred to as a late-term
abortion, it takes place before fetal viability, up to about 24
weeks of pregnancy. Even under Roe vs. Wade, the court has
permitted states to ban abortions after viability, with exceptions
for the pregnant woman's life and health, and most states have long
had such prohibitions, which are not at stake in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leroy Carhart of Bellevue, Neb., who challenged the state
law, performs about 20 of the intact abortions a year, as well as
many other abortions at earlier stages of pregnancy that the
appeals court found would also be covered by the law. Doctors
performing abortions generally seek to keep the fetus as intact as
possible to avoid injury to the wall of the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   Carhart's lawyer, Simon Heller of the Center for Reproductive
Law and Policy in New York, said Friday that although he would have
preferred that the Supreme Court let the lower court's decision
stand, he thought that of all the cases on their way to the court,
Nebraska's case was the best for the court to have accepted because
of a strong record compiled at trial on the safety and health
reasons for the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign against `partial birth abortion' has simply been
a campaign of deception orchestrated to demonize abortion in the
eyes of the public,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   James Bopp Jr., general counsel of the National Right to Life
Committee, said that even under Roe vs. Wade, bans on the procedure
could and should be upheld because the court's precedents upholding
the right to abortion did not apply to `'the killing of living
infants who are only inches away from being fully born alive.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has twice vetoed proposed federal laws. A law
passed the Senate for the third time in October, two votes short of
the number needed to override the president's veto, and the House
of Representatives will take up the bill this year.

RUSSIA RENOUNCES `FIRST USE' NUCLEAR POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Frustrated with Russia's declining role in the world,
Acting President Vladimir V. Putin Friday proclaimed a new security
doctrine that opens the door for the Kremlin to make the first
nuclear strike in a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the United States, the Soviet Union's official
policy had long renounced any ``first use'' of nuclear weapons.
Subsequently, Russia also said it wouldn't use nuclear weapons
except to protect its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   In a reflection of Moscow's increasingly hostile mood and its
souring relations with the West, the new document also called
attempts by the United States to dominate international affairs a
threat to Russia's national security.
</P>
<P>
   There was little immediate reaction In Washington. White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart declined to comment, saying only that the
doctrine ``is something that we look forward to getting a chance to
review.''
</P>
<P>
   While military officials in Moscow downplayed the doctrine's
bellicose tone, analysts said it reflects a growing consensus among
Moscow's elite that a weakened Russia is under assault from a
hostile world and needs to reassert itself on the international
stage.
</P>
<P>
   The increased emphasis on nuclear weapons, observers said, is
also an implicit recognition of the weakness of Russia's
conventional military forces, which for months have been bogged
down trying to squash a separatist rebellion in Chechnya, just four
years after Moscow gave up an earlier attempt in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level and scale of threats in the military sphere is
growing,'' the new doctrine declares. ``The Russian Federation
considers it possible . . . to use all forces and equipment at its
disposal, including nuclear weapons, to repel armed aggression if
all other means . . . have been exhausted or proven ineffective.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctrine replaces one implemented in 1997 that said Russia
would use nuclear weapons only if its national sovereignty was
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   That was at a time when military and political cooperation with
the West was still fashionable here. But following NATO's eastward
expansion, the alliance's bombing of Yugoslavia, and Russia's war
in Chechnya, Moscow's relations with the West have soured.
Washington's desire to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty
and the Russian parliament's failure to ratify the START II nuclear
weapons treaty have further increased tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The main foreign threats facing Russia, the new security
doctrine says, are NATO's expansion to include former Moscow allies
Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic, the possibility of finding
NATO military bases on Russia's borders, and the United States'
increasing dominance of world affairs. The document also accused
the United States of circumventing international law and trying to
resolve international crises on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new doctrine reflects the overwhelming opinion of the
Russian military and political elite that the West is a danger, and
that given the weakness of Russia's conventional forces, reliance
on nuclear weapons is necessary,'' said Pavel Felgenhauer, a
Moscow-based defense analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials in Moscow, however, were quick to stress that
Russia did not seek confrontation with the United States and its
allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moscow is interested in expanding cooperation with the West,''
Colonel General Valery Manilov, deputy head of Russia's General
Staff told the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   But several defense analysts said the new doctrine could herald
a new era of confrontation between Russia and the West.
</P>
<P>
   The United State has never renounced the first use of nuclear
weapons, and NATO, in a summit last year in Washington, expanded
the alliance's role to include intervention in conflicts beyond its
members' borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is cause for serious concern here although it should not
be overly dramatized,'' said Alexander Pikayev, a military expert
at the Moscow Carnegie Center. ``Russia is not strong enough to
seriously confront the West, but it could become a big rogue state
with nuclear weapons,'' he added, calling the document's
confrontational tone ``very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Pikayev and others said domestic political concerns also played
a role in the document, which has been in the works since last
spring following NATO's airstrikes against Yugoslavia, a
traditional ally of Russia. The alliance's campaign in the Balkans
set off a wave of anti-American sentiment and violent
demonstrations here.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who became Russia's acting President when Boris Yeltsin
abruptly resigned on New Year's Eve, faces a snap election in just
over two months in which he is the overwhelming favorite. Since
being plucked from obscurity by Yeltsin to become prime minister,
Putin has spoken several times of his desire to revive Russia's
status as a great power and to beef up the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``That this document was released just before the election is no
accident,'' said Pikayev.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a weak imitation of a new Cold War,'' said Konstantin
Preobrazhensky, a retired foreign intelligence officer who served
in the Soviet-era KGB. ``This is a political step by Putin aimed at
winning the military's support.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``It is still very dangerous because it gives the
military a legal basis to act more aggressively and it will feed
into anti-Western sentiments among the public.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctrine was written in this way because there is an
anti-Western mood in the country. Everything the Kremlin does is
dictated by domestic political concerns,'' said retired Army
Colonel Alexander Zhilin, a Moscow-based military analyst. ``If the
mood in the country were different, then our leaders would be
kissing up to the West and declaring their love,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The document also said terrorism has increasingly become a
threat to Russia. In September, a series of apartment bombings
killed more than 300 people in Moscow and other Russian cities.
Officials here have blamed those blasts on Chechen separatist
rebels.

SOUTH KOREA PLANS TO DEVELOP SATELLITE-LAUNCH ROCKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Having succeeded in making computer memory
chips, consumer electronics and automobiles, South Korea has set
its sights on a far loftier goal: conquering outer space.
</P>
<P>
   The government plans to develop a rocket capable of ferrying
satellites into orbit within the next five years at a cost that
space agency officials estimate at between $500 million and $1
billion, although independent experts said the cost could run as
high several billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   While still in the planning stages, the effort represents a
South Korean bid to join the elite ranks of other space-faring
nations and free itself from dependence on other countries to
launch its satellites and provide military surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials have reservations about South Korea's
ambitions, fearing that that the project may not be economically
viable and that the rocket technology could be exported to
countries who may use it for military applications. South Korea
says the project can be sufficient funded and the rocket technology
would not be suitable for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the project in December, President Kim Dae-jung
said South Korea would build ``a working satellite-launching
facility by the year 2005, constructed with Korean technology and
equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   He promised adequate government funding for the rocket program
and for research and development in other high technology fields,
including electronics and computer software.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean space agency officials said they hope to build a
world-class space program, and they have grand visions of one day
working with the United States and other countries on projects like
a reusable space shuttle and an international space station.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's decision to develop a satellite launching station
reflects the dramatic comeback of this proud nation following the
Asian financial crisis which had caused the government to shelve
the project as overly costly.
</P>
<P>
   Although little is known about South Korea's rocket technology,
some satellite experts believe that the country could produce its
own satellite-launching vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But security experts and Western officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity, expressed concern that the technology that
South Korea hopes to develop to to launch satellites could also be
used to make long-range ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Without the proper checks and balances, they said that other
countries could view the space project as having military
applications and might lead to an arms race in northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of satellite rocket technology is transferable to
military applications, and other countries in the region are
certainly going to view South Korea's program through this prism,''
said a U.S. official who monitors missile and other weapons of
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons we are not fully pleased about countries
starting up space launch programs that are not economically viable
is that they could export the launching vehicle to someone else who
has no intention of using it for satellites,'' the official said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under a 1979 accord with the United States, South Korea agreed
to limit the range of its missiles to about 100 miles and promised
to abide by nonproliferation rules.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea has been seeking permission from the United States
to increase the range of its ballistic missiles after North Korea
test fired a medium-range missile in 1998 that flew over the
Japanese mainland and into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, North Korea claimed that the test launch was a
multi-stage rocket designed to put a satellite into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, North Korea threatened to test fire a second missile
with a much longer range but abandoned those plans after strong
international protests and after the United States agreed to lift
economic sanctions against the communist country.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States recently agreed to increase the
missile range limits for South Korea to up to 180 miles, Korean
officials want the United States to raise the missile range to 300
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Choi Dong-whan, president of the Korean Aerospace Research
Institute, the government space agency, said in an interview that
Korea's space-launching rocket program would be economically viable
and that the project would not have military applications.
</P>
<P>
   He said the space agency plans to develop a leaky fuel
propellant rocket system that is not useful for intercontinental
ballistic missiles, which typically employ a solid propellant.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean rocket is expected to have an altitude between
375 miles and 437 miles and initially would carry small satellites
used for mapping, coast-line surveillance and weather forecasting,
Choi said. South Korea would continue to rely on foreign firms to
launch heavier communications satellites that are placed in
geostatic orbit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to depend on other countries anymore,'' Choi
said. ``We pay a lot of money to outside countries and we have to
wait for launching time which is dependent on their schedule and
wastes our time and budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Space agency officials said South Korea needs to place at least
19 new satellites in orbit by the year 2025 and that the country
can build its own satellite launching pad for about the same cost
of paying a foreign firm to launch four or five of satellites.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea currently has six satellites, three for
communications and broadcasting and three for scientific research,
and all carried into orbit abroad by foreign made rockets.
</P>
<P>
   If its rocket is cost efficient, South Korea could also use the
technology to compete in the lucrative commercial satellite
launching business. The highly-competitive industry is currently
dominated by three major players: the Boeing Co.'s Delta rockets
and Lockheed Martin's Atlas rockets, both from the United States,
and Ariane rockets, made by the European consortium Arianespace.
Russia and China have small portions of the market.
</P>
<P>
   But space experts said that South Korea faces considerable
challenges building a launching vehicle made solely with its own
technology, particularly in integrating the various systems of the
rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Despite years of development and billions of dollars in
expenditures, many advanced countries still struggle to master
rocket technology.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Japan said that it was abandoning its troubled H-II
rocket project after a series of costly failures, including the
embarrassing lost of an H-II rocket that plunged into the Pacific
Ocean shortly after takeoff in November.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese, which had invested $4.14 billion in the program
since 1986, are still investigating the cause of the rocket
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Still a growing number of countries are announcing plans to
build their own satellites or develop rockets to launch them,
partly for the prestige that comes with such capability but also
for the possible commercial and technological applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more countries are realizing that space is really the
next frontier and not just for exploration,'' said Duane Brown, a
spokesman for NASA in the United States. ``It's expensive and takes
a lot of hard work and trial and error, but space has become a
global venture that makes a lot of sense.''

SHORT ITEM ON A MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Municipal Bonds, The Online Way &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Putting together a municipal bond portfolio has just become
easier, at least for online investors.
</P>
<P>
   With a click of some computer keys at its Walnut Creek, Calif.,
headquarters, eBondTrade.com, a new online muni bond trading site,
opened for business last Wednesday, offering individual investors
live price quotations, credit data and the ability to search a
large inventory to find the specific type of bond they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most efficient way that munis have ever been sold,''
said Richard W. Meister, the chief executive of eBondTrade.com, a
broker-dealer.
</P>
<P>
   The muni market has long been hobbled by a lack of transparency
_ individuals, institutions and even brokers often have little idea
of the exact market prices of bonds. To buy and sell them, they are
often at the mercy of brokerage firms' trading desks which
sometimes take a substantial cut of the price. And the time needed
to buy or sell a bond _ between placing an order and confirmation _
can be more than a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole process is fairly inefficient,'' said Meister, a
former managing director of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.. ``There hasn't
been much change.''
</P>
<P>
   EBondTrade has an inventory of more than $75 million of bonds,
all rated A or higher. Individuals, brokers and institutions can
gain access to the site, www.ebondtrade.com, and search the
inventory after registering. Aside from bid and offer prices, the
site has links that connect users to credit reports provided by
Fitch IBCA for different bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Gruye, president of eBondTrade, says it is in talks to
sign up other credit rating agencies, including Moody's Investor
Service.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum trade is for a face value amount of $25,000, typical
for a round lot of munis. Trades are completed in as little 30
seconds, with a brokerage account credited within three business
days.
</P>
<P>
   The service has the venture-capital backing of Philip F.
Anschutz, the Denver billionaire, as well as Chase Capital Partners
and Access Technology Partners. But what does Meister think about
starting his service after a year in which the Lehman Brothers
20-year municipal bond index lost 4.67 percent?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to bring investors back to the muni markets,'' he
said. &QL;

CLINTON OFFERS PROTECTION TO AVIATION WHISTLEBLOWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping to prevent aviation accidents before they occur,
President Clinton Friday unveiled a program designed to protect
airline pilots and mechanics from punishment if they quickly report
incidents _ such as taxiing onto an active runway or flying at too
high an altitude _ that could lead to catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   By using the so-called Aviation Safety Action Program, officials
hope to improve areas such as flight operations, airport signage,
pilot and mechanic training by learning about issues early on and
jointly resolving problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a completely different way of looking at safety,''
Clinton said. ``It requires business, labor and regulators to work
together in a completely different way _ as partners, not
adversaries. Everyone must focus on fixing problems, not fixing
blame.''
</P>
<P>
   The program grew out of a test at US Airways and was formally
adopted by American Airlines five years ago. It allows pilots and
mechanics to report an event to the company, a mistake they may
have made, and do it in a climate without punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The reporting process also involves the employee's union and the
FAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incentive upon the employee to do this is that there is no
threat that the company will come back and discipline the employee
and even less threat of regulatory action.'' said L. Nicholas
Lacey, director of the FAA's office of flight standards. The ASAP
program does not cover issues resulting from susbtance abuse,
alcohol, possible criminal acts, or willful violations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the American Airlines program, some 18,000 reports were
generated in a four-year period and improvements were made in
preflight checklists, airport signage and pilot training.
</P>
<P>
   When American extended the program to mechanics and dispatchers
``they improved equipment manuals and maintenace procedures,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials said 18 airlines _ virtually all the major US
airlines, many commuter airlines and cargo companies have expressed
interest in adopting programs.
</P>
<P>
   ASAP is a critical part in the Clinton Administration's goal of
reducing aviation accidents by 80 percent by the year 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Another program, known as Flight Operational Quality Assurance,
uses information taken from flight data recorders on routine
flights to track potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the combination of human collected data from ASAP and
real recordings of what was experienced by an aircraft in FOQA will
significantly impact on how aircraft are designed, how we train
flight crews, and how we set up flight procedures,'' said Lacey.

BUSH RIVALS SET FOR IOWA DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ Over the past eight days they have quarreled with
him in New Hampshire over taxes, dragged him into a Confederate
battle flag controversy in South Carolina, and questioned his
antiabortion commitment in Michigan, but so far they have failed to
shake Texas Governor George W. Bush's advantage in the race for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, in an Iowa debate, five Republican contenders will get
their last clear shot at Bush before voting begins, and they are
expected to try again to tarnish the man whose closest challenger
is more than 25 points behind in public opinion polls in this
state.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, sponsored by the Des Moines Register and televised
nationally, begins at 2 p.m. EST. It will last 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With Senator John McCain confining his campaign to New
Hampshire, Steve Forbes has emerged as Bush's most vocal opponent
in Iowa. But even as he attacks Bush, Forbes finds himself tussling
with Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes for favor among a formidable
Christian conservative faction in the Iowa GOP. Meanwhile, Senator
Orrin G. Hatch has been unable to keep pace with the other
campaigns and is running a distant sixth in the polls in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The debate may be the only obstacle that could break Bush's
stride. He has high poll numbers and an almost bottomless bank
account. But as an example of how these events can change dynamics,
Vice President Al Gore came out swinging from the first bell at
last Saturday's Democratic debate in Iowa and succeeded in putting
his challenger, Bill Bradley, on the defensive for much of the past
week.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than coasting on his lead, the Texas governor returned to
Iowa Friday to invigorate his network of supporters with a series
of public appearances leading up to the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials say Bush and Forbes have the two best
organizations in the state, resources that are important because
caucuses will be held in more than 2,100 places across Iowa on Jan.
24.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have the best ground operation in the state,''
said James Tobin, Forbes's political director. ``One of the things
Steve learned from '96, when he started late, was that he needed a
ground game as opposed to an air war.''
</P>
<P>
   The football similies refer to the grass-roots organization
Forbes has sown in each of Iowa's 99 counties this year to augment
an extensive television campaign. In 1996, Forbes relied on the
airwaves to attack Bob Dole. After being scolded for breaking the
GOP's ``eleventh commandment,'' thou shalt say no evil of a fellow
Republican, Forbes promised he would not repeat the tactics in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   But the scion of the wealthy Forbes family has underwritten new
ads accusing Bush of breaking a no-new-tax promise in Texas and
holding fuzzy positions on abortion. He is expected to be
aggressive Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked this week about the commercials aimed at Bush, Forbes told
reporters: ``If being negative is telling the truth, I will tell
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, a tireless exponent of a flat tax in 1996, is
emphasizing social issues. In a question that unwittingly hinted at
the inevitability of Bush's triumph, Forbes, during a debate in
Grand Rapids, Mich., on Monday night, asked Bush to pledge to
choose ``only pro-life judges'' and a ``pro-life running mate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the exact same question Mr. Bauer asked me during the
last couple of debates,'' Bush answered wearily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four times,'' Bauer deadpanned. ``Not that anybody's
counting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will work to keep the Republican Party pro-life,'' Bush said
and made no further promises. ``I appreciate your assumption about
me being the party nominee,'' he told Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Des Moines Register poll published a week ago,
Bush led Forbes 45 percent to 18 percent, with Keyes, McCain, and
Bauer in single-digits and closely bunched for third. A survey for
Midwest television stations released midweek showed similar
results, with Bush ahead of Forbes 46 percent to 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's appearance will be his first outing in Iowa since a
mid-December debate. Though he has made virtually no investment in
the state in terms of personal time, television commercials, or
staff, the program will give the Arizona senator another chance to
engage Bush on questions involving taxes and foreign policy. In
previous debates, the two candidates, who are locked in a close
race in New Hampshire, have sparred over leadership credentials.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidates have largely become part of a supporting
cast. Frustrated by a shortage of funds, Bauer and Keyes have had
to rely on their debating skills and cadres of dedicated followers
among the religious right to stay in the contest. Hatch's
constituency appears even more minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that such ``big names'' as Elizabeth Dole, Lamar
Alexander, and Dan Quayle have dropped out, Bauer was philosophical
as he set out on his latest tour of Iowa the other day. ``I'm
pleased that I'm still standing,'' he said.

NEW MUSIC FOR AN OLD BUILDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The old building got a face lift and now, for one
night at least, it's in the facial rearrangement business.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night Radio City Music Hall will play host to its first
professional fight card when undisputed light heavyweight champion
Roy Jones Jr. is led down the building's famous circular staircase
by a troop of Rockettes and into the ring to meet challenger David
Telesco. When he gets there, it will be a crowning moment for a
landmark whose founder probably never thought the kind of
entertainment Jones provides would grace the stage he had built 67
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Radio City was the world's largest indoor theatre when it opened
Dec. 27, 1932, and for years it was one of the world's
entertainment showcases. But like most things, the building grew
old, hurt by age and inattention, until Cablevision signed a
20-year lease last year and poured $70 million into restoring it,
as it was in the days when Roxy Rothafel ruled an entertainment
palace the New York Herald Tribune called at its opening ``the most
remarkable auditorium ever built.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a building that had housed many things, but never a
boxing match. That's a trend that would have continued were it not
for the NBA's schedule-makers and Jones's willingness to ignore an
extra million dollars for a chance to make a little history.
</P>
<P>
   Had the New York Knicks not been scheduled to play the Charlotte
Hornets Saturday night at Madison Square Garden, Jones would be
facing Telesco in a building that used to be called ``the Mecca of
Boxing,'' but is now considerably less despite its recent comeback
under the direction of boxing director Kevin Wynne.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, executives from HBO and Madison Square Garden sat in
a dining room at Time Warner Inc.'s offices and batted about places
to host the fight. The first suggestion was The Theatre at Madison
Square Garden, but Jones had already worked there and had no
interest in a repeat performance.
</P>
<P>
   HBO executives Seth Abraham and Lou DiBella then suggested going
to the legendary Apollo Theatre in Harlem, an idea that has been
floated before without any luck. About that time, Wynne voiced an
idea discussed before but never really thought possible. He
suggested to Jones's promoter, Murad Muhammad, that perhaps Radio
City might work.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the bombastic entrepreneur, Muhammad jumped on history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been kicking around the idea of possibly trying to put a
fight into Radio City, but the circumstances were never right,''
said Wynne, who has brought back major boxing to the Garden,
reviving the place as a boxing palace and prize fighting as a
viable sport in New York. ``Big names want such huge site fees that
we couldn't afford to do it in a 5,900-seat house, but I threw it
out to Murad and he asked if anyone had ever fought there before.
When I told him no, he said, `Fantastic. We'll do it. Roy will do
it to be a part of history.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy really made this happen. He was willing to take less money
than he could get from a casino (a reported $1 million less than
the Grand Casino in Biloxi, Miss., was willing to put up) to be the
first champion in history to defend his title there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few fighters today have enough fan appeal to fill 16,000
seats. And even if they do, there are even fewer opponents who are
compelling enough to bring people out en masse. But because of
Roy's cooperation, we feel we can make this unique enough to charge
enough to make some money and put on a show that will make
history.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of entertainment history has been made at Radio City but
the building had taken on the battered appearance of an old
fighter, still possessing some grace but frayed around the edges.
</P>
<P>
   Things were different in the '30s. More ornate work was done on
buildings. They weren't mere blocks of cement, but featured
limestone exteriors and intricate woodworking, all of which the
renovation project stayed true to. Care was taken to make it look
as much like the original hall as possible. Additional millions
were spent to re-create the carpeting that was down the night the
place opened. Hours of research and meticulous workmanship went
into finding examples of original wallpaper and paint colors and
reproducing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had become a dilapidated place,'' said Dan Schoenberg, who
now works in public relations for the Knicks but was serving in a
similar capacity at Radio City during the remodeling and the grand
opening Oct. 4. ``It took them three weeks just to get the
scaffoldings up in the place before the work began.''
</P>
<P>
   It took six months to restore the famous Fountain of Youth mural
with 20 people working on it, 1 square foot at a time. More than
750 gallons of paint were needed for the auditorium's proscenium
ceiling and 675,000 sheets of metal leaf were used on the ceiling
of the Grand Foyer, promenades, and the undersides of the
mezzanines. Cablevision even brought in a representative of the
American Seating Corp., which was used for the original seat design
in 1932, to help ensure accuracy in the work that was done on the
carpets, wallpaper, light fixtures, and seating.
</P>
<P>
   When the project was completed, a huge bash, featuring Billy
Crystal, Liza Minnelli, Sting, Mary J. Blige, and, of course, the
Rockettes, was held. Three months later, arguably the world's best
fighter will be brought through Radio City's doors to defend his
title against a guy who can punch with the kind of power that
upsets are made of.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean Telesco will pull one off, but it does mean
Radio City is getting the kind of boxing event a place with its
history deserves. It's getting a soldout gala, with 5,700 seats
filled, many by people more interested in the building and the
oddity of boxers being inside it.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of the reason, they will be there because Jones
agreed to show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Murad said Roy would do this, I was skeptical,'' Wynne
said. ``He said he wasn't the prototypical athlete only interested
in making money, and his words were borne out. Roy proved he's an
athlete not driven by the dollar. He wants to make what he's worth,
but he also had the vision to see fighting here was a way to set
himself apart. He's looking for a place in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people will be floored to see this building. I
promised them it would be breathtaking and when they first saw it
they were speechless.''

OPEC MOVE LIFTS OIL PRICES TO HIGHEST RATE IN 9 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The price of oil, which had been stuck in a trading range since
it popped above $27 a barrel once in November, topped $28 a barrel
Friday after an OPEC committee recommended extending current
production cuts beyond the March expiration date.
</P>
<P>
   The surge, which pushed oil to its highest price since the
beginning of the Persian Gulf war nine years ago, also pulled up
the prices of home heating oil and gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Some oil analysts had predicted that the production cuts would
be extended,. but this is the first formal move by the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries to do so. And although the
announcement did not say how long the extension would be, it was
tougher than some analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
   The length of the extension will be decided by a full meeting of
OPEC members in March. But the talk leading up to the meeting had
been of an extension of at least six months. The recommendation for
the extension was made by OPEC's Ministerial Monitoring Committee,
which reviews how closely member countries have adhered to the
production cutbacks. The committee met in Vienna, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this strong a statement with a consensus was
expected,'' said Frederick P. Leuffer, senior energy analyst at
Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. ``If they do what they say, my model says we
will all be waiting on gas lines this summer.'' He also said that
the price of oil should easily pass $30 a barrel now if the
agreement holds.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for $30-plus oil, he said, is that crude oil and
product inventories are now the lowest they have been since the end
of 1997 and would drain to very tight levels if OPEC continues
holding back production at the current rate of 4.3 million barrels
a day.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Leuffer said, OPEC has backed off production cuts
when oil inventories got low. But he said this statement makes the
group sound much more determined than it has been previously.
Still, he said that once the price spiked up, OPEC would restore
some production and the price of oil would fall later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Although American oil inventories are low, the statement issued
after the Vienna meeting said that OPEC officials think that
overall world inventories are too high. This is probably because
the price rise of 112 percent last year was not holding. From the
$27.07 high in November, the oil price had fallen 10.5 percent to
$24.22 last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of the continuing market volatility and the remaining
high stock levels, all those present at the meeting agreed to
strongly recommend the extension of the current agreement,'' said
Fernando Garay, an OPEC spokesman, according to Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price
of oil for February delivery rose $1.33, or 5 percent, to $28.02 a
barrel. The price of the near-term home heating oil futures
contract rose 4.53 cents, or 6.5 percent, to 73.81 cents a gallon,
its highest since the end of 1996. The price of the
unleaded-gasoline contract for February climbed 3.25 cents, or 4.6
percent, to 74.53 cents a gallon, back near the high of 77.11 cents
a gallon it hit in November.
</P>
<P>
   The price of oil has been moving up all week as comments from
OPEC members suggested that they would agree to extend the
production cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Iran's deputy oil minister, Kazempour Ardebili, said
that OPEC oil ministers wanted to extend the production reductions
at least another three months.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Ali as-Naimi, was
reported to have said that members of OPEC had already agreed to
extend the product cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Friday, before the Vienna meeting, the Iranian oil
minister, Namdar Zanganeh, said he expected OPEC members to approve
a six-month extension of the production cuts. ``We think we are
going to get a unanimous decision,'' he said.

MINNESOTA QB GEORGE IN A WELCOME TRANSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EARTH CITY, Mo. _ Lost in the tongue-in-cheek hoopla of whether
even the most powerful computers will be quick enough to add up the
points Sunday when the Vikings invade the Trans World Dome for a
wide-open NFC playoff game against the St. Louis Rams is the
subject of Minnesota quarterback Jeff George.
</P>
<P>
   All of football outside of Minnesota has been waiting for George
to play like Jeff George, and so far George hasn't. The
self-centered, selfish, coach-killing quarterback so well known and
disliked in Indianapolis, Atlanta, and Oakland has yet to make an
appearance for the Vikings. Instead, George has been solid, stable,
and a winner.
</P>
<P>
   And Vikings coach Dennis Green has yet to receive his due for
the transformation of George. This is the second straight year
Green has revived a quarterback from the football dead and, quite
clearly, the play of Randall Cunningham last season and George this
season can't be merely a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one thing, we have continuity,'' said Green, refusing
to toot his own horn. ``So we have the exact same system that we
put in years ago. So whether it was Rich Gannon or Sean Salisbury
or Warren Moon or Brad Johnson or Randall Cunningham or Jeff
George, I think the players already know the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. Several of those quarterbacks who have played from
good to very good under Green were new to the Vikings' system. Such
as George this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think also, we have a lot of players _ and not just
quarterbacks _ who in this day and age sign just one-year contracts
and come in and play just one year,'' said Green. ``And we think we
have a system these guys understand. Many times they are looking to
revitalize their career and we don't have a problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Green is the dean of NFL coaches, finishing his eighth season as
Vikings coach (tied with Pittsburgh's Bill Cowher for longevity).
And when he notices Ray Rhodes fired after only a year at Green
Bay, Chan Gailey gone after only two seasons in Dallas, and Pete
Carroll after three in New England, he instinctively rebels at the
trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Continuity is probably the best way to have a successful
program,'' said Green. ``I know the grass always looks greener on
the other side of the fence, but the more changes you make and the
more things you have to do, I think the more difficult it is. I
don't think there's a magic system. I don't think there's a magic
pill, but I do know that I think continuity is the best way to
build a progran. Every time you change, you have to start over
again.''
</P>
<P>
   George, for his part, has taken to giving vanilla answers to any
questions about his transformation. Criticism, he said, ``goes with
the job. It's just part of the game. If you're a young guy, a
second- or third-year guy, you tend to worry about that more. But
I've been around too long to worry about what people think of me.''
</P>
<P>
   And lately, people are saying only good words about George. And
Green should be taking a bow for what many thought was impossible.

YES, HE'S OFF HIS ROCKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, Jan. 17.)  
(lh) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like most sensitive Americans, I have spent a great deal of time
wringing my hands over the remarks made by Atlanta Braves pitcher
John Rocker in Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks were so offensive that I cannot repeat them here for
fear that you will go blind or your newspaper will spontaneously
combust in your hands.
</P>
<P>
   But trust me when I say they are the most lame-brained remarks
to come out of a professional athlete's mouth in at least a week,
maybe longer.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rocker is in big trouble. He was made to undergo
psychological testing to see if he has a mental disorder, and there
is a possibility _ quite remote, I would think _ that he will be
kicked off the team and maybe even banned from baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It is my opinion that Rocker deserves whatever happens to him
because Americans are dependent upon professional athletes for
guidance in the important social issues of our time, and Rocker has
let us down.
</P>
<P>
   The way I look at it, if you can't take lessons about the human
condition from a guy who throws 95-mph heat and talks to himself on
the mound, then there is something fundamentally wrong with our
society.
</P>
<P>
   Professional baseball players only work six months a year, so
they have a lot of free time to contemplate race relations, the
AIDS virus and immigration law. While some cynics might argue that
a man who lives in a mansion and makes $10 million a year is
unlikely to generate great insight on the plight of single mothers
or the urban poor, I prefer to think that a huge salary and
four-hour workdays help sharpen a player's mind and heighten his
compassion for those who aren't similarly blessed.
</P>
<P>
   While it is true that professional ballplayers are not, as a
group, particularly well-educated and that their hobbies tend to
lean more toward hunting and fishing than theater and ballet, that
does not mean they are a bunch of unsophisticated louts.
</P>
<P>
   For example, during a game you may notice that the third-base
coach gives a lot of bizarre-looking signals to the batter.
Sportscasters would have you believe that the coach is telling the
batter to hit, bunt, take the pitch or do some other
baseball-related thing.
</P>
<P>
   Nice theory, but untrue.
</P>
<P>
   When the coach touches the brim of his hat, he's asking the
hitter: ``Have you read any good existential fiction lately?''
</P>
<P>
   When he swipes his hand across his chest, he's saying: ''I can't
get enough of that National Public Radio.''
</P>
<P>
   To the untrained eye, baseball players seem to spend an
inordinate amount of time spitting and scratching. While these may
appear to be nothing more than rude mannerisms, they are really the
outward manifestations of deep thought. You will notice that
President Clinton hardly spits or scratches at all when he is on
national TV, which could explain how he got in that mess with
Monica Lewinsky and why Al Gore treats him like a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, professional baseball players have a huge social
obligation over and above going to the opposite field and breaking
up the double-play. We live by their example and depend on them to
teach us the difference between right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   When someone like John Rocker betrays this trust, we all feel
the pain.

GORE ASSAILS BUSH ON LACK OF ANTIBIAS VIGOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore Friday plunged into South Carolina's
racial politics debate, saying Texas Governor George W. Bush
undercuts his claim to be a ``compassionate conservative'' by
accepting support from a contributor who described the NAACP as the
association of ``retarded people'' and then compounded the problem
by apologizing to the mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to reconcile tolerating that kind of
hatefulness'' with being a compassionate conservative, Gore said in
an interview with the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bush, the Republican front-runner, has avoided taking
a position on whether the confederate flag should continue flying
over the South Carolina Capitol, arguing that the decision should
be left to the people of the state, Gore said the flag was a racist
symbol and should be removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents, for many Americans, a painful episode in our
history that is recalled by some other Americans as a way of
reaffirming their belief in racial superiority and support of
discrimination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A a result, I think the Confederate flag should be removed
from the state Capitol in South Carolina and should not be used as
a symbol of any institution that is supposed to be representative
of and accessible to all of our citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he had not heard about South Carolina state Senator
Author Ravenel's remark about the NAACP until Friday when asked by
a Globe reporter for a comment. Ravenel, a Charleston Republican
and minor contributor to Bush, referred to the NAACP as the
association of ``retarded people'' in remarks last Saturday at a
``save the flag'' rally. The South Carolinian later apologized to
``the retarded folks of the world for equating them to the national
NAACP.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for his opinion of those remarks, Gore laughed in
disbelief and said: ``Whoa. I did not read that comment.'' He went
on to say, ``I can't imagine that kind of hatefulness being
tolerated.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The U.S. Army has launched a special
investigation into a complex flight-control system suspected in
more than 60 aviation incidents involving Apache helicopters,
including a fatal crash last year near Kosovo that helped ignite a
national debate over the readiness of the Apache fleet.
</P>
<P>
   At least three serious accidents since 1985 are linked to
problems with the Apache's flight-control system, a Dayton Daily
News examination found. In addition, the examination found, the
same system remains a suspect in at least two other major crashes.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is the May 5, 1999, crash near Kosovo that killed
both pilots. That crash _ the second in nine days _ is now part of
a separate U.S. Justice Department examination, the Daily News has
learned.
</P>
<P>
   The other is a December 1997 crash near Fort Hood, Texas, that
also killed both pilots and is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit
against the companies that manufactured the flight-control system.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News examined never-before-released computer records
from the Army Safety Center, hundreds of pages of Army accident
reports and interviewed former and current pilots, accident
investigators and employees of the companies that helped design and
produce the AH-64 Apache and its flight-control system.
</P>
<P>
   The examination found that much of the suspicion by the Army and
its aviators over problems in the flight-control system is directed
at BUCS, the helicopter's unique emergency backup control system.
</P>
<P>
   The BUCS was designed to control the movements of the Apache
electronically if the helicopter's mechanical controls become
jammed or severed during combat or other emergency. But the BUCS
had problems, and the system was disconnected in the first 529
Apaches to roll off the assembly line in the 1980s, and is still
disconnected in a majority of the fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The BUCS is just one of several problems plaguing the Apache _
problems raising questions about whether the Apache, the military's
most advanced and lethal attack helicopter, is capable of
performing its mission.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the Apache fleet of 743 helicopters remains
grounded to replace bearings in the tail rotors or to replace
transmission parts.
</P>
<P>
   From 1998 to 1999, the rate of serious accidents involving
Apaches nearly doubled, from 2.97 accidents per 100,000 flight
hours to 5.72 _ a rate of one major accident every 17,500 hours.
And during a nine-day period last year, the Army lost two of the 24
Apaches it brought to Albania to support operations in Kosovo.

</P>
<P>
   At least seven other countries also fly the Apache. Just last
month, Armed Forces News Wire Service reported that the Israeli Air
Force faulted Boeing and the U.S. Army for the fatal crash of an
Israeli Apache in June. The Israelis charged Boeing with
``systematic design flaws in the Apache's hydraulic system and
auxiliary power unit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Apache was developed by Hughes Helicopter as the Army's
newest attack helicopter. In 1983, the company was purchased by
McDonnell Douglas, and in 1997 McDonnell Douglas was purchased by
Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Though the military bought the expensive BUCS system to help
Apaches become better able to survive combat, the Army acknowledged
that the percentage of Apaches sent to Desert Storm with the BUCS
turned on was ``very low.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to the Daily News, the Army called 55 of
the 61 incidents linked to BUCS minor, resulting in less than
$2,000 in damage or the disruption of a mission. At least four
incidents, the Army says, are classified as Class A accidents,
currently defined as causing a death or total permanent disability,
at least $1 million in damage or loss or an aircraft regardless of
the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Three helicopters, the Army says, were ``saved'' by BUCS. The
Army did not identify the incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has not been a single incident during the life of the
aircraft where BUCS failure has been identified as the direct cause
of an accident when the aircraft was operated in accordance with
Army flight manuals,'' said Ken Jensen, a Boeing spokesperson at
the company's Apache plant in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   A special ``Red Team'' of aviation experts began investigating
the Apache's flight-control system last year. In December, the Army
released two safety messages related to BUCS. One announced that
the Red Team had identified specific actions required to ``reduce
risk,'' including increased training for pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The September 1999 issue of the Army's own aviation safety
magazine, Flightfax, says BUCS has ``become synonymous with . . .
aircraft loss of control and, in general, demons in the Apaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aviators fear the system, crew chiefs avoid it when possible,
armament personnel loathe the system and maintenance officers are
in awe of it,'' the article says.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Bowers, pregnant with her second child when her husband's
Apache crashed near Fort Hood in 1997, said she first learned about
BUCS at her husband's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just told it was the BUCS,'' Bowers said. ``I think all
the pilots know there has been a problem with it (BUCS), but what
can they do? They're like slaves to the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Army records show a part linked to BUCS was suspected to have
malfunctioned on a helicopter that crashed at Fort Hood, Texas, in
1990, resulting in only minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In its written response to the newspaper regarding that crash,
the Army acknowledged that one of the linear variable differential
transducer (LVDT) probes had malfunctioned ``just prior to or
during the accident sequence.'' LVDTs, located throughout the
flight-control system, monitor coordination between movements of
the control sticks and pedals and movements of the servocylinders.
</P>
<P>
   Should an LVDT sense a problem, it can trigger an activation of
BUCS. If the LVDT is not set properly _ called setting the nulls _
it can signal danger when there is none, activating BUCS when
pilots aren't expecting it.
</P>
<P>
   However, a written response from Boeing says, ``The broken
(LVDT) probe was not the cause of the accident.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, the BUCS in an Apache flying at Fort Knox, Ky.,
unexpectedly came on, although the pilot was able to land the
helicopter. After the incident, the Army again became concerned
about LVDTs, the part replaced after the 1990 Fort Hood crash.
</P>
<P>
   After the Fort Knox incident, the Army acknowledged in its
written response to the Daily News, it prepared a safety message,
but the draft copy was misplaced when personnel and files were
moved from St. Louis to a new office in Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Fatal Texas crash
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 4, 1997, Chief Warrant Officer Phillip Wayne Bowers and
Capt. Donald J. Lee, the Army Aviation Association of America's
1996 Aviator of the Year, were flying a BUCS-active Apache on a
daytime training mission near San Saba, Texas. The crew of a nearby
Apache saw the accident happen.
</P>
<P>
   With no warning and for no apparent reason, the Apache Bowers
and Lee were flying banked left and flew into a rocky hillside at
100 mph, breaking the helicopter into pieces thrown more than 200
feet away as it burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of pilots were considered as talented at Lee,
making the possibility of pilot error at least questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a BUCS activation is the most plausible explanation
for the crash at this point,'' said Dallas attorney Jon Kettles,
one of several lawyers representing the two women left widowed by
the accident. ``It was a smooth left turn right into the ground,
and pilots just don't do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not normal for two pilots to voluntarily kill
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Kettles, a former Army helicopter pilot and former engineer at
the Army Safety Center, said he suspects the LVDT null settings
were not checked as required.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Fort Hood accident, the Army was still more
than a year away from releasing its safety message concerning LVDT
settings _ the message prepared after the 1996 Fort Knox incident
but later lost.
</P>
<P>
   An Army investigation found that all four shear pins, designed
to break and activate BUCS during emergencies, had broken and that
the ``BUCS-ON'' light was illuminated. In addition, the report
says, the LVDTs were found in a position ``suggesting that a
possible uncommanded BUCS-on condition may have occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   But the investigation also found that the shear pins, the
``BUCS-ON'' light and the LVDTs could be explained by the impact of
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not enough evidence to support anything,'' said
Marvin Armour, an Apache test pilot who assisted in the Army's
safety investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But Armour, who officially leaves the Army next month, said
eyewitness accounts seemed to point to some type of uncommanded
flight input.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't believe they would have made such a stupid
mistake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's public report on the 1997 Fort Hood crash does not
pinpoint a cause, but two of the five recommendations in the report
concerned flight controls: One calling for improved BUCS training
and another calling for the Army to initiate an investigation of
uncommanded flight control inputs.
</P>
<P>
   Fatal Albania crash
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999 _ 16 months after the fatal Fort Hood crash and 2
1/2 years after the original safety message was misplaced _ the
Army issued a Safety of Flight message warning that LVDTs ``may
move out'' of position.
</P>
<P>
   On May 5, two days before the compliance deadline for the safety
message, an Apache helicopter conducting a night training mission
in preparation for combat in Kosovo was leading a formation of five
helicopters over mountainous terrain in Albania when it began to
slow and move right. As the crew of another helicopter watched, the
nose of the Apache then pitched up as the helicopter rolled rapidly
to the right, falling 150 feet to the ground and exploding in
flames.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Warrant Officer David Gibbs, 38, of Massillon, Ohio, and
Chief Warrant Officer Kevin Reichert, 28, of Chetek, Wis., were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The crash _ the second in nine days involving one of the 24
Apaches sent to Albania _ raised serious questions about the
readiness of the fleet of Apaches, which never entered combat in
Kosovo. There's no indication the first crash was related to BUCS.
</P>
<P>
   Findings, conclusions, recommendations and witness statements of
Army safety investigations usually are secret. Releasable portions
of the final report are not expected to be made public until as
late as April.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army won't give me anything,'' said Reichert's wife,
Ridgely. ``I've asked for the safety report. I've asked them for
updates on how the safety report is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   In its written response to the Dayton Daily News, the Army
refused to discuss the accident in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``This accident is still under investigation, and it would be
improper to speculate on the final results of the investigation,''
the Army's response says.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department is now conducting its own
examination into the fatal crash in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did BUCS cause the accident? Unknown,'' Mark Metzger, Boeing's
flight operations manager for the Apache program, says in a memo
about the crash. ``The physical data doesn't support it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 23, the Army released two more safety messages
concerning BUCS.
</P>
<P>
   One of the messages called for an inspection of all BUCS
servocylinders to ensure that a sealant is applied to the threads
of the LVDT probe. A movement of the probe out of the null setting,
the message says, ``will cause BUCS system activation.''
Application of the sealant, the message says, ``eliminates this
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The other safety message announced that a special Army ``Red
Team'' of aviation experts had identified specific actions to
``reduce risk'' involving BUCS, including increasing training for
pilots.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The U.S. Army has launched a special
investigation into a complex flight-control system suspected in
more than 60 aviation incidents involving Apache helicopters,
including a fatal crash last year near Kosovo that helped ignite a
national debate over the readiness of the Apache fleet.
</P>
<P>
   At least three serious accidents since 1985 are linked to
problems with the Apache's flight control system, a Dayton Daily
News examination found. In addition, the examination found, the
same system remains a suspect in at least two other major crashes.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is the crash near Kosovo, which is now part of a
separate U.S. Justice Department examination, the Daily News has
learned.
</P>
<P>
   The other is a December 1997 crash near Fort Hood, Texas, which
also killed both pilots and is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit
against the companies that manufactured the flight control system.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News examined never-before-released computer records
from the Army Safety Center and hundreds of pages of Army accident
reports and interviewed former and current pilots, accident
investigators and employees of the companies that helped design and
produce the $16 million Apache and its flight control system.
</P>
<P>
   The examination found that much of the suspicion by the Army and
its aviators over problems in the flight control system is directed
at BUCS, the helicopter's unique emergency backup control system.
</P>
<P>
   The BUCS was designed to control the movements of the Apache
electronically if the helicopter's mechanical controls become
jammed or severed during combat or other emergency. But the BUCS
has had problems, and the system was disconnected in the first 529
Apaches to roll off the assembly line in the 1980s, and it is still
disconnected in a majority of the fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The BUCS is just one of several problems plaguing the Apache _
problems raising questions about whether the military's most
advanced and lethal attack helicopter is capable of performing its
mission.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the Apache fleet remains grounded because of
problems with bearings in the tail rotor system, and in November,
the Army announced it would begin inspecting the entire fleet of
743 helicopters for problems in the transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   From 1998 to 1999, the rate of serious accidents involving
Apaches nearly doubled, from 2.97 accidents per 100,000 flight
hours to 5.72 _ a rate of one major accident every 17,500 hours.
And during a nine-day period last year, the Army lost two of the 24
Apaches it brought to Albania to support operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven other countries also fly the Apache. Just last
month, Armed Forces News Wire Service reported that the Israeli Air
Force faulted Boeing and the U.S. Army for the fatal crash of an
Israeli Apache in June. The Israelis charged Boeing with
``systematic design flaws in the Apache's hydraulic system and
auxiliary power unit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Apache was developed by Hughes Helicopter as the Army's
newest attack helicopter. In 1983, the company was purchased by
McDonnell-Douglas, and in 1997 McDonnell-Douglas was purchased by
Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Though the military bought the expensive BUCS system to help
Apaches become better able to survive combat, the Army acknowledged
that the percentage of Apaches sent to Desert Storm with the BUCS
turned on was ``very low.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to the Daily News, the Army called 55 of
the 61 incidents linked to BUCS minor, resulting in less than
$2,000 in damage or the disruption of a mission. At least four
incidents, the Army says, are classified as Class A accidents,
causing a death or total permanent disability, at least $1 million
in damage or loss of an aircraft regardless of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Three helicopters, the Army says, were ``saved'' by BUCS. The
Army did not identify the incidents.
</P>
<P>
   A special ``Red Team'' of aviation experts began investigating
the Apache's flight control system last year. In December, it
released two safety messages related to BUCS. One announced that
the Red Team had identified specific actions required to ``reduce
risk,'' including increased training for pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The September 1999 issue of the Army's own aviation safety
magazine, Flightfax, says BUCS has ``become synonymous with ...
aircraft loss of control and, in general, demons in the Apaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aviators fear the system, crew chiefs avoid it when possible,
armament personnel loathe the system and maintenance officers are
in awe of it,'' the article says.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Bowers, pregnant with her second child when her husband's
Apache crashed near Fort Hood in 1997, said she first learned about
BUCS at her husband's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just told it was the BUCS,'' Bowers said. ``I think all
the pilots know there has been a problem with it, but what can they
do? They're like slaves to the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Backup control system
</P>
<P>
   Like other helicopters, the Apache is controlled by sticks and
foot pedals linked mechanically to hydraulic servocylinders. The
servocylinders control the movements of the main and tail rotors,
which determine the direction of the helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other helicopters, the Apache's mechanical control
system is backed up by an electronic system, BUCS. If the Apache's
mechanical controls become jammed or severed during combat or other
emergency, BUCS is designed to allow pilots to operate the
helicopter's hydraulic servocylinders electronically.
</P>
<P>
   But pilots and other experts suspect that BUCS is taking control
of the helicopters when there is no emergency, causing so-called
``uncommanded flight control inputs'' _ steep banks, sharp turns or
other unusual maneuvers not initiated by the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Once BUCS is engaged, there's no turning back. To return to
mechanical flight control, a helicopter has to land and undergo
ground maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they first came out with the BUCS system, I had some
concerns about it,'' said Richard Langer, former chief Apache
quality assurance supervisor for McDonnell-Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   BUCS was deactivated on the first 529 Apaches because the system
wasn't working correctly, Langer said. To deactivate BUCS, shear
pins that were designed to break and activate BUCS during
emergencies were replaced with solid steel pins.
</P>
<P>
   But even shutting off BUCS proved to be hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   The Apache that Henry Fowler and fellow test pilot Stu Park
climbed aboard on June 17, 1985, had solid steel pins in it, Fowler
said.
</P>
<P>
   As Fowler and Park started the engines, the helicopter _ the
31st production helicopter to come off the assembly line _ rolled
left and came to rest on its side, causing nearly $300,000 in
damage. BUCS was blamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was supposed to be shut off,'' said Fowler, who now works
for Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   That same month, the Army issued a Safety of Flight message, a
directive designed to inform pilots and mechanics of potential
aircraft dangers and of solutions the military has proposed to
mitigate those dangers. The message instructed Apache units to
``totally disable the BUCS.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said crews began removing BUCS parts in the hydraulic
servocylinders to make sure the system wouldn't come on again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on in the Apache fielding, aviator mistrust of the BUCS,
exacerbated by an incident at the aircraft plant involving
inadvertent BUCS activation, led to a decision to inactivate
BUCS,'' the article in the Army's safety magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   BUCS turned on
</P>
<P>
   The decision to deactivate BUCS was reversed in 1988, and for
the first time Apaches began leaving the assembly line in Mesa,
Ariz., with the BUCS turned on. In November 1989, the 530th Apache
to roll off the assembly line was delivered to the Army as the
first helicopter with an activated BUCS.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots began referring to their Apaches as either
``BUCS-active'' or ``non-BUCS,'' and they became very aware of
which type they were flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an argument since BUCS hit the flight line
whether to turn it on or turn it off,'' said Thomas Boucher, who
flew Apaches for 10 years and trained Army instructor pilots before
retiring in 1994. ``There are a lot of concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those concerns is training. Pilots must make
life-and-death decisions in the critical seconds it takes BUCS to
engage, and the helicopter handles differently when BUCS moves the
controls electronically. But ``training on BUCS had never been
considered a critical task item,'' the Flightfax article says.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 minutes of the Army flight controls portion of the
aircraft qualification course is devoted to BUCS, the article says,
and, ``There is no simulator or BUCS flight training.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 15, 1990, one year after the first BUCS-active
helicopter was delivered to the Army and as 430,000 American troops
were assembling in the Persian Gulf, Warrant Officers James D.
Ellis and Samuel D. Gentsch were flying an Apache on a daytime
training mission in Texas when they heard a loud noise while
hovering at 50 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter began falling, its tail and main rotor blades
mowing down several small trees before the aircraft hit the ground
_ impacting with enough force to send a 2.75-inch rocket pod into
the main rotor blades, knocking the pod 84 feet from the crash
site. Gentsch carried Ellis from the wreckage, which had started to
catch fire.
</P>
<P>
   Both pilots escaped with only minor injuries, but the helicopter
was destroyed. The Army estimated the total cost of the accident at
$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Army records examined by the Daily News show a part linked to
BUCS was suspected to have malfunctioned on the helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   In its written response to the newspaper, the Army acknowledged
that one of the linear variable differential transducer (LVDT)
probes had malfunctioned ``just prior to or during the accident
sequence.'' LVDTs, located throughout the flight control system,
monitor coordination between movements of the control sticks and
pedals and movements of the servocylinders.
</P>
<P>
   Should an LVDT sense a problem, it can trigger an activation of
BUCS. If the LVDT is not set properly, it can signal danger when
there is none, activating BUCS when pilots aren't expecting it.
</P>
<P>
   A written response from Boeing says, ``The broken probe was not
the cause of the accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Although investigators did not positively identify the source of
the malfunction in the 1990 crash, the Army response says, they did
determine that an LVDT failed because of a ``substandard weld.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1991, two months after the accident, the Army issued
a Safety of Flight message for BUCS-active Apaches warning of
problems with welds on LVDTs. The message said 108 aircraft would
get replacement servocylinders.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's written response says that after the accident it quit
using LVDTs made by the same manufacturer and began using LVDTs
that had two methods of attachments.
</P>
<P>
   Another crash and more questions
</P>
<P>
   Less than two years later, on Sept. 28, 1992, civilian test
pilots James Mecklin and John Tulloch were flying a new BUCS-active
Apache over Delaware as part of a test for a classified project.
The test involved rapid movements of the flight controls _
movements that could cause the helicopter to believe it was
experiencing control problems and activate BUCS.
</P>
<P>
   As the controls moved during a 60-foot hover, the helicopter
went into an unexpected right roll and began to fall. Tulloch moved
his controls to stop the helicopter from rolling, but in seconds
the main rotor hit the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Mecklin broke his left arm and was pinned in the helicopter.
Tulloch suffered back injuries. The helicopter was destroyed, and
the Army estimated the total cost of the accident at $10.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher, the Apache pilot assigned by the Army to assist in the
investigation, said the cause of the accident was identified as a
malfunction in a microswitch used to activate BUCS. The
malfunction, he said, was linked to how certain BUCS parts were
being removed from the helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   In its written response, the Army blamed the accident on
``unauthorized maintenance at the factory during manufacture.'' No
other Apaches were found to have malfunctioning microswitches, the
Army response says, but new procedures were implemented as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   After the accident, Boucher said, the Army grounded all
BUCS-active Apaches to inspect the microswitches. The inspections,
he said, generated 86 reports on a variety of issues concerning
BUCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them were potential accidents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after the accident, in November 1992, the Army issued
a Safety of Flight message, warning that a recent accident
investigation had identified a problem with a BUCS microswitch. The
message recommended inspecting 220 aircraft. An inspection already
completed, the message said, found that several helicopters were
``shown to have relatively minor quality problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Mecklin, a former Air Force maintenance test pilot who flew
helicopters for 40 years before retiring in 1994, has a different
opinion on the accident. Mecklin said the shear pins designed to
activate BUCS simply break too easily.
</P>
<P>
   The time lapse between breaking a shear pin and activating BUCS
is critical. The Army says there is a one- to three-second delay
before BUCS engages.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 2 1/2 seconds, we were on the ground,'' Mecklin said. ``So
much for your backup control system.''
</P>
<P>
   The September 1992 crash wasn't the helicopter's only incident
involving BUCS. Records from the Army Safety Center show that on
Jan. 29, 1992, one of the shear pins designed to break during an
emergency and activate BUCS accidentally broke while the helicopter
was on the ground. The pin, records show, was replaced the same
day.
</P>
<P>
   Accidents trigger `null' concerns
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, the BUCS in an Apache flying at Fort Knox, Ky.,
unexpectedly came on, although the pilot was able to land the
helicopter. After the incident, the Army again became concerned
about LVDTs, the part replaced after the 1990 Fort Hood crash.
</P>
<P>
   If the LVDT is not set properly, it can signal danger when there
is none, activating BUCS when pilots aren't expecting it.
</P>
<P>
   Setting the LVDT _ called setting the nulls _ is much like
setting the alignment of an automobile's front end. A properly
aligned front end should not turn a car when the steering wheel is
in the neutral position, and when the nulls are properly set on
LVDTs, the devices should sense no movement of the flight controls
and should not activate BUCS.
</P>
<P>
   After the Fort Knox incident, the Army acknowledged in its
written response, it prepared an Air Safety Action Message, a
safety directive similar to a Safety of Flight message but carrying
less urgency.
</P>
<P>
   But the draft copy of that message was misplaced when personnel
and files were moved from St. Louis to a new office in Huntsville,
Ala.
</P>
<P>
   It would be 2 1/2 years before the Army issued a new message.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in February 1997, McDonnell-Douglas became aware of
the Fort Knox incident and initiated an investigation, according to
a company memo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been determined that two failure modes could cause
inadvertent BUCS engagement,'' the memo says.
</P>
<P>
   One cause was a part that was found to be functioning properly,
the memo says. The other cause, the memo says, is an unexpected
movement of an LVDT probe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk assessment determined the worst mishap from a probe
movement to be catastrophic, and the probability that a hazard will
occur during the planned life of the system is remote,'' the memo
says.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, on Dec. 4, 1997, Chief Warrant Officer Phillip
Wayne Bowers, whose wife was expecting their second child, and
Capt. Donald J. Lee, the Army Aviation Association of America's
1996 Aviator of the Year, were flying a BUCS-active Apache on a
daytime training mission near San Saba, Texas. The crew of a nearby
Apache saw the accident happen.
</P>
<P>
   With no warning and for no apparent reason, the Apache Bowers
and Lee were flying banked left and flew into a rocky hillside at
100 mph, breaking the helicopter into pieces thrown more than 200
feet away as it burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of pilots were considered as talented as Lee,
making the possibility of pilot error at least questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a BUCS activation is the most plausible explanation
for the crash at this point,'' said Dallas attorney John Kettles,
one of several lawyers representing the two women left widowed by
the accident. ``It was a smooth left turn right into the ground,
and pilots just don't do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not normal for two pilots to voluntarily kill
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Kettles, a former Army helicopter pilot and former engineer at
the Army Safety Center, said he suspects the LVDT null settings
were not checked as required.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Fort Hood accident, the Army was still more
than a year away from releasing its safety message concerning LVDT
settings _ the message prepared after the 1996 Fort Knox incident
but later lost.
</P>
<P>
   An Army investigation found that all four shear pins, designed
to break and activate BUCS during emergencies, had broken and that
the ``BUCS-ON'' light was illuminated. In addition, the report
says, the LVDTs were found in a position ``suggesting that a
possible uncommanded BUCS-on condition may have occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   The battalion, the investigation found, reported 10 uncommanded
flight control inputs in the 18 months preceding the accident.
Though pilots were able to recover each time, investigators warned
that ``an accident can occur.''
</P>
<P>
   But the investigation also found that the shear pins, the
``BUCS-ON'' light and the LVDTs could be explained by the impact of
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not enough evidence to support anything,'' said
Marvin Armour, an Apache test pilot who assisted in the Army's
safety investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But Armour, who officially leaves the Army next month, said
eyewitness accounts seemed to point to some type of uncommanded
flight input.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't believe they would have made such a stupid
mistake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The maintenance records he researched during the investigation,
Armour said, showed one of the BUCS hydraulic servocylinders in the
helicopter had been replaced just prior to the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The Apache, like many other military aircraft, carried no flight
data recorder, and much of the helicopter was destroyed, making it
nearly impossible for investigators to determine if electronic
flight controls could have malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   The latest model of the Apache, the Longbow or D model, has a
maintenance data recorder that should solve that problem, Armour
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots, originally interviewed as witnesses to the Fort Hood
crash, told investigators about their own experiences with Apache
flight control problems.
</P>
<P>
   One pilot recalled an incident in which he was flying at 3,400
feet when, for no apparent reason, the helicopter pointed down,
rolled right and started falling before he was able to regain
control. Another pilot told investigators of a November 1995
incident in which he was flying his helicopter at 600 feet when it
suddenly began rolling left and shuddered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked the front seat pilot whether he was on the controls,
and the response was, 'No,''' an accident investigator quoted the
pilot as saying.
</P>
<P>
   A flight surgeon who arrived at the 1997 Fort Hood crash site
told accident investigators that six pilots, during discussions
about the accident, told her of previous incidents of uncommanded
flight control movements. The surgeon, a captain, gave
investigators a list containing names of the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's public report on the 1997 Fort Hood crash does not
pinpoint a cause, but two of the five recommendations in the report
concerned flight controls: One calling for improved BUCS training
and another calling for the Army to initiate an investigation of
uncomsmanded flight control inputs.
</P>
<P>
   Crashes draw world attention
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year after that accident, on Oct. 7, 1998, the
flight controls of a new D model Apache Longbow flying at Fort Hood
became damaged when the barrel of a 30mm gun exploded, according to
the Army. The BUCS engaged, Army records show, but the ``very
senior standardization instructor pilot'' was unable to
successfully land the helicopter, and it crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The crew escaped virtually uninjured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did BUCS work as advertised? If so, why couldn't a capable
master aviator regain control of the aircraft,'' the Flightfax
article says.
</P>
<P>
   It was this accident, along with other incidents, that sparked
the special Red Team investigation, the Army said.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999 _ 2 1/2 years after the Fort Knox incident that
prompted the message that was later lost _ the Army issued a Safety
of Flight message warning that LVDTs ``may move out'' of position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investigation into a BUCS activation in flight has revealed a
suspect condition in the BUCS ... servocylinders,'' the message
says. ``If the LVDT probe moves out of the null condition, this
will cause a BUCS system activation.''
</P>
<P>
   The safety message set a reporting deadline of no later than May
7, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before that deadline, on May 5, an Apache helicopter
conducting a night training mission in preparation for combat in
Kosovo was leading a formation of five helicopters over mountainous
terrain in Albania when it began to slow and move right, according
to an Army account of the incident obtained by the Dayton Daily
News.
</P>
<P>
   As the crew of another helicopter watched, the nose of the
Apache then pitched up as the helicopter rolled rapidly to the
right, falling 150 feet to the ground and exploding in flames, the
Army account of the incident says.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Warrant Officer David Gibbs, 38, of Massillon, Ohio, and
Chief Warrant Officer Kevin Reichert, 28, of Chetek, Wis., were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The crash _ the second in nine days involving one of the 24
Apaches sent to Albania _ raised serious questions about the
readiness of the fleet of Apaches, which never entered combat in
Kosovo. There's no indication the first crash was related to BUCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army won't give me anything,'' said Reichert's wife,
Ridgeley. ``I've asked for the safety report. I've asked them for
updates on how the safety report is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   In its written response to the Dayton Daily News, the Army
refused to discuss the accident in Albania, saying it was still
under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A memo from Boeing's flight operations manager for the Apache
program says there's no record Army maintenance personnel checked
the LVDT settings as required by the Safety of Flight message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The personnel said that they had done the work but not
recorded the data,'' Boeing manager Mark Metzger wrote in the memo
obtained by the Dayton Daily News. ``Did it really get done?
Unknown. I believe the team consensus was sloppy paperwork.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the possibility that some type of uncommanded flight control
input caused the accident, Metzger wrote: ``This is the condition
that has been experienced a couple of times in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did BUCS cause the accident? Unknown. The physical data
doesn't support it.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Justice now is conducting its own
examination into the fatal crash in Albania, the Dayton Daily News
has learned. The Department of Justice did not respond to requests
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 23, the Army released two safety messages concerning
BUCS.
</P>
<P>
   One called for an inspection of all BUCS servocylinders to
ensure that a sealant is applied to the threads of the LVDT probe.
A movement of the probe out of the null setting, the message says,
``will cause a BUCS system activation.'' Application of the
sealant, the message says, ``eliminates this condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The other safety message announced that a special Army ``Red
Team'' of aviation experts had identified specific actions required
to ``reduce risk'' involving flight controls. Those actions include
increased training for pilots, something recommended after the
fatal Fort Hood crash two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``My recommendation was disable them all,'' said Armour, the
former Apache test pilot. ``I think the drawbacks of BUCS outweigh
the benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell Carollo writes for the Dayton Daily News.

GOP CANDIDATES LIGHT ON HEALTH CARE OFFERINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDONDERRY, N.H. _ Jenn Campbell has been focused on the
Republican debates with a singular zeal, waiting to hear two golden
words.
</P>
<P>
   She drove to a town hall meeting during a snowstorm Thursday
night just to hear Governor George W. Bush say the phrase: health
care. But what she quickly learned, after posing a question to the
candidate, is that Bush is focused on many issues, but not on the
one that matters to her most.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can they sit there and talk about gays in the military
when there's 45 million people without health insurance?'' said
Campbell, 45, a registered Independent from Concord who has voted
Republican in the past. ``So far, it's like it's not on their radar
screen. Particularly Governor Bush. He's the front runner, and he's
the one who should be held responsible for bringing this issue into
the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   During six weeks of long debates and a blizzard of political
ads, health care is an issue that has curiously stayed off the
radar of the GOP candidates, even as they have addressed everything
from trade relations with China to the fate of 6-year-old Cuban
Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Governor George W. Bush doesn't mention health care in his stump
speech. Gary Bauer doesn't list it as a topic on his website.
Senator John S. McCain issued a proposal on it in mid-December, but
not a single candidate has focused on it in the televised debates
since.
</P>
<P>
   Health care, of course, has traditionally been a risky issue for
the Republican Party, which is not by nature hospitible to problems
whose solutions tend to require costly federal intervention and
intrusive regulation. The GOP, as a philosophical rule, has long
held that providing for the vast number of uninsured Americans is a
problem a federal bureaucracy cannot solve. Debating health care _
to Democrats' delight _ has often left Republican politicians open
to being cast as uncaring. So the tendency has been not to raise
the topic at all.
</P>
<P>
   But after a year in which the Republican Congress struggled with
an array of controversial health care issues, and at a time when
both Democratic presidential candidates are making health insurance
a centerpiece of their campaigns, the almost universal Republican
silence strikes some observers inside the party as odd.
</P>
<P>
   Health care is, after all, ranked by most Americans as one of
the two most important issues facing the country, according to
Republican consultant Mark Allen. The other issue is education. Yet
while several conservative candidates have seized on schooling as a
matter of top priority, health care has been almost entirely absent
from the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a surprise given the amount of weight it's gotten
on the Democratic side,'' said Mark Allen, a Republican political
consultant whose firm, Market Strategies, is conducting polling for
Bush. ``Health care has always been tilted to the Democrats, so
it's not surprising the Democrats have raised the issue first. But
this period of quiet on the Republican side can't continue
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bush say they are not so much ignoring health care as
they are focusing on issues more dear to their conservative primary
base, like tax cuts, improving the military and reforming
education. They point out that, when asked, Bush frequently
describes his support for shoring up Medicare. It's just that for
now, Bush, like all the GOP candidates, is trying to ``triage the
issues in terms of what's important to Republicans,'' according to
Patrick Griffin, a Bush media consultant in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, for his part, has taken a stab at casting himself as
both ready to reform health-care and economically conservative.
Late last year, he released a health care proposal that featured
what he described as ``tailored reforms'' to the current system.
The highlights of the plan, which would cost $7.6 billion over five
years, included giving patients a limited right to sue Health
Maintenance Organizations and helping poor seniors pay for
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as publisher Steve Forbes and Utah Senator Orrin
Hatch, have mentioned health care only fleetingly. Hatch has cited
a program to provide health care to uninsured children he
cosponsored in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, says Ron Pollack, executive director of Families
USA, a non-profit health advocacy organization in Washington,
``it's not something the candidates have brought up themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Pollack says, Bush has found himself stuck in a
difficult position. When asked about managed care, Bush stands on
his record in Texas, where patients are given a limited right to
sue their HMOs, can visit an emergency room without prior HMO
approval and where doctors can prescribe drugs outside the HMO
formula. But he has come under fire for his initial opposition to
those laws when they were introduced in the state legislature _ one
possible reason for his reluctance to bring the state's record up
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every indication I've gotten is that Bush does not want to
talk about this issue,'' Pollack said.
</P>
<P>
   He was clearly not eager to pursue the topic at the town hall
meeting at Londonderry High School Thursday night. After answering
an earlier question about managed care, Bush was faced by the
question Campbell had come to ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you promise me right here and now that you will put this
at the top of your agenda in the speches and the debates, swear you
will put health care right up at the top of your agenda?'' she said
before the crowded room. Campbell explained that her particular
concern was the millions of uninsured patients.
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded: ``I appreciate that. It's a very important
issue.'' He then went on to explain that part of the problem is the
people who are uninsured by choice _ people who might benefit from
a tax-free medical savings account to pay for their health coverage
themselves. He also said, ``I worry about a debate that says,
`Don't worry, we'll let the federal government take care of
it.'...I caution people about demanding and hoping the national
government will fix health care...What I believe in is empowering
the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell was unimpressed. After the meeting, she asked: ``What
good is a $500 tax cut if you can't afford a family health plan?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush aides are confident that when the issue emerges _ as
it undoutedly will during a general election fight with either
Bradley or Gore _ the public will favor his top two health care
priorities: saving Medicare and encouraging patients to use
tax-free, medical savings accounts that let people build their own
reserves to cover medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an important issue,'' said Karen Hughes, Bush's
communications director. ``But there's a fundamental difference in
philosophy. The Democratic approach is a big-government approach.
The Republicans have a private sector approach.'' If the
Republicans have failed to emphasize health care, she said, it is
likely because ``the candidates share a similar philosophy, knowing
the folly of the Clinton Administration's attempts to put the
federal government in charge of health care.''

 &HT;    Horse sale sparks hostility
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARKERS ISLAND, N.C. _ As soon as the winds calm down, a barge
will churn across the gray waters to Shackleford Banks, a remote
island where a controversial cargo awaits a trip to civilization.
</P>
<P>
   For a week now, 14 of the island's herd of 130 wild horses have
been corralled in a large wire pen. Gale-force winds since Thursday
have halted their departure from the rugged spit of sand at the
southernmost tip of North Carolina's Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as today, the barge will transport them to Harkers
Island, where, for $600 apiece, they'll be sold to private owners
lining up for a shaggy piece of North Carolina history.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the National Park Service and a private foundation
that manages the animals say it is the first time since 1981 that
any of Shackleford's horses have been put up for auction.
</P>
<P>
   But the upcoming sale is the latest in a decades-old debate over
whether the horses _ whose roots on the island may date back 400
years to the horses of Spanish or English explorers _ belong on a
fragile barrier island.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has been especially spirited on islands that are
part of the national park system. Under a federal mandate to
protect native species, park rangers, like some environmentalists,
fear that too many horses can destroy dunes, marshes and
vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   On Georgia's Cumberland Island, a herd of 240 horses has clipped
grass and trampled marshes, said Park Service Superintendent Denis
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the frequent complaints from visitors is that they find
a dying or a dead horse,'' said Davis, explaining that rangers
treat the animals as wild and thus don't feed them or provide care
and, in remote locations, don't bury carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service hasn't tried to artificially control
Cumberland's herd _ including reducing its size _ since 1996, when
federal legislation prevented the expenditure of U.S. tax dollars
that year for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   This spring or summer, the Park Service plans to propose ways to
manage Cumberland's herd, certain to arouse locals who consider the
horses to be as much a part of the rugged landscape as sea gulls
and fiddler crabs.
</P>
<P>
   At Shackleford Banks, last week's roundup signaled progress in
the fight between local horse lovers and the Park Service. The
agency manages the narrow, 9-mile-long island as part of the Cape
Lookout National Seashore.
</P>
<P>
   Local suspicion about the Park Service's intentions for the herd
peaked in 1996. After the roundup of all 184 horses on the island,
veterinarians found that 76 of them suffered from equine infectious
anemia, a blood disease.
</P>
<P>
   State law required that the infected horses be quarantined,
donated for research, or killed. All 76 were euthanized by lethal
injection, sparking allegations by some locals that the Park
Service intended to rid Shackleford Banks of all of the horses.
</P>
<P>
   Some locals still believe that is the government's ultimate
goal, despite 1998 federal legislation requiring the Park Service
and the private Foundation for Shackleford Horses to maintain a
herd of about 110 animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A local fear is the Park Service is out to kill all the
horses,'' said Sue Stuska, 41, the Park Service ranger in charge of
Shackleford's horses.
</P>
<P>
   Hired last July, the former college instructor represents the
Park Service's intensified efforts to strike a balance between
local affection for the herd and concern over environmental damage
to the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not deer or wild hogs,'' Stuska said. ``These horses
are much loved. There is a great emotional attachment to these
horses.''
</P>
<P>
   A photographer of the Shackleford horses, Elizabeth Loftin, 41,
said her grandfather was among old-timers who branded some of the
animals and claimed ownership of them. The Park Service's takeover
of the island in the early 1980s caused resentment among locals who
felt they had been evicted from ancestral land.
</P>
<P>
   The hostilities stretched to the horses. ``They came in and
stole them,'' said Loftin, whose group, Friends of the Wild
Mustangs of Shackleford Banks, believes the horses should be left
alone, with minimal human care.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, that sentiment fuels local skepticism about the Park
Service's policy of thinning the herd by adoption and birth
control.
</P>
<P>
   Testing this week found no evidence of equine infectious anemia
in any of the 130 horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing God now, giving them birth control and all,''
said Chris Rolison, 27, a Harkers Island boat captain who ferries
tourists to Shackleford Banks and adjacent Core Banks.
</P>
<P>
   But Dallas Willis, 65, a local resident who helped with last
week's roundup, said, ``That island will only allow so many. It is
more humane to do what they are doing, managing them.''
</P>
<P>

for purchase, call (252) 225-1181.

CONSUMERS, HOSPITALS SEEK ROLE IN HELPING HMOS OUT OF TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX AND STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Two groups representing Massachusetts consumers and
hospitals asked the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Friday to
grant them official standing as ``friends of the court'' in
decisions about the fate of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer group Health Care for All and the Massachusetts
Hospital Association asked the court to give them the opportunity
to weigh in on decisions in the ongoing proceedings involving the
state's largest health plan, which the court placed in receivership
last week.
</P>
<P>
   If granted, the petitions also also give the groups access to
some but not all documents relating to the court proceedings and
the state's analysis of Harvard Pilgrim's financial position.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly was meeting with
his staff to decide which of three investment banking firms would
get a state contract to explore buyer options if the
court-appointed receiver, insurance commissioner Linda Ruthardt,
concludes that Harvard Pilgrim must be sold.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, US Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of
Rhode Island said he plans to meet with Governor Paul Cellucci next
Wednesday to argue for a joint task force to sort through Harvard
Pilgrim's troubles. The HMO shut down its Rhode Island operations
last month after suffering heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said he will ask Cellucci ``to make sure Rhode Island is
not left out of the decision-making process.''
</P>
<P>
   If the court grants status to the Massachusetts consumer and
hospital groups, that would give those advocates a voice on such
questions as whether Harvard Pilgrim should be rehabilitated, sold,
carved up, or liquidated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be scrutinizing everything that comes out of the
receivership and making sure that the health system that came out
of this is responsive to consumer needs,'' said Robert Restuccia,
executive director of Health Care for All, at 15-year-old statewide
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Health Care for All told the court in its petition that it can
contribute ``rich and relevant experience in maintaining essential
services in the conversion of nonprofit health care facilities to
for-profit entities.''
</P>
<P>
   One important set of questions in any plan to reorganize, sell,
or liquidate Harvard Pilgrim, observers said, involves how the
HMO's creditors ultimately get paid _ in what order, in what
amounts, and whether each creditor's financial condition or role in
the health care system is taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital association's executive committee met Friday
afternoon with Ruthardt to begin hashing out what Harvard Pilgrim
owes to hospitals. The trade group has claimed that total hospital
receivables amount to $300 million, but Harvard Pilgrim has said
that all its outstanding debt to doctors and other vendors, as well
as hospitals, equals about $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a process of going back and forth about
what these numbers really are,'' said Judy Glasser, a hospital
association spokeswoman. ``This is just the beginning of that
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt and Reilly plan to compile a report on Harvard
Pilgrim's top 10 creditors.

JAGUARS CARRY INJURIES INTO DIVISIONAL PLAYOFF 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ The norm for a divisional playoff game in
the National Football League is the home team has the major
advantage, because it has had the bye week and two weeks to get its
injured players healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The norm will not be the norm when the hometown Jaguars take on
the revived Miami Dolphins Saturday, kicking off what is generally
the league's best weekend of football each season.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars, who finished with the best record in the AFC and
are the No. 1 seed in the conference, are wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't know until game time if (quarterback Mark) Brunell is
ready to play,'' said Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin. ``He's been
praticing, but he hasn't been near full speed. We've been getting
(Jay) Fiedler ready so if he has to go, he can go. I feel good
about him. I think we can win with him, if we have too, but
naturally we are hoping that Brunell can play. But I won't put him
out there unless I think he can do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunell is the catalyst of the Jacksonville offense, which has
run hot and cold. In the final game of the year, Jacksonville
suffered two serious blows. Tackle Tony Boselli, the best in the
league and a force on the left side, went out for the season with a
knee injury. Boselli usually handles the other team's best pass
rusher, and when he played against Miami's Jason Taylor, wired him
to the line of scrimmage and made Taylor a nonfactor. Today, the
Jaguars will switch guard Ben Coleman to tackle and replace him
with Rich Tylski. Tylski has been a starter in the past, but lost
his job to Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin acknowleged that he doesn't know for sure what to
expect from Miami, which had an impressive upset victory over the
Seahawks in Seattle last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to figure out which Jimmy (Johnson) we are going to
see,'' said Coughlin with a chuckle. ``He has changed up several
times this year with his offense. He has gone from throwing a
handful of passes and running the ball, taking time off the clock
to control the game, to throwing it 45 times and opening the
offense up. He's had the short week of practice, and we don't know
how much he can change, but we're sure he'll have a couple of
surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin has told his team that they are where they have wanted
to be the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in the playoffs, but always lost out in the end on
the road,'' he said. ``As the No. 1 seed, we've got the chance to
be at home all the way. This is going to be a tough game. We played
(Miami) here last year in a night game, and we had to make a couple
of big plays to pull it out in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a very good defensive team, so we know it's going to
be hard to score points on them, but we have to. We have to make
big plays. I don't think you can just march the ball up and down
the field on their defense. They're too good for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami has an idea of what the Jaguars might be thinking. ``I
think we're going to get a large dose of blitzing,'' said assistant
head coach Dave Wannstedt. ``Jacksonville's had one of the best
pressure teams in the league this year. We're sure they'll try
several different ways to get after Dan (Marino). They try to get
you three and out in a hurry. We can't let them do that. We have to
move the chains on offense. Try to control the clock and the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can do it. I think we reinforced in our minds in
Seattle that we can run the ball. I think if we can throw less than
30 passes, run the ball, and pass protect for Dan, we can win. If
we can do that, we like our chances. Our players feel pretty good
about themselves right now. We went all the way across the country
to Seattle, played in a dome, on turf, in a noisy building, and
came away with a win. This game we're playing in the same state,
outdoors, on grass, which is what we do all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Coughlin, ``Turnovers will be the key. Whenever we won the
turnover battle in games this year we are 12-0. We were first in
the league in not turning the ball over. That is critical to the
way we play. We win the turnover game, we play our best game.''

NAVIGATIONAL PROBLEMS CLOUD RAYTHEON MISSILE PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pentagon said Friday it discovered navigational problems in
a Raytheon Co. antimissile system that weren't apparent when
military officials declared a test shot a success in October.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure will likely put new scrutiny on a second test
launch planned for next week.
</P>
<P>
   In the first experimental launch, a craft known as an
exoatmospheric kill vehicle built by Lexington-based Raytheon Co.,
destroyed a mock warhead 140 miles above the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The test was hailed as a key demonstration of technologies
designed to find and destroy enemy ballistic missiles, a challenge
akin to knocking down one flying bullet with another.
</P>
<P>
   But the concept also depends on extreme technical precision,
since the stakes of a miss are so high.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Friday, Pentagon and Raytheon officials confirmed
that the kill vehicle's guidance system didn't function properly
during the test because of programming errors, prompting critics to
question the validity of the results overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how well it worked, and I'm not sure they know,''
said Lisbeth Gronlund, a physicist who works at the Union of
Concerned Scientists in Cambridge, Mass. The group believes that an
antimissile system could ruin nuclear-deterrence policies.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman said the test was still a success, since
the problem didn't prevent the target from being destroyed.
Interpretations matter as the Clinton administration mulls the
merits of deploying the system, which would cost about $10.5
billion through 2005, the Pentagon estimates.
</P>
<P>
   A decision is expected this summer, after two more test
launches. The next test is planned for Tuesday and will be
conducted under circumstances similar to October's, but this time
the kill vehicle will be guided by a Raytheon-built radar system
operating from an atoll in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The navigational problems were first reported Friday by The New
York Times. Specifically, because of computer-programming errors by
Raytheon, the kill vehicle couldn't make proper use of a star map
stored in its memory.
</P>
<P>
   That data was meant to help the kill vehicle orient itself to
pick out warheads released by enemy missiles, and to distinguish
them from decoy warheads and used booster-rocket stages that might
also descend through the outer atmosphere during an attack.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the kill vehicle relied on other input for guidance
after it was launched by a two-stage rocket booster. It did manage
to identify one star successfully, Raytheon said, and then found a
decoy balloon that had been released by the test missile.
</P>
<P>
   The kill vehicle still knew to ignore the decoy, then find, ram,
and destroy the test warhead itself. The chronology was discovered
during an analysis in the weeks following the launch, the Pentagon
said Friday, and congressional staff members were briefed.
</P>
<P>
   But the navigational problem, coupled with the potentially
helpful role played by the decoy balloon, was seized upon by some
critics to question whether the $100 million test had shown
positive results after all.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's slow public disclosure of the issue ``really says
something about the quality of the information you get out of this
organization,'' said Theodore Postol, a security specialist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a longtime Raytheon
critic.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Lieutenant Colonel Rick Lehner, a Pentagon spokesman,
said the issues weren't announced before because they ``didn't
affect the capability (of the vehicle) to successfully intercept
the target.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, ``Nobody in the BMDO ever said things were done
perfectly,'' he said, referring to the ballistic missile defense
organization, the tests' overseer.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon spokesman Dave Shea said the difficulty shouldn't be
seen to detract from the firing's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It overcame bad information,'' he said. ``We understand the
problem and we're confident it won't happen next time.'' The kill
vehicle would have destroyed the test warhead even without the
balloon's presence, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluating the performance of missiles made by Raytheon and
other military contractors often has been a contentious matter.
During the Gulf War the company and military spokespeople made
claims about the Patriot air-defense missile that later reviews
found were overblown.

   HAVANA _ Talk of U.S. products started right at customs for
Henry Zwack, when guards demanded to know what those 75 bottles
were in his suitcase when the delegation of Americans arrived in
Cuba late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   You put it on pancakes, said Zwack. And on ice cream. This was
made in my home town of Stephentown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it's rum? one guard responded.
</P>
<P>
   No, maple syrup, said Zwack, the Rensselaer County executive. To
help with the translation, Zwack dunked his pinky in the miniature
bottle, licked his finger and passed it around for the others to
taste. They liked it. They passed him through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected Checkpoint Charlie,'' Zwack said, referring to the
former border crossing between East and West Germany. ``I got
Checkpoint Como Esta.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of many interactions that quickly made one
thing clear to this group traveling to Havana: Cuba offers a range
of opportunities for trade, culture and tourism exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   The group from upstate New York ate rice imported from China.
Why not from the United States? someone asked. They rode a bus
imported from Brazil. Why not from the United States? they said.
They saw medical shortages that need to be filled. Why not from the
United States?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put the word `international' into Albany International
Airport and start our own trade,'' said New York State Assemblyman
Robert Prentiss, a Republican who would like to end the U.S. trade
embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have General Electric silicones that could be shipped to
manufacture the medical products they need,'' he added. ``Cuba has
wood pulp that could be bought by International Paper. Plug Power
in Latham is developing energy for houses they could use here. If
we don't lift this embargo, foreign powers would get an economic
stronghold here before we do.''
</P>
<P>
   They got no argument from the Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba will be a wonderful buyer,'' said Carlos Franco
Parellada, head of the International Relations Department for
Havana's provincial assembly. In exchange, it has nickel, rum,
cigars and citrus to trade, along with tourism. ``It will be very
positive for both countries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Castro and his Communist insurgents took power in Cuba in
1959, leading to the eventual U.S. embargo against the island
nation just 90 miles from Florida. Although tensions had begun to
ease, the dispute over the return of a 6-year-old Cuban boy to his
father has fueled old animosities.
</P>
<P>
   In a white briefing room before a wall-sized blue map of Cuba,
Parellada gave the group a spirited two-hour history lesson that
rivaled a speech by Fidel Castro himself in intensity and devotion
to the survival of this Communist state.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in Old Havana, the conversation turned to Internet
start-ups as three Columbia University students sat on the stoop of
the old Hemingway haunt, La Bodegita del Medio. Columbia is one of
dozens of U.S. schools to send groups of students to Cuba in recent
years, including Tulane University, the University at Buffalo and
New York University.
</P>
<P>
   This delegation from the Albany area will offer the Cubans
cultural exchanges, with letters of support from two local schools,
Siena College and the College of Saint Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Saint Rose would welcome a cultural exchange with a similar
Cuban college, President R. Mark Sullivan said in a letter to Cuban
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Albany-area group, the Columbia students were given
tours of a hospital, a school and other sites. Both groups said
they hope to reach beyond the curtain of propaganda to find out
what it's really like for the people who live here.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of young people come up and talk to you about discos,
but we haven't gotten down to the nitty gritty yet,'' said Columbia
student Amber Gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents and grandparents thought I was crazy to come here
and I would be held captive here,'' said fellow student Shannon
Lightner. At least I can go back and tell them what it is _ and
what it's not. I walked the streets safely. Even books here are
free. But then, at what price?''
</P>
<P>
   At a fourth-grade elementary class, Lightner said, posters all
over the walls called for the return of Elian Gonzalez, the
6-year-old Cuban boy who was plucked from the ocean near Florida in
November and remains with relatives.
</P>
<P>
   A large billboard demands that U.S. officials ``Devuelvan Elian
a la Patria'' (send Elian back to the fatherland.)
</P>
<P>
   The delegation from New York is spending six days visiting a
range of sites to prepare a report for Congress on conditions here.
It will also donate roughly $50,000 in medicine and medical
equipment to the Calixto Garcia Hospital in Havana.

KERREY GOES ON THE ATTACK FOR BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHNSTON, Iowa _ With his campaign stalled in the countdown to
the crucial Iowa caucuses, Bill Bradley Friday summoned a top ally
who tore the friendly face off the Bradley campaign and launched a
scathing attack against Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the fiercest intraparty assaults of the Democratic
primary, Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey blasted Gore's role in some of
the greatest failures and controversies of the Clinton
adminstration, from the health-care debacle of 1993 to the
fund-raising abuses of the 1996 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey noted that Gore has criticized Bradley for ``being
corrupted'' by the pharmaceutical industry, the largest employer in
New Jersey, while Bradley was the senator from New Jersey for 18
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the subject of corruption, who was corrupted in '95 and '96
by the desire to raise money, by inviting foreign nationals to
contribute in an illegal fashion, inviting agents of governments
into the White House for coffees, leaving the impression that
national security wasn't as important as soft-money targets?''
Kerrey said of the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a willingness in this campaign of the vice president
to say whatever it takes to score political points and try to hold
what obviously has been given to them, and that's a substantial
incumbent lead,'' Kerrey said. ``And that bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign could not immediately be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey made the unsolicited remarks to reporters on Bradley's
campaign bus before he introduced Bradley for a speech at a high
school in an upscale suburb of Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley used the forum to slightly sharpen his criticism of Gore
for failing to embrace Bradley's self-described ``big and bold
ideas.'' But Bradley, who has been stymied in trying to slice
Gore's 20-point lead in the Iowa polls, continued to resist appeals
from many supporters to go after Gore more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   He left the infighting to Kerrey, one of three US senators who
have endorsed Bradley. And Kerrey, who has not shied in the past
from criticizing Clinton, went after Gore with similar zest. He
noted, for example, that Gore has hit Bradley for being a
``quitter'' because he left the Senate in 1994 rather than stay and
fight for Democratic priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't tell me I ought to give you a round of applause
for sticking around and fighting Newt Gingrich,'' Kerrey said of
Gore. Gingrich is the former House speaker who rose to power in the
Republican revolution of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey blamed Clinton and Gore for letting Republicans seize
control of Congress that year. ``You brought us Newt Gingrich,''
Kerrey said. ``That would be like asking me to thank the arsonist
after he sets a house on fire and sticks around to help us put out
the blaze.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``I would ask the vice president, does the word
`triangulation' ring a bell? Does the name Dick Morris mean
anything to you? Because when it was your turn to try to figure out
how to save your own rear ends, the ends justified any means.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey was referring to the ``triangulation'' strategy conceived
by Morris, a White House consultant, that called in part for
marginalizing Democrats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bradley's last chances to gain ground in Iowa comes in a
debate Monday in Des Moines on minority issues. Bradley has
recruited several fellow basketball Hall of Famers to attend the
debate, including Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics and Willis
Reed of the New York Knicks.

BUSH, CAMPAIGNING IN IOWA, SHOWS CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENWOOD, Iowa _ Texas Governor George W. Bush, energized after
a rousing reception in rural Iowa and a good night's sleep,
strolled the streets here Friday with a confidence that had seemed
to elude him in previous days. But with the Iowa caucuses on the
horizon, Bush wasn't taking any chances.
</P>
<P>
   He laid out modest expectations for a Jan. 24 victory: just 37
percent, the highest ever achieved in a Republican race here. And
despite Friday's sunny skies, his aides emphasized that anything,
including a snowstorm, could lead to lower results than the
campaign wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to say they're for me. It's another thing to
show up,'' Bush said during a news conference. ``I'm very aware of
how a caucus system works, as is our organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush arrived here after a grueling week of campaign stops in New
Hampshire, South Carolina, Michigan and Delaware, in preparation
for Saturday's debate in Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   He has a strong lead in most Iowa polls, which put him just
under 50 percent, followed by Steve Forbes, who is at around 20
percent. Bush is also expected to benefit from a solid political
organization in the state, which includes the backing of US Senator
Charles E. Grassley and US Representative Greg Ganske.
</P>
<P>
   But even Ganske cautioned against assuming Bush would sweep the
caucuses later in the month. The governor's frontrunner status, he
said, is ``part of the problem with the Bush campaign in Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have what is perceived as a horse race'' in Iowa,
Ganske said, after introducing Bush at a morning rally in front of
more than approximately 400 enthusiastic supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Agreed Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director: ``It's one
of the perils of being far ahead in the polls. If it's bad weather,
or if your kid is sick, you might think, it's fine, I don't have to
go, he's far ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   If Friday's campaign stops were any measure, Bush had little
reason to worry. After meeting with supporters in Red Oak, Iowa,
where he was at ease with the cheering crowd, he drove here to
shake hands with local shop owners and bank tellers and customers
running errands along Sharp Street. He signed baseball bats and
slips of paper. At one point, during a stop in the Glenwood State
Bank, he caused a roar of laughter when he held up a plastic mask
of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He caused another ripple inside Kaiman's grocery store,
commandeering the loudspeaker to announce: ``Now hear this!
Everybody should go to caucus night. And while you're there,
remember George W. Bush came to ask for the vote. Now hear this.''
</P>
<P>
   Several patrons said they'd honor the request. Store owner Jerry
Kaiman, 67, said he found Bush ``very impressive, very warm, very
cordial,'' and said that even though he lives across the state
border, in Omaha, Nebraska, he would favor Bush on election day.
Jean Armstrong, a registered nurse from Jennie Edmunson Hospital in
Council Bluffs, was even more enthusiastic. After a visit from
Laura Bush, the candidate's wife, earlier in the week, Armstrong
said she had no doubts that she would vote for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bush impressed several supporters with his
stance on the Head Start program. When asked what he would do with
it, Bush said he would expand it to become an education program _
moving it from the Department of Health and Human Services into the
Department of Education, and turning it into an early childhood
education system that teaches literacy and math.
</P>
<P>
   Only once was he visibly stumped. Asked during a press
conference to articulate what he felt he had learned about the GOP
candidates during the previous six weeks of debates, Bush paused,
then replied: ``Hm. Let's see. Well...I think that we're a pretty
conservative lot. We've learned I've got a couple of nice red ties.
I'm not really sure how to answer the question.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour through Iowa came as several new political
advertisements were released, and as the Bush campaign announced it
had received new endorsements from 94 members of the Republican
National Committee. Two are from Massachusetts: Jody Dow and Ron
Kaufman.

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ South Africa's name is famous
around the globe, a legacy of the apartheid era that etched the
country into the conscience of the world but left it a foreboding
and unfamiliar place to many of the travelers it would now like to
attract.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to travel agents in the United States or Britain who
specialize in South Africa, and they report the same queries from
curious but confused customers: Is there toilet paper in the
bathrooms? Are the roads paved? Do the people speak English? Are
there restaurants? Do we have to bring our own food?
</P>
<P>
   Anne Bellamy, vice president of African Travel in Glendale,
Calif., has heard them all. ``Some people think all they eat is
fresh elephant meat,'' Ms. Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to dispel the myths, South Africa has turned to
Madison Avenue. This month, the country makes its first major foray
into the world of international marketing with an $18-million
promotional campaign aimed at the United States, Britain, Germany,
France, Italy and the Netherlands. Its emphasis is on enjoying
South Africa's exotic outdoor attractions and urbanity rather than
experiencing the opening of a door to a new multi-racial democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, where travel to South Africa jumped almost
25 percent from 1997, to more than 166,000 trips in 1998, the
effort will focus on New York, Los Angeles and Miami, the three
markets where South Africa thinks it has the best chance of drawing
far more tourists.
</P>
<P>
   For a country like the United States, the numbers are small, but
the already increasing interest from the world's richest nation
gives South Africa hope. ``It won't be easy, but we're really
making a start,'' the country's minister of environment and
tourism, Valli Moosa, said.
</P>
<P>
   By world standards, the campaign is modest, forsaking television
in favor of more affordable media like newspapers, magazines and
billboards. For a country that until now had placed just a handful
of ads overseas, it is a huge step into the media age.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising giant Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide, a unit of the
WPP Group, was hired to develop the campaign. The firm's
Johannesburg office, Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Rightford, has spent the last
18 months working with the country's tourism industry to design a
strategy that will try to turn tourism into the humming economic
engine that so many in South Africa believe it can be.
</P>
<P>
   To listen to the leaders of this new democracy talk about
tourism, nothing less than the future of the nation is at stake.
Widespread unemployment, poverty and crime have made employment one
of the government's highest priorities.
</P>
<P>
   With just over 3 percent of the South African work force
directly employed by the tourism industry, and another 4 percent
employed by related industries, the tourism business here still has
a long way to go before it overtakes the country's mines, whose
mineral and metal riches built modern South Africa. Mining accounts
for just under 11 percent of the nation's jobs, down from 13.25
percent a decade ago but still the economy's biggest single source
of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The tourism minister said he was confident that in just a couple
of years more than 300,000 additional tourism jobs could be created
in this country of about 44 million people. ``We've reached a point
now where there is a consensus in South African society that
tourism must be regarded as a priority,'' Moosa said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always so. For many years, South Africa was
ostracized because of its repressive racist regime. Promoting South
Africa, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, would have been a
waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   That changed in 1994 when Nelson Mandela was elected president.
With little effort, tourism took off, albeit from almost nothing.
It did not take long, however, for it to taper off, as the curious
came and went, and not all that many people followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to build for the future, and South Africa did
not,'' said Malcom Peasnall, the director of the Independent
Traveler, a British agency that saw its bookings to South Africa
surge from none during the apartheid era, when the agency refused
to book trips to the country, to 500 a year immediately after
Mandela came to power, before leveling off at about 1,000 trips a
year. ``South Africa got a lot for free, but now they've got to
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn van Heerden, deputy chairman of Avis South Africa, the
regional franchisee for Avis Rent a Car System, and deputy chairman
of the country's Tourism Business Council, looks back on the days
after the election and wonders where the country might have been
today if tourism had had the attention then that it has now. ``We
probably had a golden opportunity to launch something then,'' he
said, ``but it was obviously and regretfully not a priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says, the industry and the government have realized that
the country's vast potential will begin to be exploited only if
they take their message to the people of the world _ to the people
with the money and the motivation to make the trip. ``Nothing will
sell in the supermarket unless it's on the shelf when you go in,''
van Heerden said.
</P>
<P>
   That is a welcome message to the travel agents around the world
who, until now, have found themselves alone in their struggle to
steer tourists to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing the role of educating people about Africa
as a whole, geography lessons, cultural lessons, anthropology
lessons, the whole gamut,'' Ms. Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Waddell, a minister from a suburb of Atlanta, was among
the untutored. For years, her husband had been trying to coax her
into joining him on a trip to southern Africa, where he had long
dreamed of hunting. But she was scared of South Africa, with its
turbulent history _ fearful of how her little blue-eyed,
blonde-haired daughters would be treated in a country with a
history of racial tensions. Last year, her husband's lobbying
finally won her over, or at least wore her down. ``I was
terrified,'' Mrs. Waddell, 44, said. ``I was so afraid that I
almost canceled the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   She is happy now that she did not. ``It was just absolutely
amazing,'' she said. ``The people were so friendly and so helpful
and so warm that I just wanted to stay there forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign is aimed at making South Africa an easier sell.
That will be a challenge, and not just because crime is a problem
here. Less serious, but no less formidable a challenge is
convincing people to fly 17 hours or more from the United States or
nearly 11 hours from London, to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   For inspiration, South Africa has looked across the Indian Ocean
to Australia. Far from the lucrative North American and European
markets, Australia has managed to make international tourism a
major part of its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Like South Africa, Australia knows it is never going to attract
as many visitors as Spain or France. But no country save the United
States makes more money per tourist than Australia, because its
visitors are almost always coming from afar, which means that, on
average, they stay longer than tourists any place else. (More than
75 percent of visitors to South Africa come from other African
countries; among non-African nations, Britain is South Africa's
biggest patron, with 321,000 visitors in 1998, or 5.6 percent of
South Africa's total.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   South Africa, however, plans to spend only a fraction of the
more than $85 million a year that Australia sets aside for tourism
promotion. ``We can't spend that kind of money, and we'll never be
able to because we have pressing needs in this country,'' said
Sheryl Ozinsky, the tourism manager in Cape Town. ``We have to be
creative in everything we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The innovations include repainting 50 London taxis in the colors
of the South African flag and flying the cabbies to South Africa
for a look at the country so they can chat it up with passengers
back in the West End.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to do it in New York, too, but they won't let you,''
said Dale Pretorius, the assistant general manager of marketing for
the South African Tourism Board. ``The cabs there have got to be
yellow.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the campaign will be waged with glossy inserts and
print ads in upscale magazines like Conde Nast Traveler in the
United States, Der Spiegel in Germany and Gente Viaggi in Italy,
publications most likely to be read by the sort of people who South
Africa is convinced will visit if given the right message.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out that message was not easy for a country that is
still figuring itself out, said Nunu Ntshingila, one of the Ogilvy
account managers who oversaw much of the day-to-day work on the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when work started on the glossy insert, Mandela
seemed to be the obvious choice to grace the cover. But when the ad
managers test-marketed the brochures, they discovered they were
wrong. Beloved as Mandela is, his image did not evoke thoughts of
carefree days spent on the beach, strolling through a vineyard or
hiking around a game reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing how it was interpreted internationally,'' Ms.
Ntshingila said. ``Some people saw it and expected some sort of
political message.''
</P>
<P>
   So Mandela was moved inside the brochure and a panoramic shot of
Cape Town's majestic Table Mountain took his place.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, it is not so simple. Much of the country's charm lies
in its wildlife and ecosystem, from the whales and penguins off
Cape Town to the lions and elephants in Kruger National Park in the
northeast of the country. Yet a unique element of South Africa's
appeal, especially to visitors from the United States, is its
modern infrastructure, unmatched in Africa, with first-class
hotels, fine restaurants, good roads and airports and excellent
private hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is aimed at making sure people see, or at least
sense, both sides of South Africa. ``Where the world's most
intelligent creatures take their breaks,'' reads one ad that
features a sun-splashed photograph of a whale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very tricky balance,'' Ms. Ntshingila said,
``because we don't want to lose the African heritage, but we want
to communicate the more sophisticated side of South Africa.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: NO LIMIT BUT THE SKY FOR JUDICIAL OVERREACHING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``Judicial activism is out of control and must be
stopped,'' Steve Forbes said in New Hampshire last month. ``Courts
that make laws from the bench threaten the foundation of our
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't waste it on the voters, Forbes. Go preach it to the five
members of the Supreme Court who are carrying out a radical
reshaping of our constitutional structure.
</P>
<P>
   The latest example of judicial overreaching came this week. As
in three cases decided last June, the five-justice majority read
into the Constitution words and a concept that do not appear in its
text: ``state sovereign immunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The target this time was the federal law that prohibits
discrimination in employment on the basis of age. The law allows
victims of discrimination to sue employers for damages. It was
extended to employees of state agencies in 1974, but the Supreme
Court said this week that they could not sue _ because the states
are immune.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Amendment to the Constitution bars federal courts from
hearing lawsuits brought against a state by citizens of another
state. It was intended to deal with issues arising under state law,
such as contract disputes.
</P>
<P>
   In this case a Florida agency was being sued by Florida
citizens, and they were suing to enforce a federal law. So neither
the language nor the purpose of the 11th Amendment stood in their
way.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, was Florida immune from the suits? Because of a
constitutional doctrine created by the five-justice majority of the
Supreme Court in recent years: that the states must have sovereign
immunity to maintain their ``dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   That notion cannot be traced to the Framers of the Constitution.
Americans had just won their independence from a Britain whose
Parliament claimed absolute sovereignty, and the Framers wanted a
republican United States in which rulers were answerable to the
people.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the Framers assign to the Supreme Court, especially, the
role of protecting state interests. They sought that protection
primarily in the political structure they created: for example,
equal state representation in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The issue may sound abstract, the business of lawyers and
historians. But it is far from that. It goes to the heart of all
the politics swirling around judges and their appointment these
days.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives like Steve Forbes denounce ``liberal judges'' and
``activism,'' coupling the two. Right-wing lobbyists have run
campaigns against some of President Clinton's judicial nominees on
those grounds. The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
Orrin Hatch, has warned repeatedly against ``activist judges.''
</P>
<P>
   The word activist is a verbal brickbat, without a fixed meaning.
But if it suggests judges who invade the province of legislators,
then it applies primarily today to judicial conservatives _ as this
week's Supreme Court decision showed.
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion, by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, read in
places like a parody of judicial legislating. ``Our examination of
the legislative record,'' she wrote, ``confirms that Congress' 1974
extension of the [age discrimination) act to the states was an
unwarranted response to a perhaps inconsequential problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether legislation is warranted is not a question for judges to
decide. It is the business of the political branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   The result of this and the other recent federalism cases is to
throw a cloud of hypocrisy over conservative statements that judges
who construe the Constitution should respect the text, the
intention of its Framers, and so on. When the decisions came down
last June, Professor Vincent Blasi of the University of Virginia
and Columbia Law Schools said: ``After this I want to hear no more
about original intention, textualism, strict construction or
judicial restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the four dissenters in
the Florida case, actually charged the majority with ``judicial
activism.'' But that is not likely to give the five pause.
</P>
<P>
   In 1930, when a willful majority was striking down economic
legislation as violative of ``due process,'' Holmes wrote in
dissent, ``I see hardly any limit but the sky'' to invalidation of
statutes ``if they happen to strike a majority of this court as for
any reason undesirable.'' So it is on the federalism issue today.

THE ROLE OF SATELLITES IN A WORLD THAT'S WIRED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Questions may be italicized)  
(af) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beam me up, Scotty: Let's talk satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Cable pipes and telephone lines are widely seen as the speediest
access lines linking homes and the Internet. That sort of thinking
was underscored last week by the America Online-Time Warner deal.
</P>
<P>
   It bears remembering, though, that as recently as last June, AOL
sank $1.5 billion into Hughes Electronics' satellite communications
venture. It could be that AOL made that investment because, so far,
talk about two-way cable modems and digital subscriber lines has
been mostly just that. Have you asked your local cable or telephone
company lately exactly when those upgrades are expected in your
neighborhood?
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Jayant, a satellite communications analyst at Bear Stearns
&AMP; Co., took some time last week to talk about things
extraterrestrial. Following are excerpts from the conversation:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So far, most satellite ventures have offered one-way service,
like television, and not two-way, Internet-related access. Why? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You haven't had pure-play stories yet because the technology
is not there. It costs a lot of money to develop a network that can
talk back to a satellite.
</P>
<P>
   But Gilat Satellite Networks and Hughes Electronics will have
products in about 6 to 12 months that will provide two-way access
with data streams that will be comparable to cable modems.
Manufacturing costs on these products is somewhere between $1,000
and $1,500 per unit, so the real challenge will be how they price
the hardware. The companies will probably have to subsidize the
units, but we don't know by how much. Monthly pricing hasn't been
determined, but it will likely be competitive with similar two-way
cable service. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it fair to look at this as a broadband race involving the
telephone, cable and satellite companies? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It is a race, but satellites have their own position in the
scheme of things.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, satellites will target rural America, where
household densities are not sufficient for laying out a broadband
ground network, be it cable or broadband fiber.
</P>
<P>
   That is the target market, the low-hanging fruit. There are
about 30 million rural homes in this country.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a lot of opportunity in the developing world. The
challenge is to get the cost of the dish and the receiver to
reasonable levels.
</P>
<P>
   Globally, it is about a $60 billion to $70 billion market in
terms of revenues, one that is growing at about 15 percent a year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it reasonable to think that satellites will compete with
digital subscriber lines, DSLs, or cable in urban areas? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There will be more competition, especially if delays in
getting cable and DSL upgrades drag out. But I don't think
satellites will outdo cable or telephone links in high-density
areas. An entrenched terrestrial network, be it cable or telephone,
is already in place in all high-density areas. I think you will see
upgrades in most major markets in the next year or two, when voice,
video and data will be truly bundled.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the world doesn't have this sort of infrastructure and
is not connected for voice, video and Internet service. A satellite
signal is distance insensitive, and is the way to satisfy demand in
those areas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So why did AOL make its investment in Hughes? And what
happens to that now that they have bought Time Warner?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. AOL wanted a foot in the door to every mode of distribution,
and I think they possibly wanted to do more with them. AOL has no
effective control over the asset. They own less than 5 percent of
General Motors Hughes stock and have no board representation. But
Hughes has to figure out if there is a conflict, and if they are
comfortable with a cable company owning a piece of them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Investors pushed the Bear Stearns index of 14 satellite
communications stocks up 86.8 percent for the 52 weeks through
Thursday. Are the stocks vulnerable? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The stocks have done extremely well. Hughes Electronics more
than doubled in the last year. EchoStar has been a six-bagger and
Gilat has more than tripled.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these good performers have priced in a lot of success in
the future, so there is a limited flexibility for them to miss.
They have to deliver now. If they don't, there is a chance the
stocks will decline. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You cover more than 20 of these stocks. Which ones do you
like? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I am very bullish on the whole sector and have buy
recommendations on most of my stocks.
</P>
<P>
   I really like Hughes Electronics. It is the bellwether satellite
name in everything that it does. And it is not a matter of if, but
when General Motors spins them out as a separate company. I also
like Orbital Sciences, a manufacturer of small satellites and small
rockets. And I like Sirius Radio, which will be providing 100
channels of radio via satellite for subscription.

   An international team of surgeons performed the world's first
double hand-and-forearm transplant on Thursday in Lyon, France, on
a 33-year-old Frenchman who lost both his hands in a fireworks
accident in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The same team of surgeons performed the first successful
hand-and-forearm transplant, in September 1998, also in Lyon.
There, Clint Hallam, a New Zealand man living in Australia,
received a new right hand and forearm. In January 1999, surgeons in
Louisville, Ky., gave Matthew David Scott of Absecon, N.J., a new
left hand and forearm.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have gained varying degrees of nerve regeneration,
sensation and function in their new hands, but neither has full
function.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nadey Hakim, a member of the transplant team from England,
said in a telephone interview Friday that the double-hand
transplant recipient was doing well. ``He's awake and fine,'' he
said. ``So far so good.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate surgical results appear excellent, with good blood
flow through the newly connected donor and recipient arteries and
veins and with no bleeding as a complication, Hakim said. As is
standard, the man will have a breathing tube in his windpipe for
another day or so. The doctors are watching for signs of rejection.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be many months before doctors can determine whether
the transplant was successful and how much function the recipient,
the father of two children from the Atlantic coast port of
Rochefort, will regain. His name was not made public.
</P>
<P>
   In previous months, the team gathered twice to do the
double-transplant operation it had been planning since June, but
each time, in September and November, a suitable donor could not be
found, Hakim said.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly on Wednesday, Hakim and others from Australia, Spain
and Italy flew to Lyon to join their French colleagues. A
19-year-old man who had fallen off a bridge was brain dead. His
family donated his heart, kidneys, liver and arms to different
recipients. The arms were removed on Wednesday night, and the
surgeons attached prosthetic arms to make the donor's body look
normal. At 6 a.m. on Thursday the team began the hand-transplant
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Hand transplants remain experimental and controversial.
Hand-transplant recipients, like those who get new kidneys, hearts,
livers and lungs, must take a combination of
immune-system-suppressing drugs to prevent rejection of the foreign
tissue. Such rejection reactions can happen at any time, but are
thought to be less common with time.
</P>
<P>
   Loss of a hand is a major handicap, but because hands are not
necessary to live and the anti-rejection drugs pose many risks and
must be taken for life, critics have raised a number of ethical
issues about transplanting hands and other nonvital tissues.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years when doctors, ethicists and others discussed at
scientific meetings whether to proceed with hand transplants, some
said the first recipients should be those who had lost both hands.
They said the balance between benefits of renewed function and
risks of rejection and damage from drugs favored double-hand
amputees because they had more to gain than individuals who had
lost only one hand and were less handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term immunosuppression treatment leaves an individual more
vulnerable to infection, diabetes, weakened bones and other
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The French team said it had received permission from committees
that oversee the ethics of human experimentation and had financial
support from French health officials for a pilot study of five
hand-transplant operations at an estimated cost of $50,000 each.
Ideally, Hakim said, the team will perform double-hand transplants
but will do one arm if there is a suitable patient.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, Dr. Jean-Michel Dubernard, who
headed the team of 50 doctors, nurses and other health workers that
performed the double-hand transplant, said the patient was
``strong-willed, tenacious and with the spirit of a marathon
runner.''
</P>
<P>
   The operation at Edouard-Herriot hospital was somewhat of a
marathon, lasting 17 hours. The patient was a man of small build
who lost his hands when a homemade rocket exploded as he was
preparing to launch it.
</P>
<P>
   Two teams of surgeons operated on each side. Dr. Marco Lanzetta
from Milan led one team, and Dr. Guillaume Herzberg from Lyon led
the other. They attached the hand and forearm about four to five
inches below each elbow _ about the same place where they attached
the new arm of their previous recipient, Hallam.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeons attached scores of blood vessels, tendons, muscles,
nerves and other tissues in each arm. Throughout the operation,
they gave the patient about a dozen units of blood and gallons of
fluids.
</P>
<P>
   Although the operation was long and tedious, the biggest risk in
such surgery is the risk of rejection and the potential hazards of
the drugs to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   The man has begun receiving the same regimen of four powerful
immunosuppressive drugs that was given to Hallam: anti-lymphocytic
serum, tacrolimus, mycophenolate and steroids.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the new recipient will undergo rigorous physical
and other rehabilitation therapy to gain as much hand function as
possible and undergo long-term psychological testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man will be able to endure the long post-operative
therapy,'' Dubernard said.
</P>
<P>
   But if drugs cannot control any potential rejection reaction,
either or both of the new hands may have to be amputated.
</P>
<P>
   In what is believed to have been the first hand transplant,
performed in Ecuador in 1964, the donor hand was rejected after two
weeks. Significant improvements in anti-rejection drugs,
microsurgery and other therapy were major factors in the apparent
success of Hallam's and Scott's transplants. Scott is expected to
go to Louisville for follow-up medical testing later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a triumph for immunology more than surgery because it
shows we can do now what we couldn't do a few years ago,'' Hakim
said.

FIRST JOLTS OF THE INTERNET SHAKEOUT

   NEW YORK _ For months, if not years, the virtual has trounced
the real in the stock market. Valuations of Internet concerns
vastly exceeded the values that investors assigned to companies
unlucky enough to own tangible assets. Companies with profit were
bounced for those with ``eyeballs.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, on the strength of several significant announcements,
the tables turned. The real world is back in the ascendant, and
investors are about to experience the Great Internet Shakeout.
</P>
<P>
   A big indication that the tectonic plates of the virtual world
were shifting was the bid of the highflying America Online to
acquire the landlocked Time Warner. Then the Charles Schwab Corp.,
online broker to the world, said it would acquire U.S. Trust, an
investment firm known for asset management services it provides its
decidedly blueblood clientele. Schwab appeared to be protecting
itself should the online trading boom evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   Another straw in the wind: Wal-Mart Stores announced on Jan. 7
that it was spinning off its Web operations into a dot-com.
Wal-Mart is expected to show that brick-and-mortar retailers can
beat e-tailers at their own game.
</P>
<P>
   So, even as Alan Greenspan rhapsodized in New York on Thursday
about the joys and gains relating to the Internet, that world was
starting to undergo wrenching change.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week is a bit of a watershed, in which the highflying
world of the Internet meets the concrete test of the marketplace,''
said Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at the Paribas Corp., an
investment firm in New York. AOL and Schwab were the first. ``For
the rest of the unreal world, the acid test is to come,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, investors remain extremely optimistic about
Internet stocks. The Interactive Week Internet index of 30 stocks
closed at 555.27, just 7.7 percent below its record high reached on
Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``My general concern is investors are feeling too complacent
over the extraordinary gains they got in Internet stocks in 1999,''
said David Readerman, director of Internet strategy at Thomas
Weisel Partners in San Francisco. ``It's not going to be that easy
this year. There are going to be some collosal failures.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Breyer, managing partner at Accel Partners, a venture
capital firm that is a partner with Wal-Mart.com, believes last
week's shift was epic in its significance. ``The reckoning is
coming soon,'' he said, adding that second- and third-tier Internet
companies are highly vulnerable. Equally threatened are old-economy
companies that do not get Web strategies off the ground now.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the stock market have been very forgiving of
Internet companies with big plans but little in financial results.
``Public investors have played the role of venture capitalists in
these companies,'' Breyer said. Now, venture capitalists are
getting tough with Internet companies trying to raise money, and
individual investors ought to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Readerman suspects that the shakeout has begun, noting that in
the first half of January, as Wall Street firms held Internet
investing conferences, Internet stocks did not perform that well.
``If calendar 1999 was one of discovery of the Internet, 2000 is
going to be characterized by much more rigorous scrutiny of the
business models,'' he said. ``You don't want to be completely out
of these stocks, but I'm not averse to taking some profits.'' &QL;

   IRAN-SOCCER (Los Angeles) -- With the United States and Iranian
soccer teams set to meet for the first time ever in this country at
the Rose Bowl on Sunday, local Iranians say the event also will be
a platform to express national pride and focus attention on the
repressive regime in their homeland. Iranian soccer fans now living
in the San Fernando Valley, many of whom fled their country after
the 1979 Islamic revolution, say while they plan to root for Iran,
they may sit while the anthem of the current Islamic regime is
played. ``This is one of those rare times that Iranians here can
speak out about human rights in Iran,'' said Bijan Khalili,
director of Van Nuys-based Ketab Corp., which publishes a weekly
Iranian newspaper and the Iranian Yellow Pages. Community leaders
say the Valley has the biggest population of Iranians outside of
Iran, with 100,000 to 150,000 living in the region. By Harrison

   TAINTED-SCHOOLS (Los Angeles) -- At least $25 million from local

parcels of land. Officials with the Prop BB oversight committee are
expected to attempt to recoup the money from the school district.

 &HT;    Millionaire fugitive wanted worldwide
 &HT;    EDs: EMBARGOED for Sunday, Jan. 16
 &HT;    By Bill Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fugitive millionaire James Vincent Sullivan, accused
of contracting for one of Atlanta's highest-profile murders, now is
a wanted man around the world and in cyberspace, too.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's scowling face appears second from the top on the
Georgia Bureau of Investigation Web page that shows mug shots of
fugitives sought in connection with 14 Georgia crimes. Sullivan's
photo appears right below that of Centennial Olympic Park bombing
suspect Eric Robert Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   The same photo of the 58-year-old former Palm Beach, Fla.,
investor also is posted on the Internet site of Voice of America.
He is the subject of an international crime alert stating that he
may be in Latin America or Thailand. Anyone with information is
urged to contact the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate, or to
telephone the Fulton County District Attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Sullivan paid another man to murder his wife,
Atlanta socialite Lita Sullivan. She was shot in the head 13 years
ago today (Sunday) by the gunman, who gained access to her
townhouse house by posing as a deliveryman bringing a box of pink
roses.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities contend the hit man was a North Carolina truck
driver. Philip Anthony ``Tony'' Harwood, 48, now sits in the Fulton
County jail accused of the murder, for which authorities claim he
was paid $25,000. District Attorney Paul Howard has given legal
notice he intends to seek the death penalty for Harwood, who was
arrested in April 1998 at his home in Albemarle, N.C., after police
got a tip from Harwood's former girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Harwood's lawyer, Tom West, said his client denies he was the
triggerman. ``He has consistently and repeatedly denied killing
Lita Sullivan, and he continues to do so,'' West said. ``Come on,
he's not a slick hired gun, he's just a truck driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta lawyer Ed Garland, who has represented Sullivan, said
last week he has no knowledge of his client's whereabouts or even
if Sullivan is alive. But, he said, ``if and when we are asked to,
we are prepared to defend him in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Lita LaVaughn McClinton Sullivan, daughter of Emory and JoAnn
McClinton of Atlanta, was described as a vivacious and generous
35-year-old with a love of flowers. She had left her husband of 11
years, claiming he was unfaithful and stingy with the $5 million he
had collected from the sale of an inherited liquor distributorship
in Macon, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   She was gunned down when she answered her doorbell, just hours
before a scheduled hearing in Fulton Superior Court on property
division in the couple's bitterly contested divorce suit.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 minutes after she was shot, someone placed a collect
phone call from a pay phone at an exit on Interstate 85 near
Suwanee, Ga., to James Sullivan's $3.5 million oceanfront mansion
in Palm Beach, according to testimony in court. Telephone records
show the call lasted less than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   A 1992 attempt by federal prosecutors in Atlanta to try Sullivan
on a charge of interstate conspiracy to commit murder was thrown
out for lack of evidence. But two years later, a civil jury in West
Palm Beach awarded the McClintons $4 million in damages after
concluding that Sullivan had arranged his wife's murder.
</P>
<P>
   A break in the criminal investigation came in 1998, when a woman
living in southeast Texas had her lawyer contact authorities in
Atlanta after seeing lawyers for Lita Sullivan's parents discuss
the case on the tabloid TV show ``Extra.''
</P>
<P>
   GBI agent Bob Ingram, Atlanta police Maj. G.M. ``Mickey'' Lloyd
and assistant Fulton prosecutor John Cross went to Texas to
interview the woman, a former trucker who had an on-and-off
relationship with Harwood, according to her lawyer, Ed Lieck of
Beaumont, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client told them she was with Tony Harwood when he was paid
off for Lita Sullivan's murder,'' said Lieck. He said the meeting
occurred at a restaurant, perhaps in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Lieck would not identify the woman because she fears for her
safety. He said she identified Sullivan from a photo lineup.
</P>
<P>
   But Harwood's defense lawyer, Tom West, claims no one ever has
identified Harwood as the killer. ``There are eyewitness reports of
people who saw the killer, and who saw a physical lineup including
my client, and they could not identify him,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Howard and investigator Ingram would not talk about
the woman's account, and would neither confirm nor deny that she
had identified Sullivan's photo. The FBI, working through U.S.
consulates and embassies overseas, is handling the foreign search
for the fugitive millionaire. ``We have leads in several
countries,'' said FBI spokeswoman Celestine Armistead, but she
would not provide specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the last to know anything officially about any
progress,'' said the victim's father, a retired federal official
and member of the state Board of Transportation. ``The most
difficult day for us is Christmas, not the day Lita was killed. But
I'm encouraged by any publicity, from the press, the Voice of
America, that keeps people focused on him.''
</P>
<P>
   GBI agent Ingram said he understands the family's frustration,
but he believes Sullivan, far from living the life of a millionaire
in exotic climes, is in a prison of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every fugitive I've ever interviewed said they got tired of
looking over their shoulder every time they get up and move around.
It's not a way to live; it's freedom without being free,'' Ingram
said. ``When he's caught, I think he'll fold like an accordion.''

   NOZHAI-YURT, Russia _ In the days of Soviet power, the Red Army
had political commissars in practically every unit to make sure the
soldiers obediently followed the Communist Party line, including
atheism.
</P>
<P>
   So Father Safrony's presence in the snow-capped mountains of the
rebellious southern province of Chechnya still seems a bit unusual.
Dressed in a camouflage uniform and black knit cap, the Russian
Orthodox priest is the chaplain to the Russian paratroopers who are
fighting the Islamic Chechen rebels near the Chechen-Dagestani
border here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main purpose is to raise the fighting spirit of the army
and explain to the soldiers that they are performing an important
duty,'' he said. ``We explain to them that they are real patriots.
They are not just defending territory. They are defending our
sacred Russian land.''
</P>
<P>
   In his military uniform, Father Safrony looks like any other
soldier from a distance. Up close, his long hair and wispy beard
give him away. He said he would never carry weapons as a priest,
though Russian television has carried reports about one priest who
fought with the troops and was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Orthodox priest never bears weapons,'' Father Safrony said.
``His weapon is his cross, his prayer and the words he delivers to
the soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the spirits of the army could use a little
bolstering. The deputy commander of the Russian forces in the
Northern Caucasus, Lt. Gen. Gennadi Troshev, told reporters here
Friday that the assault on Grozny, the Chechen capital, had come to
a virtual standstill. He pledged to step up the attack a few hours
after his helicopter had been hit by fire from automatic weapons
near Grozny.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Stationed in Chechen highlands, the paratroopers are far removed
from the bitter fighting in Grozny. But their mission is not always
easy. They have encircled the nearby settlements of Nozhai-Yurt and
Zamai-Yurt, so Interior Ministry troops can check each house for
militants and arms.
</P>
<P>
   At night, however, rebels creep toward them in small groups,
firing automatic weapons and grenade launchers at the Russian
command post before retreating to their mountain hideouts, using
tactics familiar to Russian soldiers who served in Afghanistan. The
Russians respond with artillery barrages but are wary of sending
troops into the mountains to chase the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our troops went into the mountains, it would mean their
destruction,'' said Capt. Aleksei Shchukovsky, 26.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Father Safrony is one of a number of chaplains dispatched here
under an agreement between the Russian Orthodox Church and the
Defense Ministry. ``I was a monk and was assigned to come here,''
Father Safrony said.
</P>
<P>
   The priest, 36, said the airborne troops had set up a chapel
dedicated to St. Alexander Nevsky, the Russian prince who defeated
the Teutonic Knights at Pskov in the 13th century. And he sees
himself as the heir to a proud pre-Soviet tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``For ages, the Russian army had a priest in every unit,''
Father Safrony said. ``During the years of Soviet power, this
practice was abolished. But the institution of the chaplaincy is
coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many officers and soldiers are still atheists, and
the attitude of many of them toward the chaplains appears to be
neutral at best. But the ties between the military and church have
strengthened in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 churches and chapels have been established on
Russian military bases, according to The Moscow Times. Russian
draftees can request service in a unit that has a priest, though it
is not always honored.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A religious academy in Moscow, St. Tikhon's Theological
Institute, offers a course on ``military service and its
correspondence to God's commandment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Strategic Rocket Forces, which wield the nation's
nuclear arsenal, has a patron saint, St. Barbara. Purely
coincidentally, Nikita Khrushchev formally established the forces
in 1960 on the saint's day.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The growing ties between the military and church have been a
concern for Muslims, who make up a significant, if minority, part
of the army.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seriously concerned that certain leaders of the Defense
Ministry are creating a split along ethnic and religious lines by
placing Orthodoxy over other religions,'' Mufti Ravil Gainutdin,
head of the Muslims in the European part of Russia, wrote. ``Is the
army made up only of Orthodox?''
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox Church insists that it is not competing with other
faiths. But its ties to the political and military establishment
are close. Several Orthodox priests were abducted in Chechnya
before the war, and Russia's patriarch, Aleksy II, has defended the
military campaign in Chechnya against Western criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are bringing order to our own country and struggling with
international terrorists who have invaded our motherland,'' the
patriarch said in November.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Nozhai-Yurt, Father Safrony's task is to comfort the
soldiers and help them sort out personal problems, which are
compounded by youth and long separation from home. Many of the
words the priest says are exactly the ones the military command
likes to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we not defend Russian land?'' Father Safrony asked.
``There is power. There are borders. And there is the motherland.
To strengthen the state, the army has to be strengthened, and there
is no army without the spirit.''

SOUTH AFRICAN HORSE IMPRESSES AT GULFSTREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How good is racing in South Africa? Judging by the easy victory
of South African star Horse Chestnut in last Saturday's $100,000
Broward County Handicap at Gulfstream Park, it must be pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   Horse Chestnut had captured 9 of 10 starts in his native country
and obviously is a superior individual, but he had never run on
dirt. However, the going proved no problem for the powerful
5-year-old, who stalked the pace from third place under Mike Smith,
then drew off through the lane to win by better than 5 lengths as
the 2-1 ($6.40) second choice. Isaypete was second at 8-1, and 6-5
favorite Rock And Roll finished third. The time for the 1 1/16th
mile was 1:42 3/5, just two ticks off the stakes record for the
Grade III event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy,'' said trainer Mike de Kock, who conditions Horse
Chestnut for owners Harry and Bridget Oppenheimer. ``I'm not too
surprised he won like that, but I wasn't sure about the horses in
another country.''
</P>
<P>
   South Africa is in the Southern Hemisphere _ horses change age
there July 1 as opposed to Jan. 1 _ so the Triple Crown season
there comes when horses in the United States would be age 4. Horse
Chestnut swept the Triple Crown, concluding his 1999 season finale
with a 10-length victory in the South African Derby April 24. He
has proved to be versatile, winning at distances from 5 furlongs to
1 1/2 miles.
</P>
<P>
   With the $6 million Dubai World Cup, which is run on dirt in
March, in mind, his connections shipped Horse Chestnut over for a
Gulfstream campaign. He has been working in Florida since
mid-December, going 5 furlongs in a rapid :59 3/5 over the
Gulfstream strip in his final tuneup for the Broward.
</P>
<P>
   Next for Horse Chestnut will be the Grade I Donn Handicap Feb.
5. If he takes that one, he will become a major player on the
international scene.

   Surfside on rise
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's only the second week of January, and trainer D. Wayne Lukas
is already in top form. After the outstanding filly Surfside
captured her 3-year-old debut in the $100,000 Santa Ysabel Sunday,
Lukas declared his charge a possible contender for the Kentucky
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Surfside has tremendous breeding. She is by Triple Crown winner
Seattle Slew, out of 2-year-old champion Flanders. Surfside has
taken five of seven starts and got the worst of it in the Breeders'
Cup Juvenile Fillies, finishing third after a wide trip. In the
Santa Ysabel, she dominated three overmatched foes despite carrying
a heavy package of 123 pounds, romping home by 8 lengths at odds of
1-5 ($2.40) with Pat Day aboard. The time for the 1 1/16th miles
was 1:43 2/5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is falling into place now,'' said Lukas. ``We can
run back in the Las Virgenes (Feb. 12), then it's 30 days to the
Santa Anita Oaks. Then we can go to either the Santa Anita Derby
(vs. males) or the Ashland (vs. females at Keeneland). Because of
her style and pedigree, Surfside looks more like a
mile-and-one-quarter horse (the Kentucky Derby distance) than
Winning Colors (a Lukas-bred filly who won the Run for the Roses in
1988). We haven't considered the Kentucky Derby this early in the
year with any other filly.''

   Buck's Boy, winner of the 1998 Breeders' Cup Turf and third last
year, wiped out the grandstand at Gulfstream Sunday when he
finished off the board in the $100,000 Mac Diarmida Handicap at
odds of 3-10. Unite's Big Red, who was first with Jorge Chavez,
returned $25.20 to win and $55.20 to show; Thesaurus, who was
second, paid $54.60 to show; and show horse Carpenter's Halo paid
$48.80 as the bridge jumpers hit the water hard. Ridden by Garett
Gomez, Buck's Boy, a noted front-runner, was pressed every step of
the way by longshot Special Coach, ridden by former Suffolk jockey
Stewart Elliot. The pair blazed through a half in :45 4/5, 6
furlongs in 1:10, and a mile in 1:35, simply too fast for a 1
1/2-mile contest, even though they opened a 12-length lead while
running like a team. Buck's Boy, who is age 7, was cooked turning
for home, fading to seventh, ahead of only Special Coach in the
eight-horse field, as the enemy flew by. ``Every time I tried to
make a move, the other horse went with me,'' said Gomez. ``Every
time I tried to take back, he laid on me. I didn't expect that. He
was on me the whole trip.'' . . . Real Quiet, winner of the 1998
Kentucky Derby and Preakness, was thought to be retired after he
fractured a splint in his leg while training for the Pacific
Classic last August. However, it now appears he will return to
action this year under an agreement made by owner Mike Pegram, no
stranger to the spotlight, and George Hofmeister, who had acquired
the breeding rights. ``He will not go to stud this spring,'' said
Bob Baffert, who trains for Pegram. ``He's over at Hollywood Park,
jogging a mile every day.'' . . . Lemon Drop Kid, winner of last
year's Belmont Stakes and Travers, is back in training at
Gulfstream. ``He's going to the track now,'' said Randy Schulhofer,
who is managing the stable while his father, Scotty, recovers from
triple bypass surgery. ``He likely won't be able to run until later
in the meeting. The Donn is out, but there is a chance he might be
ready for the Gulfstream Park Handicap (Feb. 26).'' . . . More Than
Ready, who was considered the best 2-year-old in the country last
season until he failed (fifth) in the Champagne at Belmont Oct. 9,
is also ready to return to action. More Than Ready worked a
best-of-the-day :47 4/5 for a half mile at Hialeah last Thursday to
attest to his fitness. ``He's coming along nicely,'' said trainer
Todd Pletcher. ``We're playing it by ear right now, but maybe his
first start will be in the Hutchinson (at Gulfstream Jan. 29).''

DUCTAL BREAST CANCER RECURRENCES LINKED TO AGE AND AMOUNT OF TISSUE
REMOVED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Women under 45 who have lumpectomies for an early form of breast
cancer are more likely than older women to have the disease come
back, and that may be in in part because surgeons are not removing
enough breast tissue, researchers are reporting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid it's going to scare people, but I think clinicians
and patients need to know this,'' said Dr. Frank Vicini, a clinical
associate professor of radiation oncology at William Beaumont
Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich., and first author of a study being
published Saturday in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. He
suggested that surgeons performing lumpectomies on younger women
may be reluctant to remove enough of the breast, out of concern for
the women's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Vicini said his findings applied only to women with ductal
carcinoma in situ, a very early form of breast cancer that is still
confined within the milk ducts. Commonly referred to as DCIS, or
intraductal carcinoma, they are noninvasive, meaning they have not
spread to other tissue in the breast or to lymph nodes or other
parts of the body. The tumors are usually too small to feel, and
most are detected by mammography.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 40,000 cases of intraductal breast cancer per
year in the United States. They are not counted as part of the
180,000 cases of invasive breast cancer diagnosed each year. The
number of intraductal tumors detected has increased sharply during
the past decade because mammography has become more sensitive, and
more women are being screened.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to treat the tumors has been the subject of intense
debate among doctors. Until the past decade, most cases were
treated by mastectomy, which had a cure rate of nearly 100 percent.
But when studies showed that many women with invasive breast cancer
did not need mastectomies, doctors began to question whether women
with DCIS needed the mutilating surgery, either. Medical practice
for DCIS began to shift away from mastectomy and towards a
breast-conserving procedure, lumpectomy with radiation, even though
no studies had been done to compare the two treatments for
intraductal tumors. By 1992, only 44 percent of intraductal tumors
were being treated with mastectomy, and the rest with either
lumpectomy alone or lumpectomy with radiation.
</P>
<P>
   But tumors can recur after lumpectomy and radiation: in various
studies, recurrence rates after five years varied from 6 percent to
21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Vicini's study included 146 women with DCIS who had lumpectomy
and radiation at his hospital from 1980 to 1993. The patients were
followed for a median of 7.2 years. His team found that younger
women were more likely to have recurrences: 26.1 percent of the
younger women had recurrences, as opposed to only 8.6 percent of
the older ones.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies have also shown higher recurrence rates in younger
women, and researchers have assumed that it was because breast
cancer was faster growing and more aggressive in them, and would
come back no matter how extensive the treatment was. But Vicini's
team found that surgical technique may also play a part: the
highest recurrence rates occurred in young women who had the
smallest amount of tissue removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not definitive,'' he warned, saying that the study was
small, with only 17 recurrences, and needed to be confirmed by
other studies.
</P>
<P>
   But a study published in November in the journal Cancer had
similar findings: higher recurrences in young women who had the
least amount of breast tissue removed.
</P>
<P>
   The first author of that study, Dr. Kimberly Van Zee, a breast
surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said it was
important to remove all the cancer, but that it could be especially
difficult to do so with intraductal tumors because they can spread
widely through the ducts like the branches of a tree. She also said
that intraductal tumors could spread more extensively in younger
women, possibly because their ductal tissue is more open and
interconnected than that of older women, in whom the ducts begin to
break down.
</P>
<P>
   ``More attention is paid towards cosmesis in younger women,''
she said. ``I'm not placing any judgment on that statement. It's a
fact.''
</P>
<P>
   If an entire intraductal tumor is not removed, it is not safe to
assume that radiation will take care of the rest. In fact, the risk
of recurrence within 10 years can be 30 percent to 40 percent.
Faced with those odds, Dr. Van Zee said, some women choose
mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Recurrences tend to be local, meaning within the breast. Half
are intraductal once again, but the other half are invasive,
according to Dr. Jeanne Petrek, a breast surgeon at Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   All the surgeons said that a cancer recurrence, even a local
one, is physically and emotionally devastating for most patients. A
woman who has had a course of radiation cannot have another, Dr.
Petrek said, and recurrences are nearly always treated with
mastectomy. Women with invasive recurrences, if they are an early
stage, have ten-year survival rates of 85 percent to 90 percent.

   Nurturing Diplomacy At the Waldorf-Astoria &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 31, 1999, the Waldorf-Astoria wanted to be the most Year
2000-ready hotel in New York City. Each of the nearly 1,000
employees on duty knew their midnight drill, thanks to a
color-coded battle plan drawn up in military fashion. The architect
of the plan: Alon Ben-Gurion, grandson of David Ben-Gurion, the
founding father of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Alon Ben-Gurion, 48, has been the manager _ the No. 2 executive
_ at the Waldorf since 1997. As a child, he often visited his
grandfather at many of Israel's best hotels.``Roaming the
corridors, the dining room and swimming pool fascinated me,'' he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he joined Israel's elite paratroopers _ and was badly
wounded in an ambush during the Yom Kippur War in 1973. Then he
attended Tel Aviv University, ``where I started to poke my fingers
into the hospitality business,'' he said. Then on to Cornell
University for graduate study in hotel management.
</P>
<P>
   At his bar mitzvah, his grandfather told him that ``not
everybody has to be a prime minister.'' None of David Ben-Gurion's
three children or seven grandchildren went into government. ``We
were brought up that every job is respectable, regardless of
whether you wear a tie and suit or wash dishes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wash dishes he did. He started as a busboy in a Tel Aviv
restaurant; one day, he recalled, a patron refused to be served by
a Ben-Gurion, offering to switch places. In that egalitarian
spirit, on one recent evening when the laundry truck showed up
late, he helped unload.
</P>
<P>
   The Ben-Gurion name has its advantages. Last summer, he was able
to attract Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister, to stay at the
Waldorf during a visit to New York _ the first time the Waldorf has
demonstrated such clout since Yitzhak Rabin visited seven years
ago.

<P>
   When PricewaterhouseCoopers catches a cold, James E. Copeland,
chief executive of Deloitte &AMP; Touche, sneezes. And wonders how to
keep employees from leaving to join public companies for the stock
gains that private accounting and consulting firms cannot offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said earlier this month
that most partners of PricewaterhouseCoopers had violated rules
forbidding them from investing in companies they audit. Five
partners were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland had already arranged to speak last week on the subject,
``Attracting and Keeping Your Best People,'' in a series sponsored
by the Forum Corp., a provider of corporate education and training.
His speech recounted how his firm has maintained the lowest
turnover rate of the Big Five by encouraging the advancement of
women, allowing flexible hours and rewarding employees who recruit
friends.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview, he portrayed the SEC's pressure as an
obstacle. In his view, when the rules conflict with the way members
of accounting and consulting firms might behave, it is time to toss
out the rules, not necessarily the partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to modernize the independence requirements,'' he said.
``They are arcane, archaic, overly complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Spread the wealth, not the blame, he said. ``We have to have
rules that make sense,'' he explained. ``And we have to have the
ability for our consultants to do what they do well and prosper in
this economy as a result of it.'' &QL;

``Dynamics of Leadership'' course she taught at Northwestern

   ``I give myself a B and I'm coming back to get an A because I
now know how to get it,'' Ms. Winfrey said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   After the first lecture, Ms. Winfrey gave herself only a

citing her experience and guest lecturers including Henry A.
Kissinger; Jeffrey P. Bezos, chief executive of Amazon.com; Robert
A. Iger, the ABC Network chairman, and Coretta Scott King.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her intelligence just shines through,'' said Todd Conroy, who
graduated at the end of the fall quarter. ``She was extremely
knowledgeable on the subject of leadership.''

   ``How about a kind word?'' one of the diners asks the waitress.
She ignores him. When she returns, gruffly tossing down their
plates, the man asks again, ``What about that kind word?'' This
time she relents. ``If I were you,'' she growls, ``I wouldn't eat
them eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   The story is Bradley's lighthearted way of telling audiences he
thinks it is time for greater honesty in American politics. But in
an unintended way, it is also about the dangers of so-called
straight talk. In the race for the Democratic presidential
nomination, Bill Bradley has tried to cast himself as his party's
gruff truth-teller. He talks about poverty though the economy is
soaring. He rails against the corrupting influence of campaign
contributions. He bemoans the persistence of racial injustice.
</P>
<P>
   But in style as well as substance, Bradley often resembles the
rough-edged waitress of his story. He can be curt and
uncommunicative. He sometimes ignores questions he considers silly
or intrusive. Former colleagues say he is aloof. And, as he has
shown in debates with his lone Democratic rival, Vice President Al
Gore, he can be sarcastic and condescending when attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me explain to you, Al, how the private sector works, OK?''
Bradley said patronizingly at a debate earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   To his supporters, such traits are part and parcel of what make
Bradley a different kind of politician, more honest, thoughtful and
trustworthy. To them, Bradley's bristly ways are evidence that he
can see through, and rise above, typical politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running on the radical premise that you can say what you
believe, and win,'' he often tells audiences.
</P>
<P>
   But to the undecided voters who are vital to his success,
Bradley runs the risk of being viewed as simply surly, someone
whose attacks on regular politics might be viewed as a criticism of
regular voters.
</P>
<P>
   So on a daily basis, Bradley tries to balance his rough-hewn
ways with his folksy humor, seeking to charm voters even as he
offers them tough medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it works. Bradley is easily annoyed by boom mikes that
hang in his face, and he seemed particularly irritated by a fluffy
gray one that kept flitting about his lectern during a speech in
Mason City, Iowa, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than have his staff clear the sound man away, as they
often do, Bradley interrupted his delivery to introduce ``this
little bird that has been following me.'' He then began dodging
around the flustered sound man, drawing laughs from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it falls short. Last fall at St. Anselms College, a
Catholic school in New Hampshire, Bradley opened the floor to
questions with a little joke. ``I'll call on you, and if I don't
like the question, I'll just point to the next person,'' he said to
laughter. ``Wouldn't you like it if politicians just told you what
they think?''
</P>
<P>
   But one of the first questions was one he clearly didn't like:
Would Bradley, as president, veto a ban on later-term abortions?
Bradley, a strong advocate of abortion rights, curtly answered
``Yes.'' And then without pause, or explanation, he turned away and
said, ``Next question.'' For several seconds, an awkward silence
hung over the packed room.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In running as a ``different politician'' who lives by higher
ethical standards, Bradley has also created pitfalls for himself
that other politicians might not face.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when he was asked last week whether he would
release the letters he had written to federal agencies, Bradley
practically invited reporters to check his Senate files. And
without being asked, he offered that he'd be surprised if they
found evidence he had intervened on regulatory matters.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, three letters quickly emerged showing that Bradley
had sought to help New Jersey companies who had contributed to his
campaigns. And while all seemed typical of the letters senators
write on behalf of constituents, Bradley came under criticism
largely because he had made his original claim to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's style may have created the most problems for him
during nationally televised debates where he frequently returned
fire from Gore with scornful sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   In a December debate, Bradley practically sneered when the Vice
President suggested that both candidates give up campaign
commercials. ``Al, that's good,'' Bradley said, looking at Gore's
outstretched hand. ``I like that hand. But the answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides said the insurgent's barbed remarks then and in
a later debate thrilled his supporters, who have been angered by
Gore's steady attacks on Bradley's record and platform. But the
aides acknowledged that some undecided Democrats might have found
the performances off-putting, and Bradley toned down his sarcasm
during the most recent debate in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the voters who came to Bradley's events do not generally see
his sharper edges. More often than not, the are entertained by an
upbeat, plain-spoken, somewhat goofy guy whose seems remarkably at
ease with the absurd pressures of a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   An unscheduled late-night visit to a party at an American Legion
hall in Des Moines last week showed off his silly charms. After
shaking a few hands, the candidate suddenly marched up to a table,
grabbed a pitcher of beer and took a chug straight from the
container. The crowd roared appreciatively.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, as he posed with a few supporters, Bradley began
idly tossing a basketball at the feet of the photographers, forcing
them to step back. The crowd laughed. And when his wife, Ernestine,
began dancing with another man, Bradley played the jealous husband,
stomping around in a faux huff, then grabbing another woman and
twirling her gracefully to the sound of ``Unchained Melody'' as her
beer splashed around the floor.
</P>
<P>
   And though Bradley can sound contemptuous when he criticizes
Gore to reporters, Bradley masks such feelings with voters. At the
Mason City event, for instance, he was asked about ``Corn Man,''
the Gore campaign volunteer who follows him around this state
dressed up as huge ears of corn, distributing literature
criticizing Bradley's record on farm policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real class, you know,'' Bradley said of Corn Man's appearance
that morning, sounding more like a disappointed parent than an
offended candidate. The crowd applauded, and one man even
apologized that a local resident would be so uncouth as to step
into a Corn Man suit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Bradley's efforts to remain a ``normal person'' in an abnormal
situation often involves games of cat-and-mouse with news
reporters, whom he often chides for being overly intrusive. His
campaign has refused to release the names of some advisers,
asserting that they want their privacy protected. And after Bradley
was hospitalized for a bout with irregular heartbeat last month, he
declined to release his full medical history on the grounds that it
would provide more information than people needed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his sparring with reporters is largely invisible to voters,
whose questions he rarely turns aside. In Council Bluffs last
weekend, 17-year-old Lindsay Hamilton approached Bradley following
a speech and asked him his favorite film. ``The Loneliness of the
Long Distance Runner,'' Bradley replied, referring to a 1962 film
based on the eponymous novel by Alan Sillitoe.
</P>
<P>
   But when some eves-dropping reporters asked him about the film,
Bradley demurred, as if the information would allow them to form
off-base judgments about him. ``I don't have one favorite movie,''
he said. ``It's just one of many.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later in Exira, 10-year-old Sarah Anthofer privately asked
Bradley a question that he has repeatedly declined to answer from
reporters: ``If you lose this race, will you run for president
again?'' Later, Ms. Anthofer revealed Bradley's reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, probably,'' he told her.

WAR CRIMES COURT SENTENCES 5 BOSNIAN CROATS FOR MASSACRE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The international war crimes tribunal in the Hague, in
its largest case to date, convicted five Bosnian Croat militiamen
Friday for taking part in the massacre of more than 100 Muslims in
a Bosnian village in April 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the court rejected arguments that the massacre in
Ahmici, a village in central Bosnia where Muslims, including
children, were burned alive in their homes _ was a random act.
Instead, the court found that the killings and burnings were part
of an organized effort to terrorize Muslims and get them to leave
the region.
</P>
<P>
   The presiding judge, Antonio Cassese, noted that the killing of
unarmed Muslim civilians had served no military purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indisputably, what happened on April 16, 1993, has gone down
in history as comprising one of the most vicious illustrations of
man's inhumanity to man,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the name of that small village must be added to the
long list of previously unknown hamlets and towns that recall
abhorrent misdeeds and make us shudder with horror and shame,''
Cassese said, referring to Dachau and My Lai. A total of 116 people
were killed, including 33 women and children.
</P>
<P>
   The court ordered the five men _ Zoran and Mirjan Kupreskic,
their cousin Vlatko Kupreskic, Drago Josipovic and Vladimir Santic
_ to serve sentences from 6 to 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution praised the sentences, saying they set a
benchmark for future cases of ``ethnic cleansing.'' Several
higher-ranking defendants still await verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   The court also acquitted one defendant, Dragan Papic, saying his
role in the local militia was unclear and there was insufficient
evidence to show that he had played an active role in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Since the trial began more than 15 months ago, the three trial
judges had heard testimony from 158 witnesses, some of whom
described in detail the horrors of the day when Ahmici was overrun
by fighters who machine gunned entire families, killed their
livestock and set houses on fire. One witness in the case told how
she stood on a balcony, her dead son below, as jeering Bosnian
Croat soldiers told her to jump.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five convicted men were convicted of persecution for
helping to organize or taking part in the violence, first shelling,
then house-to-house attacks, as soldiers of the Croatia Defense
Force swept through the Lasva Valley from January to May 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The court described how the five had taken part in a rampage
that resulted in the killing of Muslims and the burning of 169
houses and two mosques. The ``tragic episode'' was aimed at
expelling the Muslims from the village, stopping short of the most
serious war crimes charge, genocide, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the five convicted men said they were shocked by the
ruling and planned to appeal.

THE YIELD CURVE IS POINTING TOWARD A SHORT-TERM HAVEN

 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Worried about rising interest rates? Take a look at the yield
curve and relax. It points the way to a safe harbor for investors.
</P>
<P>
   The curve is a way to compare yields on government securities of
varying maturities. Usually the curve slopes upward, with the
yields on short-term maturities, like three-month or one-year
Treasury bills, lower than the yields on longer-term maturities,
like 10-year notes or 30-year bonds. That is because holders of the
long-term issues want to be paid more for the risk that inflation
could erode their gains.
</P>
<P>
   But the Federal Reserve has been ratcheting up its short-term
rate target, the federal funds rate, in an effort to slow economic
growth to a noninflationary pace.
</P>
<P>
   Fed officials began signaling last May that rate increases were
coming. Three separate one-quarter-point increases followed,
pushing up the federal funds target to 5.50 percent. And a further
climb of at least half a point is expected, because the economy has
shown no sign of slowing down. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman,
signaled in a speech Thursday night that rate increases should
resume when Fed policy makers meet on Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The three rate moves last year and the threat of more have
pushed short-term interest rates up sharply. Since last May, the
yield on the Treasury's one-year bill has jumped 1.25 percentage
points, to 6.10 percent. But the yield on the 30-year bond is up
far less, just 0.77 percentage point, to 6.69 percent. The
difference between the two yields is now 0.59 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In bond market parlance, the yield curve in now nearly flat _
and there are some analysts who think that it will actually invert.
That means short-term interest rates would be higher than long-term
ones.
</P>
<P>
   So how does this help nervous bond investors? It gives them a
place to hide out without paying a big price.
</P>
<P>
   There is almost no penalty now for buying less-risky short-term
Treasury securities. And that makes it easier to survive a
continued sell-off in the bond market if long-term interest rates
rise to 7 percent or higher, as some analysts predict.
</P>
<P>
   With rates rising, investors can lose on two counts. First, the
bonds they own are paying lower interest rates than the new ones
issued as rates rise, essentially an opportunity cost. Second,
since new bonds offer higher rates, the prices of their old bonds
decline, leaving them with a capital loss if they have to sell
their bonds.
</P>
<P>
   If investors have to sell, or if their money is in a bond fund
that is realizing such losses, times are tough. Last year, as
interest rates rose across the board, the Lehman Brothers Treasury
index of securities from bills to bonds, fell 2.56 percent. And the
index of just long-term Treasury bonds, which are more vulnerable
to rate increases, fell even more _ 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   An investor could sit out the bond market turmoil by owning a
one-year Treasury bill yielding 6.10 percent. That yield is not far
below the 6.69 percent of the 30-year bond _ and the risk of
capital loss is much less.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative is the six-month Treasury bill, yielding 5.66
percent. Some analysts expect the Fed to be through raising rates
by the summer; by then, the six-month bill will have matured, and
money can then be shifted into longer-term notes or bonds as rates
are falling, adding a capital gain to the return.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, it is relatively easy to hold a six-month bill
until it matures, therefore avoiding the kind of capital loss that
would be incurred by selling a higher-yielding but longer-term
security.
</P>
<P>
   Other vehicles to consider are money market funds. Laurie White,
a managing director at Wells Capital Management, says they are
better than Treasury bills because an investor can get higher
yields in the fund as market rates rise; the Treasury bill rate
doesn't change. One such fund, Wells Fargo Cash Investment, has a
current yield of 5.72 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But investors with money in a bond fund would be hit with
capital losses as prices of bonds fell with an increase in interest
rates. In a money market fund, Ms. White said, ``you do avoid the
losses when rates rise, especially when you compare the stable net
asset value of a money market fund to the variable net asset value
of a bond fund.''
</P>
<P>
   For Douglas R. Cliggott, the United States equity strategist at
J.P. Morgan Securities, the short end of the yield curve is a good
place for the time being, for both bond and stock investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are telling people to get out of stocks and bonds,'' he
said. ``We think you are going to get a 7 percent long-bond yield.
And we would rather have people buy Treasury bills and sit and
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   So, for the near term, cash looks good.

<P>
   Shareholder meetings are not usually the occasion for utter
candor _ or for that matter, arch sarcasm _ by chief executives.
But what if Gerald R. Levin, chief executive of Time Warner, which
announced on Monday that it would merge with America Online, were
to depart from tradition? He might say something like this: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Greetings, fellow shareholders!
</P>
<P>
   As you may be aware, this has been a very exciting year for Time
Warner. In addition to the creative and financial success of movies
like ``Wild Wild West'' and ``The Astronaut's Wife,'' we again
demonstrated the benefits of synergy by the nearly simultaneous
release of ``Pokemon: The First Movie'' and a Time magazine cover
story on the phenomenon. This, of course, follows our flagship
publication's teamwork with the CNN cable network in their 1998
coverage of the Tailwind incident.
</P>
<P>
   We began the new year with a very big bonus for you, the often
beset-upon Time Warner shareholder. After a decade in which our
company's stock nearly matched the Standard and Poor's 500 index,
we began 2000 by announcing the biggest deal in history, when
America Online agreed to buy us for $165 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Did I say America Online agreed to buy us? My mistake. This is a
merger of equals. Sure, America Online shareholders are getting 55
percent of the new company, while we will receive only 45 percent.
But that's almost equal, isn't it? I mean, 55-45 or 50-50 _ who can
tell?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I get to be chief executive of the new AOL Time Warner,
and chief executive is really more important than chairman. Not
just any executive, mind you, but the top guy, the Numero Uno _
except for Steve Case. Er, Mr. Case.
</P>
<P>
   And no, I could not care less that Steve, um, Mr. Case, is about
20 years younger than me. No, I am pleased that AOL Time Warner
will be in strong hands long after I have retired.
</P>
<P>
   So, shareholders, you may be asking yourself why I agreed to
merge shares in our venerable enterprise for the paper of a company
that barely existed a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The short answer: I had to.
</P>
<P>
   Let me tell you about Time Warner and its entertainment kin,
which Wall Street is fond of calling growth companies. Yes, over
the past 10 years we've had success with new magazines like InStyle
and even started a television network. But the part of our business
that's really growing is our share base, as we hand out more and
more options to our worthy executives, producers, editors and key
grips. (Even I have no idea how we got to 1.5 billion shares.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie industry is saturated, our music business has stunk
for two years in a row and the circulation of our flagship product,
Time magazine, for years has been as flat as Tori Amos's tummy.
</P>
<P>
   Want the hard numbers for our most recent quarter, ended
September 1999? Revenues were $6.72 billion, a fat 2 percent
increase over the $6.59 billion we posted in the 1998 quarter.
Excluding one-time gains, net income was $110 million, up from $35
million in the same period in 1998. Shareholders, I'll spell it out
for you: a 2 percent net profit margin and 2 percent annual sales
growth isn't Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, our business is celebrities, not, say, groceries,
so investors tend to lose perspective on just how anemic our
returns are. (The hundreds of millions of dollars in investment
banking fees we threw at Wall Street last decade probably help,
too.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, shareholders, there are only a couple of media
businesses that are growing. Cable networks are pretty decent, and
we have a couple of those. People are starting to believe in the
value of broadband cable systems _ and we are the nation's
second-largest cable system operator.
</P>
<P>
   So before DirecTV took away too many of our cable subscribers, I
decided to trade my assets for the chance at a real growth
business: the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that the world's largest media company would be
able to get onto the Internet on its own. There you would be wrong.
Entertaindom.com isn't eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some say AOL is overvalued. I can hardly disagree, given
that it trades at about 200 times earnings. But do you know what?
So do we.
</P>
<P>
   True, our shares trade at only about 20 times cash flow, but
despite what we have managed to convince the analyst community,
taxes are a real cost. You've got to pay them, or the government
gets very testy. And, I should add, that goes for interest, too.
This despite our success in focusing Wall Street's attention on
Ebitda, or cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that if I'm going to be trading at a
price-earnings multiple of 200, I would much rather be a real
growth business than a pretend growth business. So when AOL came
knocking, looking to put our cable systems to good use, I was more
than happy to tell Steve, ``I do.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, considering that AOL was more than twice as highly
valued as we were before Jan. 10, I'm pretty pleased.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for coming.

MOB BURIAL SPOT YIELDS BODIES OF TWO MEN, WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Digging through the night shielded from biting cold,
authorities early Friday unearthed the remains of two men and a
woman after being tipped off to the burial spot by a top lieutenant
to fugitive South Boston crime boss James ``Whitey'' Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   While authorities have yet to identify the victims believed to
have been killed by Bulger and his longtime cohort, Stephen Flemmi,
sources said Bulger confidant Kevin Weeks claims Arthur ``Bucky''
Barrett, John McIntyre, and Deborah Hussey, Flemmi's stepdaughter,
were buried in the eight-foot deep grave in the city's Dorchester
section.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger and Flemmi have long been suspects in the murders of
Barrett, one of six men charged with the $1.5 million Depositors
Trust bank heist in suburban Medford in 1980, and McIntyre, who was
suspected of cooperating against Bulger in an ill-fated plot to run
guns to the Irish Republican Army. Barrett disappeared in 1983 and
McIntyre vanished the following year.
</P>
<P>
   And Boston police have for years considered Flemmi a suspect in
the 1984 disappearance of Hussey, 26, who was allegedly about to
expose her sexual affair with Flemmi, her mother's longtime
common-law husband.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks, who has been described as Bulger's ``surrogate son,'' has
turned on Bulger in the wake of his own indictment on federal
racketeering charges in November.
</P>
<P>
   His revelations are expected to bring an avalanche of new
charges against Bulger and Flemmi, both longtime FBI informants,
and possibly against their former handler, retired FBI Agent John
J. Connolly Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger and Flemmi were indicted on federal racketeering charges
in January 1995 that ultimately led to the disclosure that they
were informants. That prompted a number of former cohorts to
cooperate against them.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger remains a fugitive, while Flemmi is in jail awaiting
trial.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Connolly was charged in a new federal racketeering
indictment along with Bulger and Flemmi that alleges he protected
them from crimes and warned them about the 1995 indictment so they
could run.
</P>
<P>
   During a press conference, US Attorney Donald K. Stern and
Suffolk District Attorney Ralph C. Martin 2d confirmed that bones
retrieved during a painstaking search were those of two men and a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   But they refused to identify the victims, noting that it will
likely take a couple of months for DNA tests to determine who they
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have preliminary views of who they might be,'' said Stern,
adding that forensic experts will compare DNA found at the
gravesite with other DNA evidence in an effort to find a match.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investigators quietly notified the families of
McIntyre, Barrett and Hussey about the possibility that their
bodies had been located and began seeking DNA evidence from them to
match with remains found in Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett's widow, Elaine, declined to comment Friday but said
investigators told her there was a ``possibility'' one of the
recovered bodies was that of her husband. They also told her
forensic tests must be conducted to confirm identities.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre's son and Hussey's mother, Marion, both declined to
comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a court ruling last September, US District Judge Mark L. Wolf
concluded there was ``reason to be concerned'' that Connolly had
warned Bulger and Flemmi that McIntyre was cooperating against them
-- a breach that probably would have marked him for death.
</P>
<P>
   In the days before Barrett disappeared, there were rumors
circulating in the underworld that he was cooperating with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett was among a number of men arrested on April 6, 1983 when
FBI and DEA agents raided a South Boston warehouse loaded with
marijuana. The FBI had apparently received a tip about the
warehouse from Bulger, who was miffed that Charlestown gangster
Joseph Murray was storing drugs in his hometown without his
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Hussey and Flemmi were not married, but they raised her
children from an earlier marriage together in Flemmi's house, a
typical suburban home in Milton, just outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi often referred to Deborah Hussey and her siblings as his
children and was introduced to their friends as their father,
according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Hussey reportedly had problems with drug abuse and had a
criminal record, including an arrest for auto theft.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Dennis J. Kelly, who represents Weeks, declined to
comment Friday on whether Weeks has negotiated a deal with
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi's lawyer, Kenneth Fishman, said only, ``Obviously, if and
when there are additional charges that result from this
investigation we will comment on them at that time and deal with
them at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were found underneath about seven to eight feet of
soil along a former freight train railroad spur being converted by
the Metropolitan District Commission into bike path connecting
Castle Island in South Boston to Pope John Paul II park on the
Neponset River.
</P>
<P>
   Although the site is at the edge of a well-lighted parking lot
along a busy street, it was heavily wooded during the early 1980s,
according to neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts State Police, the US Drug Enforcement
Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Boston Police and
the Suffolk County Medical Examiner's Office focused with
laser-like precision on the area where the first human bones were
discovered early Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The search was conducted like an archeological dig. Enclosed in
yellow and white striped party tents and warmed by portable
heaters, police and medical examiner staffers used spoons, small
tools and sifting screens to carefully extricate even the smallest
pieces of remains from the mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the investigation that led them to the bodies was
likely to bring investigators any closer to catching Bulger, Stern
replied, ``Well, we don't believe he was one of the two (male)
bodies.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every morning when Edward Dolman goes to work, he has
to fight his way through the throngs outside the NBC studio windows
as fans try to catch a glimpse of Katie Couric or Matt Lauer on the
``Today'' set.
</P>
<P>
   Dolman slips through unnoticed as he heads to a fifth-floor
office with views of Rockefeller Center's Art Deco towers and its
skating rink.
</P>
<P>
   In the auction and art world, however, where Dolman has worked
for 16 years, his celebrity is growing. On Christmas Eve,
Christie's sent an e-mail message to its staff announcing that he
would be its new chief executive. While the name of Dolman, a
sandy-haired Briton who had risen through the ranks at Christie's,
had been bandied about within the company as a possible successor
to Christopher Davidge, its chief for six years, many of its
clients had never heard of him.
</P>
<P>
   For months, there had been talk that Davidge was on his way out.
Board members say he fought with them and was not liked by Francois
Pinault, the French investor who bought Christie's a year and a
half ago. Pinault, whose holdings also include Printemps, Chateau
Latour and Gucci, has a reputation for studying a company's
performance the first year after he buys it and then changing
management.
</P>
<P>
   Dolman is young for someone in such a position. Asked his age,
he replied coyly, ``39 but I turn 40 in February.'' Dolman's wife,
Clare, is a former journalist. They have two children, ages 9 and
11.
</P>
<P>
   He described his preparation for Christie's with an irreverent
grin. ``I studied economics and history at Dulwich College in
London where I wasn't a particularly good student but I was
obsessed by sport,'' especially rugby, he said. ``From there I went
to Southampton University. By the time I left, I wanted to do
something in the art business.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he did not have the capital to become a dealer and found
the museum world ``too stale,'' he joined Christie's South
Kensington, where lower-priced objects were sold. (Generally, it
took family connections to start at Christie's London headquarters
on King Street.) ``That was in 1984,'' Dolman recalled. ``In those
days if you were male you were made a porter. I was making an
appalling annual salary of 2,800 pounds a year so I gave myself a
year.'' (That pay is about $4,480 at today's exchange rates.)
</P>
<P>
   His rise from porter to chief executive is not a fairy tale come
true but rather a frequent path to an auction house's executive
suites.He was made a junior expert in the English furniture
department exactly a year after his hiring, all the while
continuing to play rugby. ``I'd always been the captain of teams,''
he said. ``I had an obvious aptitude for leading teams.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an aptitude, he said, that he wanted to exploit. In five
years, he worked his way up to join the management team at South
Kensington. There, he reached out to Christie's richer clients, who
had shopped only at the higher-priced King Street or Manhattan
locations, by offering more specialized sales, like ones devoted to
the contents of stately English country homes, and publishing more
elaborate catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized there was a huge appetite for furniture and art
that wasn't expensive but looks the money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One promotion led to another. By 1995, he was managing director
of Christie's in Amsterdam; two years later he was back in London,
where he would become managing director of Christie's for all of
Europe. Last July, he came to New York to run North and South
American operations.
</P>
<P>
   For 200 years, Christie's has had the same goal: to beat
Sotheby's. Sotheby's was the market leader for 43 years until 1997,
when Christie's edged ahead in sales, $1.602 billion to $1.599
billion. They have run neck-and-neck since.
</P>
<P>
   While the companies have had different personalities _ the
cliche is that Christie's has gentlemen trying to be businessmen
and Sotheby's has businessmen trying to be gentlemen _ Pinault has
brought a new distinction. When he bought Christie's for $1.2
billion, he took it private; Sotheby's is still a public company.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues see Dolman as a feet-on-the-ground manager, but not
necessarily a creative deal-maker or strategist. But his
malleability might have helped him win and keep Pinault's favor,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   Dolman takes over as Christie's and Sotheby's, forever copying
each other in business practices, are moving in opposite
directions. In a surprise announcement in November, Christie's said
it would not link up with an Internet company as Sotheby's had done
with Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was great pressure to go into partnership with an
e-commerce company but we felt it would be diluting our brand and
throwing away our expertise,'' Dolman said. ``We realized we
couldn't make enough money selling low-priced, high-volume
merchandise.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Christie's intends to make all aspects of the company
interactive, with online auctions, Internet views of auctions in
sales rooms and technology that lets clients view merchandise on a
virtual-reality Web site _ with the ability, for example, to open
drawers of a piece of furniture.
</P>
<P>
   But with Pinault, known for capitalizing on luxury brand names,
as its owner, people in the art world wonder how he and Dolman plan
to exploit Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no plans to put Christie's name on handbags or
perfume,'' responded Dolman, alluding to Sotheby's failed 1971
introduction of a Sotheby's cigarette. ``We want to concentrate on
the core of our business, the top end of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   To get a return on his investment, however, Pinault, with
Dolman's help, is looking at Christie's real estate holdings. The
company controls one of the most prestigious blocks in London, in
the St. James area. Surveyors recently studied the possibility of
retail and hotel development of the site. Christie's headquarters
on King Street, Dolman said, will stay put.
</P>
<P>
   Dolman, however, said he did not even know which city would be
his own base, though he maintained that London would remain the
company's home. In March, Christie's will open such a large,
well-located building on Avenue Matignon in Paris _ in anticipation
of the the planned opening of the French auction market to
foreigners _ that company employees are speculating whether the
headquarters will move to that city, where Pinault is based. Or
perhaps to New York, the site of its biggest auctions.
</P>
<P>
   But Dolman has a clear notion of how he sees Christie's brand
name versus the competition. ``When people think of Christie's they
will think fine art auctioneers. When they think of Sotheby's they
will think of Sotheby's.Amazon.com or Amazon.Sotheby's.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Which will end up the more profitable _ the auction house going
after the mass market or the one trying to turn a profit from
another record-breaking van Gogh? It is too early to say.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the sportsman _ and the businessman, rather than the
aesthete _ Dolman is betting that as soon as large estates come up
for grabs, Christie's will be more likely to snag them than
Sotheby's, which is now steeped in its Internet endeavors. As
Dolman put it, ``They will have taken their eye off the ball.''

BUYING AIRLINES' MUTUAL FUNDS: IS IT THE RETURN, OR THE MILES?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: R.I., Mass.)  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Graphic of
performance of American AAdvantage mutual funds is being sent to
NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coffee? Tea? Intermediate-term bond funds?
</P>
<P>
   As if airlines did not face enough competition from fare wars, a
few carriers are now venturing into one of the most competitive
businesses around _ money management. They are offering mutual
funds that compete with those from the giants like Janus, Vanguard
and Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways, one of the world's largest airlines, teamed up
with the Royal Bank of Canada to introduce a multiple-currency
money market fund in November that holds cash in bank deposits and
money market securities.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the Virgin Group, the parent of Virgin Atlantic,
British Air's archrival, jolted the staid British fund industry by
opening two no-load equity funds; it now has a tidy $3.65 billion
in assets under management (though no tie-ins yet with Virgin Cola
or Vodka, or with Virgin's record stores).
</P>
<P>
   But the grand fund marketer of the world's carriers is the AMR
Corp., parent of American Airlines. Over the last 12{ years, AMR
has been building a family of funds under the American AAdvantage
brand and now has 10 funds, including three money market funds,
with about $22 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   The funds marketed by American AAdvantage and British Airways
allow them to offer frequent-flier miles to investors, but
investors may want to think twice before buying shares. Returns on
most of the airlines funds have been subpar, and many of the
mileage awards, when an investor does the math, do not come cheap.
</P>
<P>
   People who need just a few miles for an upgrade to a first-class
ticket, for example, might be able to save money by simply buying
miles directly from their favorite airline _ something American
generally does not allow)
</P>
<P>
   British Airways said it would give a one-time award of 500 miles
for an initial investment that exceeds 5,000 pounds (about $8,200).
The American Airlines' funds are more generous _ one mile a year
for every $10 invested in its Mileage class shares. That means an
$8,200 investment would earn 820 miles a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When American Airlines started the funds, they were clearly
unique,'' said Geoff Bobroff, a fund consultant in East Greenwich,
R.I., adding that ``it was very innovative to link miles with
account balances.''
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines' funds offer one clear benefit. Their expenses
are relatively low, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago
financial publisher. For example, expenses for the cheapest share
class of the American AAdvantage Large Cap Value fund that is open
to the public, the PlanAhead class, are 0.86 percent, versus 1.33
percent for its peers, according to Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   While the airlines may seem odd purveyors of mutual funds, the
fit is more natural than it looks. Many airline companies _
including AMR _ have long relied on outside money managers to run
their pension funds and other investments.
</P>
<P>
   AMR soon figured that it could make money by attracting
investments, largely from passengers, and then turning over the
capital to money managers handling its pension fund. As the funds
grew in number and assets, AMR brought in more outside managers,
known as subadvisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``By using a subadviser, the airlines can save on the fund's
expenses,'' said William Dougherty, president of Kanon Bloch Carre,
a Boston consulting company. ``The airlines usually negotiate a
good rate with companies to manage their pension money.'' They then
can use that relationship to get low rates for their fund assets as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The American AAdvantage funds include a balanced fund, large-
and small-capitalization value funds, an international equity fund,
a Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fund, intermediate and short-term
bond funds and three money market funds. (Not all of them, however,
are tracked by Morningstar, and therefore do not appear in the
mutual fund tables of The New York Times.)
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the funds may appeal mainly to conservative or novice
investors; several experts pointed out that the funds have
relatively conservative subadvisers. That leaning is
understandable: an airline would not want to risk losing valued
frequent fliers by exposing them to big losses during a market
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you buy the American Airlines fund,'' Dougherty said,
``you may not get a blockbuster, but you won't make a big
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the subadvisers for the AMR funds is Barrow, Hanley,
Mewhinney &AMP; Strauss, for its intermediate bond funds; the Barrow
firm also manages some Vanguard funds. Another is Brandywine Asset
Management, which manages American's small-cap value fund.
</P>
<P>
   In general, airline funds have been lackluster performers of
late. The British Airways currency fund, for example, bills itself
as an alternative to ordinary savings accounts, but its best
performer _ the United States dollar class _ had a 12-month return
of 4.32 percent through Dec. 30, a gain that trails that of many
certificates of deposit and the average money market fund.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nor have most ofthe AAdvantage funds, perhaps because of their
conservative bent, looked like dynamos. The Mileage class of the
American AAdvantage International Equity fund, for example, notched
a three-year annualized gain of 15.09 percent through December,
according to Lipper Inc., a fund research firm. That puts it in
well into the bottom half of the 394 funds in its peer group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Airlines funds have not reached a high-powered
performance,'' Bobroff said. ``But this is a sideline business for
AMR. They may not have dedicated all the resources internally that
the business needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many mutual funds, those offered by AMR have several
classes of shares. Investors who want frequent-flier miles buy the
Mileage class; financial advisers and those who are not interested
in the points can buy the PlanAhead class. AMR employees can buy
the AMR class, and institutions _ or those who with a minimum of $2
million to invest _ buy the institutional class.
</P>
<P>
   Each class has a different set of fund expenses. For the Large
Cap Value fund, investors in the Mileage class pay 1 percent of
assets annually, according to Morningstar, compared with 0.86
percent for the PlanAhead class, 0.31 percent for the AMR class and
0.57 percent for the institutional class.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of airline funds say that American is too stingy with
the miles it awards and that the increased expenses for Mileage
class investors, in comparison to those for the PlanAhead share
classes that don't provide miles, are not a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   It helps to do the math: an investor who puts $10,000 in the
Mileage class of the international fund pays 1.48 percent in
expenses and receives 1,000 frequent flier miles a year. Those who
buy PlanAhead shares of the same fund would pay just 1.08 percent a
year and receive no miles. The cost to the Mileage class
shareholders? Four cents a mile.
</P>
<P>
   But the going rate for a frequent-flier mile is 2.5 cents,
according to InsideFlyer, which tracks frequent flier perks. And
miles can be had for even less than that. MCI and Citibank, for
example, routinely buy miles from the airlines for consumer
giveaways and seldom pay more than 1.5 cents each.
</P>
<P>
   The other American AAdvantage funds don't have the same wide gap
in expense ratios between those share classes. But none of this
takes into account the price an investor is paying because of the
relative underperformance of the funds compared with their peers.
</P>
<P>
   A better deal appears to be the three American AAdvantage money
market funds available to the public. Their three-year performances
are all well above average.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Gallagher, director of marketing for AMR Investments,
said the mileage shares ``are for our customers who are real
collectors of miles.'' Such customers find the free miles just as
important as expenses and a good return, she said.
</P>
<P>
   AAdvantage Mileage shares are not reversible _ that is, if
investors earn more frequent-flier miles than they can use, they
cannot convert them into dollars to invest in the funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're flying 200,000 miles each year, chances are you
already have a 401(k) plan taking care of you,'' said Edward S.
Rosenbaum, research director at Lipper.

WAR-CRIMES TRIBUNAL FOR TIMOR UNLIKELY, ENVOYS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAURIA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The UN Security Council, which responded to Yugoslav
and Rwandan atrocities by ordering the first international
war-crimes courts since the end of World War II, appears unlikely
to follow suit in East Timor, UN officials and diplomats said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition from China and Russia and questions about financing
might doom an international court, say the UN officials, who spoke
on condition they not be named.
</P>
<P>
   For now, diplomats such as US Ambassador Richard init? Holbrooke
are pinning their hopes on an internal tribunal held by Indonesia,
whose military controlled East Timor from 1975 until August and is
blamed by human-rights groups for the atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is watching to determine whether the Indonesia
leadership has the strength to impose its own internal inquiry
without an international inquiry. . . . If the people in the
military continue to oppose it, they will do great damage to their
country and will bring international pressure to a much higher
level,'' Holbrooke told reporters here and by telephone to
Indonesian officials Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the international tribunals found
evidence that senior political and military leaders had ordered
numerous mass killings, the targeting of civilians and rape as a
means to conduct war.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the horrors of those places were evoked when at least
hundreds of people were slaughtered after East Timor voted in a
UN-run referendum for independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's hope that Indonesia can prosecute its own war
criminals comes despite intimidation of investigators there and
stonewalling by military leaders suspected of organizing atrocities
carried out by militias.
</P>
<P>
   However, Holbrooke told reporters that the ``international
pressure for a tribunal will increase directly to the extent that
the Indonesians cannot settle this problem internally.''
</P>
<P>
   The UN sent a commission of inquiry to the newly independent
territory last November for nine days to see if a war crimes court
is warranted. Its report, called ``tough'' by one official, was
given this week to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, who will
forward it to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is extremely unlikely the council will create a new
(international) tribunal because they can't persuade Russia and
China,'' said one of the officials. ``If a political decision is
made, then we can find the money.''
</P>
<P>
   The UN's commission of inquiry was faced with many obstacles
while it was in the area. The Indonesian government, for instance,
would not allow it to interview East Timorese who had fled to West
Timor. Opposition from many Asian governments, including China, had
also delayed the commission's departure to the area for two months.
</P>
<P>
   The United States would continue to deny military to military
cooperation with Indonesia until there is accountability for the
crimes committed, Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   He also responded to persistent rumors of a military coup in
Jakarta. ``It would do Indonesia perhaps irreparable damage. Any
Indonesian army officers thinking of military adventurism, have
forgotten we are now in the 21st Century, the events of the past
cannot be repeated. No rational Indonesian would want it, except
the few people trying to protect their own skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, agrees
that a meaningful prosecution in Indonesian courts is still
possible. ``Right now it doesn't look good, however, there is
tremendous intimidation of some of the Indonesian investigators and
the generals are getting worried. There's a civilian-military power
struggle going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said, ``A huge struggle is continuing on all fronts
between the forces of progress of President Wahid and Indonesian
military who are protecting themselves, refusing accountability and
openness and thwarting the process.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of justice for East Timor hinges on the outcome,
Holbrooke said.

<P>
   ``City of Angels'' is prime-time network television's great
black hope. Given the fall season's all-white-all-the-time lineup,
the mere astonishing fact that this is the only drama on the major
networks with a predominantly minority cast rates it immediate and
significant attention, but it also places an undue burden on this
show. Just as a minority character on a show shouldn't be
considered representative of a particular race, this show or its
fate with viewers shouldn't be considered representative of all
series with pointedly multiethnic casts.

   Of course, if they were all this good, that certainly wouldn't
be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder if this series would even make it to the tube if it
weren't under the aegis of Steven Bochco (collaborating with his
A-list, Emmy-winning ``NYPD Blue'' director Paris Barclay).
Bochco's first CBS series, incidentally, was ``Paris,'' starring
James Earl Jones as a police captain. It passed quickly from the
airwaves despite critical acclaim and adoration of its target
audience _ and is often, along with Tim Reid's ``Frank's Place,''
cited as an example that quality series exploring African-American
issues can't sustain big enough audiences to survive on network TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``City of Angels'' focuses on Angels of Mercy, a crumbling urban
Los Angeles hospital running more on heart than adequate equipment,
held together by the sweat and passion of its dedicated physicians.
As befitting a Bochco production, ``City of Angels'' opens with a
splash, in a shocking sequence that catches Garrett Morris, as a
soon-to-be-dethroned administrator, in a compromising position.
</P>
<P>
   The series nails the telling details of a hospital suffering
from terminal neglect _ the two indifferent reporters attending a
press conference about a blues singer's death, the destructive
administrative mindset that prefers spending money to settle a
nuisance lawsuit rather than make meaningful, genuine improvements.
</P>
<P>
   And the cast, led by Blair Underwood as Dr. Ben Turner and
Vivica A. Fox as Dr. Lillian Price, the newly ensconced medical
director, shows the facility to switch from earnest drama to high
comedy at a moment's notice. Robert Morse, as the dubiously
motivated and apparently besotted politico in whose hands the
hospital's fate rests, is a nicely quixotic character whose
peccadilloes the writers carry a whit too far.
</P>
<P>
   The racial tensions existing within the TV industry itself are
manifested in some fairly self-conscious moments on screen: One
character jokingly introduces himself to a Jewish resident
physician, ``Greetings _ I'm a black man.'' It's self-conscious
about its quirky plotting and inside jokes, as well. Two patients
who share a common name are confused; one ends up in the morgue and
the other ends up nearly getting the wrong operation. There's one
outlandish storyline, however, that provides a particularly
appropriate and wonderfully tasteless dig at the Golden Globe
Awards in episode two.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, however, the series' biggest challenge seems to
be coming up with medical stories that are as compelling as they
are convoluted. In tonight's episode, an elderly woman needing
surgery refuses it because she's her grandchildren's legal guardian
and fears losing custody if she's out of commission _ and the only
solution is to bust the mother out of jail. Semi-legally, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a doctor endangers a patient he assumes to be a
gang member by first attending to others with less dire injuries,
which inevitably leads to a message about the evils of prejudice,
even if it's intraracial. The gospel wailing on the sound track
(``All right, oh yeah, ooh oooh'') is significantly more emotional
than the scenes it plays over, making it feel terribly
manipulative. It likewise wasn't necessary to give Turner and Price
an only-in-Hollywood past love affair. The actors' chemistry
supercedes such a back story, and, at any rate, they have enough to
do restoring the hospital's vital signs. Using their personal
feelings as an obstacle feels like a bit of a cheat.
</P>
<P>
   So far, ``City of Angels'' is a solid, fairly smart series that
doesn't quite reach out and grab the viewer as Barclay and Bochco's
previous collaborations have done. But a cast capable of doing that
when the writing hits its stride is definitely in place. When
Underwood tells Fox, ``Make this a proud place again,'' he seems to
be referring to the predominantly white television landscape as
much as Angels of Mercy. &QL;

<P>
   Tonight's ``Wonderful World of Disney'' offering, ``The Loretta
Claiborne Story,'' is pretty solid as inspirational TV movies go.
Kimberly Elise (``Beloved'') stars as Loretta, who was born mildly
retarded and with other physical setbacks that prevented her from
walking or talking until she was 4 years old. She surmounted her
disabilities, not to mention prejudice, to become both a
gold-medal-winning athlete at _ and a passionate spokesperson for _
the International Special Olympics. In 1996 she won the Arthur Ashe
Award for Courage.
</P>
<P>
   The Special Olympics couldn't have asked for a better calling
card. Elise gives a strong, tough, laudably unromanticized
performance, and she's matched the conviction Tina Lifford brings
to the role of Loretta's hard-working, over-extended single mom.
Emmy winner Camryn Manheim of ``The Practice'' makes something
interesting of the usually rote role of the angelic social worker
who believed in Loretta when no one else would.
</P>
<P>
   Director Lee Grant and screenwriter Grace McKeaney trust their
material and eschew manipulatively treacly moments; they've created
a smart and moving tribute to Claiborne and those like her, whose
fierce resolve overcomes their shortcomings. &QL; 
____ &QL;

   ``On the Inside: The CIA'' is, by definition, a partial
whitewash, but it's still fascinating for its portrait of the most
secure _ and likely most paranoid _ organization in the world. How
secure/paranoid? Well, the CIA buildings in Langley, Va., are
surrounded by shell buildings, exo-skeletons, if you will; white
noise is pumped between the inner and the outer buildings so that
no listening devices may discern certain incriminating keystroke
patterns on the computer keyboards inside. If that's not intense
enough for you, try this: The guys dealing with the trash have the
highest security clearances imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   The report, narrated by James Coburn, portentously declares,
``Never before _ and never again _ will anyone delve so deeply''
into the agency's secrets. It's separated, arbitrarily, into two
one-hour parts: ``America's Front Line,'' relating fascinating
agency particulars, and ``The New Threats,'' touching on
international terrorism but getting bogged down in drug
trafficking. There's a lot of padding and rhetoric here,
particularly involving the recruiting techniques _ they seek out
the most qualified candidates for positions, who'da thunk? _ but
the dribbles of cool spy information make the dull stuff
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, a re-enactment of the painstaking detail that
went into a Panamanian prison rescue _ OK'd by former President
George Bush, one of the interviewees here, and lasting in its
actual execution a mere six minutes _ is utterly absorbing, alone
worth the price of admission, as they say. This is as close to CIA
headquarters as we're likely to get, and as close as most of us
probably would ever want. &QL;

`MILLENNIUM FEVER' APPEARS TO HAVE HELPED MANY POSTPONE DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the year 2000 approached, most Americans thought
mainly of New Year's revelry or the possibility of widespread
computer failure. But some apparently were focused on something
much more basic: drawing breath on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, people in New York City died at a remarkably
higher rate during the first seven days of 2000 as compared with
the same period in 1999, and they may be emblematic of the nation
as a whole. Many researchers have long believed that people are
able to postpone their deaths when they face a major event like a
family wedding, and perhaps the suspense of seeing whether
computers would malfunction proved just too alluring, given the
alternative of a funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The will to live can be pretty powerful,'' said Robert N.
Butler, founder and president of the International Longevity
Center, a research and education group. He professed no surprise
that many people seemed to have held death temporarily at bay, but
was impressed by their numbers. ``It does look significant,'' he
said of New York's statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Figures are not available nationally, but in New York City,
which is known for its record-keeping in health matters, 1,791
people who saw out 1999 died in the first week of 2000, 50.8
percent more than the 1,187 who died in the same period in 1999,
and 46.1 percent more than the 1,226 people who died in the last
week of 1999, according to the New York City Department of Health.
In 1998 there were 1,305 deaths in the first week of the year.
</P>
<P>
   A Health Department spokesman, John Gadd, said that it took
considerable time to analyze such data and that he could not
explain the magnitude of this year's surge. He did, however, rule
out attributing it to influenza, which he said had been running at
normal levels here.
</P>
<P>
   Gadd noted only 31 flu ``outbreaks'' in the city so far this
season compared with 32 in the same period last year. An outbreak
is defined as three or more cases in a group setting, like a
nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   To what extent millennium fever led to prolonged life elsewhere
could not be immediately determined. Jeffrey Lancashire, a
spokesman for the National Center for Health Statistics, said the
federal government had yet to receive such data from the states,
and officials in Albany said they had yet to receive any
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the paucity of statistics, the experts agreed that New
York City's experience was not a fluke, and that many people who
would not have otherwise survived carried themselves into the new
year through sheer resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty well established that people who are seriously ill
will hang on to reach significant events, whether they be
birthdays, anniversaries or religious holidays,'' said Richard M.
Suzman, an associate director at the National Institute on Aging in
Bethesda, Md. ``In this case, making it into the next century or
millennium certainly counts as that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The mechanisms are something of a mystery,'' Suzman said,
adding that the reasons for the jump in post-millennial deaths were
still being explored. ``But the phenomenon is very real.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, observed Butler, there were a handful of the very
elderly who had a particularly strong motivation to survive: a rare
chance to live in three centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Butler also said that doctors and others in medical fields had
undoubtedly cooperated in prolonging the lives of some terminally
ill patients, citing what he called an increasing ``ability to
manipulate the end of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Potash, medical director of the Hospice of Central New York
in Syracuse, confirmed this, citing recent experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one person who was on intravenous fluids and said `I
want to make it to the new millennium, and then you can stop the
IV,''' Potash said. He said he did not know the outcome.

IN THE KREMLIN'S EYES, THE WEST IS NOW A RIVAL ONCE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Underscoring its darkening view of the West, the
Kremlin issued a national security strategy Friday that inveighs
against an expansionist Europe and United States and contemplates
the use of nuclear weapons in war ``if all other means of resolving
the crisis have been exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   The revised language governing nuclear weapons is a subtle but
unmistakable easing of the previous strategy, issued in 1997, which
allowed the use of nuclear arms only ``in case of a threat to the
existence of the Russian Federation.''
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy was signed by acting President Vladimir Putin
on Monday and published Friday. It reviews not just foreign threats
but a sweeping array of internal dangers, from organized crime to
terrorism, to separatist movements like that of the militants in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, the document simply incorporates changes in
military and political doctrine approved over the last year as
Russia's domestic situation deteriorated and its judgment of
Western intentions changed.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, however, those changes comprise a new view of
the world by the nation's leaders _ one in which the West is no
longer benign but a competitor that benefits from and even schemes
to ensure Russian weakness.
</P>
<P>
   In the opinion of the document's drafters, Russia is weak in
almost every respect.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy calls the armed forces' readiness ``critically
low,'' and says that social stability is at risk because the
population is being stratified into ``a thin layer of
well-to-do-people and a predominant layer of citizens of scanty
means.'' It says that terrorism poses a serious internal threat,
that foreign economic influence over the economy and natural
resources might be more tightly controlled by the state, and that
national security is endangered by a brain-drain of technologists
and the leakage of intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy chief of the Russian defense ministry's general
staff, Col. Valery Manilov, said Friday that the strategy's
apparent suspicion of Western intentions should not be blown out of
proportion.
</P>
<P>
   In comments to the Russian news service Interfax, Manilov said
Moscow remains interested in ``mutually beneficial and neighborly
cooperation on an equal footing with Western countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Even that wording reflects the altered sentiment of the
strategy, which has dropped all mention of ``partnership'' with the
West in favor of the more neutral term ``cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Little of this bleak picture is new to people who have watched
Russia's elite and average citizens alike turn against the West
after the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce G. Blair, an expert on Russian and U.S. nuclear forces at
the Brookings Institution in Washington, said the change is ``a
codification of something that's really already been pretty well
cemented in the Russian psyche, at least among their security
planners.''
</P>
<P>
   And the discussion of nuclear contingencies, which attracted by
far the most attention, may not prove to be of much practical
significance.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who spent a decade or more watching the West as a KGB
agent in East Germany, is said by friends to be well aware that any
threat Europe and the United States pose to Russia is not military
but economic and cultural.
</P>
<P>
   And the United States _ which also periodically redraws its
security landscape, in an exercise not dissimilar from that of the
Kremlin _ has traditionally been more hawkish about the first use
of nuclear weapons than has Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department and Pentagon declined comment Friday on the
announcement from Russia, its longtime rival in the Cold War arms
race. Both sides now cooperate militarily in some spheres.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   America's Cold War policy was never to renounce the first use of
nuclear arms but to counter a Russian invasion of Europe with
nuclear force, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, on the other hand, renounced the first use of nuclear
missiles for some years but abandoned the pledge in 1993, and by
then it viewed itself as a Western ally and no longer a rival.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, the Kremlin and White House nuclear policies are
now not that far apart.
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of security, the Russian and U.S. nuclear forces
are now far apart, Blair said, with U.S. forces remaining under
tight control while control of Russian nuclear missiles is more
problematic.
</P>
<P>
   In Blair's view, the new security policy may increase the
chances of potentially catastrophic lapses within a Russian
military hobbled by financial problems and lapsed military
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is forced to rely more and more on its nuclear force to
deter threats, experts warn, because its conventional military
forces are no longer able to repel outsiders. That requires keeping
nuclear arms on high alert, which invites mistakes in a system
where missing radars and balky satellites already provide only
spotty warning of incoming missiles. The situation may also
increase the chance of false alarms.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has increasingly shown its nuclear card in recent years,
more as a reminder of its potential to wreak havoc _ and to command
respect _ than as any threat. President Boris Yeltsin startled U.S.
leaders only last month when, in response to a mild criticism of
Russia's policy on Chechnya, he tartly reminded President Clinton
that the Kremlin controls an arsenal of nuclear missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Russian military unveiled its response to the
West's bombing of Yugoslavia by staging the largest military
exercise since the collapse of the Soviet Union. It carried out
mock nuclear strikes on an unspecified - but inarguably Western
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for the exercise envisioned a Kremlin that was unable
to repel Western forces with its cash-starved army and was thus
forced to resort to nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Then the defense minister, Igor Sergeyev, all but parroted the
text of the document released Friday. ``The exercise tested one of
the provisions of Russia's military doctrine concerning a possible
use of nuclear weapons when all other measures are exhausted,'' he
said then.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did pursue such an option. All measures were exhausted. Our
defenses proved to be ineffective. An enemy continued to push into
Russia. And that's when the decision to use nuclear weapons was
made.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy formalized Friday is hardly so apocalyptic. It
stresses that Russia can regain superpower status _ its clear aim _
only if it pursues capitalism and integrates itself further into
the global economy and political system.
</P>
<P>
   On a list of threats to Russia's national security,
``complication of international relations'' came only at the end of
a parade of domestic dangers, including economic chaos, social
decay, crime and terrorism, political polarization and ethnic
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the document is laced with Soviet-style references to
``some countries,'' generally unnamed but clearly the United States
and Europe, said to be bent on global hegemony and thwarting
Russia's ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of ``some nations'' to bypass the United Nations'
global security mechanisms is a threat to Russian security, the
document states. So are efforts ``by other states'' to oppose
Russia's role as a locus in a multi-polar world and to weaken its
influence along its western and southern borders. The document also
warns that ``some countries`` are trying to dominate the flow of
information worldwide and to force Russia out of the information
market, even to the point of plotting ``information wars.''
</P>
<P>
   And the text states that NATO's decision to use force outside
its borders, as it did in Yugoslavia, ``is a threat of
destabilization of the whole strategic situation in the world.''

<P>
   DETROIT _ In a simpler time, carmakers came to auto shows simply
to dazzle the public with their latest, sleekest designs. But the
car business is hardly so easy now; at this year's North American
International Auto Show here, the companies seem to be trying to
figure out whether to go online, off road, onto the racetrack or
simply out of the box.
</P>
<P>
   At press previews for the show, which opened this weekend at
Cobo Center, the automakers seemed to be rushing headlong in all
directions, and their collective efforts sometimes looked like
chaos theory embodied in sheet metal.
</P>
<P>
   This smokestack industry is clearly trying to find its place in
a digital universe, to relate to the inscrutable ``echo boom''
generation that will soon be buying vehicles in large numbers, and
to keep pace with rapid advancements in pollution controls, safety
devices and alternative-fuel technology.
</P>
<P>
   But most obviously, manufacturers tried to show that they can
meet consumers' contradictory demand for brutish trucks that handle
and ride like plush sedans but have the cubbyholes, miniclosets and
power outlets of a house trailer. And still, of course, the
industry must offer something for the romantics who thrill to
sleek, fast automobiles and the gearheads who keep tabs on who's
who in motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   Gearheads are not the core demographic group likely to be
impressed by the 24.7, Ford's vision of the car as a sort of
computing platform that could deliver information anywhere _ 24
hours a day, 7 days a week. Three variations on this theme _ a
wagon, pickup and coupe _ share squared-off, simplistic styling and
advanced voice-activated technologies that would let drivers
personalize the controls, make phone calls and manage e-mail on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford, like its competitors, seems to think that while some
young people want to be connected all the time, others are itching
to get away from it all, or at least to leave that outdoorsy
impression as they sit in rush-hour jams.
</P>
<P>
   As if in anticipation of the smaller, gentler Hummer that
General Motors displayed, based on a pickup truck chassis, and the
equally macho Dodge MaxxCab pickup, Ford served up a design study
called the Equator, a brutal four-door utility vehicle with a
pickup box. And it rolled out its sixth production SUV, the compact
Escape, which will challenge the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 in the
$20,000 range when it goes on sale this summer.
</P>
<P>
   A sibling, the Mazda Tribute, shares the Escape's mechanical
components and carlike unit body, but has distinct styling. Ford
expects to sell 100,000 Escapes a year to newlyweds and the ``young
at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   GM is covering some of the same ground at its auto-show display,
a sprawling two-level edifice that pulled all of the company's
brands together for the first time. With a mosh pit of hired
teen-agers shouting approval, Pontiac presented the Aztek, the
company's first attempt to bridge the gap between car, van and SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the front-drive Montana minivan, the Aztek will have
optional all-wheel drive. It also has a cabin filled with storage
trays and compartments, along with a lift-out cooler in the center
console.
</P>
<P>
   The product planners, trying to erase the lines that once
separated cars, trucks and vans, were also busy melding the pickup
and sport utility vehicle. GM's first attempt, and its answer to
new ``crossover'' trucks from Ford, is the Chevrolet Avalanche, an
aggressively styled four-door with a short cargo bed. The cargo
capacity of the Avalanche can be expanded by flipping down the back
seats, removing the rear window and dropping the ``midgate'' that
separates the cabin from the pickup bed. Subaru and Nissan, among
others, have shown similar designs.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler's crossover design, the Jeep Varsity, ``blurs
the line between boulevard and boulder,'' said Tom Gale, executive
vice president of product development and design. Although styled
like a Jeep, the Varsity is shorter than the existing grand
cherokee and more carlike than any Jeep yet.
</P>
<P>
   Even Volkswagen showed an interest in jumping into the game,
introducing a design study called the Advanced Activity Concept.
This stylish extended-cab pickup has a plush interior with a
distinct SUV flavor; indeed, it is based on the platform of a
utility vehicle that VW hasn't yet brought to market.
</P>
<P>
   Other SUV design studies at the show included the Acura MD-X,
destined to replace the SLX built by Isuzu; the Suzuki XL6, the
largest and fanciest vehicle yet from that company, and three
sharp-edged Isuzus. One of these, the Kai, a combination of rounded
shapes, sharp edges and origami-like highlights, ``is a return to
traditional Japanese architecture,'' said Scott Hyde, Isuzu's
director of product planning. Mechanical components, including
parts of the suspension, are left visible.
</P>
<P>
   Ford made a safety announcement with implications for other SUV
makers, promising to offer rollover-protection air bags in its 2001
utilities. These high, side-mounted bags would be tripped by
sensors that detect an imminent rollover and they would stay
inflated for up to six seconds _ far longer than conventional bags
_ in case a vehicle rolled several times.
</P>
<P>
   Among the show's concept cars _ design studies aimed at gauging
public opinion, many of them obviously future models wearing thin
veils _ one standout was the Jaguar F-Type. A sensuous roadster
based on sketches made by Geoff Lawson, the highly regarded head of
Jaguar design until his death last year, the F-Type is destined to
become a smaller alternative to the company's XJR sports car,
priced against the Porsche Boxster in the $40,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz showed two roadsters, one large and one small, and
Chrysler, its sibling brand, rolled out the 300 Hemi C, which seeks
to recapture the excitement created by Chrysler's luxurious
high-performance 300-Series cars of the 1950s and 1960s. Unlike any
current Chrysler, this imposing convertible has rear-wheel drive
along with a 353-horsepower V8 engine. It could become the flagship
that Chrysler brand executives have long been seeking.
</P>
<P>
   After years in which budget constraints at GM resulted in crops
of concept cars that rarely won critical acclaim, the company took
back at least part of the spotlight. One of the show's unqualified
hits was the Chevrolet SSR, a sporty, low-slung pickup that evoked
both Chevy trucks of the early 1950s and the later El Camino _
itself a car-truck combination that presaged the crossovers so
popular this year. GM executives enthusiastically confirmed that
the SSR, although ostensibly only a design study, was on a ``fast
track'' for production.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another distinctive GM show car, the Buick LaCrosse, offered a
fresh, flowing interpretation of Buick's distinctly American
styling heritage, complete with ``porthole'' trim along the sides
of the hood and ``suicide doors'' that open from the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda's RX-Evolv, a stylish four-door sports car with a
rejuvenated rotary engine, made its North American debut. Infiniti
took the wraps off its first-ever concept car, the XVL, which is
likely to be produced as a rear-drive competitor to the BMW
3-Series and the new Lexus IS 300.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies made technology announcements. Ford said that
it would sell a family of electric vehicles under the Think brand
name and that it would offer by 2003 a family-sized hybrid car with
both an internal-combustion engine and electric drive. GM showed
the Precept, a diesel-electric hybrid said to be capable of fuel
economy in the 80 mpg range.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a breakfast speech, the president of Toyota, Fujio Cho,
called on automakers to work together on environmental issues. ``To
reach our goals as an industry, we must continue to cooperate in
the laboratory and compete in the showroom,'' said Cho, the first
top Toyota executive to attend the Detroit auto show.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the Detroit show is also the delivery room for
the newborn vehicles that will crawl to market in coming months,
and plenty of 2001 models made their debuts. Of particular note
were the fourth-generation minivans from DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   While breaking no ground in styling, the vans will have added
safety features and conveniences like a power rear liftgate and a
removable center console with power accessories. Another family
hauler, the next Volvo V70 wagon, was also introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota fired a shot at Detroit in the sport-utility wars,
unveiling a big SUV based on its full-size Tundra pickup. Called
the Sequoia, it is close in size to the popular Ford Expedition,
and, with an expected starting price in the mid-$30,000 range, will
be priced well below the existing Toyota Land Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Executives and engineers from GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler
repeatedly dropped by the Toyota display to try out the Sequoia's
ingenious second-row seat that can be released with one hand to
fold neatly for access to the third seating row. Those seats also
slide, fold and come out in a variety of ways.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota's Lexus division also showed its next flagship sedan, the
LS 430, with a bigger V8 engine and an array of sybaritic luxury
features, including seats with built-in massagers and a
chilled-beverage compartment. More sophisticated even than its
famously quiet-riding predecessor, the new LS will more directly
challenge the big Mercedes S-Class sedans.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These were among other categories of vehicles making news at the
show:
</P>
<P>
   _ Convertibles. New models included the BMW 3-Series, Mitsubishi
Eclipse and Audi TT Roadster. Rolls-Royce reintroduced its Corniche
convertible (base price: $359,990) and VW confirmed that it would
build a New Beetle convertible in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   _ Luxury cars. Acura showed its CL coupe, redesigned for 2001 at
prices starting at $28,000. Audi added a version of its A8 luxury
sedan with a wheelbase five inches longer, giving more room to rear
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Small cars. Nissan showed an all-new Sentra, with a clean,
simple appearance. Kia introduced a four-door hatchback, the
Spectra, that will start around $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sport utilities. New production vehicles making their debuts
included the compact Hyundai Santa Fe, a redesigned Mitsubishi
Montero and a new, small two-door, the Daewoo Korando, that will be
among the least-expensive sport utility vehicles in America.
</P>
<P>
   Several manufacturers announced initiatives in auto racing.
Dodge displayed the Intrepid R/T that will race in the Nascar
Winston Cup series in 2001. Audi said it would compete in the
American Le Mans racing series this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even Daewoo was eager to note its sporting connections, having
entered its small Nubira car in the Sports Car Club of America's
Pro Rally Series last year.

 By EMILY EAKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1851, Dr. Samuel A. Cartwright, a Louisiana surgeon and
psychologist, filed a report in the New Orleans Medical and
Surgical Journal on diseases prevalent among the South's black
population. Among the various maladies Cartwright described was
``drapetomania'' or ``the disease causing slaves to run away.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a serious mental illness, drapetomania, wrote Cartwright,
was happily quite treatable: ``The cause, in the most of cases,
that induces the negro to run away from service, is as much a
disease of the mind as any other species of mental alienation, and
much more curable. With the advantages of proper medical advice,
strictly followed, this troublesome practice that many negroes have
of running away can be almost entirely prevented.''
</P>
<P>
   A particularly absurd chapter in the annals of racist
19th-century science?
</P>
<P>
   Without question, but for Alvin Poussaint, a clinical professor
of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, Cartwright's hopelessly
unscientific diagnosis is of more than just historical interest. It
is a vivid illustration of how definitions of normal and abnormal
behavior are shaped by the values of the society that makes them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture influences what you consider pathology,'' says
Poussaint. ``Cartwright saw slavery as normative. So when slaves
deviated from the norm, he called them mentally ill. The business
of deciding what's normal and what's psychopathology gets
influenced by culture and politics. It's not hard science.''
</P>
<P>
   Poussaint says that when it comes to understanding racism,
contemporary psychiatry is as in the dark about its own biases as
the benighted Cartwright. Poussaint's argument is not with racist
psychiatrists but with the psychiatry of racism. Is racism a mental
disorder?
</P>
<P>
   The debate is decades old, but was recently reignited when John
Rocker, a pitcher for the Atlanta Braves, made bigoted statements
about blacks, homosexuals and foreigners last month in the pages of
Sports Illustrated. Last week Rocker was ordered by the
commissioner of major league baseball to undergo a psychological
evaluation. Since then, fans, therapists, pundits, sports figures,
talk show hosts and columnists have all weighed in on the degree to
which his comments and the league's decision were based on science,
stupidity, financial concerns and spin control.
</P>
<P>
   For most psychiatrists, the answer is clear: racism is
unacceptable social behavior, but not evidence of a mental
disorder. There is no entry for racism in the latest edition of the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, a compendium of mental illnesses
known as DSM-IV.
</P>
<P>
   ``If psychiatry were to define racism as a mental disorder,
you'd have to include the Nazis, and the Serbs who hate Muslims _
there would be no end,'' says Dr. Robert Spitzer, a psychiatrist at
the New York State Psychiatric Institute and a consultant on the
DSM-IV. ``Almost everyone would be ill.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Spitzer concedes that prevalence alone does not
negate a need for diagnosis. To meet the American Psychiatric
Association's criteria for a distinct mental disorder, he says,
psychiatrists would have to show that a racist's mental processes
interfered with normal functioning.
</P>
<P>
   Poussaint says he can do that. Arguing that racism can sometimes
_ though not all the time _ be a mental disorder, he says that
racists frequently exhibit symptoms associated with major
psychopathology, including paranoia (feeling threatened
unrealistically by a particular group), projection (imbuing this
group with traits that have negative associations) and fixed
beliefs (categorical opinions like ``all foreigners are dumb'').
</P>
<P>
   The real reason the psychiatric association hasn't made racism a
mental health issue, he argues, is because ``it hasn't been a
mental health issue for them.'' To pathologize racism, he said,
would require its members ``to look at their friends, their
relatives, and themselves'' in an uncomfortable light.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the APA is predominantly white and male. Of its
current 38,200 members, only 865, or 2.3 percent, are
African-American and 1,720, or 4.5 percent, are Hispanic. Some
12,000, or 31 percent, are women. There is no doubt that psychiatry
has been susceptible to some of the same biases harbored by the
society at large, most notably toward women and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Until well after World War II, instruction in now-discredited
Freudian concepts like ``penis envy'' and ``castrating female'' was
a routine part of psychiatric training. More egregious was the
theory of the schizophrenic mother, whose bad parenting was
supposedly to blame for her child's schizophrenia. Widely accepted
well into the 1970s, the theory has been supplanted by explanations
focusing on brain chemistry and biology.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexuals fared little better. Until the early 1970s, the APA
regarded homosexuality as a pathology. After heavy lobbying from
gay rights activists, including a psychiatrist who was a member of
the APA and who spoke at the 1972 annual meeting, his face
concealed by a mask to preserve his anonymity, the board of
trustees voted to remove homosexuality from the DSM-IV. The
membership followed suit in 1974. (One bemused observer labeled it
``the single greatest cure in the history of psychiatry.'')
</P>
<P>
   Poussaint credits politics _ the women's movement and gay rights
activists _ not better science, for overturning faulty psychiatric
doctrine. His own politicking to change the association's opinion
on racism has so far been less successful. In the mid-1960s,
Poussaint joined other civil rights workers in Mississippi, where
he helped desegregate the hospitals. The bigotry he witnessed among
the region's white psychiatrists as well as a spate of racist
killings convinced him to act.
</P>
<P>
   Along with seven other black psychiatrists, Poussaint appealed
to the organization to add racism to the DSM-IV. Their request was
turned down. ``Let's say that group of black psychiatrists had been
in control of establishing what the diagnoses should be in the
DSM,'' Poussaint says now. ``In some way, racism would be in that
book.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Today, many of Poussaint's black colleagues say a DSM
label would actually be counterproductive. ``Racism is so deeply
ingrained in our culture that to try to identify individuals who
are racist is in some ways to trivialize the depth and breadth of
the problem,'' says James Jones, a professor of social psychology
at the University of Delaware and the director of the minority
fellowships program at the American Psychological Association.
Others believe that pathologizing racism would inadvertently give
racists a legal defense for hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, psychiatrists were probably more disposed to treat
racism as a mental illness 50 years ago than today. In the 1950s,
the profession even flirted with a quasi-medical definition of
racism, although at the behest of the American Jewish Committee,
not American blacks. In 1950, four scholars published an
influential study titled ``The Authoritarian Personality.'' Three
of the authors were Jewish. Two of them, including the philosopher
Theodor Adorno, were refugees from Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal was to explain Hitler's genocidal anti-Semitism.
Based on their evaluations of more than 2,000 American adults, the
authors concluded that extreme racist tendencies were associated
with an abnormal ``personality syndrome'' that they labeled
authoritarian. Not a DSM-IV diagnosis exactly, but almost.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the decade, however, the theory underlying ``The
Authoritarian Personality'' had been substantially revised. The
book was found to have serious methodological problems, and efforts
to test the hypothesis yielded mixed results. The Harvard
psychologist Thomas Pettigrew struck a decisive blow. Pettigrew
examined racist attitudes in eight American towns, four in the
North, four in the South. In the Northern towns, he found some
correlation of racist attitudes with the syndrome described in
``The Authoritarian Personality.''
</P>
<P>
   In the South, however, he found that racism was so common it was
merely a social norm. ``You almost had to be mentally ill to be
tolerant in the South,'' says Pettigrew, now a retired professor at
the University of California at Santa Cruz. ``The authoritarian
personality was a good explanation at the individual level but not
at the societal level.''
</P>
<P>
   By the dawn of the civil rights era, the psychiatric profession
had largely abandoned racism to social psychologists like Pettigrew
who helped formulate the model in currency today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racism has very much been depathologized,'' says Janet
Schofield, a social psychologist at the University of Pittsburgh
who studies racial attitudes among children. ``There's been a major
shift from being influenced by things like the authoritarian
personality to thinking of stereotyping and prejudice as a
consequence of normal psychological processes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bombarded with more information than the brain can handle, she
explains, people are apt to rely on general concepts. Just the way
Americans divide daybeds, settees and chaise longues into the
general categories ``chairs'' and ``sofas,'' they divide groups of
people into categories based to some degree on stereotypes.
``Racism,'' says Ms. Schofield, ``may be the result of inevitable
processes.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an explanation for racism, not an excuse. But for
Poussaint, at least, it is not likely to be the last word. His
final appeal is to common sense: ``If you have a mental process
that leads some people to commit genocide, how can you not think
that's a mental disorder?''

U.N. DIVIDED ON SELECTION OF NEW ARMS INSPECTOR FOR IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ With a Sunday deadline looming, Security
Council differences hardened Friday over whom to appoint as the new
chief arms inspector for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a bit more complicated than one would have
expected,'' said Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Under a resolution in December creating a new disarmament
commission to finish the job of ridding Iraq of prohibited weapons,
Annan's deadline for naming an executive chairman is midnight
Sunday, and he had hoped to name a consensus candidate by now. But
Friday night, the Security Council was so deadlocked that some
officials said that a new list of nominees might have to be
solicited from members, which could stall the process indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary-general hasn't given up,'' said his spokesman,
Fred Eckhard. But several Security Council members were concerned
that extending the deadline could hurt the commission's
credibility, and Iraq would get a clear message that it had little
to fear in inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has already played an indirect role in stymieing the
council, as countries acting on its behalf have vetoed strong
candidates. Four countries _ China, France, Malaysia and Russia _
abstained in the vote that established the new inspection
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. representative and this month's
council president, told members Friday that he opposed further
delays and asked them to be on call over the weekend. Holbrooke,
who had not taken an active part in Iraq discussions since his
arrival in August, has been drawn into the issue as council
president. Several other members said they welcomed this, adding
that often only the United States has the power to force a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's short list of candidates has continued to fluctuate, but
at least two names have been steady contenders, a Western diplomat
said. They are Pasi Patokallio, a Finnish disarmament expert who is
now ambassador to Israel, and Rolf Ekeus, the Swedish diplomat who
helped create the first arms inspection commission, Unscom, and led
it until 1997. He is now Sweden's ambassador to the United States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some diplomats say that Chinese and possibly Russian insistence
that Ekeus would not be welcomed back in Iraq may have eliminated
him. At the United Nations, however, situations are often fluid
until the last minute, as envoys work the phones to their capitals
and governments confer over their diplomats' heads. U.S. diplomats
have not yet ruled out Ekeus or Patokallio, who also has his
detractors.
</P>
<P>
   Other names have been floated in the last two days _ among them
Celso Amorim of Brazil, a former diplomat who works for the United
Nations in Geneva; Abdul Minty, a South African nuclear expert;
and, most recently, Ali Alatas, a former Indonesian foreign
minister, and his compatriot Nugroho Wisnamurti, who was
Indonesia's United Nations ambassador and later foreign secretary.
Those last two names, proposed by Malaysia, are seen by other
diplomats as more of a long-shot bid to get an Asian candidate into
the mix, although Wisnamurti seems to have some support.
</P>
<P>
   All week, the process of winnowing down a large field of
candidates and focusing on those most acceptable to the permanent
five Security Council members _ Britain, China, France, Russia and
the United States _ has taken place in secret between the five and
Annan. The remaining 10 council members have been kept almost
entirely in the dark, several diplomats said. This has revived the
resentment felt when the new inspection panel, the U.N. Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission, was created by the five
permanent members in months of discussions behind closed doors, and
then presented to the other council members.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, Annan met with the 10 nonpermanent members, to
brief them on his search for an executive chairman.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no arms inspections in Iraq since December 1998,
when Unscom, the U.N. Special Commission, evacuated its staff in
the face of U.S. and British bombing raids. Unscom's chairman,
Richard Butler, resigned last June at the end of a two-year
contract, but a skeleton staff has stayed on to complete an archive
of their work.
</P>
<P>
   Unscom was created in 1991 as part of the cease-fire resolution
ending the Persian Gulf war. Despite Iraqi defiance, Unscom,
working with the International Atomic Energy Agency, was able to
find and destroy far more weapons and other prohibited materials
than experts had thought Iraq possessed.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is still under a Security Council embargo imposed after the
August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Until the Iraqis are judged to have
complied fully with disarmament teams _ first Unscom and now
Unmovic _ sanctions remain in place. Although Iraq is now free to
export all the oil it can pump in order to import needed civilian
goods, its oil income is still supervised through escrow accounts
held by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis have said that they will not cooperate with a new
inspection plan, just as they had stopped cooperating with Unscom.
But many diplomats here see this as an opening ploy in a long
struggle to get inspectors back into the country, if only to find a
legal way to end sanctions.

   NEW YORK _ Investing in the stock market for the long term, the
strategy that has made the most sense and the most money for people
over the years, is all but dead.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has long been known as something of a racetrack. New
numbers show the betting has become faster and more furious there
than at any time since the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, investors held stocks for just over eight months on
average, well short of the two years that was typical a decade ago,
according to Sanford C. Bernstein, an investment research firm.
Among Nasdaq stocks, the hottest shares last year, the average
holding period was five months, down from roughly two years. The
trading frenzy has even infected the staid mutual fund world:
Investors are holding funds for less than four years on average. A
decade ago, it was 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy trading extends across the board, from big institutions
that run mutual funds to individual investors who have flocked to
online brokerage firms. Online commissions _ as low as $5 a trade _
encourage trading. So does the surge in new issues, with some new
stock always leaping to attention. But psychology plays a big role
too, with investors always looking for the next big hit.
</P>
<P>
   The figures confirm what some market analysts have suspected for
some time: The rapid-fire trading mentality of a very small group
of hyperactive investors known as day traders has altered the
behavior of large numbers of investors and is seeping into the
overall market. The consequences are large, since studies show that
investors who trade frequently get lower returns and heavy trading
contributes to wide swings in the market.
</P>
<P>
   How frequently do shareholders trade? On the New York Stock
Exchange, the equivalent of 79 percent of all the shares listed
there traded hands last year, up from 46 percent in 1990. The
supercharged Nasdaq is turning over its shares more than three
times faster than any major industrialized market in the world. The
trading in its shares amounted to more than twice its entire share
base; the turnover was 88 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   While the data do not address different industries, some of the
Nasdaq stocks most popular with online investors trade furiously.
The entire share base of Doubleclick, which specializes in Internet
advertising, turned over 21 times last year. Investors traded
shares equal to 16 times those available in CMGI, an incubator for
Internet companies, and more than 13 times the shares of Amazon,
the online retailer. In the 50 Nasdaq stocks with the heaviest
trading, investors hold their shares for just three weeks, on
average.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Galbraith, a senior research analyst at Sanford Bernstein
in New York, compiled the statistics and sees trouble in the
trading frenzy. ``It does look suspiciously like a game of musical
chairs and you do wonder when the music is going to stop,'' he
said. ``Because three-week holding periods is not investing in my
view, it is speculating.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for investors, frantic trading can lead to much
lower returns. ``It's not very tax-efficient and not very
cost-efficient,'' said Antonio E. Bernardo, assistant professor of
finance at the Anderson School at the University of California in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   According to academic studies, rapid turnover results in
significantly lower returns, though the bull market of recent years
has been so good that investors may not quite realize what they are
missing. Brad Barber and Terrance Odean, associate and assistant
professors of management at the University of California at Davis,
analyzed data from 60,000 households that traded shares through a
discount broker from 1991 through 1997. They found that the
households trading most frequently earned an annualized net return
of 11.4 percent, while those that traded infrequently earned 18.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And yet more and more investors are succumbing to the trading
rush, giving up potential profits. ``What you end up with is a few
people out there who hit the jackpot and a lot of people wondering
why they didn't,'' Odean said.

 NEW YORK: Odean said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In addition to higher transaction costs and taxes (since
relatively few stock trades occur in tax-deferred accounts),
excessive trading poses a problem because of human foibles.
Investors tend to sell their winners after a small profit and hold
onto their losers. It is much easier, psychologically, for people
to realize their gains than to take their losses in stocks they
have picked.
</P>
<P>
   And, in an April 1999 study of 10,000 stock trading accounts
belonging to individuals, Odean found that the stocks investors buy
as replacements in their portfolios lag the securities they sell by
enough to cover trading costs. On average, the replacement stocks
did not rise as much as those that were sold.
</P>
<P>
   Besides reducing investors' gains, the effects of rapid-fire
trading are widespread. The practice has enriched both the
brokerage firms that execute investors' transactions and the
federal government that collects the taxes. Ducking in and out of
stocks produces short-term capital gains, which are taxed at
ordinary income rates. Those rates are higher than those on
long-term capital gains on investments held at least a year.
Galbraith estimates that investors' short-term gains in Nasdaq
stocks alone amounted to more than $25 billion in taxes paid to
Uncle Sam last year.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive trading also contributes to wide swings in specific
shares and the overall market. According to Leuthold Group, an
investment advisory firm in Minneapolis, moves of 2 percent or more
from the previous day's close occurred in the Nasdaq market 25
percent of the time last year, or one out of every four trading
days. Since 1971, moves of that size have occurred about 3 percent
of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this trading is the result of the long and steady rise
in stock prices over the last 10 years. Attracted by increasing
share prices and heady returns in the major indexes, more investors
are trying their hand at trading for fun and profit. Indeed,
trading volume rises as stock prices do. In 1987, for example,
turnover on the New York Stock Exchange reached 73 percent; the
following year, after the crash, turnover plunged to 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy turnover rates also characterized the early part of the
20th century. In 1901, the New York Stock Exchange turned its
entire share base over more than three times. And in 1905, its
stocks changed hands more than two times on average.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this period, you had mergers, financial innovation,
increased participation of the public, and all of these led to
higher turnover in Wall Street,'' said Richard Sylla, professor of
market history at New York University's Stern School of Business.
But as Sylla pointed out, the turnover was accompanied by a great
deal of upheaval in the stock market. First was the so-called Rich
Man's Panic of 1903 when the Dow Jones industrial average dropped
24 percent. Then there was the Panic of 1907, which took the index
down 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Odean of the University of California at Davis said the volume
of trading was so high because investors have become overconfident
about their stock picks. ``A bull market leads to rising degrees of
overconfidence among investors,'' he said. ``They attribute some of
the returns to themselves, rather than to the overall rising
market. And the temptation is to get a little bit overactive on
trading.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that the sharp rise in stock trading has
been accompanied by an explosion in information devoted to
investing. Cable television, magazines, newspapers and online chat
rooms foster a transaction mentality among investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that people have more information than they had in
the past gives them more reason to say, `I'm going to make a change
now because I know what's happening,''' said Sylla of New York
University.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he points out a potential problem. ``One of the
pernicious aspects of it is when trading volume is rising, people
think they can buy and sell easily.'' But when the market turns
down and the trading cools? ``They find it a lot harder to get
out.''

THE JUSTICE DEPTARTMENT IS EXAMINING THE SOUTH CAROLINA PRIMARIES 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., S.C.)   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Alerted to the closing of polling places in black
neighborhoods during South Carolina's last Republican presidential
primary, the Justice Department has begun asking pointed questions
about both parties' coming primaries, political officials around
the state said Friday. The inquiry raises the possibility that the
primaries could be challenged by the government under the Voting
Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   If the government finds that the poll closings violate the
voting rights of blacks, the Republican Party _ whose Feb. 19
primary is critical to the presidential hopes of Gov. George W.
Bush and Sen. John McCain _ faces the possibility of having to
spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to open every polling place
in the state, which was not done in previous primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats could also then have to cancel their March 9
primary and move to a caucus system, said the party's state
chairman, Richard A. Harpootlian, because like the Republicans the
Democrats were not planning to open every polling place in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Neither party wants to spend the money to open polling places in
each of the state's 1,914 precincts, but neither party informed the
Justice Department of its plans to deviate from the procedures used
in the general election, as they are required to do under the
Voting Rights Act. While the inquiry began after a complaint to the
Justice Department last week that was instigated by Democrats, both
parties realized that the department had never been informed that
the parties picked their own polling places in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department would not comment on the issue Friday,
but several people who had been called by the department's lawyers
said they had asked about the precise mechanics of the primaries,
and whether the voting methods had ever been cleared with the
department. A. Lee Parks, an Atlanta lawyer who drafted the
original complaint, said he had been told the department was
conducting an expedited inquiry, in order to get the matter
resolved before Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Republican state chairman, Henry McMaster,
issued an appeal Friday for more volunteers to work at polling
places on Feb. 19, in order to show the Justice Department that the
primary would be conducted fairly. At the moment, the party has
enough volunteers to open more than 1,000 polling places, he said,
but not enough for each precinct. Some polling places would have to
be consolidated with others, he said, but he promised that race
would not be a factor in which ones would remain closed.
</P>
<P>
   Opening polling places in each precinct would cost the party
more than $500,000, he said, compared with the $150,000 it has
budgeted.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the Democrats of concocting the issue to embarrass
the party and reduce black turnout in the Republican primary.
Although there are few black Republicans, South Carolina has an
open system that does not require party affiliation to vote in a
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this whole thing is about is, they don't want black
people voting in our Republican primary,'' McMaster said. ``They
see us getting all the attention. They see their base getting soft.
So what they do is play the race card and falsely accuse us of
keeping black people out of the primary. They're trying to inflame
public opinion against us, and I think they should be ashamed of
this kind of race baiting.''
</P>
<P>
   McMaster, a former U.S. attorney, said he did not believe a
presidential primary was covered by the Voting Rights Act, which
was intended to prevent discrimination in voting. But either way,
he said, the party would do whatever it took to conduct a
completely open primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party has not denied, however, that many polling
places in black areas were not open in the 1992 and 1996 primaries.
Party officials said that was because they did not have enough
volunteers to open polls in heavily Democratic areas _ many of
which were mostly black _ because few Republicans tended to vote
there.
</P>
<P>
   Harpootlian was unapologetic _ and perhaps the slightest bit
gleeful _ at having helped point out this fact to the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that the Republicans will now have to live up to
their rhetoric,'' he said. ``Bush and McCain travel the country and
urge African-Americans to participate, while the state party is
bleaching the primary so African-Americans can't vote. It's time
for them to either shut up or open up all the precincts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harpootlian, who had earlier said his party's primary would
be open in all precincts, acknowledged Friday that it did not have
the resources to do so. If the Democrats need to keep all polls
open to comply with the Voting Rights Act, he said, they could
switch to a caucus system, where voters informally elect delegates
to a state convention that later picks the state nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic vote is not as important as the Republican
primary because it comes after more significant primaries. &QL;

WHAT PROVOKES A RAPIST? SCIENTISTS DEBATE IDEA OF EVOLUTIONARY
DRIVE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo., Ariz., Ill., N.M., Ga.)   By ERICA GOODE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rape is primarily a crime of violence and power, not sex. Or so
a generation of social scientists and feminist scholars have
argued.
</P>
<P>
   But in a forthcoming book, two evolutionary scientists say this
view is born of ideology, not science, and is ``based on
empirically erroneous, even mythological, ideas about human
development, behavior and psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   They assert in ``A Natural History of Rape: Biological Bases of
Sexual Coercion,'' that rape ``is in its very essence a sexual
act'' and that the practice may have evolved because it confers an
evolutionary advantage.
</P>
<P>
   All of which, given the current passion for pulling Darwin into
the domain of human sexual affairs, is not particularly new. But
the scientists go further: If rape prevention programs are to be
successful, they contend, evolution must be taken into account.
They recommend, among other things, advising women that ``the way
they dress can put them at risk.'' They also recommend instructing
young men, before they are granted drivers' licenses, that
``Darwinian selection'' is the reason a man ``may be tempted to
demand sex even if he knows that his date truly doesn't want it''
or ``may mistake a woman's friendly comment or tight blouse as an
invitation to sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the book is not scheduled for publication by the MIT
Press until April, manuscript galleys are circulating. An excerpt
by the authors, Dr. Randy Thornhill, Regent's professor at the
University of New Mexico, and Dr. Craig T. Palmer, an anthropology
instructor at the University of Colorado, appears in the current
issue of The Sciences. As a result, the book's thesis is already
provoking discussion _ and anger.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerry Coyne, an evolutionary biologist at the University of
Chicago who has read the excerpt in the journal The Sciences,
called it ``the worst efflorescence of evolutionary psychology that
I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's irresponsible, it's tendentious, it's an advocacy article
and the science is sloppy,'' he said. ``There are some aspects of
human behavior that are fairly clearly evolutionary. But that's a
long way from saying that rape is adaptive in males.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mary P. Koss, an authority on rape and a professor of public
health at the University of Arizona, says that evolution is a
factor in rape.
</P>
<P>
   She cautioned, however, that ``it is not proper to set up
evolutionary and social causation as opposites,'' adding, ``You
have to think about how they work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Koss dismissed the notion that young men should be educated
about the evolutionary origins of rape. Thornhill and Palmer, she
said, ``have obviously never stood up before a group and given a
rape prevention talk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you even imply to a male audience that all men are
potential rapists, they go berserk,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She called the recommendation that women consider the risks of
dressing attractively ``absolutely, perfectly unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Dr. Donald Symons, a professor of
anthropology at the University of California at Santa Barbara who
studies human sexuality from an evolutionary perspective, said it
was important for researchers to challenge the view that rape had
little to do with sexuality. Though he quibbled with some points in
the book, he said, ``This is an argument for a particular view of
male sexuality and it's a view that I think is correct.''
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of the debate may have been inevitable, given that
rape is a volatile political issue. But evolutionary psychology,
once called ``sociobiology,'' is itself a field that as a whole has
been subject to criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Darwinian theory is based on the observation that evolution
selects for success: animals with traits that promote survival or
reproduction pass on their genes; others die out. Scientists have
found an evolutionary view of animal behavior to be a powerful
tool. But evolutionary psychologists are now seeking to apply
similar principles to all aspects of human behavior. In some cases,
scientists say, these efforts have proven fruitful.
</P>
<P>
   But critics have argued that in wading into the complexities of
modern human sexual relationships, scientists are on much shakier
ground, often ignoring the powerful influences of culture. Some
critics assert that the work of some evolutionary psychologists is
tinged with a misogynistic bias.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Brownmiller, whose influential 1975 treatise, ``Against
Our Will: Men, Women and Rape,'' set the tone of the feminist
argument and serves as a frequent punching bag for Dr. Thornhill
and Dr. Palmer, said that the new book ``gives sociobiology a bad
name.``
</P>
<P>
   ``Feminists never said that rape had nothing to do with sex,''
Ms. Brownmiller said. ``Obviously rape involves the sex organs, and
I'm sure many men who do it think it's a supreme macho act of sex.
But they're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Thornhill, an eminent evolutionary biologist
who moved from work on insects to studies of human sexual behavior,
said he and his co-author expected that their book would provoke
debate. ``The problem is basically a very limited understanding of
how evolutionary biology applies to people,'' he said. ``It takes
people a long time to pull back from what is politically correct
and do an analysis on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject of rape and evolution has been so touchy, Thornhill
and Palmer write in ``A Natural History of Rape,'' that lectures on
the topic have been picketed, scientific articles have been
rejected by scholarly journals, and researchers who view rape
through an evolutionary lens have been denied jobs at universities.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the debate are assertions that are touchstones
for evolutionary psychologists: that evolution favored promiscuity
in men but choosiness in women and that the male of the species
evolved to prefer young women because they are more likely to bear
children.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual coercion, Thornhill and Palmer argue, may have evolved as
an alternative reproductive strategy for males who, for whatever
reason, were not lucky enough to persuade a female to copulate
voluntarily. Or it may have developed as simply a byproduct of
other adaptive traits, for example, a greater desire to engage
multiple sex partners.
</P>
<P>
   Rape is inexcusable, they argue, but it must be viewed as a
``natural biological phenomenon,'' as much a part of nature as
other undesirable happenings like thunderstorms, epidemics and
tornadoes. Thornhill and Palmer marshall an assortment of evidence.
They note that young women at the peak of their childbearing years
are greatly overrepresented among rape victims and that rape leads
to murder in only one-hundredth of 1 percent of the cases, a figure
confirmed by other rape researchers.
</P>
<P>
   They also note that sexual coercion of females by males occurs
in many other animals, including the scorpion fly, an insect
Thornhill has studied extensively. It is equipped with an appendage
called a notal organ that appears specifically intended for rape.
Sexual coercion has also been observed among fish, birds and
nonhuman primates, notably the orangutan.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, some of whom have followed the researchers'
writings on rape over the years and others who read the excerpt in
The Sciences, said they do not find these arguments convincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibilities of bias in such work is enormous,'' said Dr.
Patricia Adair Gowaty, an evolutionary biologist at the University
of Georgia. ``And as sociobiologists we have become enamored of
some ideas in the absence of credible and critical data.''

UNDATED: critical data.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``These theories are intuitively attractive, and they fit many
of the experiences we have,'' she said. ``But it is when something
is intuitive that you need to be most careful to have adequate
scientific controls.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Koss pointed out that although it is true that most rape
victims are young women, most rapists are 18 to 25, and it is more
than likely that they will find victims in their own age group. She
and other experts noted that a surprisingly large number of rape
victims are young children.
</P>
<P>
   She said that other work by evolutionary scientists supported
the notion that male violence toward women may have evolved partly
as a strategy for controlling access to reproductive partners, an
interpretation consistent with Ms. Brownmiller's observations.
``But there are also roles for many other influences at the
societal level, the institutional level, the family level, the peer
level and within the two individual people,'' Dr. Koss said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics objected to the authors' use of nonhuman examples
to buttress their case. ``We can't ask a female fish whether she
appears to resist because she doesn't want to copulate or because
she is testing males for their fitness,'' Coyne said. ``But we can
ask a human female who has been raped if she participated
willingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally contentious are the authors' ideas about how women react
to rape. On the basis of a study in the 1970s by Thornhill and his
wife, Dr. Nancy W. Thornhill, they contend that young women suffer
more distress after being raped than do children or older women
past their reproductive years. This ``makes evolutionary sense,''
they say, because it is young women who risk being impregnated by
an undesirable mate.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Koss said that other studies indicated that the impact
of rape was far worse for elderly women than for younger women.
``They develop a much more pervasive fear of going out of their
home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some scientists applaud the efforts of Thornhill and
Palmer to refocus attention on rape as a sexual crime and to link
it to other evolutionary work on male and female sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Understood within the context of evolutionary theory, said Dr.
Neil Malamuth, professor of psychology at the University of
California at Los Angeles, the scientists' thesis ``is not as
preposterous as it might seem.'' While feminists like Ms.
Brownmiller perform an important service by focusing on the
violence and power components of rape, he said, ``there are aspects
of rape that really do have to do with sex.''

REPUBLICANS ARE WOOING HISPANIC VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>

 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ After the lights had dimmed in a hotel
meeting room here, Republican officials introduced a 60-second
television commercial that they say will help court Hispanic
voters, whose rapidly growing population makes them a political
force that could swing the largest states in the presidential
election this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement features a patriotic narrative delivered by an
elderly Hispanic man at a Fourth of July celebration while four
generations of his family wave American flags, recite the Pledge of
Allegiance and take several whacks at a red-white-and-blue pinata.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' says the man, who gives his name as Joe Guerra in
spots produced both in English and in Spanish, ``even my
95-year-old father is today a Republican. He passed his values
along to me, and I passed them along to my children and my
grandchildren. When people ask me why I am a Republican, I tell
them it is because my family's values are the values of the
Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   When the lights went up, many officials attending this winter
meeting of the Republican National Committee expressed enthusiasm
for the commercial, the first of several that the party will run
this year in an aggressive $10-million advertising campaign aimed
at Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising campaign in turn is part of a larger Republican
drive to woo Hispanics, who have voted overwhelmingly for Democrats
in recent national elections. The push, which Republican officials
call ``unprecedented,'' is crucial to the party's future, said Jim
Nicholson, chairman of the national committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Latino community is in play in this election like never
before,'' Nicholson said at a news conference here. ``And they're
sending this message: `We're open to change. Persuade us. Make your
best case.' I'm here to promise you that we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Nicholson said the attention bestowed on Hispanic voters
this year would equal that lavished on ``soccer moms'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In public forums and closed-door sessions at their meeting here
in the heart of Silicon Valley, party leaders are formulating
strategy. While there has been little public talk of fund-raising
plans, the officials have discussed any number of other topics,
including the uses of new technology, the 2004 primary schedule and
efforts to reach out to women and African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But most Republican leaders said their most important challenge
was to attract more Hispanic voters, in a manner that one
Republican consultant, Frank Guerra, described as ``sustained and
sincere.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of Hispanics in the United States has grown so
rapidly that they are expected to overtake African-Americans as the
nation's largest minority group by 2005 and to account for 25
percent of the population by 2050. The states with the largest
Hispanic populations _ California, Texas, New York and Florida _
currently account for 144 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dealing now with numbers that no one can ignore,'' said
Lionel Sosa, chief executive of Garcia LKS, a San Antonio
advertising firm that specializes in marketing to Hispanics. ``The
party that wins the Hispanic vote and keeps the Hispanic vote will
be the majority party over the next 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican officials acknowledged that they would need
more than a well-produced advertisement to attract larger numbers
of Hispanics. Garabed Haytaian, the Republican state chairman in
New Jersey, said, ``It's going to take a large commitment of
resources _ money from the party to help Hispanic candidates win.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Backus, press secretary of the Democratic National
Committee, criticized the new commercial as ``a simplistic,
somewhat patronizing message'' to Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Republicans have not learned the lesson of New
Coke,'' Ms. Backus said. ``They are trying to sell their product,
their issues agenda, to people who don't like the taste. People
have long memories, and this approach won't erase the divisive
rhetoric on immigration that the Republican Party has used in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While Hispanics are far from a monolithic group _ polls show
that they often most closely identify with their particular country
of origin or ancestry _ Republican leaders said this week that the
party shared with them ``the values that matter: a commitment to
family, a strong work ethic, a love of country and of freedom, a
belief in opportunity and a willingness to accept personal
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   If recent election results are any guide, though, Hispanics as a
whole feel they share far more with the Democrats. Hispanics went
in large numbers for Bill Clinton: 72 percent of their vote in
1996, to 21 percent for Bob Dole, and 61 percent in 1992, to 25
percent for George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those results, and despite polls that showed the
Democrats' hold on Hispanics growing stronger in the 1990s
Republican officials said they were encouraged by a survey
conducted by a Republican pollster, Lance Tarrance. That survey, of
1,000 Hispanics interviewed last month in Houston, identified 45
percent as ``hard-core Democrats'' and 30 percent as ``hard-core
Republicans.'' There was a 25 percent ``target group'' of undecided
Hispanic voters that Republicans say they will try to attract.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get 40 percent of the Hispanic vote over the next
generation, we probably won't be having a meeting of this size,''
Tarrance said at a panel discussion here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bid for Hispanics will be difficult in
California, where exit polls in 1998 showed that 78 percent had
voted for Democrats, and just 17 percent for Republicans, in races
for Congress and governor. Other polls have also shown a pronounced
anti-Republican sentiment among California Hispanics, attributed
mainly to the policies of Pete Wilson, who won a second term as
governor in 1994 by appealing to the state's anti-immigration
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, on the other hand, Gov. George W. Bush, who often
speaks Spanish at campaign events in largely Hispanic
neighborhoods, won re-election in 1998 with 49 percent of the
Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attracting Latinos in Texas will be easier,'' said Sosa, the
advertising executive. ``California will be tougher, maybe a lot
tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally challenging will be New York, where 86 percent of the
Hispanic vote went to Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's main challenger for the Republican presidential
nomination, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who received most of the
Hispanic vote in his last election, acknowledged that his party has
been badly scarred by battles over bilingual education, immigration
and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a long time to cause the Hispanics to leave our
party,'' McCain said on Friday between campaign stops in New
Hampshire, ``and it's going to take a very long time to get them
back, especially in California. We have a long way to go.''

   Americans Are No Longer Investing for the Long Term
</P>
<P>
   Investing in the stock market for the long term, the strategy
that has made the most sense and the most money for people over the
years, is all but dead. Last year, investors held stocks for just
over eight months on average, well short of the two years that was
typical a decade ago. Among Nasdaq stocks, the average holding
period was five months. The trading frenzy has even infected the
staid mutual fund world: investors are holding funds for less than
four years on average, while a decade ago, investors held mutual
funds for 11 years.

   Consumer Price Index Rises Slightly
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 of 1 percent in December, a
figure that was lower than expected and showed inflation remains
under control, even as the economy roars toward a record for
uninterrupted expansion. Combined with reassuring comments from the
chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, on Thursday, the
report set off a rally in stocks but that fervor was cooled after a
report from the University of Michigan showed consumer optimism at
a record high, reviving fears of overheating and pushing interest
rates higher.

   The shares of America Online declined $1.3125, or 2 percent, to

investors struggled to figure out the financial outlook for the
$165 billion merger the two companies announced on Monday. The only
new development Friday was AOL's filing of documents outlining the
merger agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
filing disclosed that if America Online cancels the deal and is
bought by another company within a year, it must pay a breakup fee
to Time Warner of $5.4 billion. If Time Warner pulls out and is
acquired within a year, it must pay America Online $3.7 billion.

PANAMA STEPS UP SECURITY FOR SHIP WITH NUCLEAR WASTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bowing to renewed concerns about terrorist attacks,
Panama authorities said Friday that they were beefing up security
to protect a British ship carrying radioactive cargo through the
Panama Canal this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vessel is a visible target for any group that wants to
make a statement,'' Jorge Quijano, director of maritime operations
for the Panama Canal Authority, said in an interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups fear that the ship, the Pacific Swan,
carrying high-level waste to Japan from France, is vulnerable to
terrorists who could board and dislodge or rupture the casks with
the waste, threatening a potentially catastrophic release of
radioactivity.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when the first shipment of radioactive waste
passed through the canal, Greenpeace, the antinuclear group,
boarded the vessel to show how easy a terrorist hijacking would be.
</P>
<P>
   Since then another shipment has transited the canal without
incident.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the United States has given Panama control of the
canal, Panamanian authorities have decided to provide what they
described as ``greatly enhanced protection'' for the new shipment.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian security forces will board the Pacific Swan as it
enters Panamanian waters and take control of security and escort
vessels. If necessary, Panama will also provide security from the
air, Quijano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely the most secure vessel to pass through the
canal since Jan. 1,'' he said, referring to when Panama took over
the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the pressure to increase security came from the Nuclear
Control Institute, a group in Washington that seeks to limit the
spread of nuclear weapons. The group has been monitoring the
shipments, which are tied to nuclear power plants in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The waste is the spent fuel from nuclear power plants in Japan
from which the plutonium and uranium has been recovered in France.
British ships will make two trips a year through the canal to
return the waste to Japan for 15 years, the president of the
Washington group, Paul Leventhal, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consequence of a release of radioactive waste would be
long lived,'' Leventhal said in an interview. ``The contamination
would be very hard to clean up, and it could render the canal
inoperable and the surrounding areas uninhabitable.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Leventhal was in Panama at the government's invitation to
monitor the Pacific Swan's passage. He said he attended a security
session Friday morning with representatives of the canal authority;
British Nuclear Fuels Ltd., whose subsidiary owns the ship; and the
Japanese nuclear industry.
</P>
<P>
   Any problem with the ship would be a blow to the industry, which
has come under rare public criticism since Japan suffered its worst
accident in September. One worker was killed and scores of people
were exposed to radiation when workers set off an accidental chain
reaction at a plant in Tokaimura.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is counting on France to continue reprocessing the fuel
until it builds its own reprocessing factory. But the new criticism
of the industry may threaten those plans.
</P>
<P>
   Although Panama has no new intelligence that predicts a
terrorist attack, U.S. officials have said that they worried
through much of the 1990s that a possible narcotics-terrorist plot
from Colombia would try to seize the canal.

UNUSUALLY COOL AND CLOSE BLACK HOLE IS DISCOVERED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Looking into the deep sky with new eyes, the Chandra
X-Ray Observatory has taken the temperature of a surprisingly
``cool'' black hole at the core of the nearby Andromeda galaxy,
examined stars in infancy and death and tracked the debris from an
exploded star, the stuff out of which planets may take shape.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers analyzing data from a smaller X-ray satellite and
radio telescopes have discovered the closest black hole yet _ 1,600
light-years from Earth, which is relatively nearby on the cosmic
scale of things. But not to worry. Scientists said the object with
the awesome gravitational power to consume matter in its
neighborhood was still far enough away and of modest enough
strength to pose no danger, even if it might inspire another
cosmic-killer movie from Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings from X-ray observations were reported here
Friday at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society. Much of
the attention at the meeting has been focused on the first reports
of results from the Chandra observatory, which was launched into
orbit around Earth last July and is now handing astronomers and
theorists new insights and puzzles, particularly concerning black
holes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen S. Murray of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., said the Chandra observations of
the Andromeda galaxy had pinpointed X-rays emanating from the
galaxy's central black hole, a known compact object with the mass
of 30 million suns.
</P>
<P>
   The energies of the X-rays, Murray reported, revealed that the
gas plunging into the black hole is remarkably cool, a few million
degrees Celsius. In contrast, the typical radiations from stars
elsewhere in the galaxy reflect temperatures of several tens of
millions of degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the low radio and X-ray temperature readings from the
black hole, Murray said at a news conference, ``We obviously need
some new ideas to explain this object.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eliot Quataert, an astrophysicist at the Institute for
Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., said, ``The Chandra observation
is telling us that an entirely different flow pattern is operating
around the Andromeda black hole.''
</P>
<P>
   In another report, astronomers described the fireworks of stars
being born and dying in Messier 82, the nearest of what are often
called starburst galaxies. The unsettled conditions there are
thought to be the result of a near collision with another galaxy
about 100 million years ago. The X-ray data provided astronomers
with previously unobserved details of exploding stars, black holes,
hot gas, powerful galactic winds and binary systems that contain a
normal star in a close orbit around a dead compact star or a black
hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the disk of our Milky Way galaxy, stars form and die in a
relatively calm fashion like burning embers in a campfire,'' said
Dr. Richard Griffiths of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
``But in a starburst galaxy, star birth and death are more like
explosions in a fireworks factory.''
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers from Pennsylvania State University described
Chandra's detection of more than 1,000 young stars in the Orion
Nebula, including some objects so small that they may fail to reach
stardom and wind up as brown dwarfs, stellar objects not large
enough to have nuclear furnaces. Many of these details had never
been seen before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time X-ray astronomy has resolved individual
massive stars still embedded in their natal cloud,'' said Dr. Leisa
Townsley, a research associate at Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gordon P. Garmire of Penn State reported on more Chandra
observations of X-ray sources coming from black holes so deep in
space that they must have existed soon after the universe began
organizing itself into large structures like galaxies. Like similar
evidence reported on Thursday at the conference, these findings
seemed to suggest that some early black holes may have appeared
before galaxies, which then formed around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're exploring to the very edge of the universe to learn the
history of these black holes and where galaxies come from,''
Garmire said.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of X-rays from the remnant of an exploded star,
or supernova, enabled astronomers to identify and measure in detail
the heavy chemical elements produced by the explosion 1,000 years
ago and now being dispersed into space. Dr. Claude Canizares of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology said that the exploded star
had had 20 times the mass of the sun but was scattering enough
oxygen to supply 1,000 future solar systems. ``Real fountains of
life,'' he called these outpourings of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   The recently discovered black hole, in the constellation
Sagittarius, was spotted last September when the Rossi X-Ray Timing
Explorer satellite picked up a flare of radiation from the region.
Astronomers at the Very Large Array, a network of radio telescopes
in Socorro, N.M., confirmed the discovery and detected jets of gas
issuing from the black hole at close to the speed of light. The
black hole is consuming gas from an accompanying normal star.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald Remillard of MIT said the black hole was small, with
only 10 times the mass of the sun, but added that the sudden flares
were perplexing _ ``a novel system to pay attention to.'' To quiet
any fears, he said the black hole was rotating around the center of
the galaxy, not approaching Earth and ``not free to roam on its own
and gobble up things.''

 &HT;    Jeb Bush signs lethal injection into action
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Gov. Jeb Bush signed a bill changing
Florida's method of execution from its 76-year-old electric chair
to lethal injection Friday, hours before death row attorneys wrote
the U.S. Supreme Court trying to keep alive a February showdown.
</P>
<P>
   By signing the bill, Attorney General Bob Butterworth argued in
a letter to the court this week, the death row lawyers' challenge
to the electric chair is now irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony B. Bryan, 40, the death row inmate whose case finally
persuaded justices to consider the constitutionality of
electrocution for the first time in more than 100 years ``has never
challenged his execution by lethal injection, nor has he raised
execution by lethal injection as an issue,'' Butterworth wrote.
``In fact, he has cited with favor lethal injection as a method of
execution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of the above, Bryan's challenge to the
constitutionality of Florida's electric chair no longer presents a
(justifiable) issue ripe for review,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But in his response filed Friday, Bryan's attorney argued that
the Florida Constitution prohibits changing the method of
punishment once it is imposed and legislators have no power to
amend the Constitution. Attorney Martin McClain urged justices to
keep their Feb. 28 appointment for oral arguments and accused
Butterworth of not explaining the constitutional dilemma to the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it stands now, it's the law of the state because there's a
peculiar state constitutional provision,'' said Palm Beach County
assistant public defender Steve Malone, who worked with the team
preparing the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also signed a bill shortening the time for death penalty
appeals, a law he personally insisted on during the legislature's
special session earlier this month.

 &HT;    Ski bums, beautiful people in black round out cast at Sundance
 &HT;    EDs: EMBARGOED for Sunday, Jan. 16

<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Look out!
</P>
<P>
   It's the attack of the PIBs.
</P>
<P>
   Run for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Not in the movie theater, silly. That's the first place they'll
go.
</P>
<P>
   Psssst! Over here.
</P>
<P>
   That was close. Just look at them in their black turtleneck
sweaters, black pants, black trench coats, sunglasses and carrying
attache cases, in black, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Yes folks, it's the Sundance Film Festival at its finest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Park City call it the attack of the PIBs,''
jokes Grand Junction filmmaker, Rhea Gavry, ``because all you see
is this wave of black. You can always tell the filmmakers because
they are dressed in black. They can't afford anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, PIB stands for ``people in black.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sundance Film Festival, which drew nearly 20,000 flick fans
to the ski hamlet of Park City, Utah, last year, is gearing up for
its annual run Jan. 20-30. Park City is located about 40 miles
southeast of Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The festival originally was called the U.S. Film Festival until
actor-director Robert Redford brought it under the auspices of his
Sundance Institute. The institute promotes the development of
independent voices and visions in the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Gavry has been planning her annual pilgrimage since October.
</P>
<P>
   Her efforts paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a festival `B' packet,'' says Gavry. ``It's not my first
choice, but it's better than no ticket at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the madness works: Movie junkies must apply for
ticket packages months in advance. The cost can run the gamut _
several hundred to several thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to Fed Ex your ticket request,'' explains Gavry.
``When it's signed for, that's when they assign you a number.''
</P>
<P>
   Gavry's number was 709.
</P>
<P>
   She had exactly one hour to call in with her movie choices. The
selection process wasn't easy considering there were 112 feature
films to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   Must-sees on her list are ``Americanos: Latino Life in the
United States,'' co-produced by Edward James Olmos; ``Dark Days'';
``Songcatcher''; ``Blessed Art Thou''; ``Love and Basketball,''
produced by Spike Lee; ``Shadow Magic''; ``The Charcoal People'';
and ``Luna Papa.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had tickets for 20 films over five days,'' says Gavry.
``That's an average of four films a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't sweat it if you don't have tickets and you're not a
personal friend of film critic Roger Ebert.
</P>
<P>
   There are still ways to snag a seat without sneaking in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get on the waiting list and get in line,'' advises Gavry,
whose husband, Doug Monroe, works the festival as a free-lance
cameraman for ``Entertainment Tonight,'' E! Entertainment, HBO and
Showtime. ``You are more likely to get into an early morning
screening because people stay out late for the parties and the late
night screenings are pretty easy to get into.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, about that party thing. Unless you have a Fast Pass, Packet
``A,'' Packet ``B,'' press pass or a date with Charlie Sheen,
you're not going.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that Park City has transformed itself from a
sleepy mining town to a play in the snow cultural mecca. If cinema
tickets are scarce, strap on the boards and hit the slopes for a
great day of skiing. While you're there, check out the America's
Cup Bobsled Races or the Visa Intermountain Division Nordic Jumping
Junior Olympic Qualifier competition, both of which are going on
during the 11-day festival run.
</P>
<P>
   After a day on the slopes, stroll through one of 20 art
galleries, grab some grub at the Grub Steak Restaurant then hang
out at the Mulberry Street piano bar where everyone will be in the
same boat you are: no tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttles make it easy to get around since parking is at a
premium.
</P>
<P>
   The Park City experience alone is definitely worth the price of
admission, even if you can't get into the films, many of which
eventually will be at your local theater anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, most people come to ski, screen and gawk at the
celebrities. Big names are expected to include Kevin Spacey,
Julianna Margulies, Kyra Sedgwick, Alfre Woodward, Nick Nolte, Anne
Heche, Donald Sutherland, Spike Lee, Danny DeVito and Emilio
Estevez.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell the seasoned veterans from rookie festival-goers
who usually have their head buried deep in the film guidebook
trying to figure out what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let that scare you, though, if you're a first-timer.
</P>
<P>
   Gavry remembers her first festival in the mid-'80s when it was
still called the U.S. Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   As a film student attending on a press pass, she was bitten by
the film bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a whole entourage of Australian films and they had
all these great filmmakers,'' recalls Gavry. ``The Australians were
a rowdy bunch, and there were all these parties in the street. It
was really low key and everyone was like family.''
</P>
<P>
   The next year, she was hired to work in the press office as a
liaison between the filmmakers and the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember sitting in this theater and I turned around and
Clint Eastwood is sitting right here,'' she says motioning with one
hand, ``and Faye Dunaway is sitting right there.'' She laughs, then
adds, ``You kind of do a double take and I remember thinking, `He
looks a lot older than I thought.'''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't Gavry's only brush with fame.
</P>
<P>
   Enter a young filmmaker by the name of Steven Soderbergh with
his low budget film, ``Sex, Lies and Videotape.''
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seen the film and I thought it was great,'' recalls
Gavry. ``Soderbergh was so young, it was kind of electric.''
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh drew a late night screening slot for his film, which
is probably the worst thing that can happen to a young filmmaker
with stars in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the bigger press were leaving,'' says Gavry. ``I
talked to a woman from The New York Times and I said, 'You've got
to see this film, it's great.'''
</P>
<P>
   The writer reluctantly agreed to sit in on a second hastily
added press screening the next day before her noon flight back to
New York. When it was over, she demanded that Gavry track down
Soderbergh so she could interview him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember running around and finding him,'' laughs Gavry,
``and finding her in the ladies restroom at the Egyptian Theater
screaming, 'I got him, I got him!' She came out with the story the
next day and he was on his way.''

UDOKA WAS BIG PROBLEM FOR NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ It took only a few minutes to realize there was
a problem for the Cal State Northridge men's basketball team
Thursday night. He wore No. 11 for Portland State.
</P>
<P>
   Senior forward Ime Udoka, a mystery in the Big Sky Conference
after he sat out last season after transferring from San Francisco,
proved tough to guard. Although Udoka made only 2 of 14 shots, he
had a season-high 13 rebounds and a game-high nine assists in the
Vikings' 76-42 win over Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's maybe the best player on their team,'' CSUN coach Bobby
Braswell said of Udoka, a 6-6, emotionless swingman who played with
fluidity rarely seen in a Northridge opponent this season. ``We
were prepared for (him).''
</P>
<P>
   But if CSUN is going to take care of the Vikings at home on Feb.
26, the coaching staff might have something different in store
defensively for Udoka, who is too tall and quick for the Matadors'
best defenders _ guards Carl Holmes (6-1) and Marco McCain (6-3).
</P>
<P>
   Udoka was able to get to the line frequently because of his
slashing ability; he made 12 of 14 free throws and had 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   Class reunion: Udoka starred in the mid-1990s at Portland's
Jefferson High, where he was all-state. One of his high school
teammates was in the seats behind the CSUN bench Thursday night:
Chazz Moore, a starting cornerback for the Northridge football team
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Moore is in Portland for the winter break. He was among five
Matadors who have interested NFL scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Home-grown: Redshirt freshman center Dan Read, who played with
Holmes at North Eugene High, had several members of his family in
the stands Thursday. He gave them a thrill by making 3 of 4 shots
and scoring seven points in a season-high 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Name change: Braswell isn't known in the Northwest as CSUN's
coach. Almost universally, he's referred to as ``former Oregon
assistant Bobby Braswell'' in the newspapers every time CSUN comes
to Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell was on the Ducks' staff for four years in the 1990s
before coming to Northridge.

HISTORY ON HIGH: DEAN DOME CEILING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ Say this about North Carolina's vacuous,
antiseptic Dean E. Smith Center, with its older crowd and binocular
seats: The place has great rafters.
</P>
<P>
   A chunk of college basketball history hangs from the Carolina
blue and white ceiling. There are four national-championship
banners, 14 Final Four banners and 22 ACC-championship banners. The
jerseys of legends _ Jordan and Ford, Worthy and Kupchak _ hang
from the east rafters like specters.
</P>
<P>
   `This is unbelievable,'' UCLA freshman Jason Kapono said after
Friday's practice. ``You see all the banners and jerseys and all
the great players they've had here. It's similar to Pauley
Pavilion.''
</P>
<P>
   Great history, average team. This is not a classic North
Carolina outfit. It's talented, sure, but it doesn't ooze lottery
picks and it doesn't rule the ACC. In fact, the Tar Heels have much
in common with the Bruins, who today make their second appearance
in the 21,000-seat Dean Dome. (They lost by 26 points in 1988.)
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have endured roster changes and inconsistency. Both
lost Wednesday night _ UCLA to USC, North Carolina to Wake Forest.
Both have rosters dominated by freshmen and sophomores. And both
are performing below preseason expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been looking forward to this game, but we never thought
we'd be 11-5,'' Tar Heels point guard Ed Cota said. ``Both teams
have been kind of up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference is quality of opponent. UCLA (9-4) lost to
Colorado State, Washington and USC; North Carolina failed against
heavy hitters: Michigan State, Indiana, Cincinnati and Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   Comparative scores heavily favor the Tar Heels. They beat Purdue
by 15, and UCLA beat Purdue at the buzzer. They beat USC by 17 in
the season opener, and UCLA lost to USC by 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have to play our best game of the year,'' Kapono
said. ``There can't be any spurts when we don't do things right or
they'll jump on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Once their schedule softened and sophomore forward Kris Lang
returned from a virus and shin splints, the Tar Heels seemed poised
for a charge through the brutal ACC. They beat Clemson and N.C.
State with sterling defense and 64 points from the backcourt, Cota
and freshman guard Joe Forte.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's loss to Wake Forest was a prime example of
season-long inconsistency. Cota was 3 of 12, Forte was 1 of 10, and
junior center Brendan Haywood scored eight points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to find our identity,'' UNC coach Bill Guthridge
said. ``With the lineup change with Lang coming back, everybody's
in different roles. I think we improved after Christmas with those
two good wins, then we had that tough loss.''
</P>
<P>
   But being North Carolina, there's no dearth of talent, only of
experience and execution. The pressure's squarely on UCLA to
elevate its play or suffer another bad loss. That means smart
defense, patient offense, passion and, most important, focus.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's easy to lose concentration in the Dean Dome. The
ceiling's quite a sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd isn't really that tough _ it's like our crowd,''
said Bruins forward Rico Hines, a Greenville, N.C., native. ``But
the whole Dean Dome thing can be intimidating. They've got Michael
Jordan's jersey hanging in the rafters. It can get intimidating. As
soon as you look up, you're finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Note: UCLA forwarded the results of its JaRon Rush investigation
to the NCAA on Thursday night. A decision is expected in the next
week or two. Sources close to the investigation believe Rush could
be ruled ineligible for the season, then recoup eight or 10 games
on appeal.

NFL IS EXPECTED TO DECIDE ON BELICHICK'S FUTURE BY MONDAY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Jets begin another uncertain weekend Saturday.
This time, at least, they know who their new owner is, but still
unsettled is the identity of the next head coach. The team also may
face another bitter dispute with the New England Patriots over the
price for snatching away a coach who is already under contract.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue is expected to decide
whether Bill Belichick is free to become someone else's head coach
or must remain under contract to the Jets, the team he spurned. On
Tuesday, Robert Wood Johnson IV will undoubtedly be approved as the
new owner of the Jets by the National Football League. Within a
day, if not immediately, Johnson will preside over the selection of
a coach. Many people believe that will be the former and future
coach, Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the players know what's going on,'' left tackle Jumbo
Elliott said Friday. ``But if you had to press them, they'd guess
Bill is coming back. But Bill will do whatever he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has promised his ``total dedication to bringing a
winning and championship team to this area.'' He is a sports fan,
and wants to establish immediately a solid base as the owner by
stabilizing the team. This he can do most readily by reappointing
Parcells or having Parcells name Al Groh, his linebackers coach, as
the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Marcus Coleman, who will be a free agent, has said
that his decision on whether to remain a Jet could be influenced by
whether Parcells returns as coach.
</P>
<P>
   If the new coach is Parcells or Groh, then most of the assistant
coaches will return, too. The one certain change will be Eric
Mangini, a defensive assistant who helped coach the secondary.
Mangini will wind up with Belichick, who seems destined to coach
somewhere else once his contractual status is cleared up.
</P>
<P>
   There is uncertainty whether Charlie Weis, the offensive
coordinator, will opt to follow Belichick, with whom he has become
friendly, or stay with Parcells, who has encouraged him in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   If Tagliabue rules that Belichick is under a valid contract with
the Jets, as the team has maintained, that will set up a familiar
scenario: a team that wanted to hire Belichick as coach would most
likely have to part with draft picks to land him.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are confident they have an ironclad agreement with
Belichick. They declined Tagliabue's invitation to present more
evidence or additional witnesses Friday to bolster their position.
</P>
<P>
   After Parcells retired as coach last week, Belichick, who had
been designated as Parcells' successor, stepped down as head coach
after one day on the job. Belichick contended that his contractual
status changed significantly because of the death last May of the
Jets' owner, Leon Hess. Belichick filed a grievance against the
Jets with the NFL after the team denied him permission to talk with
the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   If Tagliabue rules in Belichick's favor, then he will be free to
become the New England coach and general manager. On Jan. 3, the
day after the regular season ended, the Patriots requested
permission to interview Belichick but were rebuffed by the Jets,
who cited Belichick's contract, which said he would be the head
coach when Parcells retired.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the league upheld the Jets' contention that
Belichick was off limits to any other team. Assuming that
Tagliabue's stance remains the same, the give-and-take of
negotiating between the Jets and the Patriots will begin, just as
it did in 1997 when Parcells wanted out of his contract, which
bound him to New England.
</P>
<P>
   When the Jets and Patriots were unable to reach an agreement
over appropriate compensation, both sides requested Tagliabue's
intervention. Tagliabue decided to award the Patriots four Jets
draft choices over a three-year period in return for freeing
Parcells from his contract with New England.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he will mediate between the Jets and the Patriots
only if both sides ask him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Many current and former Jets will attend a charity auction
Monday night for the David Center, a proposed center on Long Island
for autistic children. Among the items for auction will be jerseys
signed by Keyshawn Johnson and Dan Marino, a baseball autographed
by Roger Clemens and a hockey goalie's stick signed by Martin
Brodeur. The event, from 6 to 9 p.m. at the Official All Star Cafe
in Manhattan, is expected to attract quarterback Ray Lucas, center
Kevin Mawae, tackle Jason Fabini and the former Jets Marty Lyons,
Bruce Harper and Greg Buttle. &QL;

SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER BOY SCOUTS CAN EXCLUDE GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SCOTUS-ABORTION) 
(lh) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide, in a
closely watched case from New Jersey, whether the Boy Scouts have a
constitutional right to exclude gay youths and adults from
positions of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The case is an appeal brought by Boy Scouts of America and its
Monmouth Council of a ruling in August by the New Jersey Supreme
Court. That court ruled unanimously that the Scouts were not a
private organization, but a ``public accommodation'' bound by the
state's civil rights law. As such, the state court said, the
Monmouth Council could not adhere to the national organization's
policy against accepting gay members, a policy the court said was
``based on little more than prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of its policy, the Monmouth Council in 1990 revoked
the registration of James Dale, who was serving as a volunteer
adult leader in a troop where he had reached the rank of Eagle
Scout as a teen-ager. He was dismissed after identifying himself as
gay in a local newspaper interview. Dale filed suit under the state
civil rights law, which bars discrimination on the basis of
``affectional or sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts' appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court did not take issue
with New Jersey's application of its civil rights law, over which
the justices have no jurisdiction. Rather, the appeal made the
broad constitutional argument that as a matter of free speech and
freedom of association, the organization must be able to define its
own values and ``expressive character.'' In effect, the troop is
contending that its First Amendment rights supersede the public
accommodations law of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a Boy Scout Troop in Monmouth County, New Jersey, could be
required to accept a leader whose avowed conduct and opinions
contradict the stated mission and message of the organization, it
is difficult to see what is left of freedom of association,'' the
Scouts' brief told the justices.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the Scouts, George A. Davidson of New York City,
expressed confidence that the Supreme Court would overturn the New
Jersey ruling. ``I've always thought from the outset the court
would agree to hear this case and reverse, and so far we're on
track,'' Davidson said. ``It's a very, very strong constitutional
claim that we're advancing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale's lawyer, Evan Wolfson of the Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund, expressed hope that the Supreme Court would not
overturn the New Jersey court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In several decisions in the 1970s and '80s, Wolfson said, the
high court held that the First Amendment could not be used as a
shield by groups trying to circumvent state civil rights laws. In
addition, he said, the New Jersey ruling rejected the Scouts'
argument that Dale's ouster was protected by First Amendment rights
of association. The ruling said the Scouts' bylaws and charter were
silent on the issue of homosexuality and did not permit exclusion
of any boy.
</P>
<P>
   The question before the justices is framed as one involving
leadership, but the Boy Scouts' policy against homosexuality also
applies to members. Davidson said Friday that for purposes of
carrying out the policy, there is no real distinction between
members and ``leaders'' because older boys assume leadership
positions as they rise in the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   While the Supreme Court's decision will be about associational
rights, rather than gay rights as such, the ruling could have a
broad impact on the ability of openly gay people to participate in
organizations that want to exclude them. The outcome of the case
may depend on what messages the justices conclude are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the court ruled that organizers of the St.
Patrick's Day parade in Boston could not be required under the
Massachusetts civil rights law to accept a group of gay marchers.
The court found that the gay marchers were seeking to carry a
message that the parade organizers, with a message of their own
that disapproved of the gay group's claiming open identity as
descendants of Irish immigrants, were free to exclude.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Dale's lawyers at the Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund are arguing that the Boy Scouts' First Amendment
argument is misconceived because ``there is no core expressive
purpose of anti-gay ideology in scouting'' and consequently no
expressive burden in allowing gay men to serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boy Scouts do not come together to promote bigotry and
anti-gay bias,'' Evan Wolfson, Lambda's senior staff attorney, said
Friday, adding: ``The court now has a chance to hear that scouting
is about honesty, community service, self-reliance, and respect for
others _ not discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Until its loss in the New Jersey Supreme Court, the Boy Scouts
had been successful in defending its policy in state courts around
the country by arguing that various state public accommodation laws
could not be properly read as applying to the organization. The
constitutional issue that the Scouts have posed to the justices has
not been addressed by any other court. The Boy Scouts have also
been sued by atheists and agnostics who have been unwilling to
adhere to ``duty to God'' as described in the Scout oath. The oath
also requires members to be ``morally straight,'' the phrase that
is cited in barring gay members.
</P>
<P>
   Dale, who is now 29, spent 12 years in scouting, earning 30
merit badges and induction into the Order of the Arrow. He has said
he would like to return to scouting.

NEW AIRLINE SAFETY PROGRAM FOCUSES ON PILOTS REPORTING THEIR
ERRORS

(HLW) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton announced a program on Friday to
encourage airline pilots to report their own rule violations, in
exchange for immunity from punishment, to make it easier for the
government, the airlines and the pilot unions to detect trends that
could hurt safety.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the program, which has been in use on a test basis
at American Airlines for five years, would help aviation join other
American industries in ``moving toward a zero-defect approach'' by
compiling anecdotal evidence from pilots.
</P>
<P>
   But a larger program that would give pilots immunity for
reporting data that is important to safety is still mired in
bureaucratic rule making. That system, used successfully by several
European carriers for the last few years, involves downloading data
from on-board computers and analyzing thousands of flights to look
for patterns of violating restrictions on altitudes, or on climb or
descent rates. Such patterns could give clues to problems in air
traffic control or other aviation systems.
</P>
<P>
   News organizations, lawyers who represent crash victims'
families and others have objected to the program because it would
keep the data secret from them.
</P>
<P>
   The Aviation Safety Action Program announced by the president
will be open to all airlines. More than a dozen, including all the
major U.S. carriers, have expressed interest, the Federal Aviation
Administration said.
</P>
<P>
   The president of American Airlines, Donald J. Carty, and the
president of the union that represents American's pilots, Richard
T. LaVoy of the Allied Pilots Association, said that the program
had already resulted in changes that improved safety.
</P>
<P>
   For example, LaVoy said, several pilots reported that at one
airport with intersecting runways, they had moved their airplanes
too far forward when told by air traffic controllers to yield to
other planes that were landing. The pilots did this, he said,
because they sometimes confused one runway's ``stop'' line with the
other's. The problem was solved when the lines were repainted, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But without a promise of immunity and a common practice of
reporting their own errors, pilots probably would not acknowledge
such an error and no one would realize that it was widespread, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The government already runs a hot line for pilots to report
their violations and gain immunity, operated by NASA under contract
with the aviation agency. But that data is ``de-identified,''
meaning it is stripped of details that could pinpoint the airline
or airport, making it harder to use to glean safety information,
officials said. The new program is not anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   The immunity from punishment does not extend to deliberate
violations of the rules, criminal activity or substance abuse,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the program was part of the administration's goal
of cutting the crash rate by 80 percent over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Outside experts say that to reach that goal, airlines and
regulators will have to move beyond finding problems by analyzing
crashes, because crashes are rare.
</P>
<P>
   At the College of Aeronautics, located near La Guardia Airport
in New York, Maxine E. Lubner, the chairwoman of the college's
aircraft operations department, said that the challenge now was to
find patterns of human error, because so many mechanical problems
had already been solved. ``The system is not likely to be improved
by technological and mechanical fixes as much as it once was,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Dr. Lubner said, comparing the pattern of reports
from several airlines might help spot that one had a training
deficiency or that another had a strong training program or
procedure in some particular area of operations.
</P>
<P>
   The aviation agency's bigger hope is for a program called flight
operations quality assurance, which would take data from computers
on planes. European carriers, using American-built planes, have
used such data to determine, for example, that pilots frequently
violated restrictions on altitude and rate of descent.

 &HT;    Coughlin holding off on whether to start Brunell
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE _ There are no sure things in Tom Coughlin's world,
which is why Jacksonville's coach declines to designate Mark
Brunell as his starting quarterback today.
</P>
<P>
   Though Brunell took the majority of snaps during the week and
has expressed no reservations about his left knee, Coughlin said he
won't name a starter until before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Brunell went down with a strained medial collateral ligament in
the knee in a Dec. 26 loss against Tennessee. While Coughlin has
argued, ``We will not start Mark Brunell if he can't defend
himself,'' the quarterback showed improved mobility as the week
wore on. He will wear braces on both knees.
</P>
<P>
   BRING YOUR A-GAME
</P>
<P>
   Keep an eye on the right side of Jacksonville's offensive line,
where tackle Leon Searcy is anticipating an eventful day. Miami
defensive end Trace Armstrong opened the week by trying to downplay
the Jaguars' threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we feel everybody has to play their best game to
beat them,'' said Armstrong, the league's defensive player of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   Searcy was not amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't bring his B-game,'' Searcy said, ``because I'm going
to bring my A-game.''
</P>
<P>
   With nine career sacks in the postseason (including three
against Seattle last weekend), Armstrong needs two more to tie
Charles Haley for third place on the all-time playoff sack list.
</P>
<P>
   THE BIG SPREAD
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars opened the week as a nine-point favorite, a spread
that dipped only a point, despite the uncertainty of Brunell's
knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot to go in there and prove,'' Miami defensive
tackle Daryl Gardener said. ``We're kind of ticked off about it,
but we're just going to go play our game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what an underdog is,'' Miami running back J.J.
Johnson said. ``I've never been an underdog in my life. There are
no underdogs on a football field.''
</P>
<P>
   INJURY REPORT
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins tight end Troy Drayton, who underwent arthroscopic
surgery on his right knee Dec. 23 for cartilage repair, is the
day's biggest question mark. An inactive for last weekend's
wild-card round at Seattle, Drayton went through his first practice
Tuesday and expects to play, though he officially is listed as
questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Miami wide receiver Oronde Gadsden (ribs) is also questionable.
Jacksonville offensive tackle Tony Boselli (knee) and linebacker
Bryan Schwartz (hamstring) are on injured reserve and out.
</P>
<P>
   ETC.
</P>
<P>
   Winds gusted to 35 mph Friday, and temperatures dipped into the
mid-30s overnight. But forecasts call for temperatures in the upper
60s with 8 mph winds at kickoff. ... Both teams are 2-2 against
common opponents. Both beat Denver. Miami lost to the New York Jets
twice while Jacksonville beat them once, but Miami was 1-0 against
Tennessee while the Jaguars were 0-2. ... The clubs did not face
each other this year but Jacksonville prevailed in their only
previous matchup, a 28-21 victory last season in a Monday night
game. Fred Taylor ran for two scores and Keenan McCardell caught
two touchdown passes.

 &HT;    Even injured, Davis is a pain to defenses
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Judging by his performance last week against
Detroit, Redskins running back Stephen Davis will be just fine
running on a sore ankle and a sore knee.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbled by a sprained ankle going into the Redskins' playoff
game against the Lions, Davis rushed for 119 yards and two
touchdowns in the first half before leaving with a sprained knee.
</P>
<P>
   It's still the ankle, which kept him out of the last two
regular-season games, that is giving Davis the most grief. But he
predicted Thursday, in his only practice time this week, that he
would play today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt (I'll play), but I have a long way to go,''
Davis said. ``I'm just getting myself prepared. Hopefully, it will
work out like last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Redskins center Cory Raymer said he also expected to give it a
try today, despite a pulled rib-cage muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I don't have to run and hit somebody, I think I'll
be all right,'' said Raymer, who has started every game for the
past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   DUNGY'S SIDE
</P>
<P>
   Bucs coach Tony Dungy, one of four African-Americans to be hired
as an NFL head coach, told reporters this week that he disagreed
with Jesse Jackson and the Rainbow-PUSH Coalition accusation that
the Green Bay Packers held fired coach Ray Rhodes ``to a higher
standard'' because he's black.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the Packers made a move,'' Dungy said. ``They hired a
guy, and, for whatever reason, they decided not to continue with
it. But I think we need to look at the situation where they don't
hire people, as opposed to the Packers situation.''
</P>
<P>
   OTHER INJURIES
</P>
<P>
   Tampa cornerback Donnie Abraham missed a couple of practices
this week with a right hamstring strain, but he is expected to play
today. Abraham tied for the NFL lead in interceptions with seven.
Buccaneers backup receiver Reidel Anthony aggravated a quadriceps
injury in practice and is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   SUNSHINE STATE
</P>
<P>
   Former University of Miami standout Warren Sapp is feeling
nostalgic,with three Florida teams still vying for the Super Bowl _
Tampa Bay, Jacksonville and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you what, the whole state of Florida is buzzing right
now,'' Sapp said. ``That is something special that we all got
going, with Jacksonville, ourselves and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always keep an eye on the other team,'' he said, ``because
it's kind of like, who is going to be champion of Florida right
now, and Miami and Jacksonville play, so that will eliminate one of
us. It's just one of those things where who goes the furthest has
the bragging rights for a whole year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hold that to be kind of like college ball, the state
championship between Florida and Miami and Florida State. It's just
a great, great state for football and right now we are showing how
good we are.''

 &HT;    Jags favored, but Marino a favorite
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ The future of the Dolphins' Dan Marino and
the health of the Jaguars' Mark Brunell are two of the questions
the teams will start answering at 12:35 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   Miami needs another big game out of the rugged right arm of
Marino, who last week in Seattle ignored the numbers on his NFL
odometer.
</P>
<P>
   Favored Jacksonville must protect Brunell and his tender left
knee without Pro Bowl tackle Tony Boselli, out for the playoffs
with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   With the winner of this AFC playoff game in Alltel Stadium one
victory away from Atlanta's Super Bowl XXXIV, the teams face other
questions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Who will come off the bench as interpreter if Jimmy Johnson
and Marino have to talk over something on the sideline?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will the five Jaguars who have produced a Super Bowl rap song
spend any anxious moments if the Dolphins are more resilient than
the bookies are figuring?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will Dolphins defensive end Trace Armstrong be forced to eat a
few paragraphs from a newspaper clipping after stating this week,
``It's not like we feel like everybody has to play their best game
to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its injuries, 14-2 Jacksonville is favored to handle
Miami (9-7 in the regular season) and then host the AFC
Championship Game next Sunday against either the Colts or the
Titans.
</P>
<P>
   Miami has defied the odds already, losing five of its last six
regular-season games before upending the Seahawks on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The home-field advantage could be significant for the Jaguars,
who are 29-4 at the former Gator Bowl. Nationally, however, there
is sentiment toward Marino, who has not been to a Super Bowl since
1984 and could be playing his last game in the NFL. Marino
acknowledges the support but doesn't expect much in the first
playoff game between two Florida teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think because of the years that I've played in the league
and playing for the Dolphins ... the whole time,'' Marino said, ``I
do sense that the people are pulling for me to do well, and it's a
good feeling to have the support of the fans and the people around
the country. But I think their fans will be real fired up. Their
fans are extremely loyal.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticized for a soft schedule that inflated their record, the
Jags led the NFL in rushing but did not beat a team with a winning
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care much about what the critics say,'' said Brunell,
who took more snaps with each practice day this week. ``We won 14
games, and you'd hope that would be enough to earn a little
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams do not have a fierce rivalry, but they do have a
history, and Brunell is aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before there ever were the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Miami
Dolphins were the big team in this town,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you were to go out and ask people on the street who
they wanted to see come to Jacksonville to play, it would have been
the Dolphins,'' Jags coach Tom Coughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin said he is counting on Jaguars fans not to make any
assumptions and look past Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous opportunity, I think,'' he said, ``for
our fans to come forward and make a statement about the city of
Jacksonville and about our people.''

 &HT;    NFC: Playoffs putting question to passers
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Questions abound about the four quarterbacks remaining
in the NFC playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay Buccaneers' hopes rest on rookie Shaun King, who
has started only five games. The Bucs' offense is anchored by the
run, but if the Redskins stop it, can King hold his composure under
an assortment of blitzes? The Washington Redskins' ambitions ride
with Brad Johnson. Before this season, Johnson was known more for
completing a pass to himself _ and for not playing a complete
season in five years with Minnesota. With Stephen Davis'
availability questionable and Tampa Bay's defense ferocious, could
Johnson be one hit away from a gurney?
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, former Arena League star Kurt Warner emerged as a
one-of-a-kind story, leading the Rams to the best record in the NFC
and winning the league's MVP. But St. Louis has not beaten a
winning team, and Warner has not played in an NFL playoff game.
Will the pressure get to him?
</P>
<P>
   And in Minnesota, former Falcons player Jeff George finally got
a playoff victory, throwing three touchdowns Sunday against Dallas
in an effort buoyed by an effective running game. But what if the
Rams contain Robert Smith? Can George resist the temptation to
trust his phenomenal arm in situations that require him to throw it
away?
</P>
<P>
   Questions, questions, questions, questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a quarterback,'' Johnson said, ``it's about
getting to a point where you're in a groove and you're not thinking
about the circumstances or what's at stake. You're just playing
like you're in the backyard as a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   It's very difficult to get to that point in the NFL playoffs
particularly for King, who started the season as the backup to the
much-maligned Trent Dilfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows a lot of wisdom on (the coaches') part, because as
much as I wanted to play at the beginning of the year, I probably
wasn't ready,'' King said. ``I was sort of glad that I wasn't in a
situation where I was playing and we were losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, ``I'm just excited for the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Buccaneers change their scheme, King's opportunity to
pass will not be as frequent as for the others. The Bucs build
their offense around the running of Mike Alscott and Warrick Dunn,
with an occasional _ or necessary _ display of King throwing deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaun has grown,'' coach Tony Dungy said. ``We won four of the
five games he started, so we feel the experience he's gained will
work for him (Saturday). We have confidence in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's confidence is at a career high. He's healthy, thanks
to a massive offensive line that will be missing tackle Andy Heck,
out with a hamstring injury. His absence could be a significant
blow against the tenacious Bucs' defense.
</P>
<P>
   But during the regular season, on a day that San Francisco shut
down the Washington's running game, Johnson threw for 417 yards.
That talent, and his ability to play an entire season, answered
many questions that haunted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been putting up with a lot of rumors about having a tired
arm, about being an injury-prone quarterback,'' Johnson said.
``Coming here, being a part of it, it's a special feeling. That's
all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Warner, for everything he has done in a remarkable season
_ 109.2 quarterback rating, 41 touchdowns _ the Rams rewarded him
monetarily. The team had an extra $500,000 under the salary cap and
granted that money to Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money's not something that I'm hung up with,'' said Warner,
who earned the league minimum $250,000 this season. ``It's
obviously a nice gesture, to see that they appreciate what I've
done this year. Obviously, it's going to help out the family. And
I'm very grateful for it. The best part about it is not what they
gave me, or the fact that they gave me anything, but just the fact
that they felt strongly enough about my performance to offer me
something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   A free agent after the season, Warner's performance Sunday
against Minnesota probably won't have any effect on deal
negotiations. Not that it is on his mind now. Warner has a chance
against a suspect Vikings secondary to compile more impressive
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what my mind is on,'' he said. ``The playoffs are a new
experience for me, another part of an incredible season. But I
don't want it to be over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither does George. He took over for a struggling Randall
Cunningham with 10 games left in the season and directed the
Vikings to nine victories. Sunday, he can continue to dispel the
negative notions about his ability to lead a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even thinking about that,'' George said. ``We have a
chance to get to where we want, which is the Super Bowl. So,
there's a lot of work ahead of us. But this is a great
opportunity.''

JUSTICE DEPT. INVESTIGATES CLOSING OF POLLING PLACES IN SOUTH
CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs to correct hed) 
(DW) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Alerted to the closing of polling places in black
neighborhoods during South Carolina's last Republican presidential
primary, the Justice Department has begun asking pointed questions
about both parties' coming primaries, political officials around
the state said Friday. The inquiry raises the possibility that the
primaries could be challenged by the government under the Voting
Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   If the government finds that the poll closings violate the
voting rights of blacks, the Republican Party _ whose Feb. 19
primary is critical to the presidential hopes of Gov. George W.
Bush and Sen. John McCain _ faces the possibility of having to
spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to open every polling place
in the state, which was not done in previous primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats could also then have to cancel their March 9
primary and move to a caucus system, said the party's state
chairman, Richard A. Harpootlian, because like the Republicans the
Democrats were not planning to open every polling place in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Neither party wants to spend the money to open polling places in
each of the state's 1,914 precincts, but neither party informed the
Justice Department of its plans to deviate from the procedures used
in the general election, as they are required to do under the
Voting Rights Act. While the inquiry began after a complaint to the
Justice Department last week that was instigated by Democrats, both
parties realized that the department had never been informed that
the parties picked their own polling places in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department would not comment on the issue Friday,
but several people who had been called by the department's lawyers
said they had asked about the precise mechanics of the primaries,
and whether the voting methods had ever been cleared with the
department. A. Lee Parks, an Atlanta lawyer who drafted the
original complaint, said he had been told the department was
conducting an expedited inquiry, in order to get the matter
resolved before Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Republican state chairman, Henry McMaster,
issued an appeal Friday for more volunteers to work at polling
places on Feb. 19, in order to show the Justice Department that the
primary would be conducted fairly. At the moment, the party has
enough volunteers to open more than 1,000 polling places, he said,
but not enough for each precinct. Some polling places would have to
be consolidated with others, he said, but he promised that race
would not be a factor in which ones would remain closed.
</P>
<P>
   Opening polling places in each precinct would cost the party
more than $500,000, he said, compared with the $150,000 it has
budgeted.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the Democrats of concocting the issue to embarrass
the party and reduce black turnout in the Republican primary.
Although there are few black Republicans, South Carolina has an
open system that does not require party affiliation to vote in a
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this whole thing is about is, they don't want black
people voting in our Republican primary,'' McMaster said. ``They
see us getting all the attention. They see their base getting soft.
So what they do is play the race card and falsely accuse us of
keeping black people out of the primary. They're trying to inflame
public opinion against us, and I think they should be ashamed of
this kind of race baiting.''
</P>
<P>
   McMaster, a former U.S. attorney, said he did not believe a
presidential primary was covered by the Voting Rights Act, which
was intended to prevent discrimination in voting. But either way,
he said, the party would do whatever it took to conduct a
completely open primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party has not denied, however, that many polling
places in black areas were not open in the 1992 and 1996 primaries.
Party officials said that was because they did not have enough
volunteers to open polls in heavily Democratic areas _ many of
which were mostly black _ because few Republicans tended to vote
there.
</P>
<P>
   Harpootlian was unapologetic _ and perhaps the slightest bit
gleeful _ at having helped point out this fact to the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that the Republicans will now have to live up to
their rhetoric,'' he said. ``Bush and McCain travel the country and
urge African-Americans to participate, while the state party is
bleaching the primary so African-Americans can't vote. It's time
for them to either shut up or open up all the precincts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harpootlian, who had earlier said his party's primary would
be open in all precincts, acknowledged Friday that it did not have
the resources to do so. If the Democrats need to keep all polls
open to comply with the Voting Rights Act, he said, they could
switch to a caucus system, where voters informally elect delegates
to a state convention that later picks the state nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic vote is not as important as the Republican
primary because it comes after more significant primaries. &QL;

 &HT;    Fresh faces on a weekend of firsts
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the second weekend in a row, the NFL playoffs will
provide doubleheader football today and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins and Jaguars kick off the second round at 12:35 p.m.
today, followed by Washington at Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   And those games are just the appetizers. The top two matchups
are Sunday, when the Rams host the Vikings and the Titans play the
Colts in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The divisional playoffs will be a weekend of firsts.
Indianapolis and St. Louis will host their first playoff games. In
Jacksonville, it's the first playoff game between two Florida
teams. And it's the first time one state _ Florida _ has been the
site of two playoff games on the same day since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It also is the first time in 25 years that Dallas, Denver and
San Francisco all were eliminated before the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's just a changing of the guard,'' Bucs defensive
tackle Warren Sapp said. ``Those ball clubs got a little older, and
some injuries put them in situations where they're not as potent as
they used to be. Quarterbacks will be at the center of the action.
Two hobbling veterans, Miami's Dan Marino and Jacksonville's Mark
Brunell, and two castoffs, Washington's Brad Johnson and
Minnesota's Jeff George, account for half of the eight. The rest
are inexperienced.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's Shaun King, who has won four of five NFL starts,
will become only the sixth rookie quarterback to start a playoff
game. Since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger, rookie quarterbacks are 1-5 in
the postseason.

   ``Even guys who went to good teams _ the John Elways and the Dan
Marinos _ didn't really take over and take their team to the
playoffs their first year,'' Bucs coach Tony Dungy said. ``So, it's
something that doesn't happen all the time, but I think the
circumstances were really right for Shaun.''
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis' Peyton Manning and St. Louis' Kurt Warner, the
league's top two passers this season, will make their first playoff
starts. And they know the postseason is a different animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of us, this is the first playoff game we're in,''
Manning said. ``We don't know any better than to treat every game
as if it's the most important game. That's why we've played well
the majority of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A playoff game's certainly different,'' Manning said. ``It's
going to be more intense. It's going to be faster. Hopefully, we
can rise to the occasion.''

   KURSUMLIJA, Yugoslavia _ The Serbian chief of police here looks
weary. For him the war in Kosovo is not only not over, but it has
come closer. He says Albanians from Kosovo are crossing the border
into his district in the adjacent part of Serbia and attacking
villagers and the police.
</P>
<P>
   Unlocking the door of his small Yugo car outside the police
station, 10 miles from the Kosovar border, he spoke of a land mine
explosion that killed three policemen in November. He said the mine
had been laid by Kosovar Albanians, almost certainly former members
of the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KLA is here already,'' he said with a small shrug, as if
it were no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   If true, that assertion represents a serious problem for the
NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo. The force moved in and took
control of Kosovo, the southern province of Serbia, in June after
an 11-week NATO campaign of air strikes to end Serbian repression
of Albanians and to force Serbian troops to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Already struggling to contain the postwar violence against Serbs
and other minorities inside Kosovo, the peacekeepers may face a
growing burden of policing a long and porous border to prevent
Kosovar Albanians from carrying out attacks in nearby parts of
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian police say there have been at least 16 attacks on
Serbian police officers and villagers in the area near Kosovo since
June.
</P>
<P>
   They began with occasional shootings and harassment of villagers
by Albanians straying over the border to steal wood or to settle
scores. But recently there have been more serious and organized
attacks that the Serbian police say indicate guerrilla activity.
</P>
<P>
   The worst attack occurred on Nov. 21, when gunmen opened fire on
a police post near the Serbian village of Prepolac, just a few
hundred yards from a unit of peacekeeping troops on the Kosovo side
of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting continued through the early hours of the morning, and
then a loud explosion resounded through the remote wooded hills.
Serbian police officers traveling back down the mud road from the
border to their headquarters had hit a land mine. Three men were
killed in the blast and six were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian police chief, Rodoljub Dosovic, said he had no doubt
that well-trained Albanian guerrillas had placed the mine, in a
coordinated action with the shooting attack on the police post.
``They started a firefight to draw out the police, and another
group laid the mine on the road,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another attack occurred several weeks later on a road near the
town of Bujanovac, east of Kosovo, when a police car came under
fire. Two senior officers were wounded in the attack, which the
police again blamed on Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a classic attack, an ambush from both sides of the
road,'' said Milivoje Mihajlovic, a Serbian journalist who used to
be based in Kosovo. ``It reminded me of the KLA attacks on the
police in Kosovo in 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When the Serbian military pulled out of Kosovo in June, it moved
all troops and heavy weaponry behind a three-mile buffer zone. The
Serbian police are posted on every road in the area and patrol the
back roads and villages. Many of them are from Kosovo and served
there for years.
</P>
<P>
   They take the attacks in stride. It has been part of the job for
several years, one said. The villagers in this area appear more
alarmed. Some are moving out of the settlements closest to the
border, and all are calling for a stronger police presence.
</P>
<P>
   In the town hall in Kursumlija, Mayor Borivoje Urosevic pulled
out a detailed map of his district, which has a 60-mile boundary
with Kosovo. There is no Albanian population in this area, he said,
but five Serbian villages have been abandoned as residents have
come under repeated attack from Kosovar Albanians. ``There is no
day without an attack,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Six people have been killed since June, including the three
policemen near Prepolac, and seven people wounded, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The level of violence remains low compared with that of
neighboring Kosovo, but the growing use of explosives shows a more
organized intent, Urosevic said. On Dec. 12 two young men narrowly
missed injury when their tractor drove over a mine outside the
border village of Merdare.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the KLA,'' the mayor said. ``This is organized.
Robbery is not the motive as it was earlier. It is pressure to make
the Serbs move from their territory.'' The peacekeepers, he added,
``must prevent these attacks, because we have people being
displaced from the area.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ljubica Aleksic was the last to leave the now abandoned village
of Tacevac. The police used to patrol daily, he said, but after the
land mine incident they were reluctant to drive up the roads. The
Albanians are bolder than before, he said, because they know that
the Serbian police cannot pursue them over the border into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to take advantage of the woods to clear the area of
the border, so there are no more Serbs there anymore,'' Aleksic
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the border, in Kosovo, ethnic Albanian
villagers have returned to rebuild their houses under the
protection of peacekeepers but remain nervous with the Serbian
police so close. When shooting broke out near the Kosovo village of
Donje Dubnica recently, several families fled their homes for the
day.
</P>
<P>
   They said they did not dare venture to cut wood on the Serbian
side. When prompted, they acknowledged that young men who had
fought in the war were slipping across the border to attack the
Serbian police.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, the German commander of the peacekeeping
force, played down the issue in an interview, as did the British
officer in charge of operations in the border area. Both appeared
confident that their border controls and covert operations were
sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot prevent everyone who wants to go across, except by
mining to a maximum,'' Reinhardt said. ``And we are busy trying to
demine the place.''

 &HT;    Taylor wants reason to show off pearly whites
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Out went the gold teeth. Thug, rapper,
gangster, the stereotypes said, and Fred Taylor listened before his
second NFL season.
</P>
<P>
   In came the white caps. After leading all rookies with 1,223
rushing yards, Taylor's future as a pro star and potential endorser
of products seemed as gleaming and wide as his smile.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a hamstring injury and six games on the bench in 1999.
After a pre-season marketing deal with Pepsi, talks with Nike went
into a holding pattern. Gone were a reported $1 million in Jaguars
contract incentives he probably would have met easily on healthy
legs.
</P>
<P>
   Nike looked elsewhere, such as to Edgerrin James. Like Taylor,
James grew up without much money in Immokalee, a rural South
Florida community not far from Taylor's home in Belle Glade. Unlike
Taylor, James kept his gold teeth, resisting advice to the
contrary, and left intact his dreadlocks, which Taylor never had.
James went on to become NFL Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Now Taylor, as healthy as he has been since midseason, has a
chance to bolt back into the spotlight as the Jaguars host the
Dolphins in the playoffs Saturday, two games from the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was headed in a good direction, headed up,'' Taylor
said. ``Getting injured kind of hurt my marketing a little bit, but
not a whole lot. I've still got a lot things open to me with the
team doing very well. I think it all pretty much balanced out.
It'll only get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: Taylor's concern Saturday is not his teeth,
except to the extent they might get rattled if somebody misses a
block. Nor is it is his endorsement prospects. If he helps his team
win, he says, the rest will take care of itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had all those different things,'' Taylor said. ``I just
hadn't taken advantage of it. I was trying to get my leg right and
I wasn't even worried about that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville must get past Miami to reach the conference title
game for the second time in four years. The Jaguars are not anxious
to appear to be looking ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Still, consider the possibilities Saturday: A monster rushing
day by Taylor, who grew up in the long shadow of Dan Marino's
passing arm in South Florida, might usher the legendary quarterback
into retirement or a new NFL city. And if the Colts also win,
Taylor could find himself in a marquee rushing matchup with James
in the AFC title game.
</P>
<P>
   When healthy, Taylor is the most explosive spark in the league's
leading rushing offense. He ran 77 yards for a touchdown on the
first play from scrimmage in last year's 28-21 Jaguars win over
Miami, the only other time the teams have met. With Jags
quarterback Mark Brunell trying to work out the stiffness of a
sprained knee, Jacksonville can be expected to ask more than ever
of its running game and Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to try to win,'' Taylor said. ``I'm not
worried about Dan retiring. I'm pretty sure he'll be back next
year. He's a great player, man, and you just can't throw him out.
He'll retire when he's ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor admired Marino growing up, but his loyalties ran to the
Chicago Bears and running back Walter Payton, whose moves and
stiff-arm James also happened to idolize. Taylor's own stiff-arm
was the one that crumpled Broncos linebacker Glenn Cadrez on a
38-yard touchdown run with 2:38 left to give the Jaguars a go-ahead
score against Denver in the 13th game of this season, marking his
return from injury.
</P>
<P>
   The hamstring has prevented him from matching the production of
this rookie season in 1998, when he became Jacksonville's first
1,000-yard rusher. James Stewart has more yards this season for
Jacksonville, 931 to Taylor's 732, and more touchdowns, 13 to 6.
But Taylor, when full speed, remains the more dangerous threat,
averaging more yards per carry, 4.6 to 3.7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred is a great back because he has the ability to break one
on every play,'' Brunell said. ``We're counting on Fred to have big
game. Last year against the Dolphins he did and hopefully he will
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's rookie season stirred talk of 2,000 yards this year,
which he now regards as a jinx. A similar thing happened at the
University of Florida. After an eye-catching freshman year, Taylor
endured a sophomore slump, missing much of the season to injury and
suspensions for minor but embarrassing disciplinary infractions. He
would be involved in three such incidents in his college career,
for things like misusing bookbags and charge cards that did not
belong to him.
</P>
<P>
   That was part of the reason for the attention to Taylor's image
in the off-season, helped along by advisers from the Jags media
relations team to agent William ``Tank'' Black. Taylor has become
increasingly at ease before cameras, and corporate sponsors have
nibbled if not yet offered the big-dollar contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a discussion or two with him,'' said Nike spokesman
Scott Reames. ``With someone like Fred, we're certainly keeping an
eye on those who are not under contract already with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Deciding who is marketable and who is not ``is a complex
calculation,'' Reames said. ``We don't have a protractor. If you
fit between the lines, you're a Nike guy.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is that gold teeth and dreadlocks may be considered
interesting and nonthreatening for a player like James, whose
off-the-field behavior is actually quite mild-mannered, by all
accounts. For Taylor, capped teeth might yet prove to be a good
move, if it helps dispel any bad-guy stigma that might linger,
fairly or not.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what happens on the field counts for a lot. With a
strong showing in the playoffs, Taylor might find plenty to smile
about off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's mother will be there Saturday at Jacksonville's Alltel
Stadium, as will friends from home and college, but not his
grandmother, Rosetta, the woman who essentially raised him in Belle
Glade. That has not changed since his high school playing days at
Glades Central, where he was a Parade All-America.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can't bear to watch,'' Taylor said. ``Not in person
anyway. But she'll watch on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   So will thousands of Dolphins fans, who might like to see Taylor
better his business fortunes another day.
</P>
<P>
   They know it's a bad sign for Miami if it's late in the game and
the camera pans to helmetless Fred Taylor on the sidelines,
flashing the whitest enamel marketing science can find.

TOP SCOUT TEAM LOOKS OVER COMPETITION

<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ We're down to the Elite Eight in the NFL's
postseason tournament, and it's time to analyze what these teams
have to do to have the best shot of advancing to their respective
conference championship games. As always, commentary from men whose
teams have faced both participants.
</P>
<P>
   Miami at Jacksonville, Saturday at 12:30, analysis by Jets
director of football operations Bill Parcells: ``There is one
important factor here to begin with that should not be overlooked.
Miami's preparation time. Jacksonville has been off for two weeks,
getting healthy, and with plenty of time to prepare. My guess is
that they probably prepared more for Seattle, thinking Seattle
would win the game, but they still should have a wide preparation
edge on Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miami, I'd bet, didn't get home from Seattle until 2 or 3
Monday morning. So Monday was ruined as a practice day. Then they
have to play Saturday at (12:30), another day taken off a normal
preparation week. Miami has to run the ball well to win. If they
become one-sided against the Jacksonville defense, then they'll
have a hard time scoring points. If Miami runs as well as they did
against Seattle, they've got a good chance to win. I don't think
Jacksonville will run on Miami, either. Miami's defense is pretty
good. The big decision they have to make is how they are going to
cover Jacksonville's wide receivers, Jimmy Smith and Keenan
McCardell. Smith is the go-to guy for Jacksonville. It will be
interesting to see whom Miami matches up Madison with. Jacksonville
likes to screen a lot, and throw the ball to Smith. Their tight
ends haven't been a big part of the passing game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacksonville is good on defense. They use the zone blitz very
well. I don't know if Miami can exploit that. I think Miami will be
a little charged-up after winning in Seattle, and if they don't
turn the ball over, and play the same kind of game they played in
Seattle, run well, no turnovers, they can win this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington at Tampa Bay, Saturday at 4, analysis by Lions coach
Bobby Ross: ``This should be a great matchup with the Washington
offense going against Tampa's defense, which to me is the fastest
in the league. They are so quick on defense that if you don't play
against them on a regular basis, like we do twice a year, their
speed kind of blindsides you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is very good on offense, and overall, when they
beat us last week, they were a much better team than when we beat
them in Detroit during the season. Their defense seems to be
playing better now. Washington can hurt you just about every way
possible on offense. They can throw deep with the speed and size of
their wide receivers, they have role players out of the backfield
like (Brian) Mitchell and (Larry) Centers for special occasions;
their tight end, (Stephen) Alexander, is a good pass catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they will have to deal with Tampa's speed. Warren Sapp is
one of the most dominating players in the game. Their linebackers
can run with the best of them, and (Donnie) Abraham is one of the
best cover guys in the league. I think Tampa will be very
conservative on offense, and try to protect the young kid (Shaun)
King at quarterback. They'll try to bang into the line with (Mike)
Alstott, and run screens and draws with Warrick Dunn to try to get
him in space for the big play. My guess is that Tampa will be very
conservative on offense, trying not to turn the ball over and make
mistakes, and let their defense try to set good field postion, and
win that way. But in the playoffs a team has to have more than one
element to win, so I think you'll see Tampa take a few deep shots
down the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota at St. Louis, Sunday at 12:30, analysis by 49ers
general manager Bill Walsh: ``I think St. Louis is the best team in
the league this year and should win the Super Bowl. They are very
good on offense, good on defense, and good enough on special teams.
They're probably the only team with balance in all three areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minnesota has to outscore them. I see St. Louis scoring 35
points against that defense. Minnesota is not good on defense, and
St. Louis has it going on offense. The quarterback (Kurt Warner)
hasn't had any problems yet. But you never know. He could come out
a little nervous, throwing incompletions, or interceptions, and
then it's a ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Louis has outstanding speed at wide receiver. Marshall
Faulk is a weapon, running and in the passing game. Both teams can
hurt you deep, go downfield with the ball. What Minnesota has going
for it is Jeff George and the deep passing game. George is playing
exceptional football. He should try to make big plays in the
passing game all day long. I see St. Louis winning something like
38-24. But if they make some mistakes, turn the ball over, then
Minnesota can beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee at Indianapolis, Sunday at 4, analysis by Browns coach
Chris Palmer: ``The team with the better defense in this game will
win. Neither team has a `great' defense, although they both can
play well at times. Indy is a great play-action pass team. What
will help Peyton Manning is the double tight end, one-back set they
always play. This could be very effective in stopping Jevon Kearse
pass rushing off the corner for Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manning reads the defense fast and gets rid of the ball. It's
very hard to sack him. Jeff Fisher plays a variation of the old
Buddy Ryan `46' defense. Tennessee pressures. They bring Blaine
Bishop, a very good safety, up to play eight men in the box and
they dare you to run. They're good at stopping the run. But,
Manning, with his play-action passing, and Edgerrin James, with his
running, might open up the field deep for Marvin Harrison and
(Terrence) Wilkins to make some plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennessee is not great against the pass. If they try to double
Harrison, then Wilkins can hurt them. On offense, Tennessee is a
gimmick-type team. They always have a couple of trick plays, to
back off the defense. Eddie George is a great runner, but I think
(QB Steve) McNair is the best runner on their team. That guy is
hard to bring down. He didn't pass well against Buffalo, but he
threw five touchdowns against Jacksonville, so you don't know what
you're going to get.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll is telling friends he expects to sit out a year
before he returns to coaching. Pete also told some of his coaches
that he was forced to fire Larry Kennan, Paul Boudreau, and Steve
Walters following his first two season, and prevented two more from
being fired.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has been reported ad nauseum that Phil Luckett, who was the
referee in Tennessee's win over Buffalo last Saturday, is the guy
who made the ``bad'' calls in games involving Pittsburgh and the
Jets in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Luckett was the referee who flipped the coin in the Thanksgiving
Day game where Steeler Jerome Bettis called ``head, tails.''
Luckett was villified for saying Bettis called ``heads'' when a
national television audience heard ``tails.'' During the offseason,
an electronically enhanced tape proved that Luckett was right, and
was not only exonerated, but given a bonus from the league. So he
did not blow that call.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the media types said he was the one who made the bad
call in the Jets-Seahawks game, when Vinny Testaverde was brought
down inches short of the goal line, but incorrectly given a winning
touchdown. Luckett was the referee, but he didn't make the call.
The line judge, backed up by the umpire, raised his arms signaling
touchdown. Luckett was stationed deep in the backfield behind
Testaverde and it was not his call.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the reason Carroll seemed so at ease following his final
game in Foxboro Stadium, waving to the crowd on the way out, is
that owner Bob Kraft told him before the game he was going to be
fired the next day. Carroll asked Kraft before the game to know his
fate so he could relax and enjoy the day, so Kraft told him that
was going to be it, but not to tell anyone.

NEW MICROSOFT CHIEF EXECUTIVE HAS SPECIAL BOND WITH CHAIRMAN
GATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ At the lectern on his first day as chief executive of
the world's most powerful software company, Steven Ballmer slapped
his hands together loudly for emphasis. But only once.
</P>
<P>
   By any account, such a performance is low key for Ballmer, who
on Thursday was named to succeed his longtime business partner and
best friend, Bill Gates, as Microsoft's chief executive. Gates will
remain the company's chairman and focus on shaping Microsoft's
software strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer, who has been president of Microsoft for a year and a
half, is known for his fist-pounding, bellowing, bombastic style.
Though some suspect it is one of the most finely honed acts in the
industry, no one disputes the passion he brings to his role as the
industry's supersalesman.
</P>
<P>
   And no one disputes his intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Once in an interview, Ballmer gesticulated so wildly that he
struck his forehead with his fingernail hard enough to draw blood.
Apparently unfazed, he continued talking while dabbing at his
wound.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer is stepping forward to guide Microsoft's day-to-day
business as the company faces an array of competitive and legal
assaults. It is only the latest challenge Gates has laid before him
in his 20 years at Microsoft, from managing the company's software
relationship with IBM in the 1980s to taking responsibility for a
``holy war'' to heighten customer satisfaction over the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the special chemistry that has marked the business
partnership between Ballmer, 43, and Gates, 44, few expect the
change in leadership to have a noticeable effect on Microsoft's
operations or its strategic direction.
</P>
<P>
   Central to that chemistry is the complementary nature of the two
men's passions. Ballmer is the consummate business manager,
thriving on operational details, while Gates takes legendary
delight in pushing forward new technologies and plunging into
arcana.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're two halves of the same person,'' said a Microsoft
executive who has worked closely with them for years. ``Together
they constitute the finest business executive in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors showed no apprehension about the change Friday, with
Microsoft shares rising $4.4375, to $112.25, recouping losses
earlier in the week on a generally strong day for technology
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago Gates and Ballmer said they had made a ``gut
check'' and agreed they were committed to Microsoft at least until
they reached 50. On Thursday, both said nothing had changed about
that commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Other Microsoft executives who have spent years with the two men
say it is the trust they built first as college friends that has
distinguished their collaboration over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still best friends,'' said Michael Swaine, co-author
of ``Fire in the Valley: The Making of the Personal Computer''
(McGraw Hill, 2000). ``These guys were college pals, and after
poker games at Harvard, Gates would stay up describing the games to
Ballmer. In turn Ballmer got Gates to join a men's club to smoke
cigars and wear a tuxedo.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, unlike the high school friends Steven P. Jobs and
Stephen Wozniak, who founded Apple Computer in 1976 but have grown
more distant since the 1970s, Ballmer and Gates have only grown
closer over the years.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with a small group of reporters after the
announcement Thursday, they frequently completed each other's
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   After Gates said he would probably continue to kibitz by e-mail
on day-to-day issues confronting Microsoft, Ballmer laughed and,
sounding a bit like Martha Stewart, said, ``Reading e-mail from
Bill is a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is not at all unusual for Ballmer to step in to help lift
the load from Gates. It has been a troubled time for the software
executive and world's richest man. (His 15 percent share of
Microsoft is worth about $88 billion, while Ballmer's 5 percent
share is worth about $29 billion.) With the government antitrust
case threatening both the company and his own reputation, Gates has
described 1999 as ``the worst year in my life'' to confidants at
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   With the company under siege, Ballmer has often led the
counterattack with enthusiasm and gusto.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, though Ballmer has a reputation as ``the sales guy,''
he actually has the technical credentials to match Gates. He
majored in applied mathematics at Harvard, and part of the pair's
original bond was that they were both ``math nerds'' who stood out
even among the best and brightest. Ballmer loves to tell of how he
outscored Gates in several crucial mathematics and economics tests.
Although Gates dropped out of Harvard to start Microsoft with his
childhood friend Paul Allen, Ballmer stayed on to graduate and then
joined Procter &AMP; Gamble, where he began his business career
test-marketing cake mixes.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer's intellectual prowess has made it possible for him to
step in and oversee the company's software development efforts at
various crucial times. Now, with him as chief executive, even
longtime competitors say they believe that the new division of
labor will free both men to do what they each do best.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is giving Steve the platform to do what he does really
well,'' said Gordon Eubanks, a longtime Microsoft competitor and
president and chief executive of Oblix Inc., an electronic-business
software company in Cupertino, Calif. ``Until now it was
complicated by the fact that Bill still had to do things, and it's
very complicated for two people to share the day-to-day management
of a company.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that few people believe will change is Microsoft's
aggressive nature, which has earned Ballmer the industry nickname
``the Embalmer.'' He has carried on a particularly spirited public
rivalry with the chief executive of Sun Microsystems, Scott
McNealy, a fellow Detroit native and Harvard acquaintance with one
of the industry's sharpest tongues.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever his bluster or tactical bombast, Ballmer embodies
the disciplined persistence that has marked Microsoft since its
inception, coupled with a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Many years ago, after a reporter misspelled his last name as
``Bullmer'' in an article about an early version of the company's
Windows operating system, Ballmer highlighted the error in a
celebration of the product at a trade show. He noted that it was
just one additional bug in a troubled product the company was
intent on improving.

 &HT;    U.S. Supreme Court will hear appeal from Branch Davidians
 &HT;    By Mark England and Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear the
appeal of five Branch Davidians challenging lengthy prison
sentences for using enhanced weapons during a gun battle with the
government at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Four ATF agents and five Davidians died in the Feb. 28, 1993
shootout.
</P>
<P>
   The Davidians argue they shouldn't have been given longer
sentences for carrying machine guns or grenades because the San
Antonio jury hearing their cases never decided what kind of weapons
they had.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding juror Sarah Bain agrees with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been one of my bones of contention from the
beginning,'' Bain told the Waco Tribune-Herald. ``It was a question
never put to the jury. It was not in any of the matters we had to
determine as a jury. I felt like the judge overstepped himself in
making determinations we weren't even asked to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   Surviving Davidians had differing reactions to the court's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is wonderful,'' said Sheila Martin, a Branch Davidian who
left Mount Carmel days after the ATF raid. ``This means so much.
This will give encouragement to the men that their waiting and
hoping was not in vain. They just want to have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Clive Doyle, who was acquitted at the trial, was less
enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been pitching not to get the case reviewed or to get
another trial but to get them out, because I don't think they
should even be in there,'' Doyle said. ``But this is a start in the
right direction anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1994 trial, Davidians Jaime Castillo, Brad Branch,
Renos Avraam and Kevin Whitecliff were convicted of voluntary
manslaughter. Graeme Craddock was convicted of possession of a
grenade.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also found the Davidians guilty of possessing a firearm
while committing a violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco, however,
initially set aside the latter, arguing the convictions were
inconsistent with the jury's acquittal of the defendants on the
charge of conspiracy to commit murder.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, however, reinstated the convictions after prosecutors
argued that inconsistent verdicts were still valid legally because
each individual charge was like a separate indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Although the jury wasn't asked what weapons the Davidians used,
Smith determined they had enhanced weapons (machine guns or
grenades) through use of the so-called ``fortress theory.'' It's
based on a defendant's access and proximity to weapons during a
crime. Smith subsequently tacked 30 years onto the sentences of the
four Branch Davidians also sentenced to 10 years in prison for
voluntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Craddock, given a 10-year sentence for possession of a grenade,
received an additional 10 years on the weapons charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good day,'' said Waco attorney Richard
Ferguson, who is handling Brad Branch's appeal. ``When you have
been fighting for a client for five years and getting nowhere and
then you finally have some hope, it is a good day. We are just
pleased that some court is finally willing to take a look at our
issues. We feel we have a very good chance at success.''
</P>
<P>
   Waco attorney Stanley Rentz, who represents Craddock, called the
court's decision ``a big step.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an issue that needs to be resolved as to whether or not
you are carrying a weapon that carries a 30-year sentence or one
that carries a five-year sentence and who determines it: whether it
is a jury or a judge,'' Rentz said. ``I think it will help in a lot
of different cases. The unfortunate thing about it is that they can
only review part of the overall case.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Tinker, the Corpus Christi attorney who represented Brad
Branch at his trial, said no evidence was presented six years ago
to connect Branch with a machine gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's evidence that he had a firearm,'' Tinker said. ``But
it was clear from listening to the witnesses who cooperated with
the government that it could not be classified as a machine gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Bain, too, doesn't believe the evidence showed the Davidians
carried enhanced weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there were automatic weapons on the premises,'' Bain
said. ``It's not something the jury was asked. But whether someone
used them or carried them, that wasn't substantiated during the
trial to my thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Bain said she's always regarded the weapons-charge count given
jurors as ``crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to find them guilty if we believed they used or carried
weapons,'' Bain said. ``To me, there's a lot of difference between
moving around a box of grenades and pulling the pin on one and
throwing it. But the law gives them the same weight.''

 &HT;    Judge picks British firm to re-create events at Davidian
compound
 &HT;    By Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A federal judge in Waco on Friday chose a British
firm to stage a demonstration designed to determine if FBI agents
fired into Mount Carmel on the final day of the 51-day siege with
David Koresh and his followers.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr., in a pivotal, two-page
order in the wrongful death lawsuit filed against the government by
Branch Davidian survivors, laid some preliminary ground rules that
will govern the re-creation of events at Mount Carmel on April 19,
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Smith tabbed Vector Data Research, a British firm that
specializes in infrared and thermal imaging, to conduct the
re-creation, but set no date or location for the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff attorney Mike Caddell, who is confident the
re-creation will prove that FBI agents fired at Branch Davidians on
the final day of the siege, said he thinks the tests will be
conducted during the first two weeks of March at Fort Hood.
</P>
<P>
   Smith ordered the re-creation in November at the urging of
Special Counsel John Danforth. The former senator from Missouri was
appointed in September by Attorney General Janet Reno to
investigate revelations in the Branch Davidian controversy,
including the government's belated admission that they used
pyrotechnic devices in the early-morning hours of the final tear
gas assault on Koresh's compound.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs have alleged that bursts of light on government
aerial infrared surveillance tapes from April 19, 1993, are gunfire
from federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials have maintained that their agents didn't fire a
single shot on that day, despite their claims that they were
showered by Branch Davidian bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test will occur, at a minimum, with the current FBI camera
and aircraft,'' Smith ordered. ``The (Office of Special Counsel),
with the cooperation and assistance of the parties, will attempt to
secure a camera and, if necessary, an aircraft that contains a
camera, of the type the FBI used in 1993, without the upgrades that
are on the current camera. If both cameras may be procured, the
test will use both cameras.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, at first, protested the notion of the
re-creation, claiming that the equipment had changed since 1993 and
noting the difficulty in approximating the exact conditions of that
day.
</P>
<P>
   Smith ordered that his court and Danforth's office will submit a
first draft of a protocol to the government and plaintiffs by Jan.
31. Experts from both sides then will confer and develop a
protocol, including where and when the tests will be conducted,
weapons and ammunition to be used, types of planes and cameras,
weather conditions and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vector is very well respected,'' Caddell said. ``Our people
have checked them out and we are very comfortable with them serving
as the neutral expert for the court and the OSC. For us, having a
truly neutral expert and utilizing the original camera and aircraft
were the key components to maintaining the credibility of the
test.''
</P>
<P>
   At the court's invitation, government attorneys submitted the
names of three infrared experts in December as neutral experts to
participate in the test. Caddell, however, charged that the
government's choices all had been former colleagues of Irving
William Ginsberg, who submitted an affidavit on the government's
behalf in November claiming that there are ``too many unknown
variables'' to accurately re-create the conditions of April 19,
1993.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also ordered that results from the re-creation be
provided to the parties at least eight weeks before trial, which is
set for May 15 in Smith's court in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   The parties will pay for the tests ``as the court deems
appropriate after consultation with the parties,'' Smith wrote.
Danforth's office will pay Vector's bill, he said.

 &HT;    Long odds, odd song? Dolphins not listening
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Think about this: It has been more than two
months since the Miami Dolphins won back-to-back games.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Dolphins shut out Tennessee on a hot November
afternoon at Pro Player Stadium, they have had only one kind of
streak. Losing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as they walk onto the field at Jacksonville's Alltel
Stadium today, six days after a first-round playoff victory at
Seattle, the Dolphins players and coaches honestly believe they can
win again, advance to the AFC title game for the first time since
1992 and turn a recording done by five Jacksonville players _ ``Uh
Oh, The Jaguars Super Bowl Song'' _ into a premature parody.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the oddsmakers pegged the Dolphins as
eight-point underdogs. Or that when ESPN's Tom Jackson was asked to
rate the remaining eight playoff teams, he put them dead last. Or
that when a reporter from The Associated Press broke down the
first-round playoff games, he wrote of the Miami-Seattle matchup
``the winner here has no chance of winning a second-round game.''
</P>
<P>
   That quote is now posted on the bulletin board. Circled and
highlighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we can beat Jacksonville,'' assistant coach Dave
Wannstedt said. ``We're playing here close to home. We're playing
on grass. We're in the state of Florida. We're healthy. There's no
reason not to think we can win this football game.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there are lots of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Jacksonville's resume: Finished the regular season with
an NFL-best 14-2 record ... won seven of eight home games ... did
not allow an opposing passer to throw for 300 yards ... allowed
only one running back, Tennessee's Eddie George, to rush for 100
yards ... spent last weekend resting.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Miami's: Finished the regular season with a 9-7 record,
losing six of its final eight games ... only made the playoffs when
the Seahawks and Jets lost on the last day of the regular season
... had to rally in the fourth quarter to beat a Seattle team that
had lost five of its last six games.
</P>
<P>
   Uh Oh?
</P>
<P>
   Not if you listen to the tone coming out of the Dolphins locker
room. After snapping one streak in Seattle _ 27 years without a
road playoff victory _ the optimism seemed to grow each day,
building until, in his last meeting with reporters, Dolphins coach
Jimmy Johnson scoffed at the idea that his recently slumping team
doesn't have a shot at becoming the first No. 6 seed to make it to
an AFC title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Want to get on a roll?'' he said. ``Win the first playoff
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Dolphins did that last year. When defensive end
Trace Armstrong jarred the ball loose from Doug Flutie, preserving
a first-round playoff victory against Buffalo, it set the stage for
a game that, in many regards, looked similar to this one.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins headed to Denver, home of the team that finished
the regular season with an NFL-best 14-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   They lost 38-3 _ the worst playoff defeat in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was different,'' Armstrong said. ``You just went into
Denver hoping. You hope you get a break. You hope they have a bad
day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have had to have been real, real fortunate to have
any chance last year,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Dolphins say, they don't need luck or hope or even
one of those everything-falls-into-place games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that we need to latch on to anything,'' Armstrong
said. ``Now, we've kind of got a tough row to hoe. ... But it's not
like we feel like everybody has to play their best game for us to
beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for why this meeting with the
regular-season champions feels different than the last one. Start
with the injuries. Last year at Denver, the Dolphins were missing
seven players who at the beginning of the season were starters.
This year the Jaguars are the ones hurting. Tony Boselli,
considered the best left tackle in the NFL, is out with a knee
injury. Quarterback Mark Brunell has been limited in practice with
a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of the schedule. Five of the Dolphins'
regular-season opponents _ including two division champions _ made
the playoffs. Meanwhile, the Jaguars played only one team that
finished with a winning record. They lost to that team, Tennessee,
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the same Tennessee that the Dolphins beat on that hot
November day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat the team that beat them,'' Dolphins offensive
coordinator Kippy Brown said. ``So we know we're capable of
competing with anybody _ if we play well.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dolphins tried to conceal their game plan this
week, it seems clear that they plan to stick with what worked in
Seattle. Run the ball. Avoid turnovers at all costs. Play good
defense. Hope the game is close. And then, if you need to, let Dan
Marino use his 38-year-old arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what serves Dan Marino and the Dolphins best,'' said
Phil Simms of CBS, who covered the Seattle game. ``He is not the
same Dan Marino. He doesn't need to stand back in shotgun and throw
40 passes. He is not capable of doing that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But are Marino and the Dolphins capable of wining today in
Jacksonville?
</P>
<P>
   CBS' Dan Dierdorf, who will be calling the game, thinks so. He
says the oddsmakers have it wrong. He looks at the Jaguars'
banged-up offensive line, the Dolphins' defensive front and calls
it a toss-up.
</P>
<P>
   And although the Dolphins aren't heading to the recording studio
just yet, after a regular season filled with uh-ohs _ seven
interceptions returned for touchdowns _ they believe this isn't
Denver all over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach convinced them,'' Brown said. ``There's nobody in this
league that we can't beat if we play how we're capable of playing.
Nobody.''

 &HT;    Supporters urge Trump to try presidential run
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ They sipped his wine, nibbled his salmon,
gawked at Mar-a-Lago and wrapped arms around Donald Trump's waist
urging him to run for president while having their pictures taken.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party leaders from across the country came to Trump's
private club to mingle with the candidate who is trying to convince
himself that he can win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Trump said he will make his decision Feb. 15 and will likely
announce it in the atrium of Trump Tower _ ``is there a better
place?'' _ in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think that he brings an excitement to the Reform Party
that can only help us if he stays involved,'' said David Goldman, a
Sarasota attorney and chairman of the Florida Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 members of the party from New York, Georgia,
Virginia, Michigan, Massachusetts, Florida and other states were
given free copies of Trump's new book: ``Trump: The America We
Deserve'' as they entered the White and Gold Ballroom, which was
added to the 1927 estate in 1960 by cereal heiress Marjorie
Merriweather Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to learn more about his ideas,'' said Russell Verney,
the party's outgoing national chairman. Verney works for party
founder Ross Perot. ``I think he still needs to get a handle on
just how difficult it is to win this election,'' said Verney. ``I
want to make sure that he has all the information he needs to make
his decision.''
</P>
<P>
   For Marji Mathieu of North Palm Beach, seeing Mar-a-Lago was too
good to pass up. ``What a place,'' said the Reform Party activist.
``He sure does make it interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever the businessman, after leaving his guests, Trump headed
toward the members-only dining room pausing long enough before
entering to ask one of the staff, ``Are we up over last night?''

EYES ON IOWA, BRADLEY JABS AS GORE HOLDS BACK PUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JAMES DAO with KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHNSTON, Iowa _ With just 10 days to go before the Iowa
caucuses, former Sen. Bill Bradley sharpened his efforts Friday to
portray Vice President Al Gore as a ``nibble around the edges''
politician, saying Gore was too willing ``to settle'' for small
solutions for big problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say we cannot do big things,'' Bradley said before
several hundred students, teachers and supporters in a high school
auditorium here. ``We're a great country at the time of our
greatest prosperity. And now is not the time to settle.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech echoed criticisms Bradley has made before against
Gore in their battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.
But Friday was the first time in recent days that Bradley pulled
all those varied criticisms together into one address.
</P>
<P>
   His aides said Bradley would continue to use that approach in
the coming week to clarify the distinctions between the two
candidates as well as to strengthen his assertion that he would be
a bolder leader than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's approach has been the opposite of Bradley's
aggressiveness. Gore has been keeping his head down and trying not
to make waves _ and not to make news of the sort he made last week
with his comments on gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two days in New Hampshire, it has been hard to tell
that he is campaigning at all. Gore is avoiding rallies and the
normal hoopla that attends the approach of an election. Instead,
his only public events have been detailed policy discussions with
small groups of people, where he speaks in a quiet, near-monotonous
voice and is careful to show the cameras, which usually outnumber
the voters, nothing but a low-key, thoughtful vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that voters, especially the independents in New
Hampshire, are loath to reward any candidate for a negative
approach to campaigning, and, after months of harsh assessments of
Bradley _ from raising doubts about his loyalty to the Democratic
Party to faulting his health care proposal as unfair to blacks and
other minorities _ Gore is sidestepping all opportunities to
criticize his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   At a brief news conference at a retirement home in Concord,
N.H., Gore passed up several chances to respond to Bradley's
remarks Friday. ``The only thing I can figure is that he didn't get
the word on the nice things I said about him,'' Gore drawled to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Iowa caucuses little more than a week away,
Bradley's advisers are concerned that many Democrats do not
perceive significant differences between the two candidates on
major issues.
</P>
<P>
   So Bradley used much of Friday's speech to tick off his
proposals on universal health insurance, gun control, child
poverty, campaign finance reform and education. In each case, he
contended, Gore would do far less.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Bradley even mimicked the quavering voice of a
timid person in describing what he said was Gore's limited health
care proposal. Then he drew a comparison between his proposals to
reduce poverty and expand health care to what Franklin D. Roosevelt
and Lyndon B. Johnson did to create the Social Security and
Medicare systems. And he suggested that he would be a truer heir to
their expansive tradition of Democratic politics than Gore would
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 1930s, depression,'' Bradley said.
``The elderly of this country were destitute. He said, `We're going
to pass Social Security.' He didn't say we're going to pass Social
Security for 20 percent of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was accompanied Friday by Sen. Bob Kerrey, a Democrat
from the neighboring state of Nebraska, who has endorsed him. And
in a talk with reporters before Bradley's speech, Kerrey fiercely
attacked the Clinton administration and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He berated Gore for having called Bradley a ``quitter'' for
retiring from the Senate in 1996. Gore asserts that Bradley should
have stayed in Washington to fight the Republican congressional
leadership, as Gore says he did. But Kerrey argued that the
Republican landslide of 1994 was caused by the Clinton
administration's poor leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't tell me I ought to give you a round of applause
for standing around and fighting Newt Gingrich,'' he said,
referring to the former Republican House speaker. ``You brought us
Newt Gingrich. That would be like asking me to thank the arsonist
after he sets a house on fire and then sticks around and helps us
put out the blaze.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey went on to assert that the Clinton administration was
``corrupted'' in 1995 and 1996 by its efforts to raise large
campaign donations, that it had dropped efforts to enact universal
health care for political reasons, and that Gore would ``say
whatever it takes to score political points.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Godzilla of the Internet decides to wed the King Kong
of content, it is a natural time for the other denizens of the
jungle to wonder what the future will hold for the colossal couple
and the world they inhabit.
</P>
<P>
   The question of what America Online and Time Warner see in each
other is inseparable from the question of what the Internet
landscape will look like in a few years. Will cyberspace be mainly
a source of information and entertainment, or an interactive
communications medium? Will the crucial asset be a subscriber base,
a broadband electronic pipeline or a server full of movies, music
and news? Will the primary entrance point be a computer, a
television a cellular phone or perhaps a Webcam?
</P>
<P>
   Verne G. Kopytoff and Julie Flaherty were assigned by Money &AMP;
Business to ask Internet seers in business and academia how they
saw the online experience evolving over the next five years, and
whether last week's announced merger of tree-snapping behemoths
advances, retards or misreads those trends. Here are their
replies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WILLIAM H. DUTTON Professor of communications at the University
of Southern California and author of ``Society on the Line''
(Oxford University Press). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Internet providers don't want to be limited to people who have
computers. But to date, efforts to introduce interactive television
and other interactive services like video text and video services
have all failed.
</P>
<P>
   You have to be skeptical about to how well the Internet model
translates to the television set. They're totally different. People
who watch television generally are passive and don't interact with
it and don't want to. So changing their viewing habits is going to
be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the Web has been a trigger service that has caused more
people to get computers and get online. But there are also other
trigger services, like word processing and spreadsheets.
</P>
<P>
   People who see big synergies in the AOL-Time Warner merger are
ignoring the fact that electronic mail and communicating with
others is why most people use the Internet. Access to information,
including entertainment, is not the major reason why people go
online.
</P>
<P>
   People will still watch television on television, which will be
much like it is today, though in a few years it will have many more
links and ties and references to the Internet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GORDON M. TUCKER Chief executive of Egreetings Network, an
online digital greeting and gift company based in San Francisco. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I believe that the desktop computer will remain the anchor point
for people going online. I don't believe that people who are
information-centric organize their lives around television.
</P>
<P>
   Television doesn't handle the variety of needs. You want to
reduce the number of communications options you are forced to deal
with. The problem is that more and more people are getting
frustrated with the number of devices they have to manage. Wireless
phones and laptops will be there, but as a supplement to computers.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about making it easier and easier for people, and
faster and faster. Obviously people today want instant
gratification, and mergers like AOL and Time Warner are just going
to accelerate the achievement of that goal. In a few years the
Internet will be a lot more dynamic, and you'll have the ability to
personalize a Web site you visit: it will be possible to present a
fundamentally different Web site for you versus everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   In online retailing, global commercial access transforms
companies and the way they sell products. Right now it is difficult
to sell products internationally, but as the barriers to
international trade come down and Web sites address the need of
international consumers, you'll have access to anyone in the
world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MARIO GERLA Professor of computer science at UCLA, now working
on developing Internet 2, a high-speed successor to today's
Internet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I see a lot of changes happening. One is wireless access to the
Internet. Nowadays, we connect mainly from the home or the office,
but we already see a trend of access to the Web from cell phones.
Soon a commuter riding to work in a van will be able to
video-conference or take a class on a laptop. We will be able to
stand in the aisle of one store and see what others are charging.
There is definitely the need to access the Internet from anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   All of this raises the question of cost. You may pay a provider
for access, but no one is charged for actually using the network,
regardless of the traffic. That's all right for now when there
isn't that much traffic. But in the future, if everyone is building
bigger conferencing and video on demand, you'll just exceed the
bandwidth available. That will be resolved by charging people, or
by giving free access but having advertising subsidizing the
network as an indirect charge.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true for wireless access. If I'm in the
middle of Central Park, I'm sharing the spectrum with a large
number of people, so pricing will be the controlling factor.
</P>
<P>
   The other complementary act is that we will have the so-called
smart office, and the smart network to appliances in the home, and
video cameras in every room that can be accessed from the Internet.
You will be able to see what your kids are doing _ that's an
extension to the concept of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   As for the AOL-Time Warner merger and the proliferation of
entertainment on the Internet, there is a limit to what you can
sell. We are already flooded. I don't have any time for that; maybe
kids do. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL L. DERTOUZOS Director of the Laboratory for Computer
Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and author of
``What Will Be'' (HarperBusiness). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I am not surprised by the merger, for it confirms the industrial
world's progress toward a powerful information marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   I am surprised, however, by the hyperventilation over
``content.'' Even with interactivity, such uses will only be
roughly as big a part of the overall economy as entertainment and
news are today _ less than 5 percent. But office work, at 50
percent of the industrial economy, could reach $4 trillion a year
online worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Within five years, 50 million Indians, who read and write
English and have office skills, will be ready to sell their
information work to us at bargain prices. Interconnected computers
will further automate many of the things we now do with our eyes
and brains. People will collaborate over time and space wherever
they may be. They will be able to retrieve the information they
want, rather than infojunk; control their physical environment; and
customize goods and services to individual needs.
</P>
<P>
   And, we hope, more people than the privileged 2 percent of the
world who are interconnected today will join in. Much more than
interactive ``content'' lies ahead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOB METCALFE Founder of the 3Com Corp.; now a commentator on
technology and vice president of the International Data Group, a
large publisher of computer-related books, newspapers and
magazines, in Boston. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In five years, most Americans will be enjoying broadband
Internet from home, maybe 100 times as fast as dial-up modems and
always on _ no more waiting for personal computers to power on,
boot up, launch browsers, accept dial tone and then dial their
screeching modems only to get busy signals from, well, America
Offline.
</P>
<P>
   What we'll attach to the always-on, high-speed Internet will be
mostly devices other than personal computers. What comes and goes
over the broadband Internet will be much less like clicking a
computer than like talking on the telephone. And it will be less
like talking on the telephone than like watching CNN, reading Time
magazine, laughing through Looney Tunes at the movies, hip-hopping
with Rampage on Elektra records and exercising with Jane Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   All we have to worry about on the broadband Internet is
preserving freedom of choice among competing alternatives. Worry
about Big Business taking over the Internet if you want _ AOL Time
Warner, Microsoft and the telephone monopolies, for example _ but
be sure to keep an eye on Big Government.

   BC-PINOCHET-CHILE-NYT (moved on Wednesday, Jan. 12)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Wednesday, Jan.
12, about the presidential runoff election in Chile tomorrow
referred incorrectly to the actions of Joaquin Lavin, the
conservative candidate, after Gen. Augusto Pinochet was arrested in
Britain at the request of a Spanish judge. Lavin, at the time mayor
of a community in Santiago, did not suspend garbage collection at
the Spanish and British Embassies. The action was taken by the
mayor of a neighboring community.

   BC-CODEBREAKERS-NYT (moved on Monday, Dec. 6)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, Dec. 6,
about the cracking of a code protecting some wireless telephone
transmissions referred imprecisely to the achievement. Although
cracking the code could jeopardize the security of phone calls, the
ability was thus far theoretical; no occurrence was reported.
</P>
<P>
   The article also included an outdated reference to a wireless
communication standard known as G.S.M. (A brief report on the
subject in the Week in Review on Dec. 12 also included the error.)
The expression now stands for global system for mobile
communications, no longer Groupe Speciale Mobile. The errors were
pointed out in a letter from Omnipoint dated Jan. 4.

   A New York Times News Service article sent on Thursday, Jan. 13,
about Jon Entine's ``Taboo: Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports and
Why We're Afraid to Talk About It'' misspelled the surname of a
pathbreaking boxer in some copies. He was the heavyweight champion
Joe Louis, not Lewis.

   In the fall of 1994, when America Online, with just about a
million subscribers, lagged behind its competitors _ and when the
smart money was betting that the free World Wide Web would quickly
eclipse the paid online services _ Time Warner unveiled a site that
aspired to be the emerging Web's prime destination.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald M. Levin, Time Warner's chairman and chief executive,
proclaimed that the Web site, called Pathfinder, would turn the
company's magazines into an indispensable daily electronic
information guide.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was one of the things that America Online was
trying to be, and its chairman and chief executive, Stephen M.
Case, did not fail to take notice. In 1995, as Case's company
suddenly surged past its online rivals Prodigy and CompuServe, he
even discussed a joint venture with Pathfinder executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought Pathfinder was a good idea,'' Case recalled in an
interview last week. ``Thankfully, it was poorly executed. I
thought they had a great opportunity, but for them at the time the
Internet was a curious peripheral. For us, it was the be-all,
end-all.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of why Pathfinder ultimately failed _ alongside the
story of Case's unending focus _ goes a long way toward explaining
how it happened last week that the media world turned upside down.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement by America Online, known for dive-bombing the
nation with free diskettes of its software, to acquire Time Warner,
whose cartoon characters and magazines are some of the most
recognizable icons of popular culture, has been seen as a startling
triumph of the new media over the old. At $165 billion, it would be
the biggest merger ever.
</P>
<P>
   But on some grounds, the deal shouldn't have been all that
startling. A close look at Time Warner's history of earnest efforts
to harness the digital media business shows a predictable set of
obstacles, underscoring why virtually no traditional media brands
are central players in today's frothy Internet industry.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a longstanding commitment by Levin to digital
technology, Time Warner was stymied by corporate politics,
distracted by other, more profitable ventures and unrealistic about
how quickly it could harness the technology to suit its needs.
Moreover, it was focused on promoting its editorial and
entertainment products, while America Online pursued Case's belief
that connecting people was the Internet's most addictive
application.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's mixed experience in the digital realm also
explains how the company came to appreciate its own weaknesses and
see the benefits of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Asked last week why Time Warner, with all its resources and
reach, did not simply start its own online service, Ted Turner, the
company's vice chairman, said simply: ``It's not that easy to build
an AOL.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it may be simplistic to label the deal a triumph for
America Online. Case's eagerness to make an acquisition _ at a huge
premium _ that will surely slow the momentum of his company's stock
is an indication that he expects the formula of America Online's
success to change radically in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet becomes available over television, telephone and
particularly over high-speed networks, Case believes that content,
even more than community-building, will grow in importance. That is
where his company has stumbled in the past. And at $21.95 a month,
its main service faces new competition from several fast-growing
free Internet services. Case sees the need to diversify.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from one million to 20 million subscribers in the last
five years. That's great, but a billion people watch CNN,'' Case
said. ``We've gone from members spending an average of one hour a
week to one hour a day on the service _ but there are 23 other
hours in a day. This is the reality of how consumers live their
lives, and if we really want to have an impact, we have to paint on
the broadest possible canvas.''
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious benefit of the deal to America Online is that,
in buying Time Warner, it is acquiring the nation's second-largest
cable provider. Without guaranteed access to the cable modems that
will increasingly enable subscribers to surf the Internet at 50
times today's average speed, America Online could have been shut
out of a big chunk of what looks to be the lucrative future of
broadband service.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the two companies will be able to find other kinds
of synergies _ ways of serving up Time Warner's rich media brew to
America Online's loyal users _ may ultimately depend on how much
they have learned from their past successes and failures.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Steve Case and Gerald Levin were both ahead of
their time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Case, just out of college, took a job at Procter &AMP;
Gamble in large part because it was in Cincinnati, one of two
places in the country where interactive television was being
tested. But the neighborhood in which he chose to live did not have
access to the service, called Qube _ which happened to be provided
by a company, Warner Amex Cable, that was a venture of a
predecessor to Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   At a friend's house, his excitement dimmed as he repeatedly used
the service. Clunky interactive quiz shows somehow were not what he
had in mind. Instead, Case bought a computer, connected it to a
phone line and began exploring the early versions of online
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Levin's fascination with interactive television was not so
quickly put aside. As a rising star at Time Inc. in the early
1970s, Levin had built an early satellite network for the company's
HBO movie channel.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he became chief executive in 1992, Time had merged
with Warner Communications and its cable division had won a special
Emmy Award for entwining thick coaxial cable with slender fiber
optic strands so that cable subscribers could both send and receive
information.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That meant a lot of things, theoretically. It meant that you
could order a pizza through your cable system, pay your bills
through your cable system, shop through your cable system. But the
main thing it meant _ theoretically _ was what cable executives
came to call video on demand. The fantasy of having millions of
cable subscribers pay to summon up any movie they wanted, at any
time, blinded much of the industry to the lack, or exorbitant cost,
of the technology to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Many cable companies sponsored interactive television tests, but
none as lavish as the one Time Warner rolled out in Orlando, Fla.
After a small trial in New York City, Levin was so taken with the
idea that he authorized tens of millions of dollars to be spent on
proprietary equipment for the project, which was announced in
December 1994 to a gathering of 450 journalists from 10 countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1997, having garnered a total of 4,000
subscribers, Time Warner shut the network down, declaring it a
valuable trial for a system that could be extended nationally once
the technology became less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's plans to make such Jetsonian technology
available to its millions of cable subscribers were delayed as
upgrading its systems with fiber took longer than expected, and the
price of the complicated set-top boxes remained exorbitantly high.
</P>
<P>
   Attention then turned to the Internet as the source for
interactive activities. It is just now, as Time Warner prepares to
merge with an Internet company, that it has started to offer
interactive television in Honolulu and is on the cusp of being able
to provide it on a much wider scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had hoped it would happen faster for sure,'' said Jim
Chiddix, chief technical officer for Time Warner Cable. ``There was
a theory that interactive TV would have been the way this all
happened. In hindsight that wasn't realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Levin's conviction that his company needed to be
retrofitted for the digital age was growing only stronger. In 1994,
a month before the introduction of the Orlando project, he
announced Pathfinder, a Web site that allowed Internet users to
read articles of Time Inc. magazines including Time, Life and
Sports Illustrated. The idea was to make it the first Web portal, a
free competitor to services like America Online that would earn its
keep through advertising, magazine subscriptions and other
products.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, however, Pathfinder was criticized by insiders
and outsiders alike as chronically failing to live up to its
promise. Not only were the company's music and film divisions not
interested in taking part, but the magazines themselves didn't have
much incentive to contribute resources to a project that, at least
initially, showed no sign of generating any cash in return.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, who was busy buying cable franchises against the better
judgment of many investors _ in addition to overseeing the rest of
the Time Warner empire _ seemed to have neither the clout nor the
attention to carry out his vision. A year after Pathfinder's
introduction, it was famously dubbed a ``black hole'' by Time
Inc.'s executive editor, Don Logan, at a magazine conference.
</P>
<P>
   Several key executives left: Walter Isaacson, a Time editor who
lent the project credibility as its managing editor, fled back to
the print world as soon as he was offered the job of managing
editor at Time.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Sagan, once Time Inc.'s president of new media, is now
president of a high-profile Internet start-up called Akamai
Technologies, with a stake worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   James Kinsella, the founding managing editor of Pathfinder, who
is now president of MSNBC.com, recalls the frustration of trying to
get the company's disparate divisions to work together on a
centralized online service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all such a struggle,'' Kinsella said. ``You didn't have
a strong leader saying, `We're going to make this our core.' They
all wanted to have their own titles and own look and feel, so it
was clearly a hodgepodge of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In April last year, , after pouring more than $100 million into
Pathfinder with little to show for it, Time Warner announced it was
disbanding that service, too. In recent months, the individual
magazines have been fending for themselves on the Web, developing
advertising deals across both media in what Time Inc. executives
contend is likely to be a far more lucrative business model. The
online division of Warner Brothers, meanwhile, has developed a
well-received entertainment site called Entertaindom. What America
Online will do with all that has yet to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner executives say Pathfinder's costs were less than
those of many an Internet start-up, but they agree that the
corporate setting wasn't always an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never lost my zeal,'' Levin said in an interview last week.
``But Pathfinder never became the central focus of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   The slower pace of decision-making in a large company also
frustrated efforts by other Time Warner outposts to make money from
the Internet. One former manager at CNN recalled a plan three years
ago to create a search and directory portal like Yahoo, called
``Gotwo,'' for Time Warner Online. Despite support from Levin, the
plan went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sometimes felt on the team like we were preparing for one
of those G-7 summit meetings,'' said the former manager. ``You had
to go make your case to the publishing guys, the film guys, the
cable guys. You had to waste a lot of time. It ultimately got
studied to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nobody was more frustrated than Levin. Last summer, he
moved to impose his long-held views on the importance of digital
technology. He created a new division called Time Warner Digital
Media and appointed his chief financial officer, Richard Bressler,
to run it.
</P>
<P>
   In October, however, Levin received a phone call from Case. And
Levin attributes his receptiveness to his own long history of
digital experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not defensive about any of this,'' Levin said in an
interview last week. ``Every one of these experiences enhanced my
consciousness level about what the right thing to do is. It helped
me recognize why this merger made sense. You won't find too many
CEOs that would do it.''
</P>
<P>
   YOU might not find too many chief executives who would propose
such a merger, either. But Case's well-known single-mindedness may
be the key to America Online's unlikely success.
</P>
<P>
   While more-established competitors like CompuServe still doled
out e-mail addresses composed of long strings of digits, and
Prodigy offered neither e-mail nor online chat, America Online's
service was easy to navigate and encouraged interaction. ``We
believed the soul of the medium was people interacting with each
other,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet early on, Case learned the value of content, too. A contract
with Time magazine in 1993 helped legitimize AOL in the eyes of
traditional media companies, he said. With a sharp focus on the
consumer, as opposed to the technology, along with a heavy-duty
marketing campaign, the company began to add subscribers quickly.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of stumbles and recoveries along the way. From
1985, when Case helped form AOL's predecessor company, until about
1992, he developed almost no market for his service. But by the
mid-1990s, rather than competing with the Internet, America Online
simply incorporated it into its own offerings.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1996, America Online switched to a flat-rate pricing
plan, but failed to account for its popularity, resulting in
well-publicized busy signals for many customers. The company
apologized, then furiously added capacity.
</P>
<P>
   But America Online has never quite mastered the creation of its
own original content. AOL programming _ like Entertainment Asylum,
which Case now characterizes as ``just another entertainment site''
_ has not performed well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize it's hard; it requires a different kind of
culture,'' Case said. ``We were always better at building the
community brands that rely on people contributing content.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence the deal with Time Warner, Case said. But rather than
reviewing how his company came so far, he would rather spin a story
about the virtues of convergence among all forms of communication:
``I understand the need to talk about the past, but I'd rather talk
about the future.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Case may prefer to take the long view in part because the stock
market's more immediate response last week was less than
enthusiastic. Time Warner's share price soared after the merger was
announced on Monday, to a high of $102, but it closed at $83.25 on
Friday, $6.75 below Monday's close. Shares of America Online fell
more than 14 percent over the week.
</P>
<P>
   But the market also may have been reacting to the merger's
long-term risks. Whatever the two companies have learned from their
pasts, they will be confronting a new and shifting series of
obstacles in the future.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of a huge media conglomerate, Case will no longer
have a founder's unique power to rally troops around his message.
And as chief executive of an Internet company, Levin, will face for
the first time the brutal pace of change and expectations of rapid
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Other questions abound. If America Online's strength has been
its dogged pursuit of online subscribers, what happens when it
merges with a company that is so notoriously scattered?
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL has been built really on just one idea, making it easy for
people to get online,'' said John Battelle, publisher of The
Industry Standard, a technology trade publication. ``Time Warner is
a company with almost indecipherable conflicts of interest. It will
be interesting to see how AOL sorts out the priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   And if one of America Online's chief virtues has been ease of
use, what happens when consumer electronics manufacturers begin
marketing devices that make it far simpler to tap the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Internet was about bringing an appliance home, plug it
in, get on and go, that's a threat to the core of AOL,'' said Paul
Saffo, director of the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park,
Calif. ``They have this marvelous community of users, but one could
see the world changing where all those people are lured away in
other directions.''
</P>
<P>
   As the four executives on the AOL-Time Warner ``integration
team'' ordered in Chinese food to America Online's board room last
Wednesday evening, a range of other opinions asserted themselves on
new message boards that America Online had set up. ``Think maybe
now we can switch screen names faster?'' asked one user, referring
to online aliases. ``Big is not always better,'' wrote another,
while yet another said, ``Good only if monthly fee comes down.''
</P>
<P>
   Typing in www.pathfinder.com still brings users to the Time
magazine site. No message boards on the subject of the merger
appeared there last week, although those interested could vote in a
poll on whether or not it was good for the Internet.

WAL-MART CHIEF STEPS DOWN; LONGTIME AIDE STEPS UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Kan.)  (mk) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David D. Glass, who aggressively expanded Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
from a rural discounter into a worldwide powerhouse during his
12-year tenure as chief executive and president, announced Friday
that he would step down immediately. As expected, he will be
succeeded by his long-trusted lieutenant and chief operating
officer, H. Lee Scott Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Since Glass took the reins of Wal-Mart from Sam Walton in 1988,
the company's annual revenue is estimated to have expanded tenfold
to an expected $165 billion for the current fiscal year ending Jan.
31. Glass' biggest achievements include the retail chain's shift to
the supercenter format _ stores that sprawl as big as two football
fields and carry groceries and pharmaceuticals as well as general
merchandise _ and a substantial move into overseas markets,
including Argentina, Brazil, Germany and China.
</P>
<P>
   While Scott inherits perhaps one of the most efficient retail
companies, he has several serious challenges ahead. First of all,
it will be hard for him to maintain the extraordinary momentum of
18 percent annual sales growth as competitors overseas like the
French retailer Carrefour and domestic rivals like Safeway fight
back. He will also be responsible for helping Wal-Mart revive its
lagging Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   ``International growth and the Internet will keep him busy,''
said Scott Swanson, portfolio manager of Phoenix Engemann Growth
Fund, which owns about 5 million shares of the stock. ``He is going
to have a lot to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart did not say why Glass, 64, decided to retire now, but
said it was his decision. He will stay on for at least a year as
chairman of the executive committee of the board. While the timing
was a surprise, the eventual transition to Scott as chief executive
has been anticipated for more than a year. The company took pains
to paint the change in leadership as almost irrelevant because of a
dominant corporate culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no doubt that the same collaborative culture which has
always driven the success of our company and served our leaders so
well will also help make Lee Scott successful in his new role,'' S.
Robson Walton, Wal-Mart's chairman, said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers also emphasized what would stay the same at
the retailer instead of what would change. ``He won't do a thing
different,'' said Richard Church, an analyst with Salomon Smith
Barney, ``and investors should take comfort in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffery Feiner, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, concurred,
saying, ``This is a seamless transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, shares of Wal-Mart fell 62.5 cents Friday, to $64.50.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, 50, started with the company, which is based in
Bentonville, Ark., 20 years ago, as head of the trucking division.
Like many Wal-Mart executives, he came from a small-town,
state-college background. The son of a gas station owner, he grew
up in Baxter Springs, Kan., attended Pittsburg State University in
Kansas and married when he was 21.
</P>
<P>
   After joining the trucking division, he rose swiftly through the
ranks of the retailer's logistics department. He has held a wide
variety of positions at the company, including head of
merchandising and president and chief executive of the Wal-Mart
Stores division.
</P>
<P>
   While Scott will continue the growth strategy started by Glass,
there are some notable differences between the two leaders. For
starters, Scott is thought to be more of a people person than the
sometimes brusque Glass. ``He has that little extra charisma,''
said Brian James, a portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles &AMP; Co., which
owned 532,688 shares of Wal-Mart stock in September. ``He is a good
cheerleader, a good speaker and has leadership presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also say that Scott represents a new generation more
willing to tackle areas studiously avoided by the old guard. ``The
previous leadership had a Mao Tse-tung,
conquer-the-countryside-but-leave-the-cities-alone strategy,'' said
Burt Flickinger III, managing director of Reach Marketing, a retail
consulting firm that follows Wal-Mart. ``The current generation is
clearly moving to urban areas and into markets that are heavily
unionized.''
</P>
<P>
   Flickinger also predicted that under Glass the company would
focus on consumables and fashion. Wal-Mart's supercenters have been
criticized for their quality of produce and meat, especially in
foreign markets where standards for freshness are higher than in
America. The retailer has lagged behind competitors like Kmart and
Target in offering fashion to consumers.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all of the communications and media companies affected by
America Online's deal to acquire Time Warner, perhaps none will
feel the impact as deeply as AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The king of a stagnant industry _ the long-distance telephone
business _ AT&AMP;T has bet more than $100 billion of its shareholders'
money that the road to reinvigoration is paved with cable
television systems. Under C. Michael Armstrong, the company's
chairman since 1997, AT&AMP;T has acquired Tele-Communications Inc. and
agreed to buy MediaOne Group Inc. When the MediaOne takeover is
completed, AT&AMP;T will be the nation's biggest cable company.
</P>
<P>
   But it may no longer be the most important. A combined AOL Time
Warner would not only rival AT&AMP;T in cable television; it would also
be the biggest Internet company and would dwarf AT&AMP;T in other media
including movies and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   As the Bell local phone carriers move to eviscerate AT&AMP;T's core
long-distance business, AT&AMP;T badly needs to sign up cable companies
like AOL Time Warner to jointly offer phone service over cable
lines. A telephone deal AT&AMP;T had reached with Time Warner is on
hold until AT&AMP;T completes its MediaOne deal. AT&AMP;T, meanwhile, could
become a valuable partner in the distribution of America Online's
Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's cable systems do not compete directly with AT&AMP;T's,
and AT&AMP;T has been trying to form a partnership with America Online
at least since last summer.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Friday, Armstrong spoke by telephone from
Englewood, Colo., near AT&AMP;T's cable headquarters, about the broad
implications of the America Online-Time Warner agreement _ and
about what it means for his company. Following are excerpts from
the conversation: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's on your mind with all the news about the AOL-Time
Warner deal? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. First, I was delighted that it really confirms that broadband
is the future of communications, and in particular, that I think
cable has to be now declared the broadband preferred technology.
The largest transaction in American corporate history was a lot
about that. And I think as a result it's going to stimulate
boardroom thinking about new relationships between content and
distribution, including we and AOL-Time Warner. I think also,
finally, maybe it may _ and I'm out on a limb here _ it may begin
the reconciliation of the very disparate valuations that are in the
marketplace between what is a dot-com and what isn't a dot-com, as
all of us become Internet-enabled and -based. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you thinking of this new company mostly as a competitor,
as a potential partner or somewhere in the middle? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This was very positive for the relationship, not only between
Time Warner and AT&AMP;T but now, AOL and AT&AMP;T. My bottom line is that
I believe that there's more opportunity for communications and
strategic relationship because our core strengths today now
complement each other much more than they did before. They are more
content-centric, we are communication-centric. But we both carry a
common purpose. We both seek ubiquity in reach and in devices. And
the one arena that we share, I think, a strength by working
together, is in the interactive TV area, which I think is going to
really help this whole digital revolution come to maturity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Specifically, what are some of the ways in which we might
anticipate some sort of cooperation? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think our ability to help them reach a large population of
consumers and commerce, through our infrastructure, is something
that they should be interested in, and I think they are. And surely
we have interests in using their infrastructure for our
communication-centricity to do the same, to reach an
ever-increasing number of consumers and commercial enterprises. So
we ought to be sitting down _ and I believe we will _ and expand
upon just the negotiation we were having with Time Warner to now
include a wholly new, a newly aligned AOL. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. At their news conference on Monday, Gerald Levin, the
chairman of Time Warner, and Steve Case, America Online's chairman,
said they had called you first thing that morning. Why do you think
they made that public, and what did they have to say? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, first, I think they made that public because they, too,
believed that the relationship that was developing with Time Warner
_ and it was a very sound as well as friendly relationship and we
were in discussions _ was obviously now going to be redefined. And
I don't think anybody would have suggested that AOL and AT&AMP;T, at
least publicly, were getting on that well. It was more adversarial.
And so Steve Case in particular wanted me to know that we now had
much more alignment. We now had much more common interest, and that
he very much looked forward, along with Jerry, to coming to some
communications and strategic relationships with AT&AMP;T. Finally, they
wanted to let me know that even though there were a lot of things
that were going on, they would make the time to have these
negotiations so that this would not in any way impede our
schedule. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Would it be logical to think about a potential arrangement
going forward being basically an exchange in which you agree to
carry America Online on your systems, in return for which you help
them offer telephone or some other service? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, I absolutely think that carriage of AOL would be
something that we would be interested in. As well, I hope they're
interested in having us be the communications provider in their
infrastructure. I will at this time point out that we will honor
our contracts with (the Internet access service) Excite(at)Home,
though, and we will exclusively, until 2002, carry Excite(at)Home
on the very high-speed, broadband systems that we currently have.
But there are several other opportunities that are before us to do
things now, and we will be exploring those with them. We're putting
in fixed wireless systems that in the next 24 to 36 months will
pass 10 million homes. We are from the get-go opening that for
multiple Internet service providers, and that should be very
attractive. And so it's not that we have to wait for 2002 to do
some really interesting things. We can begin to do things together
that are interesting starting this year, though we will continue to
work with Excite(at)Home. &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How does AT&AMP;T respond most broadly to this new being? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Take advantage of it. Of course, the content production of
all the studio operations and publication operations of Time Warner
are world-class. They now are available over our infrastructure and
in turn we would hope to be the communications infrastructure that
they might implement to their customers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You mentioned the content side. You and your team have been
quite explicit about how you do not want to be a content company
per se. Does it make sense generally for a traditional source of
content to be linked with the distribution mechanism, as they are
with America Online-Time Warner, or does it make more sense not to
have that integration, the way you've chosen? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm a great believer in focus. I'm a great believer in
leading from strength. I want us to be the best communications
company in the world, and that definition includes the applications
associated with communications, content associated with
communications, like e-mail. I have to believe that Jerry Levin and
Steve Case wish to be the best originator of content, aggregator of
content. Will there be some overlap in the two definitions? I bet
there will be. Will there be any model that is the only model that
works in the marketplace that is as complex and big and exciting
and changing as fast as it is? I don't predict that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Obviously, the vast majority of your revenue still comes from
the long-distance telephone business, a business that is under some
pressure. Explain how valuable that asset is and the extent to
which it is simply a burden. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The long-distance business is not a growth business. And it
is a blessing because it is a cash machine. The long-distance
business is a commodity, and our strategy with our investments is
to decommoditize voice. And by making voice a part of a greater
communications value that customers, both consumer and commercial,
can buy, we believe we both enrich the voice application by
integrating it with those other applications, and we permit it to
continue to contribute. So voice is not dead. It's just that voice
by itself doesn't have the value to really sustain itself as a
stand-alone business. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Time Warner's media businesses _ magazines, movie studios,
books, music _ aren't growing that quickly. AT&AMP;T's historic core
business _ long-distance telephone service _ is not growing and
parts are shrinking. Which of those legacy businesses would you
rather build on? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I happen to think cash has value. I know that it's not
``in'' these days. But I believe that in the end, cash will be
king. The AT&AMP;T company next year will generate 24 to 26 billion
dollars of Ebitda, basically cash flow. That's more cash flow than
any other nonfinancial institution in America. I believe that has
terrific value, and of course the value of cash is that it can be
deployed for growth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Delivering a Bundle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has not moved into the cable TV business to sell just cable
television. The idea is to provide a basket of futuristic
interactive television, local phone service and high-speed Internet
access over the same cable pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   But ideas and reality do not always coincide. AT&AMP;T has spent a
lot of money on its plans, but hardly any of its millions of
customers have yet entered AT&AMP;T's digital vision. Armstrong says
2000 is the year that AT&AMP;T will finally deliver. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. This integrated world of voice, video and data in an
integrated platform is something that we've been hearing about for
quite some time. Where are we in terms of making that a reality? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This is not the World's Fair for 2005, and it's not something
that's just happening now. It's happened. We have pilots now in 16
cities and we now have close to 8,000 to 10,000 subscribers for our
telephone service. In the fourth quarter we will roll out with
Microsoft and other vendors an interactive television pilot in
several cities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When will local telephony over your cable infrastructure and
these new sorts of interactive television be broadly available in
your markets? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. By the end of the year we will have 400,000 to 500,000
telephony subscribers on our cable infrastructure. And then as we
go into 2001, that will go to the millions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. It's been a year and a half since you agreed to acquire
Tele-Communications Inc. and we haven't seen any telephony deals
with other cable providers. Is there a problem here? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Obviously, negotiating these deals, we were more optimistic
in suggesting the time frame. I think you'll see several in the
next several months because we've come that far and they're in that
stage. But it would be premature for me to say ``by this date, this
company.'' I just don't want to get caught in that again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turnabout Is Fair Play &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, AT&AMP;T and America Online have battled about
whether the government should make cable companies open their
systems to outside Internet providers. In hearing rooms, op-ed
articles and interviews with journalists, AT&AMP;T has said no; America
Online has said yes.
</P>
<P>
   But now, America Online appears to have changed its tune. While
America Online and Time Warner said they intended to open the
combined company's systems, they appear to have joined AT&AMP;T in
arguing that the free market will eliminate the need for new
regulation about what is variously called ``open access'' and
``forced access.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. America Online seems to have had a change of heart in terms
of the need for government regulation of the Internet on cable
systems. Were you surprised at that? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I was surprised at the AOL acquisition of Time Warner. But
given that, I was not surprised at the change of heart because they
now are us. We're the No. 1 cable company and they're the No. 2
cable company. I think we together now will kill this whole issue
of forced access, because we both have the same interests. We both
want ubiquity. We want to go anywhere, and thus we want everyone to
come with us, because if everyone comes with us we'll make the most
money. I think one of the very positive things from this merger is
that the whole issue will now go away because both of us will have
common interests and be pursuing multiple providers on our
network. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How does this private-market, open-access structure operate? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Take fixed wireless, because it's a real live example of
commercial terms. We are in the Dallas-Fort Worth area next month
expanding our pilot footprint, so we'll cover thousands and
thousands of homes with fixed wireless. And that capability can
carry not only the four telephone lines but a one-megabit
online-all-the-time data line. We are currently in negotiations
with several ISPs. So we might show, for example, five, six
different ISPs that a consumer could simply click and subscribe
to. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In terms of the commercially negotiated terms, though, there
is a huge asymmetry in simple market power between an AT&AMP;T on the
one hand and most ISPs on the other. How can an ISP really think it
can get a fair shake from AT&AMP;T? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We are motivated by self-interest and greed just like they
are. And so if I go down to, I don't know, Austin _ and I'm making
this up _ and there's a UniversityofTexasnet.com ISP that really
has captured a good part of that market, and I really wish to sell
as much of my data services over this infrastructure as I can, then
having that very popular ISP on my infrastructure is the way that I
can gain new subscribers. I don't find it asymmetrical at all. And
the terms and conditions are something that we would mutually
negotiate. I need to make a return on my investment for the
infrastructure as well as a profit. And they're going to want to be
able to make a return, whether it's from advertising or e-commerce
or transactions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fair Market Value &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next year, a combined America Online-Time Warner is expected to
have about $40 billion in revenue. AT&AMP;T's sales will probably top
$55 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, America Online and Time Warner's combined market
value Friday was about 40 percent higher than AT&AMP;T's _ roughly $245
billion, compared with $175 billion. For all of the vigor of
Armstrong's plans, the company's stock has not quite responded. On
Friday, AT&AMP;T's shares closed at $54.6875, 6.25 cents lower than
their closing price on Jan. 14, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has not hidden his frustration at the stock's
lethargy. Now, AT&AMP;T has plans to issue a separately traded stock to
track its fast-growing wireless business. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Side by side, as a stock, which company, AT&AMP;T or AOL Time
Warner, should be more valuable? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I think there's going to be a convergence here. The
market today has been operating with disparate valuations, which is
a statement of the obvious. Dot-com companies have incredible
multiples that one can't even begin to apply to more traditional
companies. AOL built a huge market capitalization based upon the
Internet portal-type valuations the market was willing to afford
it. And it went out and bought what I would call a traditional
content company, a very strong and a very high-quality company. But
its market valuation was predicated on a much different set of
metrics. Now that they're one, the AOL Internet-space kind of
metrics are not going to prevail. And in fact the AOL growth rate,
which was 30 to 40 percent in the combined company, I heard them
announce, is now going to be 12 to 14 percent. Well, that's not far
off of AT&AMP;T's growth rate. Next year we're going to grow 8 to 9
percent. And if you looked at our business minus the consumer
business, we'd be probably growing at the same rate they are. And
so this may be the beginning of reality in terms of the convergence
of the disparate values. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you have to do to persuade investors to enhance your
valuation on that basis? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the very first thing is that we need to continue to
make the commitments and execute to the potential we've defined,
both financially and operationally. The second thing is, we roll
out our wireless tracker. One, it's operationally ready for public
investment. Two, we need a currency that is defined in the
multiples that the industry is participating in so that the company
can participate in industry consolidation _ read that acquisitions
and investment. And we anticipate that the new valuation of the
tracker and a new valuation of the remaining AT&AMP;T is going to add
up to a new market capitalization. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You mentioned acquisitions and investment. What sorts of
deals do you think make sense going forward, not only for AT&AMP;T but
also for the industry? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We have some investments that have not realized the potential
that we think they have. Take Worldnet, take Web site hosting, take
Excite, as three. We believe that there's a lot of potential with
those businesses through additional investment, through new
relationships with others, so we really can create a much higher
level of growth and a much bigger critical mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where the Action Is &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong spent the first three decades of his career at IBM In
1992, when it became clear that he would not get the chairman's job
there, he jumped to General Motors' Hughes Electronics unit.
</P>
<P>
   He helped turned Hughes around, pushing it into satellite
television with its DirecTV service. But his challenge is even
greater at AT&AMP;T. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. If you had to go run one other company right now, what would
it be? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, let's see. I think that either Excite or Yahoo has got
to be a lot of fun to be in and a part of today because they are
moving so fast and doing so much and redefining themselves every
day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I know you're having fun now. But it doesn't get any easier,
does it? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. No. This is tough. And I say this is tough, not to, in fact,
suggest that the other people's jobs and other industries aren't
just as tough. The faster leadership has to manage change, to
convert attitudes and cultures, to realize the potential of
investments, to redefine markets, to retrain and retool people and
assets _ when that pace accelerates, the test of leadership is more
demanding. And that makes it increasingly tougher. I figure these
jobs maybe have, going forward, the life of an NFL halfback.

<P>
   BOSTON _ Coatless in air so frigid that each warm word condensed
into a white cloudlet as it left his mouth, Cornel West preached
before a Faneuil Hall Marketplace crowd of several hundred,
pounding on syncopated syllables:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the word go forth from this historic place here and now
that Bill Bradley is on the  &UR; move &LR; , he is on the  &UR; move &LR; ! And that
we are there  &UR; with &LR;  him, be &UR; side &LR;  him, a &UR; round &LR;  him, because we are
fundamentally dedicated to keeping alive the best of the democratic
tradition, and Bill Bradley  &UR; is &LR;  the president who best em &UR; bodies &LR; 
that, he en &UR; acts &LR;  that, he in fact provides the presidential
 &UR; gra &LR; vitas necessary to take this nation into the 21st century! Let
me say that again: presidential  &UR; gra &LR; vitas!''
</P>
<P>
   West's usual gig is more veritas than gravitas. He is a
professor in the Afro-American studies department at Harvard,
considered by many to be the most prodigious brain trust of black
intellectuals in the country, home to Henry Louis Gates Jr., its
chairman, and William Julius Wilson, a leading sociologist, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   But in this campaign season of two wonky and highly
race-conscious Democrats, such desirable African-American scholars
get quickly booked up. Gates, a literary and cultural critic, has
agreed to help Vice President Al Gore on issues of race and
education. Wilson, an expert on poverty, has just signed on to
advise the Bradley campaign. And West, in a more active campaign
role than those of his colleagues, is traveling the trail off and
on at his own expense, to shout from the rooftops that he loves
Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Those differing allegiances stem in large part from long
friendships, West's with the Bradleys and Gates' with the Gores.
But both professors say they also mirror a central difference in
approach between the candidates: Gore's emphasis on the pragmatic
versus Bradley's on the ideal. The candidates themselves have been
hammering each other on that very difference in recent days, with
Gore chiding Bradley that the presidency is no mere academic
exercise, and Bradley chiding Gore that real leaders must be bold
and not just ``nibble around the edges.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Harvard ebony tower, it is West, a self-described
``democratic socialist'' and ``radical democrat'' who champions
social justice in his work, who emphasizes the public policy ideal,
while Gates _ who describes himself as well left of center, just
not as far left as West _ is the pragmatist.
</P>
<P>
   West, said Gates, ``articulates ideals to which every society
should aspire, and I admire that; I, on the other hand, am much
more pragmatic. I see my job as trying to implement what is
practical in that idealistic program, and in a way, that's one of
the differences between Bradley and Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gates said, he loves the idea of universal health
care coverage, but deems it unlikely that Bradley's proposal for
universal care could be implemented now. So the question becomes,
``in the meantime, how do we begin to move toward that, and I see
Gore's program as more pragmatic.''
</P>
<P>
   West, when he discusses his support for Bradley, mentions the
candidate's positions on poverty and race and health care. But _
staying unusually on message for an eclectic thinker who slides
easily from Chekhov to Coltrane to Nietzsche _ he almost always
focuses on Bradley's personal qualities, and on describing a
friendship that transcends politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really is my brother,'' West said. ``And this is hard to
convey to the public because they think it's about public policy,
they think it's about our concerns about race and racism, but most
fundamentally, he's my brother and I'm his brother and we relate to
each other soul to soul, and it has to do with the kind of person
he is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's true,'' West said, ``that I support his efforts to
talk about child poverty, I support his efforts to come to terms
with health care. But it's much more the kind of person he is in
terms of integrity, in terms of his dignity, in terms of his mind
and soul, and that's what friendship is. In that regard, it cuts so
much deeper than is often conveyed.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   What has sometimes been conveyed in campaign commentaries is
that West is an odd, unusually radical, unusually ideological
bedfellow for a mainstream candidate. Shelby Steele, a scholar of
race relations at the Hoover Institution, predicts that West's
visibility could alienate some centrist voters, as could his
association with the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not figures that are attractive to the political
center,'' Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   But the prevailing view among several political scientists
interviewed was that such alienation was highly unlikely because
most people were not familiar enough with West's views on, say,
redistribution of wealth, to take umbrage. The bigger question,
they said, was whether West's support could make a difference for
Bradley, particularly with a black population that generally leans
toward Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``People take their cues essentially from political leaders and
not from academics,'' said John Walters, a University of Maryland
political scientist. In the critical campaign territory of the
South in particular, where West has offered to tour with Bradley,
``what moves that vote is the political infrastructure,'' and the
Gore campaign has a solid grip on it, Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at the University of
New Orleans, disagreed, saying that he thought West could help by
drawing large crowds in cities like Atlanta, New Orleans and
Memphis, Tenn. ``He's very, very popular as a public
intellectual,'' Brinkley said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., when asked how West and Gates might
affect the Democratic race, said he had not even been aware of
their endorsements, ``so I think that's a statement by itself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever talents they have,'' he said, ``would be best
realized in terms of the advice they give rather than the fact they
are well known.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   If West does fail to influence the vote, it will not be for lack
of dedication. Fresh out of the hospital after being treated for
kidney stones, and still using a cane, he appeared at a New
Hampshire debate last month, relegated to the press room, where he
stood out for his finely tailored suit, the trademark Afro that
seems like just about the last in America, and his failure to
snatch at the food set out for the reporters. He was not spinning,
merely watching, and had come to show Bradley his support through
his presence, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he was at another New Hampshire debate, escorting
Bradley's wife, Ernestine. On the way back to Boston in a
limousine, he said that Bradley had just taken him up on his offer
to accompany him to Iowa, then he fell silent as he computed
complex logistics. Like Gates, West is something of a one-man
academic industry, constantly on the move from speech to project to
class to book.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bradley calls West his campaign friend rather than adviser, one
who ``is supportive in any way he can possibly be supportive.
Sometimes that's being supportive of me personally, sometimes
that's going out with me speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   They may disagree on some issues and West may be more radical,
Bradley said, but ``friendship is much deeper than any position on
any issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The friendship has had a decade to deepen. It began, West said,
when Bradley recruited a small, informal circle of professors to
gather every few months at one of their homes and hash out aspects
of American history, politics and society, reading everything from
Langston Hughes to William Jennings Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to do with, how do we ensure a high-quality democracy
in the 21st century,'' West said. ``We were dealing with the
prospects of the American republic in light of past and present.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates said he could see the effects of West's influence every
time Bradley talked about race.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact,'' Gates said, ``I cannot think of a presidential
candidate whose policies have been more directly influenced by a
black philosophical thinker than Bill Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   For all those signs of influence, however, West took pains to
emphasize that Bradley listens, but then decides for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley is like a jazz musician who knows who he is and can
therefore put forward his distinctive visionary voice,'' West said.
``Whereas Gore, in a way, is like a pop star in search of who he
is, and so he's got to go to pollsters and spinsters to find out
what his voice is.''
</P>
<P>
   West said he and Bradley often discussed ``working with
yourself, criticizing yourself so that you have a stronger self
against all the forces of conformity and seduction.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The split between Gates, whose nickname is Skip, and West does
not mar their own close friendship, both men said. West, however,
did not hide his glee that Wilson's support for Bradley made the
department count ``two-to-one against brother Skip!''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One thing Gates and West say they share this campaign season:
lack of interest in cabinet jobs. Gates said that while he would be
happy to help Gore on speeches or policies in the campaign, and he
has recused himself from writing about the Democratic candidates
for The New Yorker, where he is a staff writer, in order to help,
he wants to remain at Harvard. ``Why leave heaven?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   As for West, if Bradley wins, he said, ``I will be his loving
and friendly critic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The love will still be there no matter what,'' he said, ``but
then I'll just make sure that my brother remains true to his
issues.''

COMMENTARY: TWO 21ST CENTURY FOXES ELOPE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ CEO of the United States may be a big job, but the
White House, like everything else, looks smaller this week next to
the new AOL Time Warner. The most mega mega-merger in history
reduced the imminent presidential primaries to quaint sideshows,
relics of a distant age flickering along the fringes of the evening
news. Press and public alike instinctively recognized that the
first (though hardly the last) consummated marriage between new
media and old is going to shape our lives long after we've
forgotten which politician had which health or tax-cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement and trepidation generated by this deal is in part
about money and Wall Street valuations, sure. But its lasting
effect lies in the sheer velocity and impact of seismic cultural
change. The unofficial precursor of AOL Time Warner synergy, the
movie ``You've Got Mail,'' came out just a year ago and has already
been outrun by Internet time. In that picture, the big chain
bookstores were driving the little independents out of business.
But now _ according to a new Andersen Consulting survey buried
under Monday's avalanche of merger news _ those big bookstores are
themselves being routed by the Net. This Christmas Americans
purchased more (far more) books online than at stores _ even though
less than half of the country is online and most of us who are have
slow connections.
</P>
<P>
   The AOL Time Warner deal accelerates the arrival of an
inevitable future by ratifying it with big clout and bucks. When
the world's largest purveyor of movies, music, journalism, books
and cable puts all its chips on the Internet, that's a virtual Mall
of America. (Conspicuous non-players in this mother of 21st-century
media combinations: a newspaper or major broadcast network.) In
increments within the next decade _ the loose time frame estimated
by AOL's Steve Case and Time Warner's Gerald Levin, with whom I had
separate conversations on Thursday _ everything we watch, read and
listen to will be as speedily accessible on the Internet as e-mail
is now. Which is not to say it will be free.
</P>
<P>
   A Wall Street Journal headline announces ``the death of old
media''; Wired.com has spotted ``a music industry death knell'' and
``the end of TV as we know it''; in a December speech at the
Columbia Journalism School, Dan Okrent of Time Inc. declared ``the
death of print.'' I don't disagree, in the sense that the old media
will all be put in new electronic bottles. I can't say I'm upset.
For all the unknowns _ indeed, because of them _ this is a gripping
transitional moment in history. Besides, some of the antique forms
will continue to survive alongside the digital _ and, as Okrent
observed, even books printed on paper will still be sold to an
aging nostalgic elite. But most information and culture we consume
will be available both in greater variety and in handier, more
portable and cheaper packages than we have now.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics say it can't be so. Don Imus spoke for many this week
when he said that a citizenry that still can't program a VCR will
never figure out how to download movies or navigate the Web's
infinity of offerings. That's where AOL comes in. It has long been
derided in Silicon Valley as the Internet on ``training wheels,''
but that was and is Case's big marketing idea. A country that can't
be bothered to program a VCR wants an Internet on training wheels.
That means a pre-selected, Reader's Digest distillation of the
Internet that's ultimately not in a PC and doesn't require you to
know what a disk drive, a browser or an operating system is, let
alone how to use one. It's an Internet that will be reached through
a ubiquitous device (``AOL Anywhere'') that looks like (and is as
simple to work as) a phone or TV. AOL TV will be introduced later
this year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The other things we like in an appliance besides ease of use are
convenience and speed. We bridle at rewinding videocassettes or
returning our rentals to Blockbuster. It's a pain to search for TV
Guide, or fish out the newspaper's sports section or stock tables,
or the L.L. Bean catalogue, once we're settled into the couch with
clicker in hand and all that unruly paper is in the next room.
Media giants will pander to our laziness by giving us the whole
menu on demand, instantly, no geek expertise required, through
broadband connections such as those Time Warner's cable now adds to
AOL. They'll try to keep us glued, lest we wander into the wider
Internet in search of competing goods, services and information.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone will need or want to shop at the virtual mall, but
few corporations have gone broke so far overestimating the appeal
of instant gratification to the American consumer. We are already
adopting DVD players faster than we initially did VCRs _ even
though home DVD players don't yet record _ not just because the
picture is better but because you can fast-forward or rewind in a
click. Once people discover instant digital time, they're suddenly
too impatient to tolerate even a few extra seconds required by
analog.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't guarantee that AOL Time Warner will succeed. Vision
is one thing, execution another. AOL has a history of access and
privacy meltdowns, Time Warner of money-hemorrhaging Web sites and
lumbering cable TV service. The corporate cultures could clash,
too: Case has never watched the most dazzling gem in the mountain
of content he just bought, ``The Sopranos.'' Fierce, perhaps more
nimble competitors will arrive soon, maybe siphoning off AOL Time
Warner brains when they do. Predicting winners in show business is
a fool's errand.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL Time Warner does have a head start and some corporate
DNA on its side. Levin stubbornly championed cable while Wall
Street predicted its (and his) doom. Two other executives on stage
at Monday's baptism were among the first to figure out, some 20
years ago, that the broadcast market could be fragmented into
lucrative, narrow niches: Ted Turner, who saw a global audience for
nonstop TV news, and Bob Pittman, who was present at the creation
of the first 24-hour movie channel as well as MTV. Theirs was a
digital sensibility before digital was cool _ home computers were
just coming on the market _ and you could argue that MTV in
particular, with its quick cuts and demolition of linear narrative,
was a harbinger of the aesthetic of Web surfing. Certainly the Web
is in part a zillion channels as specialized and idiosyncratic as
those of Turner's and Pittman's early wild dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the troubling part of the story. If you
believe that the Internet is the greatest explosion of free
expression and cultural resources of the past century, what happens
when it is merchandised as a mass-market product by the biggest
corporations in history?
</P>
<P>
   In theory and so far practice, the Web is limitless, too
powerful and diverse to be tamed or homogenized by any company, no
matter how huge. Some kid out there may already have a new idea
that will upend AOL Time Warner as Case did Bill Gates on the Net.
But should the new AOL or its coming rivals squelch that kid, who
will blow the whistle?
</P>
<P>
   At this point, almost every journalist in America works for at
least one media octopus. (Me? I'm an author at Random House, owned
by Bertelsmann, AOLs partner in Europe and Australia.) Even the
theoretically pure PBS now has a journalistic conflict of interest:
its broad new ``strategic alliance'' with AOL just happened to be
announced the day of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the specter of Big Brother. ``No country in the
history of the world has had this much information about people
before,'' in the words of the media critic Jon Katz.
Public-interest groups also worry that AOL Time Warner and its kin
will run their fast Internet wires like private toll roads, banning
other Internet providers or diverting them to slow and bumpy
traffic lanes. Case says trust him: if he and his peers fail to
guarantee an open Internet or to protect us from ``the nightmare of
an Orwellian world,'' then ``the backup is government
intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   He also allows that ``the devil is in the details,'' and ``it's
fair for people to say `Prove it' _ and that's what we will do over
the coming months.'' Levin echoes him, as well as vowing
independence for his journalists and artists.
</P>
<P>
   We may be on our own as we seek verification. Even as the
country was debating the vast implications of AOL Time Warner, the
otherwise loquacious current president and his would-be successors
have been all but mum on the subject. That's why it's in the
self-interest of those who haven't yet ventured into cyberspace to
stop procrastinating. You'll have no choice but to go there soon
enough, and on this frontier as on our last, more is up for grabs
now than after the barons lay down the rails.

AGREEMENT IS SIGNED ON RETURN OF 84,000 ACRES TO UTE INDIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOAB, Utah _ As good fortune for Utah, it might not equal Salt
Lake City's winning the right to stage the 2002 winter Olympics,
but it seemed it was not far off.
</P>
<P>
   In a whirlwind tour that began on a Ute Indian reservation in
Fort Duchesne and ended here along the Colorado River, Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson announced two major initiatives Friday
that addressed longstanding land issues in the state.
</P>
<P>
   First, he signed an agreement to return 84,000 acres that the
federal government took from the Utes 84 years ago for the land's
oil shale reserves. Later, he flew here to announce that the
federal government was preparing to remove 10.6 tons of uranium
waste from an abandoned mine site. The uranium is polluting the
Colorado River and ground water.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds cheered heartily at both announcements, a sign that
President Clinton's hoped-for environmental legacy might gain
traction in this most-Republican state.
</P>
<P>
   But residual benefits of both initiatives may be a long way off.
Congressional action is required on each, meaning it could be
several years before the Utes realize any profits from mining on
their land and even longer before the first load of contaminated
dirt is trucked away.
</P>
<P>
   The Utes lost land adjoining their 4.5 million-acre reservation
in 1916, when the federal government sought fuel reserves for its
naval fleet. No mining ever took place. But Energy Department
officials say the land could generate a fortune from gas reserves
for a tribe that suffers enormous poverty and high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't done any real evaluation yet,'' O. Roland McCook, a
tribe official, said after he and Richardson signed papers to begin
the process of transferring the land. ``We're going to do it as
soon as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement that links the two initiatives, the
Utes will contribute 8.5 percent of any mining royalties to the
uranium cleanup, with the federal government paying for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   But several hurdles remain, including the transfer of authority
over the site from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to the Energy
Department. Then, Congress has to set aside money for the cleanup.

SOME HARSH WORDS ON VODAFONE'S BID 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUESSELDORF, Germany _ Facing an uphill fight to ward off the
biggest hostile takeover in history, the chairman of Mannesmann AG
sought to fortify his defense against Vodafone AirTouch PLC Friday
with both sweet talk and intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best response of shareholders is to do nothing at all,''
said Klaus Esser, the chairman of Mannesmann. ``They don't need to
fill out any forms. Offers not accepted are simply for the
wastepaper basket.''
</P>
<P>
   And as a sweetener for shareholders, Esser announced that
Mannesmann was likely to take its Internet business public, a move
that could help the parent company benefit from the astronomical
valuations on Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Less than four weeks remain before Mannesmann shareholders must
decide on Vodafone's offer of more than $140 billion, about 263
euros a share at current prices. But despite his defiant stance,
Esser is under increasing pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, several investment advisers have strongly
recommended that Mannesmann shareholders accept Vodafone's offer.
Mannesmann's stock rose 8 percent Friday, to 259.25 euros. The
stock has risen 81 percent since reports emerged in late October
that Vodafone was considering a hostile bid.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, issuing Mannesmann's formal response to Vodafone's bid,
Esser reiterated his longstanding argument that Vodafone would
merely slow Mannesmann's own growth.
</P>
<P>
   He belittled Vodafone as a ``setting sun'' and said its global
strategy was based largely on properties in ``Fiji, New Zealand and
Uganda.'' He also warned that Vodafone would need to get full
control of the company to carry out its plans, and that it would
need to pay huge sums of cash to settle with a minority of
shareholders who refuse to agree.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann, based here, is currently the biggest single operator
of wireless telephone networks in Europe. Vodafone owns Britain's
second-largest mobile telephone network and holds minority stakes
in wireless networks across Europe, Asia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It is still too early to say which side will prove most
persuasive with shareholders. But in contrast to many other German
companies, which are often shielded from takeovers because large
blocks of shares are in the hands of friendly partners,
Mannesmann's stock is distributed very widely and more than 60
percent is owned outside of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises hundreds of
U.S. institutional investors, came out strongly in favor of
Vodafone's offer earlier this week. The advisory firm, based in
Rockville, Md., said that the combination of Vodafone and
Mannesmann would create Europe's dominant wireless carrier and that
Vodafone's offer, at current stock prices, represented a premium of
71 percent of Mannesmann's share price last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers endorsed the Vodafone bid even more strongly in
a 65-page report on Jan. 4. Jo Oliver, Lehman Brothers'
telecommunications analyst, acknowledged that Mannesmann's real
value is actually about 350 euros a share, far higher than
Vodafone's current bid.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He also agreed with Esser's assertion that Mannesmann was
growing faster than Vodafone and that a merged company would grow
slightly more slowly than Mannesmann by itself.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he contended that Vodafone's offer gave Mannesmann
a generous premium over its stock price before the takeover battle
began. And he said that the two companies would immediately create
the world's leading wireless operator and would ultimately be worth
more than if they remained separate.
</P>
<P>
   Also, ABN Amro, the big Dutch bank, issued a third ringing
endorsement of a merger on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Both Esser and Vodafone's chief executive, Chris Gent are
barnstorming for shareholder support. The deadline for Vodafone's
offer is Feb. 7.

SPORTS COLUMN: ANOTHER PLAYER GOING ONE - ON - ONE WITH A PORSCHE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ As the hymn music ushered in the mourners, a
restless 3-year-old boy in the first row of pews noticed the bright
orange bouquet arranged in the shape of a basketball.
</P>
<P>
   He slipped from the hands of a family member like a soap bar and
skipped toward the flowers resting at the front of the church. A
trailing relative lifted him up, allowed him to touch the
candy-colored flower petals and put him down. He then turned and
pointed to the peaceful, strong figure resting in the casket, and
said, ``Daddy ... Daddy,'' as if waiting for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Trey Phills could not comprehend the moment. No one could as the
grieving searched the church rafters for answers, inspiration and
even a little humor during a memorial for Hornets guard Bobby
Phills that elicited the raw emotions of a revival. Beneath the
shouts of ``Amen,'' scattered throughout the service, only one
person had more answers than the rest.
</P>
<P>
   There stood the distraught David Wesley. With his head tilted
down, he was the last Hornet to slip through the side door at the
Central Church of God and find his seat in the roped off section of
pews. Only Wesley knows how the final moments to Phills' life
began. Only Wesley knows what led him and his best friend to engage
their two Porsches in what the police say was a drag race that
ended with Phills' losing control of his car while streaking up a
busy, cresting curve on Tyvola Road.
</P>
<P>
   Was it as simple as, ``Race you to the light?''
</P>
<P>
   As Wesley took a deep breath, gathered his emotions and spoke at
the service Friday, he didn't allude to the instant Phills died.
But there were clues as to what might have provoked the tragedy
that unfolded Wednesday as the two self-described mischief-makers
left the Hornets' shoot-around and continued a little one-on-one on
the highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I can say, but he was my partner in crime,''
Wesley said as his voice trailed off. ``He always had to win. And
whatever he didn't do well, he'd talk enough trash to make you
think he could.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd laughed at the moment of levity. It seemed everyone in
the church knew this side of Phills. His wife, Kendall, talked
about how her husband competed ``whether it was golf, basketball,
bowling, dominoes, cards, bike riding or even a little black jack;
Bobby was playing to win. He had to make everyone know that it was
his high score on the arcade game in our game room at home.''
</P>
<P>
   But this mentality doesn't make Phills any different from other
athletes. It makes him exactly the same as all of the others who
are addicted to kind of adrenaline that ribbons its way through the
body and creates a high they seek in every facet of their life.
</P>
<P>
   Phills was bright, well-educated, well-spoken and introspective.
He also purchased a Porsche that had a top speed of 171 miles per
hour. And he foolishly pushed it to a reported speed of more than
75 miles per hour in a 45 zone without pondering the consequences
to himself or someone else.
</P>
<P>
   It's a teen-ager's mentality. Phills was 30, but he was also
part of a sports culture that retards a player's ability to grow
into an adult. The team plane, the team bus and the team locker
room, the atmosphere around each is only a half step above the
frat-house level. It's rips, jabs, put-downs and card games. Who's
got the best girl, the nicest stereo and the finest car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby had a passion for exotic cars, trucks, boats and his
black, little convertible Turbo 911 Porsche,'' Kendall Phills said
as she expressed her husband's zest for the good things in life.
``He had to make all of our cars distinct from all the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   The money only makes the addiction to adrenaline a greater
danger. The faster the car, the harder it is to resist the
temptation to push the limits. The more time on their hands, the
more room for error. Most players work four or five hours a day,
including hours in the gym and a practice session. The time lapse
in between creates boredom, and idle time breeds a window for
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   What else did Wesley and Phills have to do after practice on
Wednesday? Racing was just an outlet for their energy. Yet, it's
only natural for an athlete as aggressive as Phills to look for
ways to channel his intensity off the court. He pushed it every
night on the floor and bathed in the adulation _ just like the
mourning basketball players in attendance Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, the Knicks' Latrell Sprewell and the Hornets'
Derrick Coleman. Both have been charged in connection with car
accidents. Both stand as examples of how thin the line between a
tragedy and a fender-bender can be. But the death of Bobby Phills
will not change anything. As one Knick was overheard saying,
``Bobby must have let that Porsche get away from him.''
</P>
<P>
   They all think they can handle it. That's why almost every day
after practice, one Knick player or another, is seen speeding
around the curves at SUNY-Purchase on the same street joggers use.
They all believe nothing can touch them. That's why when Magic
Johnson announced that he was HIV positive, it didn't alter
anyone's life style.
</P>
<P>
   The chase of women, racing of cars, flirting with danger, it's
all the offspring of an athletes addiction to adrenaline.
Truthfully, few would be as successful without it. Phills was able
to rise from the Continental Basketball Association and make his
way into the NBA because he had that 24-hour jones for competition.
Right to the end.

 Lower Rate Increase Sought for PG&AMP;E  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A member of the California Public Utilities Commission yesterday
proposed that Pacific Gas and Electric Co. receive a rate increase
well below the $822 million sought by the utility.
<P>
   Commissioner Carl Wood said he is offering an alternative rate
increase of about $400 million ``because PG&AMP;E asked for too much in
the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood's proposal must be voted on by the entire five-member
commission, which is also mulling a rate increase of $243 million
recommended by an administrative law judge.
</P>
<P>
   However, Wood's ``alternate decision'' suggests that PUC members
are dissatisfied with Judge Mark Wetzell's ruling and are trying to
come up with a workable compromise.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E has warned that as many as 3,500 workers could be fired and
tree trimming around electrical lines could be reduced if it fails
to get close to its desired increase.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said the $243 million increase now on the table ``has cut
too deeply into muscle and bone.''
</P>
<P>
   Under his alternative plan, he said he would emphasize tree
trimming to prevent fires, along with ``mechanisms to assure that
moneys earmarked for those programs are in fact spent on those
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E spokesman Ronald Low said the utility was gratified by Wood
proposing a higher rate increase than Wetzell but noted that the
new amount was still only about half what had been originally
requested.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group, said
it was mystified by Wood's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This alternate only makes sense as either an effort to rescue
PG&AMP;E's management from its own incompetence or as a decision to
hand PG&AMP;E revenues far in excess of the amount the company needs in
order to provide safe and reliable service,'' said Bob Finkelstein,
a TURN attorney.

 HP Hints at Education Revolution  &HT;     By Henry Norr, Todd Wallack and Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Heading an all-star lineup at the Bay Area Council's annual outlook
conference yesterday, Hewlett-Packard's new chief executive
Carleton ``Carly'' Fiorina offered a sneak peek at a ``learning
appliance'' the company expects to announce in April.
<P>
   Encased in a red plastic shell slightly larger than a Palm
device, the handheld device ``has the potential of creating a
revolution in education,'' she said. It apparently will offer
Internet access, but she didn't demonstrate and offered no details
about what else it will do or how much it will cost.
</P>
<P>
   The new device, Fiorina said, is just one of HP's many efforts
to create a ``digital bridge'' to overcome the ``digital divide''
or the fact that white and well-off people have far more access to
new technologies than minorities and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, Silicon Valley companies don't have a great track
record in terms of inclusion and diversity,'' Fiorna said, in
calling for a new policy of ``e-inclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just an obligation, it's good business,'' she said,
in part because it's increasingly difficult to recruit outside
technical talent to move to the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker, ExciteAtHome chief executive Thomas Jermoluk,
told reporters that his company finally achieved profitability late
last year, fulfilling a promise it made when it went public.
``We've met our commitments every single quarter ... and I can
guarantee you that we've met them again,'' he said. ExciteAtHome is
expected to report earnings next week.
</P>
<P>
   Jermoluk also said his phone ``has been ringing off the hook''
with calls from prospective ``partners'' since America Online
unveiled plans Monday to buy Time Warner for about $160 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Redwood City company's stock jumped 19 percent Thursday amid
speculation that AT&AMP;T, which owns 58 percent of ExciteAtHome, might
buy the remaining shares.
</P>
<P>
   Jermoluk said the AOL-Time Warner deal helped ``validate''
broadband, or high-speed Net service, boosting interest in
ExciteAtHome.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts say AOL bought Time Warner to sell a faster
version of its service to Time Warner's 13 million cable
subscribers. Likewise, ExciteAtHome sells its high-speed Net
service through cable TV operators, including AT&AMP;T, which serves
most of the Bay Area. ExciteAtHome has 1.1 million customers
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``ExciteAtHome is very attractive,'' he added, but declined to
comment on the AT&AMP;T rumors or name which companies he's talking to
about potential deals.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Jermoluk conceded the company has had significant
service problems but said that's natural when rolling out any new
technology. On Thursday, a message on the company's technical
service hotline said there were outages in Olympia, Wash., the
entire state of Michigan and other locales, along with e-mail
problems in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a lot of heat, but this is a tough thing,'' Jermoluk
said. He said phone companies have had similar troubles introducing
another type of high-speed Net service, called digital subscriber
line. Overall, he said, surveys show ExciteAtHome customers love
the service.
</P>
<P>
   Jermoluk also dismissed a threat from several Usenet
administrators to block ExciteAtHome customers from posting
messages to many Internet bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
   The Usenet administrators, who oversee bulletin boards, have
posted messages on the Internet calling for the ``death penalty''
against ExciteAtHome.
</P>
<P>
   Spammers apparently were using ExciteAtHome's computer network
this month to flood bulletin boards with ads.
</P>
<P>
   But Jermoluk said the spammers simply exploited a hole in the
company's software to make their messages look like they were
coming from ExciteAtHome. The Usenet administrators believed that
ExciteAtHome knew of the problem and did nothing to stop it, but
Jermoluk said the problem has since been fixed.
</P>
<P>
   University of California economist Janet Yellen, formerly chief
economic adviser in the Clinton White House and a Federal Reserve
governor, offered an optimistic forecast for the U.S. economy this
year, tempered by concerns that roaring growth could ignite
inflation and force the Fed to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. economy is operating outside its speed limit,''
Yellen said. But if Fed policymakers succeed in heading off a surge
in prices, ``this expansion probably still has a lot of life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, as in many other regions, a booming economy has
left employers scrambling to fill jobs. ``Bay Area firms will face
difficulty in hiring and retaining workers,'' she noted.
</P>
<P>
   But even a slowdown in national growth wouldn't knock the props
from under the area economy. ``We are at the center of the new
economy and this technology revolution has a very long way to play
itself out,'' Yellen said. ``Our region will continue to grow and
prosper.''
</P>
<P>
   One beneficiary of the new economy, Wells Fargo Chief Executive
Officer Richard Kovacevich, warned against overestimating the power
of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Wells Fargo operates the country's largest
online banking business, with more than 1 million customers,
alongside its traditional branch network. But Kovacevich argued
that dot-com competitors who operate Internet-only banks will fall
by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   ``For financial services, there are very few customers who are
single channel users,'' he said. ``I would bet on clicks and
bricks.''
</P>
<P>
   The business model of some online banks seems to be to ``sell a
dollar for 85 cents and make money on advertising,'' he quipped.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Wal-Mart Is Poised to Swoop Online  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``This is Wal-Mart.com,'' said Jim Breyer, standing amid a handful
of empty cubicles, boxes of computer gear and an unused foosball
table. ``Welcome.''
<P>
   Actually, the global headquarters of Wal-Mart.com, the
soon-to-be online arm of the world's biggest retailer, is just some
extra space in the Palo Alto offices of venture-capital firm Accel
Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer, Accel's managing partner and one of three Wal-Mart.com
board members, is now trying to quickly assemble the team,
including a chief executive, that will shift Wal-Mart's Internet
activities from the company's Arkansas base to an
as-yet-undetermined location in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. Although Wal-Mart has had an online
presence since 1996, and revamped its site only a couple of weeks
ago, the company's Internet operation has not exactly been an
e-commerce powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   By reinventing Wal-Mart.com as a separate company co-owned by
Wal-Mart and Accel, the aim is nothing less than rapid domination
of online sales of everything from books and CDs to toys and
appliances _ in other words, creation of an outlet that competes on
the Net as aggressively as Wal-Mart overshadows the
brick-and-mortar world.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer is setting his goals high. ``Amazon.com is the most
obvious and logical initial competitor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some on Wall Street are already saying that the question should
not be whether Wal-Mart can go head to head with the likes of
Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is if Amazon can go head to head with Wal-Mart,''
said Bernard Sosnick, director of research at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in
New York. ``Wal-Mart has never said anything less than that it
intends to be a major factor on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon is in trouble,'' agreed Jennifer Secallus, an analyst
at Atlantis Investment in New York. ``Wal-Mart is a force to be
reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else, Wal-Mart.com vaults onto the playing field with
incredibly deep pockets. With a market value of nearly $300 billion
_ more than 10 times that of Amazon _ and annual revenue expected
to top $160 billion this year, Wal-Mart has money to burn in making
its online subsidiary pay off.
</P>
<P>
   And the company has no illusions about how much it's going to
lose on the venture, at least in the short run.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been braced,'' Breyer said. ``They know what they're
getting into.''
</P>
<P>
   Many details of the new company have been kept under wraps since
it was unveiled last week. While Breyer said Wal-Mart will hold the
majority of shares in Wal-Mart.com, he declined to specify the size
of the stake or how much either Wal-Mart or Accel have ponied up.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said reports that each firm has invested between $50
million and $100 million are ``not far off.''
</P>
<P>
   Breyer also said Wal-Mart's good-old-boy executives are
comfortable with the tech-industry notion of luring talent with
oodles of stock options, and have every intention to take
Wal-Mart.com public at some point.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are stock options that are going to be worth a
fortune,'' he said with a gleam in his eye. Moreover, Breyer noted
that a generous dollop of options will be ``the key part of the
benefits package for the CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   The CEO's seat should be filled within the next three months.
And for other positions, Breyer said ``thousands'' of resumes have
already been received _ even though the company has made only
minimal recruitment efforts and isn't even sure how many people it
will hire.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  All this sounds rosy enough now. But it remains to be seen
how smoothly the down-home Wal-Mart corporate culture will
translate to a warp-speed Silicon Valley startup. start-up.  &LR; And
although both Wal-Mart and Accel present themselves as kissing
cousins at the moment, not all relationships between established
retailers and hotshot hot-shot  &LR; VCs end up going the distance.
</P>
<P>
   The most notorious fallout involved New Jersey's Toys R Us and
Menlo Park's Benchmark Capital.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies said last April that they were joining hands
to create Toysrus.com as an independent e-commerce entity. But as
the partners attempted to nail down key points about control and
operation of the Web site, relations between the two sides quickly
soured.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, Toys R Us and Benchmark said their alliance had
collapsed. The toy giant's CEO subsequently resigned, and the
company's online operation faced a disastrous holiday season, with
numerous orders undelivered before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Toys R Us nor Benchmark responded to calls seeking
comment on the episode.
</P>
<P>
   For Accel, which manages about $1.4 billion in tech-related
assets, making its newly forged partnership with Wal-Mart work has
been an exercise in anticipating problems before they crop up.
``The last thing anyone wants is another Toys R Us,'' Breyer said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Accel addressed key points like going public and
offering employees stock options well in advance of the deal being
announced. And both partners appear to be unusually sensitive to
the challenge of finding common ground for their respective
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The differences that people talk about don't register with
us,'' said Lee Scott, who was named yesterday as Wal-Mart's new
president and chief executive, and who sits on the Wal-Mart.com
board. ``Because we're in so many different countries, our culture
cuts many different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Silicon Valley can be an alien landscape to outsiders.
Wal-Mart, taking no chances, met with nearly a dozen VC outfits and
contacted numerous business affiliates before settling on Accel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accel has a history of longer-term commitments,'' Scott said.
``We liked that. We want to build a history.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Wal-Mart has no desire to repeat the mistakes of
Toys R Us. ``That whole thing was a good road map for us,'' Scott
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   One element of Wal-Mart's decision to spin off its Internet
operation that hasn't gotten much attention is the fact that the
new firm will be able to avoid sales taxes for most of its online
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are now required to collect sales taxes for online and
catalog purchases in all states where they have a physical
presence. Wal-Mart has more than 2,400 outlets nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But as a separate firm with physical operations only in
California and Arkansas, as well as a distribution center in Utah,
Wal-Mart.com will be able to avoid collecting sales taxes in most
states, making it a more nimble e-commerce competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, consumers themselves are required to pay
sales taxes for online and mail-order purchases from companies that
do not have a physical presence in their state. In practice, few,
if any, actually do.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer said Wal-Mart.com's management will be entirely separate
from Wal-Mart's, with the ability to purchase and price goods as it
sees fit. As such, he said it's possible that the Web site will
offer prices even lower than the bulk-order discounts that are a
hallmark of brick-and-mortar outlets.
</P>
<P>
   He said Wal-Mart.com's main strategy, at least initially, will
be to lure existing Wal-Mart shoppers to the site, as opposed to
reaching out to a whole new demographic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wal-Mart gets 100 million customers a week,'' Breyer pointed
out. ``If we can get to these people and bring them onto the Web,
the numbers are just immense.''
</P>
<P>
   A crucial ace in the hole is a recent deal between Wal-Mart and
America Online to create a co-branded Internet service targeting
rural communities. The service, which will cost less than AOL's
regular service, will of course make it easy for users to find
their way to Wal-Mart.com.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer said the Web site will benefit as well from AOL's
megamerger with Time Warner, although it's too early to say just
how that deal will affect the site's content. He hinted, though,
that users can expect an emphasis on high-speed features like video
applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is going to be state of the art,'' Breyer
stressed. For example, he said Wal-Mart.com will offer ``group
shopping,'' whereby users in different locations can browse the
site together, and real-time assistance from online salespeople.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wal-Mart is famous for its service,'' Breyer noted. ``We need
to reproduce that on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Easier said than done. In any case, rivals like Amazon, for
which top-notch service is also a priority, will not simply roll
over and play dead just because Wal-Mart is finally getting serious
about the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so obsessed with providing the best customer service, we
don't have time to worry about what others are doing,'' said Paul
Capelli, a tough-talking Amazon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Wait until Wal-Mart.com actually has people in its cubicles _
which should happen within the next few weeks. That's when things
will start to get interesting.

NBA HOPES   FOR THE DEBUT   OF JORDAN,   THE EXECUTIVE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association is eagerly awaiting the
return of its supernova.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan continued negotiations with the Washington
Wizards' majority owner, Abe Pollin, Friday in an effort to take
over the struggling franchise's basketball operations. Barring a
last-minute snag, an agreement could be reached as soon as this
weekend, a person with knowledge of the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   If an agreement is reached to give Jordan total control _
trading, signing and drafting players _ he would face the daunting
task of trying to resuscitate a franchise without taking a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that we'd like Michael Jordan, in whatever
capacity, to return to the NBA,'' said Russ Granik, the league's
deputy commissioner. ``He's a tremendous asset to the NBA, and his
association with the league can do nothing but help us.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Whether it's in Washington or anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone while on vacation Friday, David Falk,
Jordan's agent, would neither confirm nor deny that a deal had been
struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through this with Denver, Orlando, Vancouver and
other franchises,'' he said. ``We're not going to respond to
Michael rumors. We haven't done that for the last 15 years. It's
been our consistent position until an agreement is finalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk added: ``I don't know if Michael is going to come back to
the NBA in any shape or form. But there's no question he is perhaps
the biggest influence in the game, a wonderful spokesman, performer
and role model. He stands for everything good about the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the remaining snags in a potential deal that was reported
Friday by The Washington Post was the amount of equity in the
franchise that the minority owners, Ted Leonsis and Jon Ledecky,
would cede to Jordan. Leonsis and Ledecky own 44 percent of the
team, and they have been given the right of first refusal by
Pollin, who owns the other 56 percent, when he decides to sell his
majority share.
</P>
<P>
   What's in the deal for Pollin?
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is spending $200 million to build the MCI Center in
downtown Washington so that a broader commercial life might return
to the city, or paying $105 million to hang on to the team's
emerging star, Juwan Howard, three years ago, Pollin has done
nearly everything possible to make sure his moribund franchise
returns to prominence _ without many results.
</P>
<P>
   With his team at 12-24 and the playoffs again slipping away, the
league's senior owner has a chance to give the Wizards an
incalculable image boost before eventually giving up his majority
share of the team. Always a civic-minded philanthropist, Pollin
could go out a winner with Jordan in charge.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to put Jordan's likeness on a billboard. It is
quite another when Jordan is making the recruiting call to free
agents like Grant Hill and Tim Duncan in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   However inaccurate, there was a perception that Dean Smith made
fewer home visits in his later years as coach of North Carolina.
College basketball's career winningest coach, it was said, simply
told Jordan whom to call and when, and the Tar Heels would produce
another blue-chip recruiting class.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the world of sports or business approaches his
celebrity pull.
</P>
<P>
   An Eastern Conference general manager who spoke on condition of
anonymity said he spoke with the Wizards' general manager, Wes
Unseld. He said Unseld, who has refused to comment on the
negotiations, was unaware of where the parties were as of Thursday
and was unclear what his role would be if Jordan took over the
basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has never held a management position in the league, but
his marketing savvy and his ability to successfully negotiate with
NBA Commissioner David Stern during last year's labor standoff gave
him valuable experience.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how Jordan will react when a nettlesome
agent is not on his side at the bargaining table. Or whether he can
negotiate a salary cap and handle the day-to-day grind of working
behind a desk.
</P>
<P>
   But he appears on his way back, and the NBA cannot wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be great,'' said B.J. Armstrong, Jordan's former
teammate in Chicago and good friend. ``As competitive as he is, I
think he's going to do a wonderful job. He knows the league and
everyone currently playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have thought five years ago that Michael Jordan
would be running a team already? Believe me, you could see this was
coming.'' &QL;

BUSH IMPROVES ON THE STUMP (WITH RESERVATIONS) 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The question-and-answer session was chugging along
rather unremarkably, with Gov. George W. Bush coasting on automatic
pilot through all of the usual issues, when he suddenly encountered
an unexpected pocket of potential turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody wanted to know his feelings about the human genome
project.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a topic that had emerged in any of the Republican
debates. Almost certainly, the Texas governor had not been briefed
on it. Quite possibly, he had never addressed it before.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, without missing a beat, Bush flew confidently and
gracefully into the heart of it. He told the audience at St.
Anselm's College in Manchester, N.H., earlier this week that the
mapping of the human gene would probably bring cures for
``genetically driven diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that there were ethical dilemmas embedded in
forecasting a person's biological destiny. ``You can imagine what
that would mean for the ability to spread risk across insurance
pools,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   And there were temptations. ``I worry about people taking the
place of God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush clearly knew what he was talking about, and over the last
two weeks, during which the Texas governor has been campaigning
with more intensity than ever, there have been many similar moments
when he seemed wholly in command.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been at least as many episodes when Bush seemed a
bit lost, or at least unwilling to stray from familiar oratorical
terrain. And despite three debates this month and dozens of
campaign speeches, he remains something of a muddle: authoritative
and insightful one day, hazy or scripted or platitudinous the next.
</P>
<P>
   He has performed well enough not to diminish the strong
likelihood that he will cinch the Republican presidential
nomination. But he has left unanswered the question of just how
potent an adversary he would be for the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon Bush will participate in his seventh debate,
the last before the Iowa caucuses Jan. 24. The candidate's senior
advisers seem genuinely optimistic about how he will do; in their
view, his performances have steadily improved and he has taken to
heart whatever failings he noticed in a videotape of all his
remarks in the three debates in December. Aides prepared it for
him, and he studied it over his holiday break.
</P>
<P>
   But there were several stretches in the most recent Republican
debate in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Monday when Bush seemed to be
indulging his oft-noted habit of resorting to well-practiced
strokes, when he treaded water and did not keep his head much above
the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the federal government should send hundreds of
millions of dollars to help relieve the scourge of AIDS in Africa,
Bush seemed intent on pivoting into tried-and-true language, and
started talking about the need to ``rally other compassionate
nations around the world to provide the money.''
</P>
<P>
   It was essentially his canned riff on the need to ``rally the
armies of compassion,'' a line in his stump speech about
encouraging religious groups to do more social work, only now he
had gone global with it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the derogatory racial comments of the baseball
pitcher John Rocker and what his team, the Atlanta Braves, should
or should not do to punish him, Bush hastily constructed a verbal
bridge to another signature phrase from his stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'd like to do as president of the United States is usher
in the responsibility era,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if he were rummaging through previously composed index
cards in his mind and plucking the one that seemed the most
relevant.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Bush's tendency to do that so confusing is that in
private conversations, with no television cameras around and are no
tape recorders on, he demonstrates a much more impressive
intellectual and verbal fluency.
</P>
<P>
   One senior adviser explained this discrepancy by saying that
when the clock is ticking, as it is in a debate, Bush feels
pressure to be concise and pithy, which sometimes translates into
superficial and canned.
</P>
<P>
   Another adviser said Bush, by nature, adopted a more formal,
constrained manner in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an element of caution,'' the adviser said. ``He does a
lot better one-on-one than in multiperson formats. He's what I like
to refer to as a serially monogamous campaigner. He doesn't win
over voters en masse. He wins them over one at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's usual ebullience and confidence, he seems prey at
times to nervousness and exhaustion, either of which might explain
the curious grammatical lapses and verbal blunders that the
candidate has been committing.
</P>
<P>
   This week he told an audience in Florence, S.C., that
educational yardsticks needed to be implemented so that lawmakers,
teachers and parents had answers to the question, ``Is our children
learning?''
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, in Mount Pleasant, S.C., he muffed a line in the
foreign policy section of his speech, referring to the danger of
``potential missile launches'' with a phrase that sounded like
``potential menshul losses.'' The second word is spelled
phonetically, because the word itself does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   But in between those two events, at a brief news conference in
an airport hangar in Florence, Bush was back in the saddle again.
</P>
<P>
   While he had previously weighed in on whether Elian Gonzalez
should be returned to his father in Cuba, Bush was asked something
more specific: Was it really responsible of the boy's dead mother,
who has been hailed by some people in the United States as a hero,
to put her young son at such risk by taking him to sea?
</P>
<P>
   Bush's answer was not linguistically elegant, but it was
politically deft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to second-guess the decision of a mom, because
you and I don't know what it's like to live in tyranny,'' he said.
``It shows how amazing the great beacon of America is.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, he hit a note of winning charm in answering a
voter's question about what might distinguish his presidency from
his father's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I've got half my mother in me,'' he said, to a roar of
laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Humor has been Bush's consistent forte, and he has leaned on it
more and more frequently in his debates and public appearances over
the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a debate in Columbia, S.C., Bush responded to a
question about the biggest mistake he had ever made by citing his
former career as managing general partner of the Texas Rangers and
his decision to trade the baseball player Sammy Sosa for Harold
Baines. Sosa went on to greatness; Baines did not.
</P>
<P>
   It showed voters just how quick and funny Bush can be. But it
told them little _ at least for now, as he carefully protects a big
lead _ about his capacity for reflection, about how deep he can or
cannot go.
</P>

WIN98 UPGRADE DOESN'T TAKE DISKS _ JUST A LITTLE FAITH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: I purchased a used PC and did not get any disks
or CDs with it. I want to upgrade to Windows 98 or Windows 2000,
but I do not have the Windows 95 CD. Do I need this? Also, will I
lose anything that is on my PC? I do not have the backups for the
software. _ Uneasy Upgrader
</P>
<P>
   Dear Uneasy: I realize this is closing the barn door long after
ol' Dobbin has been packed off to the glue factory, but you should
never buy a used computer if the seller won't provide you with the
original disks for software loaded on the machine.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, if you don't have the disks, you have no way of
proving the software isn't bootlegged. Second, even if you don't
care about the legal stuff, there'll come a day when your computer
goes kerblooey, and you'll have to rebuild it from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   Simply upgrading to Win98 or Win2K shouldn't be a major problem,
though. You don't need the Win95 CD to do it, unless the upgrade
installation fails and leaves you with a very expensive
paperweight. And don't listen to all those Microsoft apologists who
say that can't happen. It does. Not often, but it does. It happened
to me. I lost hundreds of irreplaceable files. But I'm not bitter.
No, not the least little bit. I just hope Bill Gates roasts in ...
Hmmm, I see I've strayed a tad. Sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead and try the upgrade. The odds are actually pretty good
that you'll get through it OK. Maybe my problems had to do with
karma.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: My 2 1/2-year-old computer has begun to freeze
up. The error message is ``Rnaapp not responding.'' The only way to
resolve the problem is to shut down and reboot. _ Mr. Freeze
</P>
<P>
   Dear Mr. Freeze: It's a little-known theory that when software
engineers design the complex ways their programs interact with
Windows and other installed products, they use the clown-car
principle. In other words, they stuff Mr. Chuckles into the car and
hope that his elbow doesn't jab Flopsy in the eye and that his big,
dopey clown shoes don't wind up in Moopie-Pie's ear.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Chuckles is not getting along with one of the other clowns.
Somewhere along the line, you have installed something that upset
another program. Remember the warning that most setup routines
display? The one that says you should probably close all other
Windows programs before proceeding? Of course not. Nobody ever pays
attention to that, and most times you can get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, though, you got busted. Maybe you didn't turn off
your virus checker before doing the installation. I always forget
that one, and I've gotten that same error. All you can do now is to
uninstall possible offending programs in reverse order, turn off
everything else, put on your big red nose, then reinstall.
</P>
<P>
   If none of that works, uninstall again, then go to Windows Setup
and get rid of Dial-Up Networking (Rnaapp is part of that). Now
reinstall, reinstall, reinstall.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: Tell me how to burn a CD of a copy-protected
game. _ Bandit
</P>
<P>
   Dear Bandit: Why don't I just show you how to hold up a liquor
store? That's just as illegal, but at least you'd have the cash to
buy the game.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: Why do you feel it necessary to be so rude and
sarcastic? Please change your attitude. _ Shocked and Offended
</P>
<P>
   Dear Shocked: No. But thanks for asking. &QL;

MERGER TALKS BY SMITHKLINE AND GLAXO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Two British pharmaceutical giants, SmithKline Beechham
PLC and Glaxo Wellcome PLC, are near agreement on a $80.7 billion
merger that would create the world's largest drug maker, executives
close to the talks said here Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   A deal, which could be announced as early as Monday, comes
almost two years after merger talks between the two companies
collapsed in a dispute over who would control the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   That stumbling block was cleared in large part in early
December, when Jan Leschly, the chief executive of SmithKline, who
had been seen as largely responsible for the management stalemate,
announced that he planned to retire in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been expecting this deal would be back on the cards
since the talks fell apart the first time,'' said Franc Gregori, an
analyst with BNP Paribas in London. ``You've got the making of a
super company that will have critical economies of scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Also propelling the deal forward was the announcement on
Thursday by Warner-Lambert that it was in talks with Pfizer over a
possible merger, upsetting an earlier agreement between
Warner-Lambert and American Home Products. Last month, Pharmacia &AMP;
Upjohn and Monsanto announced a merger deal.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that lack sufficient research and marketing muscle are
under pressure to seek partners, and analysts expect the furious
pace of consolidation in the industry to accelerate even more.
Novartis, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Roche and American Home
Products are considered likely to seek deals soon.
</P>
<P>
   For Glaxo and SmithKline, a combination may give them the size
to try to right laggard sales and marketing miscues as well as
vault them into a class of their own. A combined Glaxo-SmithKline
would have $17.88 billion in drug sales, based on 1998 data,
towering over the current No. 1, Aventis, with $10.8 billion in
sales, according to IMS Health, an industry consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo's top-selling drugs include Imitrex, an anti-migraine
treatment, and medicines for respiratory ailments and for HIV.
SmithKline makes Avandia, a leading diabetes drug, and Paxil, a
leading antidepressant.
</P>
<P>
   Though both Glaxo and SmithKline have extensive operations in
the United States, a successful merger would mean that of the top
five drug companies, only one would be American: a combined Pfizer
and Warner-Lambert. Two years ago, three of the five largest drug
companies were American. Still, a combined Glaxo-SmithKline would
control only 7.5 percent of the world market.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo's chief executive, Richard Sykes, ``believes vehemently
that bigger is better,'' said James Culverwell, an analyst with
Merrill Lynch in London. ``To him, Pfizer-Warner Lambert changes
the competitive landscape. He doesn't want to lose out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in an interview in November, when Pfizer made a hostile
bid for Warner Lambert, Sykes said that a combination of American
Home and Warner Lambert ``would not have had a major impact on our
business, but if you get Pfizer and Warner Lambert, you are talking
about 7 to 8 percent market share, a big number.'' Noting what a
combined Pfizer-Warner Lambert could spend on research, he added,
``I think it should be a worry to anybody that one company is
spending between $3 billion and $4 billion a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, SmithKline and Glaxo representatives confirmed that they
were in talks, though neither would disclose any specifics except
to say that any deal would be a merger of equals. Glaxo is a much
larger company, however, and the combined company is expected to be
divided about 60-40 in favor of Glaxo shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the talks said the two companies planned to
work out the final details over the weekend. They stressed that as
with any deal of this size, the companies could still decide to
abandon the effort.
</P>
<P>
   One issue that has been agreed upon, executives close to the
talks said, is that Sykes would become chairman of the combined
company, while Jean-Pierre Garnier, chief operating officer of
SmithKline, would become chief executive. Within a few years,
Garnier would be expected to succeed Sykes.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Sykes and Garnier were much more compatible
as a management team than Sykes and Leschly, and that now the deal
had to be completed, if for no other reason than to save face.
``There is a real fear of failure if a deal doesn't get done now,''
Gregori, of BNP Paribas, said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors applauded the possibility of a tie-up. Shares of
SmithKline rose 56 pence, or 7 percent, to 847 pence. Shares of
Glaxo rose 78 pence, or 4.5 percent, to 1.8 pounds. SmithKline's
American depository receipts rose $3.9375, to $70, and Glaxo's
gained $2, to $60.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Times and USA Today reported Friday that the
companies were in talks.
</P>
<P>
   Would investors have fared better if the companies had completed
a deal in 1998? Culverwell, the Merrill Lynch analyst, said he did
not think so. ``If a deal had been done two years ago, the terms
would be very different,'' he said. ``It would have been out of
desperation. SmithKline has more broadly based growth now. And
Glaxo was in the throes of several patents expiring at the time.
And to be frank, this time around, with Leschly leaving, its just
more straightforward.''

CONSUMER PRICES INCREASE A MODEST 0.2 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latest evidence that inflation remains in check, consumer
prices rose only modestly in December even as the economy roared
toward a record for uninterrupted expansion, Labor Department
figures showed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A lower-than-expected rise in the Consumer Price Index of 0.2
percent, combined with reassuring comments Thursday evening by Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to help propel the Dow
Jones industrial average to its third record close of the week.
</P>
<P>
   But after the government issued its report on inflation and
other data on industrial output and inventories, word came in
midmorning that consumers might have become unduly optimistic. That
could mean continuation of a breakneck spending pace that the
Federal Reserve has been trying to arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The news pushed interest rates, which had initially subsided,
higher for the day and left economists less convinced that the
central bank can avoid repeated increases in its short-term rate
target, now 5{ percent. It is all but certain, analysts say, that
the Fed will decide on a quarter-point rise at the end of its
two-day meeting at the beginning of February.
</P>
<P>
   December's rise in consumer prices lifted the 1999 inflation
rate to 2.7 percent, with the acceleration from 1998's 1.6 percent
reflecting a sharp jump in the price of oil. Energy prices surged
13.4 percent last year after falling 8.8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But with the wide-swinging energy and food components set aside,
the so-called core inflation rate last year was 1.9 percent, the
lowest since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement accompanying her department's release of the
report, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said the economy remained
``strong and growing and should be nominated for best picture'' at
the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Private analysts were also encouraged, saying that medical care
appeared to be the only unsettling major sector, assuming that the
price of oil stops rising. Medical costs advanced 0.4 percent for
the second consecutive month and 3.7 percent for 1999 as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty reassuring report,'' said Edward McKelvey, a
senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. He added that while Greenspan
would no doubt tighten credit another notch or two, the chairman's
speech to the Economic Club of New York indicated he was not ``on
the warpath.''
</P>
<P>
   That stance is perceived despite an increase of 0.9 percent in
inventories in November, which suggested that the economy's growth
rate could approach 6 percent for the quarter. Analysts hope that
much of the rise will prove temporary, reflecting stocks built in
anticipation of possible Year 2000 computer failures.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate tally Friday, the University of Michigan said its
index of consumer sentiment soared to 111.4 at the mid-January
reading, the highest in its 20-year history, from 105.4 at the end
of December. Although this unnerved the bond market, index sponsors
said the rise might have been magnified by relief that no computer
disasters occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of reading that if it persists could suggest
consumer spending could ratchet up at a rapid pace,'' said Richard
Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities. On the other hand,
he said, Year 2000 considerations could mean it was temporary and
not worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the economy, which has been growing without
interruption since April 1991, is expected to break the longevity
record for a business expansion set in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few sectors not suffering some strain is American
industry, where output grew 2.2 percent last year, mostly in
technology equipment, the Federal Reserve reported Friday. Output
rose 0.4 percent in December, with plants operating at 81.3 percent
of capacity, still below the historic average of 82.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The inflation report showed housing and food and beverages each
up 0.1 percent in December; for the full year, housing rose 2.2
percent, with food and beverages up 2 percent. Transportation
climbed 0.7 percent in December and 5.4 percent for 1999, mainly
reflecting the surge in fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   The index for used cars and trucks fell 0.7 percent last month,
while the price of public transportation fell 0.5 percent, mainly
reflecting lower airline fares. For the full year, however, air
fares advanced 10.9 percent.

EDITORIAL: NEW TWIST IN THE PINOCHET CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 15:
</P>
<P>
   Britain's declaration that Gen. Augusto Pinochet is medically
unfit to stand trial should not be the final word on this matter.
More information is needed, and it can be provided under a
reasonable plan proposed Friday by the Spanish judge who is seeking
to prosecute the former Chilean dictator for human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, outlined by Judge Baltasar Garzon, two doctors
appointed by his Madrid court would take part in a new examination
of Pinochet, who has suffered a series of minor strokes. The result
of that exam, and an earlier one performed solely by British
physicians, would be made available to Garzon. He would then
determine whether Pinochet should be spared a trial because of
mental impairment and an inability to understand the charges.
</P>
<P>
   This case is too important to set aside without a second medical
opinion, and without giving the Spanish court access to the
doctors' reports. The British government has not shared the results
of the first examination with the Spanish court.
</P>
<P>
   If Pinochet is found to be unfit by the Spanish court, even some
of the most fervent advocates for prosecution would have to agree
that justice would not be served by proceeding against an enfeebled
man.
</P>
<P>
   The case has already made a profound contribution to
international law. It established that even former heads of state
do not enjoy impunity for crimes against humanity, and may be tried
outside the country where the crimes were committed. It has also
had a liberating effect on Chile. When Pinochet was arrested in
London in October 1998, many feared that the charges would
destabilize Chile's transition to democracy. As Chileans prepare to
vote for a new president this weekend, it appears the opposite has
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1973 and 1990 Pinochet presided over the murder or
disappearance of more than 3,000 Chileans and the torture of
thousands more. His intimidation was so complete that he and his
associates escaped prosecution for a decade after he stepped down.
But since his arrest, emboldened Chilean courts have issued rulings
that have shaken the military's immunity. More than two dozen of
his former officers have been arrested for murder and kidnapping.
Former political prisoners are preparing to file the first criminal
complaint accusing Pinochet and some of his former officers of
torture.
</P>
<P>
   None of this has disturbed Chile's fledgling democracy. On the
contrary, Chileans have experienced the first presidential campaign
since his coup in 1973 that was not distorted by the polarizing
legacies of Pinochet. The candidates _ Ricardo Lagos, a Socialist,
and Joaquin Lavin, a former official in Pinochet's government _
have stressed everyday problems like health care, crime and
unemployment. It suggests that those who feared the destabilizing
power of justice underestimated its healing effect.

AOL AND TIME WARNER RETREAT AS WALL STREET REVIEWS OUTLOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The shares of America Online declined $1.3125, or 2
percent, Friday, to $63.1875, while Time Warner's fell 75 cents, to
$83.25, as investors struggled to figure out the financial outlook
for the $165 billion merger that the two companies announced on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's drop Friday was modest compared with Thursday's upward
bounce, leaving it comfortably above Wednesday's closing price of
$60. Time Warner's decline was in line with that of other
communications company stocks Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts cautioned against trying to read too much into
Friday's action.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that if prices remain around current levels for a
couple of weeks, doubts about whether the deal will be completed
should evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   The only new development Friday was AOL's filing of documents
with the Securities and Exchange Commission outlining the merger
agreement. The filing disclosed that if America Online cancels the
deal and is bought by another company within a year, it must pay a
breakup fee to Time Warner of $5.4 billion. If Time Warner pulls
out and is acquired within a year, it must pay AOL $3.7 billion.
Those fees translate into 2.75 percent of the market valuation of
America Online and Time Warner respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Koch, co-head of mergers and acquisitions for Credit
Suisse First Boston, said the 2.75 percent breakup fee was typical.
``The absolute level, of course, is somewhat staggering,'' Koch
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the agreement contains a second breakup provision.
If AOL shareholders vote down the deal but AOL remains independent,
AOL must pay Time Warner 1 percent of its market value at the time
of the announcement, or $2 billion. If Time Warner shareholders
vote down the deal and Time Warner remains independent, Time Warner
must pay AOL $1.4 billion _ 1 percent of Time Warner's market
value.
</P>
<P>
   The 1 percent fee ``is not unheard of, but it's not the norm,''
Koch said. Courts in Delaware, where most corporations are based,
have found such fees to be reasonable because they compensate a
company for the time its management has spent on a deal and other
costs, he said.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 15:
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court acted decisively this week to preserve one of
the nation's most valuable tools for protecting the environment _
the ability of citizens to enforce federal anti-pollution laws
through private legal actions. By a surprisingly lopsided 7-2
margin, the court voted to pull back from its own recent rulings,
and those of lower federal courts, that had significantly narrowed
the ability of environmental groups to pursue polluters in court.
</P>
<P>
   The case, involving a hazardous-waste incinerator in South
Carolina, posed a crucial test of the continued vitality of
provisions of the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and the other
sweeping environmental measures of the 1970s that authorized
individuals to act as ``private attorneys general'' and collect
fines on behalf of the federal treasury. Congress wisely included
these provisions as a hedge against the tendency of government
regulators to become too cozy with the industries they oversee, and
much of the environmental progress the nation has achieved since
then has resulted from citizen-generated suits.
</P>
<P>
   To Justice Antonin Scalia, however, giving citizens enforcement
power gave plaintiffs too much bargaining power and threatened
democratic governance. Over the past few years his views persuaded
several courts to limit citizen court access in environmental
cases. Happily the new decision, written by Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg, takes a sharp turn in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg argues that the fact that fines imposed in citizen
suits flow to the federal treasury and not the plaintiffs does not
deprive the plaintiffs of the stake in the outcome of the case
required to establish standing. Moreover, the ruling makes plain
that a polluter does not render a case moot, thereby escaping fines
and the need to reimburse plaintiffs' legal fees, simply by
complying with regulations after a legal action has begun. A case
is moot, Ginsburg said, setting an appropriate standard, only if it
is ``absolutely clear'' that the violations will not recur.
</P>
<P>
   Had the court once again followed Scalia's preferred path, 30
years of forward progress on environmental issues would have been
put at risk. Instead &UR; , &LR;  the court took one look at this abyss and
turned aside.

TASK FORCE: PAY UP OR LOSE CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY PAT FLANNERY  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull's stadium task force sent Arizonans a pointed
message Friday:
</P>
<P>
   If you want to keep an NFL franchise, prepare to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The panel released a tentative proposal to levy several special
taxes over the next three decades to finance $224 million of the
$329 million construction cost of a new football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona Senate President Brenda Burns offered an equally
pointed reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think voters have made it clear that they don't want a tax
increase to fund stadiums,'' she said through a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Burns also vowed a public vote on any proposed tax hikes, a
chilling prospect for stadium backers who watched Mesa voters shoot
down the Rio Salado Crossing stadium project last year.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's proposal, the product of two months of work by the task
force, would fund a facility to host the Cardinals, the Fiesta Bowl
and, panel members hope, several Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the upfront cost would be covered by the Cardinals,
the Fiesta Bowl and interest earnings on construction bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The task force asked the Cardinals to put up $75 million, the
same amount the team offered for the Rio Salado Crossing proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed new taxes include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A new 0.5 percent statewide hotel bed tax, which would be
added to the current statewide hotel/motel tax of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _In Maricopa County alone, another 0.5 percent bed tax would be
added to the statewide hike. It would increase the 6.27 percent
hotel/motel taxes paid in Maricopa County to 7.27 percent, said
Vince Perez, an Arizona Department of Revenue spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   _A new 3 percent tax on car rental sales in Maricopa County,
replacing the flat $2.50 fee now charged on every car rental.
</P>
<P>
   _State income taxes already paid by professional football
players in Arizona, and new state income taxes levied on salary
earned in Arizona by all visiting pro sports players. Although the
tax on visiting players' salaries would apply to all sports, only
visiting NFL players' taxes would be earmarked for stadium
financing.
</P>
<P>
   _State sales taxes paid on the construction value of the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   _State sales taxes paid on concessions in the new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One Chairman Michael Welborn, who heads the task force,
said he was ``optimistic'' the plan could be embraced by the
Arizona Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tax revenues being sought wouldn't be collected in
Arizona were it not for the Cardinals, Wellborn and others pointed
out. Others are narrowly targeted taxes affecting tourists, and
these levies would also generate revenue for tourism promotion.
</P>
<P>
   And Welborn warned that this could be Arizona's last chance to
keep the Cardinals. Though owner Bill Bidwill has not said he would
move the team without a new stadium, most members of the task force
expect that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bidwills have been terrific in not trying to make this a
threat issue,'' Welborn said. ``But at the end of the day, this is
still a business.''
</P>
<P>
   Task force members noted repeatedly Friday that their
preliminary plan contained something for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cardinals are very happy to be a part of it,'' Bidwill
told the task force shortly before his son, Michael, unleashed
Aeneas Williams and two other Cardinals players to schmooze panel
members.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Cardinals' financial participation appears no greater
than in Rio Salado Crossing, task force members insisted the team's
commitment is stronger. That's because it came without any
guarantees that parking revenues would be available to cover some
costs, they said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Cardinals do want revenues from at least 7,500
parking spaces before buying off on the new deal.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's proposal pays only for construction of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The task force has already said it is eyeing six sites in
Phoenix, Tempe and Mesa. It will confer with the cities during the
next few weeks, hoping to lure offers of free land, parking
facilities and infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Fiesta Bowl's proposed $20 million contribution
would be raised by selling permanent seat licenses for club seating
at the bowl. However, panel members noted that the $20 million
figure is still being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed new taxes, applied for the next 29 years, would
raise more than $2 billion, some of which would go to other causes,
such as tourism promotion and bolstering the Cactus League, the
10-team spring training league based in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   State tourism officials say the Cactus League, which lured a
million visitors to the state last year, is in danger of being
raided by other states.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona hopes to keep the teams and lure others like the Los
Angeles Dodgers, which are looking for new facilities.
</P>
<P>
   If the stadium plan succeeds, the Cactus League will be
guaranteed revenue to help build new facilities and maintain older
sites so teams don't bolt.
</P>
<P>
   To get the hospitality and rental-car industries to accept the
new taxes, the task force also would beef up state tourism
spending.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal earmarks a percentage of new revenues each year for
promotion, with the immediate effect of doubling the state's annual
tourism promotion budget to $12 million from $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens are invited to find out more about the stadium plans
and offer their own suggestions at a public meeting Tuesday, from 6
to 9 p.m. at the Salt River Project's PERA Club, 1 E. Continental
Drive, Tempe. The facility is west of Scottsdale Road between
McDowell and Curry roads. &QL;

   PAT BUCHANAN: BACK IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Buchanan on Friday made his first campaign stop in New
Hampshire since a brief appearance Oct. 25 when he announced his
bid for the Reform Party presidential nomination. Buchanan said of
the Democrats and Republicans, ``The two Washington parties have
become Xerox copies of one another.'' But he called himself ``the
defending champion of the New Hampshire primary,'' referring to his
defeat of former Sen. Bob Dole in the 1996 Republican contest
there. &QL;

<P>
   OPINION SURVEYS: TEXANS BACK BUSH
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, but Gov. George W. Bush's fellow Texans support him
overwhelmingly, according to a new Dallas Morning News/Houston
Chronicle poll. Bush leads Vice President Al Gore 59 percent to 32
percent and former Sen. Bill Bradley 62 percent to 28 percent. Gore
led Bradley 54 percent to 24 percent in the poll, which had a
margin of sampling error of 6 percentage points.

   ORRIN HATCH: PAID NOTICE
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, his Republican presidential candidacy barely
registering in the polls, bought his first television
advertisements in New Hampshire this week. They are 30-minute
speeches, which began at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday on WMUR
in Manchester. In the advertisements, he attacks the Clinton
administration as ``the most deceitful and corrupt'' in history.

   GEORGE W. BUSH: FAMILY OUTINGS
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush's campaign is bringing out the big-name
surrogates. His father, former President George Bush, who stumped
for his son in Iowa on Thursday, will campaign for him in South
Carolina on Saturday, the Bush campaign announced Friday. Gov.
Bush's brother Jeb, the governor of Florida, will work in New
Hampshire for him Saturday, and Elizabeth Dole will make three
appearances on his behalf in Iowa on Saturday and another three in
South Carolina on Sunday. &QL;

   REPUBLICANS: E-CAMPAIGNING
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee became an Internet service
provider Friday, offering direct access to the World Wide Web.
Besides free e-mail and chat rooms, the service will give members
customized Web pages that will provide updates on Republican
developments, as well as what party officials called an ``anti-smut
filter'' and unbiased reporting about news events. The service is
intended for ``people who want freedom FROM the press,'' according
to an advertisement.

   JOHN McCAIN: OWN MEDICINE?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain has upbraided the Republican establishment in
New York, which is allied with Gov. George W. Bush, for considering
a challenge to McCain's nomination petitions to get him thrown off
the ballot. But in 1998, McCain's Senate campaign challenged the
petitions of a Republican candidate named Bert Tollefson. Tollefson
was effectively forced to withdraw, leaving McCain with no primary
opponent. But a McCain campaign spokesman, Howard Opinsky, said
yesterday that the laws in Arizona were far more forgiving than
those in New York.

   THE CROWD: ROAD TRIP
</P>
<P>
   Why bother with Daytona Beach when you can spend winter break in
New Hampshire? Cam Winton, 21, a junior at the University of
Pennsylvania, packed four friends into a rented Dodge Caravan and
hit Dublin, Londonderry, Hooksett, Peterborough and Manchester in a
quest to shake hands with the next president of the United States,
logging nearly 800 miles by yesterday, when they caught up with
Vice President Al Gore. They ribbed Bill Bradley for being a
Princeton Tiger, and caught George W. Bush's attention when they
made eyes after the candidate mentioned his 18-year-old twin
daughters.

GOVERNOR WANTS PUBLIC TO KNOW WHICH LAWMAKERS RECEIVE LOBBYISTS'
LARGESSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN L. PETTERSON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   TOPEKA, Kan. _ Just ask Gov. Bill
Graves. He'll tell you it's time for lobbyists to start naming
names when they report the cost of their efforts to influence the
Legislature.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tab for steaks and wine for a couple of senators? It should
show up on the monthly report, right next to the names of the
diners.
</P>
<P>
   Same for the cost of those Royals tickets lobbyists bought for
the House members they accompanied to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has asked the Legislature to require members' names
to be reported on official lobbyist spending documents that would
be available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't like lobbyist reporting,'' Graves said Monday after
he made the recommendation in his State of the State address. ``I
think it's time.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor may think it's time, but he appears to be short of
supporters in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Dick Bond, an Overland Park Republican, said he
sees no problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: Is there abuse?'' he asked. ``I don't believe
we have a serious abuse problem. You've got to prove that before
you change the law.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been previous efforts to pass similar legislation,
but such efforts have been unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Hellebust tried to get similar legislation approved when he
headed Common Cause in Kansas from 1986 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never did get a very receptive hearing,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the legislators wanted people to know who was taking
them out or buying them tickets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For some time, the legislature in Missouri has required
lobbyists to report the names of lawmakers who receive lobbyist
largess if it isn't provided to the entire legislature or to an
entire party caucus or committee.
</P>
<P>
   Records of those individual expenditures are available for
public inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Not in Kansas, though, and the governor isn't optimistic he'll
be able force a change this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that its chances are particularly good, but I
think it is important, especially in an election year,'' Graves
said.
</P>
<P>
   All 165 legislative seats are up for grabs this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the first eight months of last year, the 588 registered
lobbyists spent $432,098 on food and beverages to influence the
Legislature. That averages out to $2,619 for each representative
and senator.
</P>
<P>
   But most lawmakers don't see the need for tighter reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rich Becker, a Lenexa Republican, thinks any reporting
legislation should be tied to a thorough discussion of the
legislative pay issue.
</P>
<P>
   Becker thinks lawmakers' pay, $74.58 per day while they are in
session or are attending summer committee meetings, is too low.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't like to read news stories about the average amount
lobbyists spend on lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Give him the average amount, he said, ``and I'll buy my own
chips and dip, and sodas out of the Coke machine.''
</P>
<P>
   To the argument some lawmakers advance that they are paid too
little to afford three squares a day while maintaining a residence
in their home districts, the governor offered this response:
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, baloney.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislation containing the governor's recommendation was
introduced this week by the House Governmental Organization and
Elections Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lisa Benlon, a Shawnee Republican and chairwoman of the
committee, said hearings on the measure probably will be scheduled
for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators, she predicted, may have a problem with the
bill ``because they have standing evening meals set up (with
lobbyists).''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Sen. Janice Hardenburger, a Haddam Republican and
chairwoman of the Senate Elections and Local Government Committee
that handles ethics legislation, said lobbyists won't like the bill
because it will require extra paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Should the legislation emerge from the House, Hardenburger
promised to give it a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public should know who's entertaining us,'' she said. ``If
there's excessive spending on a small number of legislators, that
certainly indicates there might be undue influence.''
</P>
<P>
   One lawmaker who openly supports Graves' idea is Sen. Don Biggs,
a Leavenworth Democrat, who says simply, ``it's needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports that name names would raise the awareness on the part of
the legislators and the public, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is basically opening up the window on the process,''
Biggs said.

DRUNKEN DRIVER WHO KILLED FAMILY OF THREE SENTENCED TO 15 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The man who killed a
young family of three while driving drunk on Christmas Day in 1998
was sentenced Friday to 15 years in prison.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although less than the 23 years recommended by a jury, the
sentence of Anthony Lamar Fields is thought to be the longest ever
in Jackson County for a drunken-driving conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exactly what we wanted, but we are satisfied with
that,'' said Laverne Robinson, mother of victim Tracy Stowers.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy and Cecil Stowers and their 4-month-old daughter, Sydney,
had spent their last evening at Tracy's parents' home before
Fields' vehicle rocketed into them at more than 85 mph on
Interstate 435 near 83rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   Fields' blood-alcohol content was 0.16 percent. The Missouri
limit is 0.10 percent. Gov. Mel Carnahan is pushing to lower the
limit to 0.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County Circuit Judge Charles E. Atwell heard nearly two
hours of emotional testimony from the victims' families and from
Fields' family and friends. Atwell said that he did not think the
maximum penalty was appropriate but that severe punishment was
warranted.
</P>
<P>
   He sentenced Fields, 28, to seven years each on three counts of
involuntary manslaughter and one year each on two counts of
second-degree assault. But he grouped some of the terms to run at
the same time so that Fields must first serve seven years, then
another seven years and then one year, consecutively, for a total
of 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Jackson County Prosecutor David Fry estimated Fields
will serve at least half the term in prison before being paroled.
Fields was taken into custody Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fields tearfully addressed the Stowerses' families, his words
barely understandable through his sobbing. His Bible lay before him
open to Psalm 86, a prayer for mercy and compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I live I can't change what happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The finality of that Christmas Day also weighs on Laverne
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sydney was my only granddaughter, and I'll never have
another,'' she told the court. ``So precious, so precious, and
death is so permanent.''
</P>
<P>
   Cecil Charles Stowers Jr. was 29 and Tracy Lynette Stowers was
30. They both worked at Hallmark Cards Inc. She had a master's
degree in business administration. They had been married 5 years.
Both were active in community and church affairs. Atwell called
them role models for young adults.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil Stowers' mother, Idora Henderson, spoke of a dutiful and
caring son who called her every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the nicest people you could ever meet,'' she
told the court. ``I tell people now: If you didn't know him, you
missed a treat.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields' family and friends told the court how he had changed
after the accident, how he was remorseful and started a Bible study
group. He also voluntarily enrolled in a substance-abuse counseling
program.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of that program testified that Fields was one of the
most sincere clients he has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant Jackson County Prosecutor Rick Knight told the
court that Fields had been arrested three times for drunken driving
before that Christmas evening when he crossed the highway median
and struck the Stowerses' vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Robinson, Tracy Stowers' father, asked the judge to be
fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``This drunken driving has got to stop,'' he said. ``It's taking
too many lives.''

IN THE KREMLIN'S EYES, THE WEST IS NOW A RIVAL ONCE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 2nd graf to change `easing' to `stiffening'; adds sentence on
Putin to end of 3rd graf; deletes phrase on `information wars' from
end of penultimate graf; in last graf, deletes phrase `in the
world' to correct quote.) 
 (js) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Underscoring its darkening view of the West, the
Kremlin issued a national security strategy Friday that inveighs
against an expansionist Europe and United States and contemplates
the use of nuclear weapons in war ``if all other means of resolving
the crisis have been exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   The revised language governing nuclear weapons is a subtle but
unmistakable stiffening of the previous strategy, issued in 1997,
which allowed the use of nuclear arms only ``in case of a threat to
the existence of the Russian Federation.''
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy was signed by acting President Vladimir Putin
on Monday and published Friday. It reviews not just foreign threats
but a sweeping array of internal dangers, from organized crime to
terrorism, to separatist movements like that of the militants in
Chechnya. Buoyed by the campaign in Chechnya, Putin is the leading
candidate in the election for president on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, the document simply incorporates changes in
military and political doctrine approved over the last year as
Russia's domestic situation deteriorated and its judgment of
Western intentions changed.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, however, those changes comprise a new view of
the world by the nation's leaders _ one in which the West is no
longer benign but a competitor that benefits from and even schemes
to ensure Russian weakness.
</P>
<P>
   In the opinion of the document's drafters, Russia is weak in
almost every respect.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy calls the armed forces' readiness ``critically
low,'' and says that social stability is at risk because the
population is being stratified into ``a thin layer of
well-to-do-people and a predominant layer of citizens of scanty
means.'' It says that terrorism poses a serious internal threat,
that foreign economic influence over the economy and natural
resources might be more tightly controlled by the state, and that
national security is endangered by a brain-drain of technologists
and the leakage of intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy chief of the Russian defense ministry's general
staff, Col. Valery Manilov, said Friday that the strategy's
apparent suspicion of Western intentions should not be blown out of
proportion.
</P>
<P>
   In comments to the Russian news service Interfax, Manilov said
Moscow remains interested in ``mutually beneficial and neighborly
cooperation on an equal footing with Western countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Even that wording reflects the altered sentiment of the
strategy, which has dropped all mention of ``partnership'' with the
West in favor of the more neutral term ``cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Little of this bleak picture is new to people who have watched
Russia's elite and average citizens alike turn against the West
after the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce G. Blair, an expert on Russian and U.S. nuclear forces at
the Brookings Institution in Washington, said the change is ``a
codification of something that's really already been pretty well
cemented in the Russian psyche, at least among their security
planners.''
</P>
<P>
   And the discussion of nuclear contingencies, which attracted by
far the most attention, may not prove to be of much practical
significance.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who spent a decade or more watching the West as a KGB
agent in East Germany, is said by friends to be well aware that any
threat Europe and the United States pose to Russia is not military
but economic and cultural.
</P>
<P>
   And the United States _ which also periodically redraws its
security landscape, in an exercise not dissimilar from that of the
Kremlin _ has traditionally been more hawkish about the first use
of nuclear weapons than has Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department and Pentagon declined comment Friday on the
announcement from Russia, its longtime rival in the Cold War arms
race. Both sides now cooperate militarily in some spheres.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   America's Cold War policy was never to renounce the first use of
nuclear arms but to counter a Russian invasion of Europe with
nuclear force, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, on the other hand, renounced the first use of nuclear
missiles for some years but abandoned the pledge in 1993, and by
then it viewed itself as a Western ally and no longer a rival.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, the Kremlin and White House nuclear policies are
now not that far apart.
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of security, the Russian and U.S. nuclear forces
are now far apart, Blair said, with U.S. forces remaining under
tight control while control of Russian nuclear missiles is more
problematic.
</P>
<P>
   In Blair's view, the new security policy may increase the
chances of potentially catastrophic lapses within a Russian
military hobbled by financial problems and lapsed military
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is forced to rely more and more on its nuclear force to
deter threats, experts warn, because its conventional military
forces are no longer able to repel outsiders. That requires keeping
nuclear arms on high alert, which invites mistakes in a system
where missing radars and balky satellites already provide only
spotty warning of incoming missiles. The situation may also
increase the chance of false alarms.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has increasingly shown its nuclear card in recent years,
more as a reminder of its potential to wreak havoc _ and to command
respect _ than as any threat. President Boris Yeltsin startled U.S.
leaders only last month when, in response to a mild criticism of
Russia's policy on Chechnya, he tartly reminded President Clinton
that the Kremlin controls an arsenal of nuclear missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Russian military unveiled its response to the
West's bombing of Yugoslavia by staging the largest military
exercise since the collapse of the Soviet Union. It carried out
mock nuclear strikes on an unspecified - but inarguably Western
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for the exercise envisioned a Kremlin that was unable
to repel Western forces with its cash-starved army and was thus
forced to resort to nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Then the defense minister, Igor Sergeyev, all but parroted the
text of the document released Friday. ``The exercise tested one of
the provisions of Russia's military doctrine concerning a possible
use of nuclear weapons when all other measures are exhausted,'' he
said then.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did pursue such an option. All measures were exhausted. Our
defenses proved to be ineffective. An enemy continued to push into
Russia. And that's when the decision to use nuclear weapons was
made.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy formalized Friday is hardly so apocalyptic. It
stresses that Russia can regain superpower status _ its clear aim _
only if it pursues capitalism and integrates itself further into
the global economy and political system.
</P>
<P>
   On a list of threats to Russia's national security,
``complication of international relations'' came only at the end of
a parade of domestic dangers, including economic chaos, social
decay, crime and terrorism, political polarization and ethnic
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the document is laced with Soviet-style references to
``some countries,'' generally unnamed but clearly the United States
and Europe, said to be bent on global hegemony and thwarting
Russia's ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of ``some nations'' to bypass the United Nations'
global security mechanisms is a threat to Russian security, the
document states. So are efforts ``by other states'' to oppose
Russia's role as a locus in a multi-polar world and to weaken its
influence along its western and southern borders. The document also
warns that ``some countries`` are trying to dominate the flow of
information worldwide and to force Russia out of the information
market.
</P>
<P>
   And the text states that NATO's decision to use force outside
its borders, as it did in Yugoslavia, ``is a threat of
destabilization of the whole strategic situation.''

PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL KEYES' CAMPAIGN CENTERS ON MORALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   MONROE, Iowa _ Everything about Alan
Keyes is moving. Always moving.
<TEXT>
<P>
   His hands are ever gesturing. His feet carry him from side to
side, turning his body this way and that to make sure no part of
his audience can feel ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Even the voice moves, riding the scale in pitch while the volume
rises and dips to emphasize one point and the next.
</P>
<P>
   After talking, almost yelling, to a gymnasium full of high
school students for 15 minutes, he took a step closer to the
bleachers and lowered his voice in conspiratorial tone. It was as
if he's letting them all in on a dangerous secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a kernel of dignity in every person in this room,''
he said, ``not because any man says so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's determined by the great unmentionable, determined by the
one the courts say we can't talk about in the public schools, but
which our founders said you have to talk about. Remember?
`...endowed by their cre-a-tor.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the perpetual motion that is Keyes _ the radio talk show
host who could be president _ one thing stays put. His message
never changes.
</P>
<P>
   America, Keyes insists to everyone in earshot, is in a moral
crisis. The country's soul is in jeopardy because its children are
denied the moral teaching and discipline that he believes made the
great experiment of democracy a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the challenges that we face are fundamentally not
challenges that money could address,'' Keyes said as his speech
quickened and his arms lift toward the ceiling. ``They are
challenges that involve questions about our moral character, our
moral understanding, our moral commitment, about the kind of things
we do not because we get money for them, but because they're
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes' world is one where there is little danger of confusing
right from wrong, where faith in God holds America's best hope for
the future and a secular outlook devoid of religion threatens to
doom the world's last standing superpower.
</P>
<P>
   For Keyes, nothing marks so clearly the country's depravity than
abortion. He mocks the argument that carrying a child to term is a
``mother's choice.'' The U.S. Constitution, Keyes argues, makes no
room for abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are killing our children,'' he said. ``It threatens our
very freedom. If the unborn are not safe, no one is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually no question escapes Keyes' sermon on morality. What's
to be done about agriculture? Step in with a special banking system
that allows bumper crops to be stored for leaner times and save the
family farm. The family farm, by his reckoning, is the ``nursery of
America's moral character.''
</P>
<P>
   What about income taxes? Keyes contends they put the control of
all money in government hands. He calls them ``slave taxes,'' says
they should be eliminated entirely. Instead, Keyes would impose a
national sales tax with exemptions for life's necessities of food,
medicine and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you could determine how much money you want to give the
government,'' he said. ``You don't feel like giving money to the
government right now, you don't go out and get those extras.''
</P>
<P>
   He favors school vouchers that would allow parents to route tax
dollars into private schools. Keyes talks with disgust of
``government schools,'' places he says have sacrificed the goals of
discipline and classic education on an altar of liberal political
agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, his campaign doesn't much bother with specifics.
Keyes says nearly nothing about the programs he would overhaul,
launch or scrap. There is little room for that kind of talk, after
all, when the candidate is concerned with bigger things like
calling America to task for its failings of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that he's new to the alphabet soup of the federal
government. From 1978 to 1983 he held several low-level jobs in
various State Department outposts. Then he spent two years as
ambassador to the United Nations Economic &AMP; Social Council, and
three more as assistant secretary of state for international
organization affairs.
</P>
<P>
   During the Reagan administration he was a chief spokesman for
so-called ``constructive engagement'' with the then-white minority
government of South Africa and in opposition to boycotts and
sanctions. Today he talks of a much harder line with China, a force
he sees as formidable and scary.
</P>
<P>
   Although he talks derisively of politicians and the media, he's
belonged to both clubs. He twice ran for the Senate from Maryland,
and this is his second bid for the White House. Keyes briefly wrote
a syndicated newspaper column in the early 1990s and spent the last
half of the decade on AM radio as host of ``The Alan Keyes Show:
America's Wake-up Call.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 49, he wears a crucifix on a gold chain outside his shirt
but behind his tie. His coat lapel bears a gold pin of a pair of
feet of a fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to Rotary clubs, high schools or business luncheons he
plays the part of a congenial man of letters. Keyes is all
extemporaneous, themes repeated from one place to the next but the
language he uses is all eloquent. There's nothing timid or
rehearsed in his talks.
</P>
<P>
   But in debates with his rivals for the Republican nomination, or
in interviews with the reporters and television crews taking a
growing interest, he comes on more strident. He harangues fellow
candidates, regularly accusing them of dodging the nation's most
important issues _ his issues _ out of fear of dashing their
political fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again after debates, he has stormed into the nearby
rooms where reporters file their stories to complain that they pay
too little attention to his campaign because he is
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Lately he has seen his poll numbers spike a bit. Where once he
barely drew 1 percent in many surveys, a recent poll by The Des
Moines Register found him placing third with 9 percent of likely
caucus voters behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush and magazine
publisher Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he remains beyond skeptical of polls. Keyes said polls
are manipulated to make voters think some candidates have no chance
of winning. Lowering expectations for those candidates, he said,
could provide cover for vote fraud that wipes out the real support
they get in the ballot booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not paranoid. It's the world we live in,'' Keyes said.
``It's the danger that we get into if we put too much faith in
these polls....Don't turn (the election) over to pollsters. Don't
turn it over to media moguls.''

TRANSFER OF POWER IS VITAL PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When two of the most
powerful titans in American business relinquished their chief
executive officer titles this week, both demonstrated why they've
been so successful.
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Glass, who took Wal-Mart's leadership torch from Sam
Walton, announced Friday he was being succeeded by his chief
operating officer, Lee Scott. Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft,
did the same Thursday and handed his chief exec mantle to longtime
friend and lieutenant Steve Ballmer.
</P>
<P>
   At 64 and 44 years old respectively, Glass and Gates are as far
apart in age as they are in the types of Old Economy-New Economy
enterprises they have headed. What they showed in common, though,
by moving aside for the next management generation helps explain
their greatness as business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Their acknowledgement of the need for an orderly management
succession reassures the investing public they are willing to
sacrifice any ego-driven desire for power to what's best for the
company. It's consistent with their management track record, which
is reflected in the share price of their companies.
</P>
<P>
   Compare their actions to, say, Michael Eisner, who appears
unable to share power by grooming a successor at Disney. As
Wal-Mart and Microsoft investors have prospered, Disney stockholder
fortunes have withered, due partly to Eisner's failure to nurture
the next generation of top management.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as though Glass and Gates are out to pasture. Gates
remains chairman and ``chief software architect'' while Ballmer
deals with government trustbusters and competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Glass situation is more interesting from a Kansas City
perspective because he hopes to own the Royals and ensure the
continued community presence of major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be a matter of Glass withdrawing entirely from
Wal-Mart's affairs to hang a ``gone fishin' (for the Royals) sign
on his door. His intention to remain full-time for at least a year
with Wal-Mart as chairman of the board's powerful executive
committee implies he will remain a force at the company.
</P>
<P>
   There's often more to transitions than developing a successor
and giving him or her the opportunity to run the company. The wise
corporate leaders choose to remain handy long enough to finish the
mentoring process in real, operational time to ensure a smooth
transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
   The bonus for area residents concerned about the Royals' future
is that Glass now will probably have more time and energy to devote
to his dream of being a big-league baseball owner. His public
acceptance as an honorary Kansas Citian is virtually complete; all
that remains is for the baseball ownership club to approve his bid
to buy the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The reassuring aspect of this for Royals fans is that in Glass
they get not only a hard-core baseball devotee, but also one of the
20th Century's most able enterprise builders. The management skills
Glass honed helping build the Wal-Mart empire don't promise
miracles for the Royals, but they do promise it will be an
organization dedicated to doing its best to please its biggest
group of stakeholders, i.e., its fans.
</P>
<P>
   David Glass knows a lot about doing right by his stakeholders.
He proved it again this week.

A CLICK AND A PRAYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can a person talk to God on the Internet? The answer probably
depends on a person's concept of God and his or her powers of
concentration. The devout person might answer that the human heart
can pray just about anywhere, including Grand Central Station _ so
why not on the Web?
</P>
<P>
   Viewed broadly, the Web site ``newprayer.com'' is harmless
enough, offering a selection of inspirational writings and a place
for harried Net surfers to compose some spiritual thoughts of their
own and type them into a box.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed narrowly _ as site designers appear to have crafted it
and as many visitors seem to be using it _ the address makes a
presumptuous mockery of religious meditation, boasting of a direct
line to the infinite and promising to send prayers there via radio
transmitter.
</P>
<P>
   The destination is an ancient star cluster known as ``M13,''
chosen because NASA astronomers have pinpointed it as one of the
oldest clusters in the universe. The logic, or illogic, is that
anything that old must have been involved in the big bang and so
must have been touched by God.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply click on the PRAY button and transmit your prayer to
the only known location of God,'' read the directions, which also
explain that ``you will receive e-mail notification that your
prayer was sent.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about as mystical as ordering a book from Amazon.com.,
and it feeds into the ``click-click, buy-buy'' fever pervading much
of the Internet. The prayer site did start out selling its services
for $5 an order but pulled back after people complained _ Martin
Luther would be proud.
</P>
<P>
   It's a free country, and a person can post just about anything
out on the wild informational frontier. But the consumer, as ever,
must beware _ not only of financial scams but of the erosion of
meaning and cheapening of the sacred in an increasingly impersonal
technical age.
</P>
<P>
   Prayer is, or should be, deeply personal. It needs no radio
transmitter to reach its target, for it flows through the depths of
the soul _ as much a home to the infinite as any distant star.

A GOLAN HEIGHTS BLUEPRINT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Because of an Israeli penchant for leaking secrets to the press,
it was easy to foresee that sooner or later, developments in
Israeli-Syrian peace talks would be disclosed, as happened
Wednesday when the Israeli daily Ha'aretz published a Clinton
administration summary of what the two sides have agreed upon and
what remains in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   There were no startling revelations in the document. The leak
serves to inoculate Israeli public opinion against suspicions that
Prime Minister Ehud Barak is preparing to make excessive
concessions behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the leaked American draft of a treaty-in-progress has
the great virtue of demonstrating to Israelis and Syrians alike how
bridgeable are the differences between the two countries and how
close they are to a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The overview President Clinton presented to the two governments
ought to reassure skeptical Israelis on two crucial points. It
stipulates that Damascus has already agreed to joint Israeli-Syrian
management of the water resources on the Golan Heights and to an
early-warning station on the heights that would be under the
control of American and French security monitors.
</P>
<P>
   On both of these important issues, the tentative agreements
represent sage and practical compromises. They grant Israel what it
needs for economic and security purposes without forcing Syria to
cede on the principle of sovereignty over territory it lost in
wars.
</P>
<P>
   The published text suggests that the Americans are playing an
indispensable role. Since Israel wants to know what it can expect
from Syria on security and normalized relations before making its
own concessions on territory and since the Syrian ruler, Hafez
Assad, wants to know how much land he will retrieve before turning
over his cards on security, open borders, and trade, it is up to
Clinton to elicit from each side concessions conditioned on
concessions from the other side.
</P>
<P>
   What the published document does not mention is that Assad needs
to make peace with Israel in order to become a client of
Washington.

DEVEREUX MILBURN, 82, SPORTSMAN AND LAWYER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Devereux Milburn Jr., a sportsman and Wall Street lawyer who was
a skilled performer both on polo fields and in courtrooms, died on
Monday at his home in Narragansett, R.I. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   He had cancer, his son Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Milburn was a grandson of Charles Steele, a senior partner at
J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., the investment banking firm, and of John G.
Milburn, who in 1904 joined the Manhattan-based law firm that is
now Carter, Ledyard &AMP; Milburn, where Devereux Milburn Jr. became a
senior partner.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Old Westbury, N.Y., he graduated from St. Paul's School
in Concord, Mass., received a bachelor's degree in 1938 from Oxford
and his law degree in 1941 from Harvard. He served in North Africa
as a navigator on U.S. warplanes during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s and in the 1950s, Milburn, the son and
namesake of a noted polo player who was a pioneer of the game on
Long Island, made a name for himself in polo there. He rose to have
a handicap of six goals, meaning he was a fine player. Like his
father, he played as a back and was regarded as steady in that
defensive position. He was considered an excellent horseman and an
accurate shot with his long polo mallet.
</P>
<P>
   In those postwar years, he played with Long Islanders who were
also prominent polo players and wanted to keep the sport alive on
the East Coast. In 1950 he played with a team made up mostly of
fellow Long Islanders _ he lived most of his life in Old Westbury _
that won the U.S. Open championship.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960 Milburn suffered a polo-related elbow injury. He retired
from the game, but in later years he kept riding, took up
fox-hunting and was master of the Meadow Brook Foxhounds on Long
Island for almost a decade. For four decades he was president of
the sprawling Meadow Brook Club in Jericho, N.Y., with sports
facilities that for some years included three polo fields.
</P>
<P>
   He was a trustee of the New York Racing Association, a governor
of the Racquet Club in Manhattan and president of the Coaching Club
and of the Sportsmanship Brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   In the legal world, as the longtime chairman of Carter,
Ledyard's litigation department, Milburn argued and won two
significant cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, Eisen vs. Carlisle &AMP; Jacquelin (73-203), he
represented the defense in a class-action lawsuit against the way
Wall Street brokerage firms charged for small transactions. In a
seminal decision, the court, wanting to tighten the rules for
class-action suits, held that when a plaintiff files a class
action, every member of the class must be notified within a given
period of time, and that a U.S. district court must certify that it
is a proper class.
</P>
<P>
   The second case was U.S. Trust Co. vs. New Jersey (75-1687). The
U.S. Trust Co. of New York, the trustee of Port Authority bonds,
filed suit, contending that the state of New Jersey was trying to
violate the U.S. Constitution's clause about contracts by planning
certain new uses for funds that served, or might serve, as security
for the bondholders.
</P>
<P>
   Milburn represented the plaintiff, and the Supreme Court, in a
rare interpretation of the contract clause (Article I, Section 10),
ruled that if the Port Authority did put those funds to the new
uses, the Constitution would indeed be violated. Chief Justice
Warren E. Burger is said to have told a New Jersey judge at the
time that Milburn's argument in the case was extremely impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Milburn was also an expert in trust and estates law.
</P>
<P>
   Long active in the Democratic Party, he was co-chairman of
Citizens for Kennedy in Nassau County in 1960. He was also a
governor of New York Hospital in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Frank Milburn, of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife
of 61 years, Elizabeth Hinckley Milburn; three other sons, Devereux
III of Los Angeles, John of Williamsburg, Va., and Michael of
Woodbridge, Conn.; two daughters, Elizabeth Morris of Boxford,
Mass., and Nancy Milburn of Manhattan; and nine grandchildren. &QL;

STORR RESTORED; MURRAY ON INJURED RESERVE FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Goaltender Jamie Storr turned in his ice pack
Friday afternoon, but Glen Murray grabbed it before it had a chance
to melt.
</P>
<P>
   Storr, sidelined since Dec. 15 with a concussion, will be in
goal tonight when the Los Angeles Kings face the San Jose Sharks in
a matchup of struggling Pacific Division rivals. But Murray was
placed on injured reserve and could miss up to three weeks with a
bruised upper chest.
</P>
<P>
   Storr was scheduled to make a start for minor-league Long Beach
on Friday, but the Kings medical staff cleared him to play after
another shaky outing by Stephane Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   The news was tainted by the medical report on Murray, who left
Thursday's game in St. Louis in the first period after getting
checked into the boards by the Blues Tyson Nash.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it happened, we thought he broke his collarbone,'' coach
Andy Murray said. ``Craig Johnson had a similar injury and it cost
him 10 days. Our medical staff says this one looks worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The news couldn't be much worse for the Kings, who are 2-9-1 in
their past 12 games. But they also are looking at another two to
three weeks before first line center Jozef Stumpel returns from an
injured left knee. Stumpel, who missed 10 weeks after a hernia
operation earlier this season, has a muscle tear and a deep bone
bruise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This season has been a nightmare,'' Stumpel said Friday before
the team left for San Jose. ``I thought when I got back from the
first injury, I would be here the rest of the way and get to help
out. It is so hard to just watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the poor record the past month, the Kings (18-17-7)
remain seventh of eight teams in the Western Conference playoff
race. Even though Calgary and Edmonton are just one point back and
the Mighty Ducks three points behind, Storr says their competitive
record is the reason the morale on the club remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, this stretch has been bad, but we're in the playoff
hunt,'' he said. ``We are a .500 team. After all that's happened,
we still haven't lost sight of that. Last year we opened 2-9-2.
That meant just a few weeks into the season we already had to win
seven games to get to .500. That was demoralizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with all the injuries, we're still right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick whistles: With Murray gone, that leaves Luc Robitaille,
Ziggy Palffy and Bryan Smolinski as the only healthy players from
the first two lines on opening night. Donald Audette is a week away
with a sprained left ankle. But there are concerns about Palffy,
who missed Friday's practice with lower-back soreness that has
bothered him the past five weeks. Until the injury, Palffy was the
team's leading scorer, but since then he has just two goals and has
missed four games with back problems. ``This is something that is
going to be with him the rest of the year,'' Andy Murray said. ``He
had so much jump in his game at the beginning of the season and
that is missing now.'' ... Aki Berg, who was benched after playing
poorly against Ottawa, will not play tonight against San Jose.

`SMART' APPLIANCES COMING SOON TO A KITCHEN NEAR YOU

<P>
   Futurists have long predicted the thinking toaster and the
Internet-ready refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   But the first ``smart'' kitchen appliances to hit stores may be
the coffeemaker and the mixer.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam Corp. plans to unveil nine intelligent home appliances
next week at the International Housewares Show in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The devices that talk to each other should be in stores by the
end of the year. The product line includes an alarm clock, smoke
detectors, an electric blanket, a blood-pressure monitor and a
bathroom scale.
</P>
<P>
   If you set your alarm 15 minutes earlier than usual, the smart
clock tells the coffee machine to start percolating earlier and
tells the blanket to cool down earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The clock's modem can connect to the Internet to wake you with
weather reports or sports scores.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunbeam has competition to be first in stores, said Joyce
Putscher, an analyst at Cahners In-Stat in Scottsdale. Whirlpool
and Cisco Systems are developing a line of computer-enhanced
refrigerators, stoves and dishwashers.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam says most of the products will cost about the same as
today's lower-IQ coffeemakers and mixers, $50 to $90.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a nice, cute product,'' Dataquest analyst Jay
Srivatsa said. ``But I don't see a mass market this year.'' &QL;

SUPREME COURT AGREES TO HEAR A `PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION' CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to add clarifying material to 5th graf.)  
(lh) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Adding an abortion case to its docket for the first
time in eight years, the Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide
whether a Nebraska law banning a procedure the state calls
``partial birth abortion'' is constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The justices plan to hear the case in April and decide it by
early summer. The election-year ruling could have a substantial
impact on the fractious politics of abortion, although it may not
resolve questions about all the similar, but differently worded,
prohibitions that 30 states have adopted in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The Nebraska law, which is broadly written and lacks an
exception to protect the health of pregnant women, was declared
unconstitutional last year by a federal appeals court, which also
struck down similar laws in Iowa and Arkansas. Nearly
simultaneously, a different appeals court upheld laws in Wisconsin
and Illinois, creating the judicial conflict that the Supreme Court
is acting quickly to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   In their order late Friday granting Nebraska's appeal, the
justices indicated that they are not interested in revisiting the
basic question of the constitutional status of abortion. Nebraska
had asked the court to reconsider its decisions establishing a
right to abortion, but the justices granted review only on specific
questions of whether the Nebraska law is consistent with those
precedents.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other states' laws, the Nebraska law applies to
procedures used to terminate pregnancies in which the fetuses
cannot yet live outside the womb, up to about the 24th week of
pregnancy. The procedures in question are used to terminate
second-trimester pregnancies. At this stage of pregnancy, the
Supreme Court ruled eight years ago in Planned Parenthood vs.
Casey, states may not place an ``undue burden'' on a woman's access
to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In striking down the Nebraska law in its ruling last September,
the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in St. Louis, said that
because the Nebraska law would have the effect of prohibiting ``the
most common method of second-trimester abortion,'' it constituted
an ``undue burden'' and meant that the court had a ``duty to
declare the statute invalid.''
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion for the appeals court, which sits in St. Louis,
Judge Richard S. Arnold said that the phrase partial birth
abortion, ``though widely used by lawmakers and in the popular
press, has no fixed medical or legal content.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nebraska law, which was passed in 1997 but has been blocked
from taking effect, contains this description of the abortion
technique it prohibits: ``an abortion procedure in which the person
performing the abortion partially delivers vaginally a living
unborn child before killing the unborn child and completing the
delivery.'' The term ``partially delivers'' is in turn defined as
``deliberately and intentionally delivering into the vagina a
living unborn child or a substantial portion thereof.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said the phrase ``substantial portion'' was
the law's ``crucial problem'' because it meant that the prohibition
applied to a range of abortion procedures used quite early in
pregnancy, in which a doctor pulls fetal parts from the uterus
through the birth canal. Although Nebraska argued that its
legislature had in fact not intended to ban this common procedure,
known as dilation and evacuation, the appeals court said that ``we
cannot, however, twist the words of the law and give them a meaning
they cannot reasonably bear.''
</P>
<P>
   In its Supreme Court appeal, Stenberg vs. Carhart, No. 99-830,
the state is arguing that the appeals court should have adopted a
narrower reading of the law to prohibit only a variant of a
procedure known as intact dilation and extraction. In this
procedure, which is used infrequently but became widely known
through its graphic depiction during congressional debates on the
issue, a more fully developed fetus is brought feet first through
the birth canal, leaving the largest part, the head, inside the
uterus. The skull is then collapsed and its contents suctioned in
order to enable it to pass through the cervix.
</P>
<P>
   While this procedure is often referred to as a late-term
abortion, it takes place before fetal viability, up to about 24
weeks of pregnancy. Even under Roe vs. Wade, the court has
permitted states to ban abortions after viability, with exceptions
for the pregnant woman's life and health, and most states have long
had such prohibitions, which are not at stake in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leroy Carhart of Bellevue, Neb., who challenged the state
law, performs about 20 of the intact abortions a year, as well as
many other abortions at earlier stages of pregnancy that the
appeals court found would also be covered by the law. Doctors
performing abortions generally seek to keep the fetus as intact as
possible to avoid injury to the wall of the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   Carhart's lawyer, Simon Heller of the Center for Reproductive
Law and Policy in New York, said Friday that although he would have
preferred that the Supreme Court let the lower court's decision
stand, he thought that of all the cases on their way to the court,
Nebraska's case was the best for the court to have accepted because
of a strong record compiled at trial on the safety and health
reasons for the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign against `partial birth abortion' has simply been
a campaign of deception orchestrated to demonize abortion in the
eyes of the public,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   James Bopp Jr., general counsel of the National Right to Life
Committee, said that even under Roe vs. Wade, bans on the procedure
could and should be upheld because the court's precedents upholding
the right to abortion did not apply to `'the killing of living
infants who are only inches away from being fully born alive.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has twice vetoed proposed federal laws. A law
