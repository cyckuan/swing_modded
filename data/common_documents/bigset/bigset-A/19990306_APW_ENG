<HEADLINE> Activists Expect Personal Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- As impeachment fades to a messy memory,  
activists in key early states are bracing for another bruising 
round of fighting over the personal foibles of politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Though polls show most voters do not care, some Republican  
activists are loathe to forgive even youthful indiscretions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are those who say a leopard can't change his spots,''  
said Chuck Hurley, a leading social conservative and former 
legislator. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is somebody going to push it? Absolutely,'' said veteran GOP  
activist Mary Boate. ``The questions will be asked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa's precinct caucuses next February mark the initial  
high-profile test of the presidential nominating season. The nature 
of Iowa's caucus system and the nation's political climate in the 
wake of a year-long battle over presidential sexual misconduct have 
set the stage for a campaign with a distinctly personal touch. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain already  
have faced questioning. Bush concedes he ``did some irresponsible 
things when I was young and irresponsible,'' and McCain has 
admitted to being responsible for the ending of his first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Both argue those indiscretions happened years ago, and they  
decline to discuss them further. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent polls show a majority of Americans, about 60 percent,  
believe presidential candidates should be held to a higher moral 
standard than average Americans. But four out of five do not want 
candidates asked if they ever have committed adultery. 
</P>
<P>
	While President Clinton survived, Republicans are campaigning  
among an electorate likely to be much less tolerant of misbehavior, 
some argue. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are going to have to assume that when they come to Iowa  
and New Hampshire, they are going to have to explain all that 
stuff,'' said Bob Haus, a respected GOP strategist who has signed 
on with publisher Steve Forbes. ``That's the beauty of a small 
state. The questions get asked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exit polling in Iowa in 1996 showed a third of caucus-goers  
identified with the conservative Christian Coalition and said 
``conservative values'' were the most important quality in a 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Consultant Greg Mueller says the character of the Republican  
primary electorate will dictate the tenor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republican Party treats personal behavior differently than  
Democrats,'' said Mueller. ``We tend to punish people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are other views, including that of Chuck Larson, a young  
Republican legislator who led a delegation to Austin, Texas, urging 
Bush to make the race. He said conservatives accept Bush's 
confessions and do not want details. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bush says he's not going to inventory his sins and I'm very  
comfortable with that,'' Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Reed, a former head of the Christian Coalition who is now  
offering advice to Bush, said Christian conservatives lean toward 
accepting confessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if someone has made a mistake in their past,  
particularly in the distant past, it's going to be very low in the 
hierarchy of concerns,'' said Reed. ``There's a deep reservoir 
among moral conservatives for forgiveness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There also are differing takes on how Clinton's experience will  
affect the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Mueller argued that GOP voters are going to make very sure they  
nominate a candidate who is squeaky clean. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next time around we've got to make sure we've taken care of  
the problem,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Clinton's experience has largely negated the potency  
of these kinds of issues,'' Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others argue that the nature of the caucus process automatically  
will make personal issues important. 
</P>
<P>
	Not many people go to caucuses -- fewer than 100,000 in 1996 --  
and those who do must stand up in front of neighbors and friends 
and declare their support. Most want to meet and talk with 
candidates before making a choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Though most people say they are sick of personal revelations,  
Boate said something more complex is at work. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not talking a lot about it in public,'' she said.  
``Are they talking about it over the coffee table? Are they talking 
about it after church? They probably are.''

<HEADLINE> Ill. Mom Charged in Kids' Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHEATON, Ill. (AP) -- A nurse authorities say used prescription  
medication to put her three children to sleep and then suffocate 
them was charged Saturday with murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Marilyn Lemak, 41, was under police watch at a hospital in  
Naperville, a Chicago suburb, with minor injuries and was expected 
to be jailed Sunday, prosecutor Joseph Birkett said. Police said 
Mrs. Lemak's wounds were self-inflicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Birkett declined to discuss a possible motive.  
</P>
<P>
	``Why people do horrible things to children is not for me to  
think about,'' Birkett said. ``There's no good reason to kill three 
beautiful children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lemak and her husband, Dr. David Lemak, were separated and  
getting a divorce. Birkett said the children's father was 
``devastated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was according to all the info we have a very concerned and  
caring father and he saw his children regularly,'' Birkett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found the bodies of 7-year-old Nicholas, 6-year-old Emily  
and 3-year-old Thomas Lemak Friday morning after Mrs. Lemak called 
them to her two-story Victorian home in a historic part of town. 
</P>
<P>
	Birkett said after Mrs. Lemak drugged the children she ``then  
put them to bed and then manually suffocated them by placing one 
hand over the mouth and then pinching the nose of each child as 
they slept until they were dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials wouldn't say what type of medication Mrs. Lemak  
allegedly gave her children. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lemak is charged with three counts of first-degree murder  
and is expected to appear in court Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the children's deaths rocked their Naperville  
neighborhood, which is designated a historic district by the city 
because of the cluster of 19th century homes there. The Lemaks had 
won awards for their restoration work, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several neighbors described the Lemaks and their children as the  
``All-American family.''

<HEADLINE> Greene Advances to 60 Meter Semis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAEBASHI, Japan (AP) -- Maurice Greene, the indoor world  
record-holder in the 60 meters, and Gail Devers, the two-time world 
indoor champion, did not have auspicious debuts at the 1999 World 
Indoor Championships Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Upset by a false start against him and a series of false starts  
against several other sprinters in the first round, Greene was last 
out of the blocks in his heat and finished second to Georgios 
Theodoridis of Greece. Both were timed in 6.56 seconds, but the 
little-known Theodoridis, who ran his personal best, was declared 
the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the setback, Greene, whose world record is 6.39,  
advanced to Sunday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system is too sensitive, but you've got to deal with  
whatever it is,'' Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Harden, who beat Greene in the final of the USA  
Championships last week, won his heat in 6.51, edging Jamaica's 
Donovan Powell, also at 6.51. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 60 heats, Devers, owner of the fastest time in  
the world this year at 6.98, also was beaten by a Greek. 
</P>
<P>
	Katerina Thanou, the 1996 European indoor champion, outraced  
Devers in 7.01, making her the No. 6 performer in history. Devers, 
the 1993 and 1997 indoor champion and the 1992 and 1996 100-meter 
gold medalist, was a distant second at 7.14. 
</P>
<P>
	In another heat, Philomina Mensah of Canada clocked 7.02,  
putting her in a tie for seventh on the all-time performers' list. 
</P>
<P>
	Devers' American teammate, Inger Miller, won her heat in a  
personal-best 7.07. 
</P>
<P>
	After six events of the heptathlon, France's Sebastian Chmara  
held a four-point lead over Erkl Nool of Estonia. Chmara had a 
total of 5,489 points, as only 74 points separated the top five 
heptathletes going into the final event, the 1,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	International track and field officials might have to reconsider  
a pole vault rule that gave France's Jean Galfione the title over 
American Jeff Hartwig. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversial rule came into question Saturday night when  
Galfione, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist, touched the bar while 
clearing 6.00 meters (19 feet, 8 1-4 inches) 
</P>
<P>
	The rule specifies that it's a foul if a vaulter deliberately,  
with his hands or his fingers, tries to replace the bar that is 
about to fall from the supports. 
</P>
<P>
	Galfione admitted that he touched the bar, and Canada's Cecil  
Smith, the meet's technical delegate, agreed, questioning the 
clearance to the event referee. However, Smith was overruled by the 
referee. 
</P>
<P>
	``He chose to take a different interpretation,'' Smith said. ``I  
can live with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't a decision that went over big with Hartwig, U.S.  
officials and other American athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe this will finally convince the powers that be to  
reconsider the rule because it's a bad rule that affects the sport 
and the show we want to provide,'' Hartwig said, after settling for 
second place with an American indoor record of 5.95 meters (19-6 
1-4). 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is that the rule is so vaguely written that it  
becomes a judgment call and takes it out of the hands of the 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel robbed. I was happy for Jean. But I was upset  
about the rule because I probably touch the bar more than 
anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the competition, when Galfione was declared the winner,  
U.S. assistant coach Greg Foster paid a $100 fee to the 
International Amateur Athletic Federation, the world governing 
body, to protest the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-man IAAF jury of appeals reviewed the jump on videotape  
and rejected the U.S. appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was rejected after careful analysis of the super slow  
motion of the vault,'' the IAAF said in a statement. ``They 
concluded that rule 172.6 (d) has not been violated. Therefore, 
there is no reason to change the referee's decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the way the American team saw it.  
</P>
<P>
	``They (the jury members) admitted that he touched the bar, but  
they don't feel he replaced it,'' said Craig Masback, chief 
executive officer of USA Track and Field. ``They made a mockery of 
the rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Either get rid of the rule and I'll accept the decision, or  
enforce the rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it was intentional or deliberate, his hand touched it,  
it steadied it. He then pushed it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster and Russ Rogers, U.S. men's head coach, agreed with  
Masback. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why would you touch the bar other than to replace it?'' Rogers  
said. ``To make sure it doesn't fall off, of course. 
</P>
<P>
	``He definitely put his hands on it twice. We saw it clearly in  
slow motion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster said, ``There's no question he was well below the bar and  
pushing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other U.S. vaulter, Nick Hysong, concurred.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at the video, it looks like he held it up,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Claude Vollmer, one of the French team leaders, claimed  
it's a good rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't try to replace the bar,'' Vollmer said.  
</P>
<P>
	That's the way Galfione viewed it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I touched the bar, but I didn't push it back,'' he said after  
becoming only the fourth vaulter ever to clear 6.00 meters (19-8 
1-4) indoors. The others are world record-holder Sergei Bubka of 
Ukraine and Rodion Gataullin and Maksim Tarasov, both of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Galfione then missed three times at 6.05 meters (19-10 1-4).  
</P>
<P>
	The Frenchman had much sympathy for Hartwig,  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel sorry for Jeff,'' he said. ``The law is stupid, but the  
law is the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig said the 10-minute delay in discussing the decision on  
the field threw off his momentum and timing, as he then missed 
three times at 6.00 (19-8 1-4). 
</P>
<P>
	An IAAF official saw it differently.  
</P>
<P>
	``The important thing,'' said Istvan Gyulai, IAAF secretary  
general, ``is that the vaulters knew what was going on all the 
time. Hartwig did not go into his vaults (at 6.00, 19-8 1-4) 
thinking he was the winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig didn't agree with Gyulai.  
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to stay focused on my jumps, but with such a  
distraction, it was very hard. I think it's a terrible rule exactly 
becsuse of what happened today.''

<HEADLINE> Spielberg Wins Award From Guild </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Steven Spielberg won the Directors Guild of  
America's award on Saturday night for ``Saving Private Ryan,'' 
making him and the epic World War II film strong favorites for 
Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	In voting by the union for filmmakers, Spielberg defeated  
Roberto Benigni of ``Life is Beautiful,'' John Madden of 
``Shakespeare in Love,'' Terrence Malick of ``The Thin Red Line,'' 
and Peter Weir of ``The Truman Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am so happy. I'm like so -- '' Spielberg said, interrupting  
himself as he dropped the plaque onto the podium with a clunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Back stage, Spielberg joked, ``I can't believe I dropped it.''  
</P>
<P>
	He dedicated the award to his father, Arnold Spielberg, and his  
father's World War II generation. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg noted that the award came at a time in which all five  
directors were nominated for both DGA awards and Academy Awards for 
historical films, three dealing with the World War II period and 
two with the Elizabethan era. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are finding ways of embracing history,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Saving Private Ryan,'' which follows a squad of soldiers sent  
to find a private whose brothers were killed in the war, was 
nominated for 11 Academy Awards, second only to ``Shakespeare in 
Love,'' with 13. 
</P>
<P>
	In winning a DGA award, Spielberg stands a strong chance of  
getting a director's award at the Oscars on March 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Only four times has the DGA winner not repeated at the Academy  
Awards. The winner of the directing Oscar also usually sees his 
film take a best picture award. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg has won three DGA awards, also getting honors for  
``The Color Purple,'' (1985) and ``Schindler's List,'' (1993). 
``Schindler's List'' went on to win seven Academy Awards, including 
best picture and best director. 
</P>
<P>
	In the DGA's television categories, Paris Barcklay won for the  
emotionally gripping episode of ``NYPD Blue'' in which Jimmy Smits' 
character dies, and Michael Cristofer won for the television movie 
``Gia.'' The documentary DGA award went to the makers of ``Vietnam: 
Long Time Coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Director's Guild of America represents more than 10,000  
members working in American cities and abroad. Their work is 
represented in theatrical, industrial, educational and documentary 
films as well as television shows, movies and commercials.

<HEADLINE> Czechs See Hope in Boeing Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- A black-and-white photo on the  
wall of Aero Vodochody's production hangar shows the heyday of the 
Warsaw Pact arms industry -- row after row of sleek MiG fighters 
coming off the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Look around the mostly empty hangar today and see the Czech  
company's contemporary history -- a few light attack planes 
lingering from a busted 1991 deal with Nigeria, and a handful of 
workers who head for their posts when the boss walks in. 
</P>
<P>
	A closer view reveals the future.  
</P>
<P>
	The boss is an American from Boeing Co. who became president  
last year when Boeing bought a 35 percent stake in Aero Vodochody. 
Coming down the production line is the first L159 light fighter 
jet, a Cold War hybrid that mates a Warsaw Pact favorite with 
high-tech Western electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott White, a Californian who jointly runs Aero Vodochody with  
Czech chief executive officer Adam Stranak, explained that Boeing 
bought in to get a share of the Central European market formerly 
closed to the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing considers its investment a strategic move to expand its  
product line and possibly bring more contracts and influence in the 
region, White said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also mentioned the possibility that the partnership with the  
Czech Republic's major airplane maker could boost Boeing's chance 
of winning a big fighter aircraft sale to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The F-18, produced by Boeing after it took over McDonnell  
Douglas Corp., is considered a front-runner for a possible joint 
purchase by Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to bring their 
air forces to NATO standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Preparing Aero Vodochody to compete on global markets required  
major changes, White said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Warsaw Pact days, Aero Vodochody ``never had the  
training or the focus to make a profit,'' he said. ``They were 
basically a producer of airplanes. That was it. They didn't have to 
sell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White said Boeing, despite its minority holding, exerted  
management control by taking three of the five board seats and 
trimming 10 percent of the work force, down to 2,200. It opened 
communications with unions and workers to head off protests over 
the layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not stupid. They understand,'' White said. ``We had  
people standing around not doing anything.''

<HEADLINE> Singer George Jones Hurt in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) -- Country singer George Jones was in  
critical condition Saturday after he smashed his sport-utility 
vehicle into a bridge near his home while talking on a cellular 
phone to his stepdaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 67, lost control of his Lexus while rounding a bend on  
Highway 96, a curvy heavily-traveled two-lane road, and hit the 
bridge abutment, state police said. Police said Jones was not 
wearing a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
	It took rescuers about two hours to free him following the 1:30  
p.m. accident, and he was taken by helicopter to Vanderbilt 
University Medical Center in nearby Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said Jones suffered a collapsed lung, ruptured his liver  
and had internal bleeding. He was placed on a ventilator to aid in 
his breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was unconscious when he was brought in and doctors gave  
him medication to keep him that way, Dr. John Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The body responds to this kind of injury much better if we can  
control the pain and the blood pressure and so on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris offered no prognosis but said he expects Jones will  
remain in critical condition for at least one or two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, famous for hits like ``He Stopped Loving Her Today'' and  
``The Race is On,'' is generally considered one of the finest 
country singers ever. He was married for six years to the late 
singer Tammy Wynette. The pair were known as ``The King and Queen 
of Country Music'' in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1983, Jones has been married to Nancy Jones, his manager.  
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed ``Possum,'' Jones was born near Saratoga, Texas. At  
16, he landed his first job as a musician, being paid $17.50 a week 
to play guitar with a husband-and-wife singing team in bars and 
dance halls. 
</P>
<P>
	After two years in the Marines, he returned to Texas and began a  
recording career that has spanned 40 years, making him one of 
country music's top stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones has battled alcoholism and drug abuse during much of his  
life. He was given the nickname ``No Show Jones'' for failing to 
appear at so many concerts and later recorded a song by that name. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1992.  
That same year, country fans and the media voted ``He Stopped 
Loving Her Today'' the most popular country song of all time. The 
1980 weeper was about a man whose love for a woman died only when 
he did. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones has been working on a new album for Asylum Records and is  
also host of ``The George Jones Show'' on television's The 
Nashville Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Evelyn Shriver, head of Asylum Records, Jones' record label,  
said Jones called her from his car five or 10 minutes before the 
crash. He was listening to seven new songs he had recorded and was 
so excited he wanted to play them for her over the phone but could 
not get his cassette player to work, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said his stepdaughter, Adina Estes, later told her she was  
talking to him when the crash happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was calling to say he's almost home, and she heard the  
crash and everything,'' Shriver said.

<HEADLINE> Rodney King Arrested for Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) -- Rodney King was arrested Friday on  
charges he beat his 16-year-old daughter and her mother, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 33, was booked for investigation of spousal battery, child  
abuse and vandalism. He was released after posting $6,850 bail, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, it was just a family misunderstanding, and it's  
been (blown) way out of proportion,'' King said after being 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	An arrest warrant charges that King committed the assault on  
Jan. 31 at a home in Fontana, east of Los Angeles. Police responded 
to the disturbance but did not arrest King at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they did not know whether the woman was King's  
ex-wife or girlfriend, and refused to release the names of the 
alleged victims. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Carmen Simpson told KNBC-TV on Thursday that she was  
the woman beaten by King. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in trouble again and he did something this time to his  
daughter that he shouldn't have done and he needs to pay,'' said 
Ms. Simpson, who claimed to be King's girlfriend and the mother of 
one of his daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	King's lawyer, Edi M.O. Faal, denied the allegations against his  
client. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a parent, Mr. King decided to step in and take her out of  
the situation, and (to) admonish her as a parent,'' Faal said. 
``And that conduct is now being turned into allegedly criminal 
conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King, who is black, gained international attention when he was  
beaten by Los Angeles police officers in 1991. The beating was 
captured on videotape by an amateur cameraman. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1992 acquittal of four white officers in the beating sparked  
three days of rioting. 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1994, a jury awarded King $3.8 million in damages, but  
much of it went to his lawyers.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Restructuring Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force is moving to limit overseas  
deployments, setting a new standard of 90 days in every 15 months 
for most service members based in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to take a lot of unpredictability out of people's  
lives,'' Acting Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes, to take place no later than next January, are an  
attempt by the Air Force to ease the strain of frequent foreign 
missions, low morale and a troubling exodus of pilots to 
higher-paying airline jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The overhaul, the first major one for the Air Force since the  
end of the Cold War, establishes 10 main ``expeditionary'' groups 
that would rotate responsibility for foreign deployments. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the forces for military-type missions, an  
additional five groups were set up to handle humanitarian missions 
such as last year's delivery of aid to victims of Hurricane Mitch 
in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	And for the first time, members of the Air Force Reserve and Air  
National Guard would be included among the rotations. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll still be pulling some travels, you'll still be flying  
jets or whatever you do. But you're going to know when that's going 
to be,'' Peters said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of disillusioned military pilots told a House Armed  
Services subcommittee earlier this week that it wasn't just the 
bigger salaries at airlines that were coaxing them to leave the 
military -- but also poor working conditions and almost constant 
overseas assignments, sometimes coming with only a few days' 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new structure, Air Force crews would know well in  
advance when they might be sent overseas -- and for how long they'd 
have to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters said almost 70 percent of the 365,000 active-duty  
personnel are married, many with children, a reversal of the force 
during the Vietnam War, when a similar percentage was single. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people are being run pretty ragged,'' he acknowledged.  
</P>
<P>
	For military missions, the new groups are intended to deploy  
anywhere in the world within 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Each ``air expeditionary force'' unit will average about 15,000  
people and about 175 planes, including fighter jets and heavy 
bombers, as well as reconnaissance, electronic warfare, refueling 
and transport aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The aircraft will be based at separate airfields, but air crews  
will train together. Two groups will be on duty at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 main ``air expeditionary force'' units will have  
headquarters at the following Air Force bases: Hill, Utah; Dyess, 
Texas; Elmendorf, Alaska; Davis Monthan, Ariz.; Shaw, S.C.; 
Barksdale, La.; Ellsworth, S.D.; Cannon, N.M.; and Langley, Va., as 
well as Lakenheath Air Base in England. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the five units that will focus only on humanitarian  
aid missions have headquarters at these Air Force bases: Pope, 
N.C.; Travis, Calif.; McConnell, Kan.; Grand Forks, N.D.; and 
Fairchild, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Two additional units, at Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho,  
and Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, N.C., would not be part of the 
usual rotation but would remain on call at all times as backup 
units. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force cited as a reason for the overhaul a fourfold jump  
in the number of foreign operations over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The overhaul also brings the 125,000 people in Air Force Reserve  
and Air National Guard units into the rotation schedule. It would 
not affect those permanently attached to most overseas bases, 
including those in Europe, South Korea and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Urges Individual Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Individual taxpayers, not the government,  
should control investment decisions when it comes to Social 
Security, House Speaker Dennis Hastert said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Republicans' weekly radio address, the Illinois  
congressman said he agrees with the Clinton administration that 
Social Security needs to get a better return on its investment 
dollars. But Hastert said he wants to enable individuals to decide 
how to divert their Social Security taxes into the stock market. 
Republicans have expressed unease in the past that letting the 
government make such decisions ultimately would lead to political 
interference in financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert also said Republicans want to do more than put aside 62  
percent of the budget surplus to shore up Social Security, as 
President Clinton has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our proposal will lock away every penny of the Social Security  
surplus for our nation's senior citizens. It will also create a 
safe deposit box to make sure that these funds cannot be raided for 
wasteful spending programs,'' Hastert said. ``Social Security is a 
trust fund for the American people, not a slush fund for the 
federal government to use it as it pleases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., voiced similar  
thoughts Friday, accusing Clinton of trying to turn Social Security 
into a slush fund for foreign aid by using it to help Central 
American victims of Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's assertion was based on Clinton's plan to use federal  
surpluses to pay for the bulk of a $1.9 billion emergency measure 
approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee. All of this year's 
projected $111 billion budget surplus comes from Social Security, 
which is building up reserves to handle the retirements of baby 
boomers as they begin a decade from now. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton economic adviser Gene Sperling noted earlier Friday that  
under budget law, federal surpluses can be used to pay for any item 
that both Congress and the president designate an emergency.

	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Smoke in the cabin forced a Boeing 757  
with at least 150 people on board to make an emergency landing 
Saturday at Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was traveling from Atlanta to Washington, D.C., when

<HEADLINE> Singer George Jones Hurt in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) -- Country singer George Jones was in  
critical condition Saturday after he smashed his sport-utility 
vehicle into a bridge near his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 67, lost control of his Lexus while rounding a curve on  
Highway 96, a curvy heavily-traveled two-lane road, and hit the 
bridge abutment, Tennessee Highway Patrol spokeswoman Dana Keeton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no word on how fast Jones was traveling or whether  
alcohol was involved. State police said Jones was not wearing a 
seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
	It took rescuers about two hours to free him following the 1:30  
p.m. accident, and he was taken by helicopter to Vanderbilt 
University Medical Center in nearby Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital spokesman Wayne Wood said Jones was being evaluated by  
doctors. He said he did not know if the injuries were 
life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, famous for hits like ``He Stopped Loving Her Today'' and  
``The Race is On,'' is generally considered one of the finest 
country singers ever. He was married for six years to the late 
singer Tammy Wynette. The pair were known as ``The King and Queen 
of Country Music'' in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1983, Jones has been married to Nancy Jones, his manager.  
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed ``Possum,'' Jones was born near Saratoga, Texas. At  
16, he landed his first job as a musician, being paid $17.50 a week 
to play guitar with a husband-and-wife singing team in bars and 
dance halls. 
</P>
<P>
	After two years in the Marines, he returned to Texas and began a  
recording career that has spanned 40 years, making him one of 
country music's top stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones has battled alcoholism and drug abuse during much of his  
life. He was given the nickname ``No Show Jones'' for failing to 
appear at so many concerts and later recorded a song by that name. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1992.  
That same year, country fans and the media voted ``He Stopped 
Loving Her Today'' the most popular country song of all time. The 
1980 weeper was about a man whose love for a woman died only when 
he did. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones has been working on a new album for Asylum Records and is  
also host of ``The George Jones Show'' on The Nashville Network.

<HEADLINE> Wilson Wins Gymnastics Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Blaine Wilson became the fourth  
gymnast to win three American Cup titles, posting the best scores 
in three of six events Saturday to beat American teammate Jason 
Gatson. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennie Thompson completed an American sweep when she edged  
Russia's Elena Produnova for the women's crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson joined former national champions Bart Conner, Mary Lou  
Retton and Kurt Thomas as a three-time winner of the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be a part of history is sweet,'' said Wilson, a three-time  
U.S. all-around champion. ``This was definitely my toughest 
American Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson won the title with 57.025 points, earning his best score  
of 9.775 on the rings. He also topped the individual scores with a 
9.575 in the parallel bars and 9.550 in the vault. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson was second with 56.800 points, unable to top the list on  
any apparatus but posting the second-best score four times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows that the U.S. is coming on strong,'' Gatson said.  
``It is a good steppingstone for national championships and world 
championships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bulgaria's Jordan Jovtchev was third after posting the best  
scores on the pommel horse and in floor exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson also didn't post the best score in any single event and  
finished second only once, in the uneven bars. But she managed to 
avoid the trouble that felled former U.S. champion Vanessa Atler 
and defending American Cup titleist Viktoria Karpenko of Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really excited,'' said Thompson, who finished with  
37.861 points. ``My routines were almost as good as I can do 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Produnova led by .419 heading to the final event, the floor  
exercise, but stumbled with a score of 9.012 -- third lowest among 
the eight finalists. Thompson scored a 9.450, finishing with 37.861 
points to Produnova's 37.842. 
</P>
<P>
	Atler, who won three individual-event titles on Friday night,  
finished third after a fall on the uneven bars gave her only a 
score of 8.462. Karpenko was fourth after also struggling on the 
bars.

	LONDON (AP) -- All factions of the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo  
have promised to sign a peace plan that would give them autonomy, 
the Clinton administration said. The pledge, if carried out, would 
intensify pressure on the Serbs to sign or face NATO airstrikes. 
Former Sen. Bob Dole, who negotiated the agreement at the request 
of President Clinton, told Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
today he was confident Kosovo's Albanians would follow through. 
That would leave the Serbs' refusal to accept NATO's peacekeeping

<HEADLINE> Tyson Won't Face More Jail in Ind. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson can  
look forward to restarting his boxing career now that his legal 
problems are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see no reason why he doesn't resume training and fighting''  
once he is released from a Maryland jail, James Voyles, Tyson's 
Indianapolis lawyer, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson must serve an extra 60 days in a Maryland jail for  
violating his Indiana probation for a 1992 rape conviction, under 
an agreement filed Friday in Marion County (Ind.) Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Tyson will actually be released from jail and resume  
his career is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's 60-day sentence for violating probation won't affect his  
Nevada boxing license, said Kirk Hendrick, legal counsel for the 
Nevada State Athletic Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hendrick said just having the license doesn't guarantee  
Tyson's right to fight. He said a promoter has to put together a 
card that would include Tyson, and that card would have to be 
approved by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are probably some tough questions Mike and his people  
would have to answer'' if promoters sought commission approval for 
such a card, Hendrick said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's 60-day sentence will begin at the end of the one year he  
is serving in Montgomery County, Md., for a misdemeanor assault. 
The Maryland sentence still could be reduced for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana authorities could have forced Tyson to serve up to four  
years in prison, but they wanted to resolve the issue at no further 
cost to taxpayers while still holding Tyson accountable, Marion 
County prosecutor Scott Newman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were frankly not anxious -- and I don't think the people of  
Indiana were anxious -- to have Mike Tyson back in our courts and in 
our jails,'' Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson will pay Indiana $80 per day, or a total of $4,800, for  
the cost of his incarceration, and Indiana will reimburse Maryland 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Tyson admitted he violated his probation.  
He also waived his right to appeal his no-contest plea to charges 
he assaulted two men after a minor traffic accident in August. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving the additional 60 days, his record will show that  
his Indiana probation was terminated as ``unsatisfactory,'' the 
agreement said. That would be taken into consideration if Tyson 
gets into legal trouble again.

	Tyson's probation was scheduled to end March 24. If he had been  
forced to appear in court in Indiana on a probation violation, he 
probably would have withdrawn his Maryland plea and appealed his 
sentence, Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would have been protracted litigation in this matter,  
probably in two states,'' Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was signed Thursday by Newman, Tyson and Voyles  
and was accepted Friday by Judge Patricia Gifford, who had 
sentenced Tyson for his 1992 conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson began serving his Maryland sentence Feb. 5. He had until  
Sunday to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Evander Holyfield, who has twice beaten Tyson in the ring, was  
unmoved when told that Tyson will serve an extra 60 days for 
violating parole. Tyson was disqualified for biting Holyfield's 
ears in their last fight, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike has to handle his business and I think I'll be most  
effective if I handle my own,'' Holyfield said in Burbank, Calif., 
where he is preparing for his March 13 title bout against Lennox 
Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Muhammad Siddeeq, a spiritual adviser to Tyson, said those close  
to the boxer are ``extremely grateful'' a deal could be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure that Mike would want me to say on his behalf ... that  
he's going to try to be worthy of the consideration that's been 
given him,'' Siddeeq said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was on probation in Indiana for raping a beauty pageant  
contestant in an Indianapolis hotel room in 1991. He was released 
from prison in March 1995 after serving three years of a six-year 
sentence.

<HEADLINE> McClatchy Keeping Pirates in Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- Kevin McClatchy's biggest accomplishment  
in the three years since major league baseball's youngest owner 
bought one of the sport's oldest teams is they are still called the 
Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in 1996, after the former newspaper reporter, advertising  
salesman and Giants fan bought the Pirates following seven months 
of laborious negotiations that often threatened to unravel, people 
speculated the team might become the Washington Pirates or the 
Charlotte Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	In baseball, they were guessing which withering-on-the-vine  
small market team would move first: the fan-devoid Montreal Expos 
or the cash-poor Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	``People came up to me as soon as we bought the team and asked  
when we were moving to Sacramento,'' McClatchy said, referring to 
his hometown. ``I said, `Give us a chance first.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Pirates' future -- in Pittsburgh, no less -- seems  
brighter than it has since they last won the World Series in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	They will break ground next month on a 38,000-seat riverfront  
ballpark that will meld the fan-friendly memories of Forbes Field 
with the revenue-generating aesthetics of luxury boxes and club 
seats necessary to compete in the big-money world of pro sports in 
the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	Ticket sales are way up. And the Pirates actually made a modest  
profit the last two seasons, even if it took a massive payroll 
slashing to accomplish it in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were one of the few teams in baseball to make a profit both  
years,'' McClatchy said. ``Considering where we came from, it's an 
accomplishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Where they came from was the brink of extinction in 1995, when  
fans feared the Pirates' last home game that season might be their 
last in Pittsburgh. Major league baseball had rejected cable TV 
entrepreneur John Rigas' offer -- he would later buy the NHL's 
Buffalo Sabres -- and few gave credence to McClatchy's seemingly 
underfinanced attempt to enter the elite group of big corporations 
and billionaires who largely comprise major league ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	McClatchy had plenty of reasons to fail.  
</P>
<P>
	His family owns the newspaper chain of the same name, and  
McClatchy himself is a millionaire. But he did not have the vast 
wads of cash to shower on a team like many club owners do. 
</P>
<P>
	He had failed previously to buy the Oakland Athletics. So when  
he set up shop in a windowless one-room Pittsburgh office lent him 
by a sympathetic lawyer friend in August 1995, McClatchy was given 
as little chance to complete the purchase as the Pirates were of 
winning the pennant. 
</P>
<P>
	But he won over Mayor Tom Murphy, who had made it a priority to  
preserve baseball. He also assembled a score of investors who 
pitched in $1 million or $2 million each and a handful who put up 
$5 million each, including Indy car owner Chip Ganassi. 
</P>
<P>
	By February 1996, McClatchy had himself a baseball team.  
Remarkably, he was only 32 -- younger than some of his players. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people didn't think he could it,'' Murphy said.  
</P>
<P>
	National League president Len Coleman did, quickly embracing  
McClatchy's group and steering it through the difficult approval 
process by fellow owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were of a single mind to keep this storied franchise in  
Pittsburgh, this franchise of Wagner, Stargell and Clemente,'' 
Coleman said. ``Kevin McClatchy is a dynamic leader ... who was 
tested throughout this process but proved every time he could keep 
this together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there were fits and starts even after McClatchy bought  
the team -- mostly fits of disappointment and poor starts by his 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't afford expensive free agents, which meant the  
on-field product wasn't attractive or successful in 1996. A couple 
of his big investors bailed out after six months, saying the kid 
owner didn't know how to run a team. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Leyland, regarded as one of baseball's best managers,  
triggered an escape clause in his contract, and left to manage 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Patiently, McClatchy sorted out the finances, brought in  
newspaper owner G. Ogden Nutting as a partner and ordered a massive 
payroll slashing that kept the franchise fiscally viable. The idea 
was to rebuild through the farm system in anticipation of fielding 
a winning team once the Pirates moved into a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as McClatchy begins his fourth year as a major league club  
owner, the new ballpark is a certainty following a spasmodic 
two-year fight that nearly unraveled numerous times amid political 
infighting and public indifference. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates' challenge no longer is to get a stadium, but to  
build it -- and, they hope, a championship-caliber team to occupy it 
once it opens in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun to be able to concentrate on baseball again,''  
McClatchy said. ``It beats fighting with politicians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New stadium. New players. Hey, isn't that how they did it in  
Cleveland, Baltimore and Texas? 
</P>
<P>
	``Look back at the last three years; I'd say we did all right.  
We did everything we said we were going to do,'' McClatchy said. '' 
We kept the Pirates in Pittsburgh. We're getting a new stadium. 
Strangely enough, after three turbulent years, I still want to run 
a baseball franchise.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Irvin Police Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit Dallas  
Cowboys players Erik Williams and Michael Irvin filed against the 
Dallas police after a woman accused them of sexually assaulting her 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater ruled Friday that  
Williams and Irvin failed to prove allegations that police violated 
their civil rights during an investigation into allegations made by 
Nina Shahravan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Shahravan was convicted of perjury after recanting her  
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	She told police that she had been raped by Williams and an  
unidentified man while Irvin held her at gunpoint and videotaped 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, she admitted to police that Irvin was not present  
and that she willingly had sex with Williams and another man. 
</P>
<P>
	Police cleared the players later that day, and no charges were  
filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Shahravan subsequently pleaded guilty to perjury and served  
a 90-day jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and Irvin sued the city of Dallas, police Chief Ben  
Click, police spokesman Sgt. Jim Chandler, and three officers who 
investigated the allegations by the former topless dancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Ginsburg, a Washington lawyer representing both players,  
said he would appeal Fitzwater's ruling or file new lawsuits in 
state court. 
</P>
<P>
	Several officers named in the suit said they were glad the case  
was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pleased that it has been resolved,'' Chandler said  
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Brant Brown's Error Still Haunts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- He dropped it, OK? He knows it. The whole  
world seems to know it -- and seems to keep reminding him about it. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Brant Brown, the Pittsburgh Pirates' center fielder,  
wants this on the record for all who ask: He doesn't worry about 
the dropped fly ball that cost the Chicago Cubs a game, but didn't 
cost them their season. So everyone should just get on with his or 
her life and quit talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's ghastly error didn't keep the Cubs out of the  
postseason. Really, it didn't mean a thing. It wasn't like Bill 
Buckner's grievous error, a ground ball through the legs that 
ruined the Boston Red Sox's best chance in 80-some years to win a 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Funny, Brown didn't catch the ball, but he has caught six  
months' worth of grief. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Sept. 23, and the Cubs, desperately clinging to a  
wild-card spot, were leading the Milwaukee Brewers 7-5 with two 
outs and the bases loaded in the ninth inning. If the Cubs won -- 
and they were one out away -- they would lead the Mets by a 
half-game and the Giants by three games. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown entered the game only an inning earlier as a defensive  
replacement but, as his role suggests, he is an excellent fielder. 
Adjusting to the late-afternoon sun, wind and the field conditions 
shouldn't have been a big deal. It wasn't, at least until Geoff 
Jenkins lofted a relatively routine fly ball that Brown needed only 
to squeeze for the game's final out. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown moved back a few feet and put up his glove.  
</P>
<P>
	He didn't try to make a Barry Bonds-like one-handed snatch  
catch. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't start pumping his fist in victory.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, somehow, some way, the ball glanced off the heel of his  
glove and bounded away. So did the Cubs' victory as all three 
runners scored. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as a new season approaches, Brown still doesn't have an  
answer as to why it happened, but that doesn't keep inquiring minds 
from wanting to know. What intrigues him is the play ultimately 
meant nothing because the Cubs still advanced to the playoffs, yet 
he is treated as if he personally ruined their season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've caught the same ball thousands of times,'' Brown said.  
``Why it happened then, I'll never know. But if that's the worst 
thing that ever happens to me ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown can't explain how he dropped the ball, but he also can't  
explain everyone's fixation with the play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't help it if everybody has to ask the same question  
about something that didn't mean a thing,'' Brown said Friday. 
``Players know it didn't mean a thing, but the media doesn't. And 
that's all I'm going to say about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least he's gotten away from it since he was traded from  
Chicago to Pittsburgh, hasn't he? 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I haven't gotten away from it over here,'' said Brown, who  
was asked about the non-catch within minutes of his first personal 
appearance for the Pirates in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 27, prefers to talk about his new opportunity in  
Pittsburgh. He drove in 48 runs and hit 14 homers in 347 at-bats 
with the Cubs last season, and the Pirates project him as a 20 
homers-plus hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	But he just can't seem to get people to forget about that one  
play on one day that seemed to epitomize the futile frustration 
felt by Cubs fans for decades and decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching Sammy Sosa last year, I couldn't have handled it the  
way he did,'' Brown said. ``Sammy, I don't know how he or Mark 
McGwire did it. It was a joke. Everybody asked him the same 
questions over and over again and he gave the same answers over and 
over again ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, maybe Brant Brown does know how Sosa did it.

<HEADLINE> States Weigh in on Price Reporting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More and more farm states are taking the lead  
on an issue bogged down in Congress: requiring meatpackers to 
reveal the prices they pay. 
</P>
<P>
	South Dakota has passed a price reporting law, effective July 1.  
Similar efforts are under way in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and 
Kansas, and advocates expect the trend to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Washington is all wrapped up in the booming economy, thinking  
there's really not a problem,'' said Mike Callicrate, a cattle 
feedlot manager in St. Francis, Kan. ``The states are closer to the 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers have pushed for what is called mandatory price reporting  
for some time, but with greater urgency over the past year. All 
areas of livestock are experiencing low prices, particularly the 
hog industry, where prices have dipped to their lowest levels in 
four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In December pork producers were getting $8 a hundredweight  
compared with around $40 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	According to USDA figures, as of 1997, the four largest packing  
firms accounted for 80 percent of cattle slaughter, 54 percent of 
hog slaughter and 70 percent of sheep slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers have accused the big companies of pushing them out by  
controlling prices and keeping them secret. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, prices reported now on a voluntary basis set the  
market. Farmers say processors do not reveal the premium prices 
being paid to producers with contracts to raise livestock for 
companies, an omission they maintain keeps the market at a low 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concern is that low sales are getting reporting and thus  
that's what the market is being created off of,'' said Tom Buis, 
vice president of government relations for the National Farmers 
Union. ``You need an adequate reflection of the entire market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The future is uncertain this year for several bills in Congress  
that would implement mandatory price reporting. Efforts to pass 
such a requirement failed in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who supports price reporting  
but has contended he did not have authority to step in, recently 
reversed himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a fair reading of the Packers and Stockyards Act gives  
us broad discretionary authority to collect more information than 
we do,'' Glickman told a meeting of the National Cattlemen's Beef 
Association last month. 
</P>
<P>
	He has promised to announce a plan within weeks detailing steps  
USDA will take to collect additional price information and 
``determine if there is evidence of price manipulation or unfair 
pricing activity by packers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, states have acted.  
</P>
<P>
	``Being practical people, these state legislatures decided if  
they (the federal government) are not going to do it, we're going 
to do it,'' said Chuck Hassebrook, a Nebraska member of Glickman's 
National Commission on Small Farms. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission members last month criticized Glickman for not moving  
to implement some form of price reporting to help small farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., a sponsor of a House bill, said  
``It's not at all surprising this thing is producing legislation at 
the state level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pomeroy accused big meat packer lobbyists of getting last year's  
measure killed -- even after lawmakers had agreed to include it in 
the agriculture spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were able to stop it behind closed doors in Washington  
but they've hardly stopped the public sentiment,'' Pomeroy said.

<HEADLINE> Utility Ordered To Pay $37.3M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida's largest electric utility has been ordered  
to pay $37.3 million to the family of a girl killed in a traffic 
accident, the largest wrongful death verdict for a child in state 
history, said the family's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve-year-old Jill Goldberg died in 1997 when her mother's car  
was hit at an intersection where a traffic signal hung dark. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers for Florida Power &AMP; Light Co. had shut off power in the  
area to repair a downed power line. Apparently, none of the workers 
noticed they also cut power to the traffic signal about 150 feet 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't simply pull the power from a traffic control signal  
and make absolutely no effort to keep the inevitable from 
occurring,'' said the girl's father, Walter Goldberg. ``They could 
have done so many things. And they did nothing.'' 
</P>

	The utility plans to appeal Friday's verdict.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Wins Women Skiing Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. MORITZ, Switzerland (AP) -- Austrian Alexandra Meissnitzer  
captured the women's overall World Cup title today with a 
fourth-place finish in the super-G race. 
</P>
<P>
	Michaela Dorfmeister, another Austrian, won the race and kept  
alive her chances for the super-G season title. Dorfmeister was 
timed in 1:29.17. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Renate Goetschl finished in 1:29.37, beating out  
American Kathleen Monahan, who was clocked in 1:29.57. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Monahan's first career trip to the podium. Monahan's  
previous-best result was an eighth place in the super-G in Mommoth 
Mountain earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really surprised but it's dawning on me more and more,''  
said Monahan, who was the first skier out of the start hut. 
``Because I was first I didn't know what to expect so I tried for 
an aggressive line. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw Meissnitzer's time was slower than mine I knew I'd  
had an awesome run, because she's been skiing really fast,'' added 
Monahan, who joined the World Cup circuit in 1992. ``This is really 
good for the upcoming finals in Sierra Nevada, because it gives me 
a lot of confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Meissnitzer's fourth place finish was enough to get her  
the overall championship, it was not quite enough to wrap up the 
disipline title. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorfmeister advanced to second place in the super-G standings,  
and had an outside shot at the title going into the World Cup final 
next week. She has to win in Spain to capture the discipline 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory today was was Dorfmeister's first ever in the  
super-G, and only her second win ever.

<HEADLINE> Pirates Give Young $24M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. (AP) -- First baseman Kevin Young signed the  
richest contract in Pittsburgh Pirates' history on Saturday, a $24 
million, four-year deal made possible by the team's 
soon-to-be-built stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract far surpasses shortstop Jay Bell's $17.5 million,  
four-year deal in 1993 and represents a remarkable turnaround for 
Young, who was released by both Pittsburgh and Kansas City in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	By next season, Young will make more than twice as much as  
outfielder Al Martin, whose $2.7 million salary is the Pirates' 
highest this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal calls for a $500,000 signing bonus and salaries of $5.5  
million in 2000, $6 million in 2001, $5.5 million in 2002 and $6.5 
million in 2003. Young is getting $2 million in 1999, the final 
season of a $3.6 million, two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hasn't set in yet,'' said Young, who has driven in 182 runs  
in two seasons since returning to Pittsburgh in 1997. ``I'm just 
totally happy to get this settled. It's almost like a storybook the 
way this has worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young celebrated his new contract by homering in his first  
at-bat this spring in the second inning Saturday against Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates initially offered Young $16.5 million over three  
years, then $18 million. They agreed to the fourth year for the 
same $6 million per year average during lengthy talks Friday night. 
The Pirates were pressured in part by a spiraling market that saw 
outfielder Brian Jordan get $40 million from Atlanta and infielder 
Jose Offerman get $26 million from Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market just flew by us,'' general manager Cam Bonifay  
said. ``It was my preference for (three years) ... but we had to 
make a business decision. The whole market shifted up with what 
Boston did (with Offerman).'' 
</P>
<P>
	By signing Young now, the Pirates prevented their top run  
producer -- Young drove in 108 runs last season -- from becoming a 
free agent after this season. They also signaled they will take the 
same approach the Cleveland Indians did after getting a new stadium 
by signing their key players to long-term contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pennsylvania Legislature signed off last month on the final  
funding needed to build the Pirates' $228 million PNC Park, a 
38,000-seat ballpark expected to open in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, it is a statement -- it's a statement by ownership that  
we're going to do the best that we can to win a championship,'' 
said Bonifay, who has traded for or signed six veteran players 
since the Pirates finished 69-93 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	By adding shortstop Pat Meares, second baseman Mike Benjamin,  
third baseman Ed Sprague, outfielders Brant Brown and Brian Giles 
and pitcher Pete Schourek, the Pirates have dramatically made over 
last season's painfully inexperienced team. They also have bought 
time for their farm system to begin pumping out the players 
expected to arrive in time for the new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, 29, is the first Pirates veteran to sign this spring but  
may not be the last. Bonifay faxed a new offer to Jason Kendall's 
agent on Friday night as the Pirates try to lock the catcher into a 
long-term deal before he can become a free agent after the 2001 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall has made the All-Star team in two of his first three  
major league seasons and was chosen as the team's MVP last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, we want to get that done now,'' Bonifay said.  
</P>
<P>
	Remarkably, Young was cut during the Pirates' final spring  
cutdown in 1996 to make room on the opening day roster for 
utilityman John Wehner. Young signed with Kansas City, but was 
released again that fall and returned to the Pirates as a minor 
league free agent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Young subsequently won back his starting job at first base and  
was headed for a 100-RBI season until he missed six weeks with a 
broken thumb. He finished with a .300 average, 18 homers and 74 
RBIs that season, then hit .270 with career highs in homers (27) 
and RBIs (108) last season.

<HEADLINE> Brown Leads the Dodgers in Jokes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- It didn't take baseball's $105 million  
man very long to establish himself as a leader in the Los Angeles 
Dodgers clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, if didn't figure to take long, what with the success  
Kevin Brown enjoyed with his previous two teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Take last Tuesday morning. There was Brown, taping a hand-drawn  
picture on a clubhouse wall in the team's spring training facility 
with all his teammates looking on, laughing like a school kid. 
</P>
<P>
	They all joined in, including Carlos Perez, the target of the  
joke. 
</P>
<P>
	The drawing of Perez bore little resemblance to the Dodgers'  
left-hander, but the teardrops were clear, and so were the two 
statements attributed to him: ``No runs; no saves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reference was to a story in that day's local newspaper,  
which quoted Perez as saying this was going to be his year, that he 
had little run support in 1998 and left a number of games with 
leads that didn't stand up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was some good-natured kidding,'' Brown recalled Saturday in  
an almost-empty clubhouse after finishing his workout for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The message was also clear, although Brown, owner of the richest  
contract in baseball history, wouldn't admit it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll never tell,'' he said with a thin smile.  
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't take a rocket scientist to put it all together -- the  
idea is to win, personal accomplishments come second. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown no doubt got his message across.  
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it was appropriate to give him a hard time, part of  
what it takes to make it interesting'' Brown said, adding that a 
clubhouse attendant drew the picture. ``You're going to take guff, 
you're going to give it, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who signed a $105 million, seven-year contract with the  
Dodgers on Dec. 12, has established himself as one of baseball's 
finest starting pitchers. But there's more -- everyone close to the 
team realizes he was signed for what he could accomplish in the 
clubhouse as well as on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's just a label,'' he said of his leadership tag. ``I'm  
just me. That's all I'm going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who turns 34 next Sunday, helped the Florida Marlins and  
San Diego Padres to the World Series in 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd take nine in a row with three different teams,'' he said.  
``That's your focus. If that's no what you're looking to 
accomplish, you're approaching it the wrong way. You want to do 
well individually. Your accomplishments mean so much more when 
you're with a winning team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he's enjoyed his first spring training with the  
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a good time cutting up, enjoying each other,'' he  
said. ``We've still got our work done. It's a serious business, but 
you've still got to enjoy yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How good can the Dodgers be?  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody knows,'' Brown said. ``Playing on paper  
never does any good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, scheduled to make his first appearance of the exhibition  
season Sunday against the New York Mets, has a 2.33 ERA over the 
last three years -- the best in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The hard-throwing right-hander was 17-11 with a 1.89 ERA for  
Florida in 1996; 16-8 with a 2.69 ERA for the Marlins in 1997, and 
18-7 with a 2.38 ERA for the Padres last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he signed with the Dodgers for basically one reason.  
</P>
<P>
	``I believe these guys have one of the best approaches, if not  
the best approach,'' he said. ``I felt of teams that were 
interested in me, they would have the best chance to be successful 
year in and year out. That's got to be the goal. That mirrors my 
approach to the game.''

<HEADLINE> Apparent Haiti Smuggling Boats Sink </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Two boats carrying as many as 43 Haitians in an  
apparent bid to smuggle them into the United States sank Saturday 
off the South Florida coast, and rescuers found only three 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	The three men rescued in the choppy Atlantic waters off West  
Palm Beach told U.S. Border Patrol officers that one boat -- 
carrying 18 Haitians -- broke down and that the other boat -- 
carrying between 18 to 25 more people -- approached it to help. Both 
boats then went under, the survivors said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forty are presumed dead or drowned,'' said Art Bullock, a  
border patrol officer in West Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard planned to continue its search for survivors  
until midnight, at which time the situation was to be re-evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
	The sinkings became known about 2 a.m. when crew members on a  
passing freighter reported hearing screams from the water about 30 
miles east of West Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard cutter recovered the bodies of two men and crew  
members saw two other men's bodies sink below the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot of people,'' Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Ron LaBrec  
said. ``We will keep searching until exhausting all hope to find 
people alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A helicopter located the first survivor at 5 a.m. and took him  
to a medical center in West Palm Beach, where he was in stable 
condition hours later. Two other men were rescued at 8:30 a.m., 
clinging to a barrel. They were taken to the Border Patrol office 
in West Palm Beach, Bullock said. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the men were wearing life jackets and it was believed  
they were trying to sneak into the country, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Generally that many people don't get on a boat to cross in the  
middle of the night,'' Petty Officer Jeff Hall. ``From what we've 
seen in the past, they generally leave from the west end of the 
Bahamas and come across into West Palm Beach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard was searching for the others in the waters  
between Florida and the Bahamas with boats, two helicopters and a 
Falcon jet. 
</P>
<P>
	The two vessels that sank, a 17-foot boat and a 20-foot boat,  
apparently casted off from the Bahamas, said Samedi Florvil, with 
the Haitian Refugee Center in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Bahamas (smugglers) tell them it is easy over here,''  
he said. ``Some of them pay $2,000 or 3,000 to get on a boat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers of Haitians and Cubans taking to the seas rose in  
1998, and authorities say they expect the trend to continue in 
1999. In 1998, Coast Guard vessels intercepted 1,025 Cubans and 
1,206 Haitians at sea, compared with 406 Cubans and 587 Haitians in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 17, a 29-foot boat capsized in 6-foot high seas off  
Elliott Key, some 22 miles south of Miami. Nine Cubans drowned and 
another five were lost at sea and presumed dead. Two of the nine 
survivors are charged with smuggling the others. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just reiterates the danger that's involved in smuggling  
migrants to the United States,'' LaBrec said. ``These people leave 
in small boats that are generally unseaworthy, overcrowded and 
lacking in even the most basic safety gear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haitians who pay smugglers to take them to the United States  
know the risk they are taking, said Fernand Phillip, vice president 
of the board of Miami's Haitian Refugee Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are aware of the danger, but they are dying where they  
are,'' Phillip said. ``They're just looking to survive.''

<HEADLINE> Unite's Big Red Wins at Gulfstream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Unite's Big Red swept past heavily  
favored African Dancer in the final 70 yards to win the $250,000 
Pan American Handicap in stakes-record time Saturday at Gulfstream 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Panama City rallied to finish third in a field of seven  
5-year-olds and up going 1 1/2 miles over turf. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Mike Smith, Unite's Big Red was timed in 2:23,  
eclipsing the record of 2:23 2-5 established by Eclipse grass 
champion Buck's Boy in last year's Pan American. Buck's Boy carried 
115 pounds; Unite's Big Red broke the record carrying 114 Saturday, 
two less than the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-year-old Florida-bred son of Unite paid $13.20, $4 and  
$2.80. African Dancer, at odds-on, paid $2.60 and $2.20. Panama 
City paid $2.60 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the ninth victory in 28 starts for the winner and  
increased his earnings to $603,055. He won three grass stakes last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	African Dancer was within three-quarters of a length of Deep  
Dive on the far turn the final time around and drew even with the 
pacesetter as they set down for the stretch drive. 
</P>
<P>
	African Dancer put away Deep Dive inside the eighth pole but  
Unite's Big Red, closing fast on the outside, caught him inside the 
sixteenth pole and won going away by 1 1/4 lengths. African Dancer was 
second by three quarters of a length over Panama City who was a 
length in front of a fast closing Rebridled.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazilian police charged seven officers  
Saturday with the slayings of three young people found with gunshot 
wounds to the head, said a police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of the three, ages 14, 17, and 21, were found in a  
forest near Sao Vicente, a coastal town 50 miles southeast of Sao 
Paulo, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of the dead youths, found close to beaches popular  
with vacationers, has shocked Brazilians. 
</P>
<P>
	The trio disappeared during the nation's annual carnival  
celebrations three weeks ago, but their bodies were only found 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven police officers allegedly drove the victims into the  
forest and shot them, the spokesman said. The officers will be 
tried in a criminal court. 
</P>

<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazilian employers cut some  
580,000 jobs in 1998, the highest number in six years, the O Globo 
newspaper reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most jobs were cut last December with service and construction  
industries heavily hit, said the daily, citing Employment Ministry 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministry experts blamed the cuts on high interest rates  
introduced to counter financial turbulence battering Brazil, the 
daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only this week, new Central Bank president Arminio Fraga raised  
interest rates further, from 39 percent to 45 percent, to combat 
inflation. Financial markets reacted well but many economists say 
the move will deepen Brazil's recession. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, only 35,000 jobs were cut by employers in Brazil.  
</P>
<P>
	According to government figures, about 8 percent of the  
country's economically active population of some 50 million are 
jobless, the highest rate since 1985.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A former official of the Gulf coast state of  
Tabasco has accused the state's governor of illegally using tax 
revenues to pay for an ad campaign, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmanuel Ruiz, former general director of the state government  
office, accused Roberto Madrazo of retaining millions of dollars in 
payroll taxes to fund a flashy TV and media campaign touting him 
for the 2000 presidential race, the newspaper La Jornada reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz's complaint was received by the Office of the Presidency in  
February and was turned over to the Treasury Secretariat for 
investigation, an office spokeswoman said on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	It would not be the first time the governor has faced  
investigations of his finances. State prosecutors cleared Madrazo 
of charges that he spent ten times more than allowed on his 1994 
governorship campaign.

<HEADLINE> Reid Works To Match Olympic Mates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- David Reid hopes to join Olympic  
teammates Floyd Mayweather and Fernando Vargas as world champions 
tonight when he challenges Laurent Boudouani of France for the WBA 
super welterweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, the only U.S. boxer to win a gold medal at the 1996 games  
at Atlanta, was a solid favorite in the fight at the Boardwalk 
Convention Center, although he has had only 10 fights to the 
champion's 41. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at the caliber of opposition he's had,'' Al Mitchell,  
Reid's trainer, said of Reid. ``He hasn't been pampered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid (10-0, seven knockouts) has fought two faded former world  
champions (Jorge Vaca and Simon Brown) and several solid 
journeymen. 
</P>
<P>
	While Mayweather, WBC super featherweight champion, and Vargas,  
IBF junior middleweight champion, won world titles quicker than 
Reid, he would become a world champion faster then them in terms of 
number of fights. 
</P>
<P>
	The most dazzling rise from Olympic champion to world champion  
was accomplished by Leon Spinks when he upset Muhammad Ali on a 
split decision in only in his eighth pro fight on Feb. 15, 1978. 
Ali won a rematch on Sept. 15 of that year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Boudouani (38-2-1, 32 knockouts) will be making  
the fifth defense of the 154-pound title he won by knocking out 
Julio Vasquez in the fifth round Aug. 21, 1996, in France. 
Tonight's match will be Boudouani's fourth defense and fifth fight 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Boudouani's two losses have come inside the scheduled distance.  
He was stopped in the eighth round by Gilbert Baptist in 1991 and 
was knocked out in the eighth round by Bernard Razzano in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very vulnerable for certain punches,'' said the  
25-year-old Reid, of Philadelphia. ``I'm just going out there and 
use my jab to make openings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight will be preceded on the HBO telecast by a 10-round  
heavyweight bout between Lou Savarese (38-2, 32 knockouts) of New 
York and 6-foot-8 Lance Whitaker (18-0, 18 knockouts) of Van Nuys, 
Calif., who is billed as Mount Whitaker. The telecast will begin at 
10:15 p.m. EST.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft May Fix Privacy Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft will modify its Windows 98 operating  
system to eliminate a problem that could make personal information 
available to hackers or unauthorized persons, The New York Times 
reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said the problem is created by a unique identifying  
number used for registration of Windows programs and other 
Microsoft products that was designed to help Microsoft support 
employees help users diagnose problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Windows registration number is tied to an individual's name,  
to identifying numbers on the person's computer hardware and to 
documents the user creates. Microsoft said the combination of the 
Windows number with all these data could result in the ability to 
track a single user and the documents the person created across 
vast computer networks, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hackers could compromise the resulting database, or subpoenas  
might allow authorities to gain access to information that would 
otherwise remain private and unavailable, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're definitely sensitive to any privacy concerns,'' Robert  
Bennett, Microsoft's group product manager for Windows, told the 
Times. ``The software was not supposed to send this information 
unless the computer user checked a specific option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts by The Associated Press to reach the Redmond,  
Wash.-based company to confirm that changes would be made were 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said the option to collect the information had been  
added to the software so that Microsoft support employees would be 
able to help users diagnose problems more accurately. He said it 
was never intended to be used for marketing purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett told the Times Microsoft will not only alter the way the  
registration program works in the next maintenance release of 
Windows 98, but technicians would go through the company's data 
bases and expunge information that had been improperly collected as 
a result of earlier versions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said Microsoft has been discussing the issue with a  
Cambridge, Mass., programmer who contacted the company earlier this 
week after discovering that the Microsoft Office business software 
was creating unique numbers identifying a user's personal computer 
and embedding them in spreadsheet and word processing documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The programmer, Robert M. Smith, president of Phar Lap Software  
Inc., told Microsoft he believed the practice created a potential 
threat to privacy, the Times said. Phar Lap is a software tools 
development company.

<HEADLINE> Ore. MDs Wary of Suicide Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- Many doctors in Oregon say they will refuse  
to prescribe deadly doses of drugs, frustrating plans of some 
terminally ill patients who want to use the nation's only 
assisted-suicide law. 
</P>
<P>
	Six out of the 15 terminally ill people who used the law to end  
their lives last year were turned down by at least one doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	And by the state's own informal sampling, 67 percent of doctors  
who treat terminally ill patients said they would refuse to 
participate in an assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't been trained to kill people,'' said Portland cancer  
specialist Dr. Jana Reddoch. ``I've been trained to help them live 
as long as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chief sponsor of the law, Barbara Coombs Lee, said Oregon's  
Death With Dignity Act gives doctors and health care organizations 
the right to ``opt out'' of assisted suicides on moral or ethical 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the intention of the law,'' she said. ``It creates a  
right for patients to ask for the prescription but it doesn't 
provide a duty for the physician to provide it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report on last year's experience with assisted suicide,  
conducted by the Oregon Health Division, didn't focus on 
physicians' attitudes on assisted suicide but rather was aimed 
mainly at the characteristics of the terminally ill people who 
requested lethal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the authors of the report, Dr. Katrina Hedberg, said a  
comprehensive survey now is under way to find out how Oregon 
physicians feel about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking a look at last year's report, Hedberg guessed that in  
addition to those doctors who refused to take part in suicides on 
moral grounds, others might be worried about being targeted by 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is extremely controversial. It's like being an abortion  
doctor,'' she said. ``Doctors who take a stand and participate 
might be subjected to public harassment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some medical observers were surprised by the relatively low  
number of terminally ill people who requested lethal drugs in the 
first full year the law was in effect, and they wonder whether 
physicians' resistance played into that number. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health Division report found that use of the law has so far  
been driven overwhelmingly by the desire of strong-willed patients 
to exercise some control over the way they died.

<HEADLINE> Russian Dominate Grand Prix Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) -- Led by rising star Tatiana  
Malinina and world champion Alexei Yagudin, Russian skaters 
dominated Saturday in the finals of the ISU Grand Prix, a tuneup 
before the world championships in Finland later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Malinina, a Russian native now skating for Uzbekistan, upset  
two-time European figure skating champion Maria Butyrskaya, who 
fell twice in a shaky free skate program. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin outskated fellow Russians Alexei Urmanov and Evgeny  
Plushenko and American Michael Weiss in a men's competition that 
turned on a battle of the quads -- the quadruple jumps that several 
contenders tried, but none managed to land cleanly. 
</P>
<P>
	Russians failed to win only the pairs competition, which went to  
China's Xue Shen and Hongbo Zhao, who captured the judging with a 
side-by-side triple toe and a triple twist throw. They defeated 
Russian's Olympic silver medalists, Elena Berezhnaya and Anton 
Sikharulidze, after Berezhnaya fell on a triple loop. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ice dance competition, the Russian pair of Anjelika  
Krylov and Oleg Ovsiannikov defeated the French pair of Marina 
Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the attention at the competition was focused on  
Butyrskaya, considered the most likely skater to challenge Michelle 
Kwan at the world championships. But she skated miserably, falling 
first on a triple flip and then spectacularly on a triple salchow, 
skidding across the ice on her stomach toward the judge's stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Her performance was still strong enough to finish second to  
Malinina, who made five clean triple jumps, including an 
outstanding triple lutz, to win the free skating program. Malinina 
also dominated Friday's short program. 
</P>
<P>
	But Malinina, whose strength is technical, not artistic,  
conceded that she was not likely to take on Kwan for the world 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can compete on the technical side,'' she said. ``I won't be  
able to beat her on artistic representation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Irina Slutskaya finished third.  
</P>
<P>
	Russians also swept the top three positions in the men's  
competition, with Yagudin followed by Urmanov and the 16-year-old 
Plushenko. Weiss came in fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Although none of the top finishers landed a completely clean  
quadruple jump, Yagudin came close, landing on one foot but 
slightly losing his balance. Plushenko attempted two quads -- 
something done only once before in competition -- but didn't land 
either of them cleanly.

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard Rescues Three Haitians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Coast Guard rescued three men in the Atlantic  
Ocean off South Florida on Saturday after a boat sank while 
apparently smuggling up to 18 Haitians to the United States. At 
least two bodies were recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard sent ships, helicopters and an airplane to  
search the area between Florida and the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	The survivors said there may have been as many as 18 people on  
the boat, leading the Coast Guard to believe it was a smuggling 
attempt, said Petty Officer Jeff Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Generally that many people don't get on a boat to cross in the  
middle of the night,'' he said. ``From what we've seen in the past, 
they generally leave from the west end of the Bahamas and come 
across into West Palm Beach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crew of a freighter reported hearing screams from the water  
about 30 miles east of West Palm Beach early Saturday, according to 
a Coast Guard statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Three men were rescued, two of them found clinging to a barrel,  
and were taken to hospitals in Florida. The crew of the Coast Guard 
cutter Matagorda recovered two bodies and saw two other bodies sink 
into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just reiterates the danger that's involved in smuggling  
migrants to the United States,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Ron LaBreck. 
``These people leave in small boats that are generally unseaworthy, 
overcrowded and lacking in even the most basic safety gear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum penalty for people convicted of smuggling refugees  
is life imprisonment and a $250,000 fine, LaBreck said. Refugee 
smuggling that results in death is a capital offense. 
</P>
<P>
	No details were released on the boat that sank.  
</P>
<P>
	The numbers of Cubans and Haitians taking to the sea in efforts  
to reach the United States have increased since 1998, and experts 
expect the trend to continue in 1999. In 1998, Coast Guard vessels 
intercepted 1,025 Cubans and 1,206 Haitians at sea, compared with 
406 Cubans and 587 Haitians in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 17 a 29-foot boat capsized in 6-foot seas off Elliott  
Key, 22 miles south of Miami. Nine drowned and five other 
passengers were lost at sea and presumed dead. Two of the nine 
survivors are accused of being the smugglers.

<HEADLINE> IRS Gives Disaster-Area Refunds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- More than 630,000 taxpayers living in  
federally declared disaster areas are getting a tax refund even if 
they didn't suffer any damage. 
</P>
<P>
	A loophole in the federal tax law has the IRS automatically  
sending refunds for interest charges to taxpayers who lived in an 
area declared a disaster area since 1997 and ended up filing their 
taxes late. 
</P>
<P>
	While the total amount being refunded is unknown, thousands of  
California residents have received refunds, some as much as $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm stunned. That is not what Congress intended,'' said Rep.  
Robert Matsui, D-Calif., who serves on the House Ways and Means 
Committee that oversaw the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress had sought to give Americans a break when natural  
disasters make it difficult to file taxes on time, but lawmakers 
apparently had not intended to give every resident of disaster 
areas an interest-free loan on late taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	An IRS spokesman said the agency is simply carrying out the law  
as Congress wrote it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and subsequent legislation last  
year gives a tax break to people who lived in counties declared by 
the president to be disaster areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The laws made those residents eligible for refunds of any  
interest they had been charged for paying their taxes late. The 
laws do not require that the taxpayers be affected by the disaster.

<HEADLINE> Philadelphia Building Blast Hurts 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- An explosion blew out the top floor of a  
small apartment building on Saturday, injuring at least four 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	A gas leak in an oven on the second-floor caused the blast, Fire  
Department supervisor Harry Johnson said. A refrigerator motor 
sparked the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion blew out the back and side walls of the top floor  
of the three-story building and destroyed the roof. The blast 
started a fire that gutted the structure before firefighters could 
extinguish the flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Bush, 51, who had been working in the basement of a house  
across the street, and Ed Jackson, 62, ran outside in time to see 
two men crawling out of the rubble to the edge of the wrecked third 
floor. They got a ladder and helped the men down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their shirts were burned off,'' said Bush.  
</P>
<P>
	He ran into the other floors to rouse tenants, including an  
older man who slept through the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said two men had severe burns, and two others  
suffered lesser burns. In addition, an elderly woman complained of 
chest pains.

<HEADLINE> Guillen Still Missing for Pirates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates may find out  
Monday if outfielder Jose Guillen will remain out of spring 
training camp for a few more days -- or, possibly, a few more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen missed his 11th day of camp Saturday because of an  
immigration dispute resulting from his marriage last fall, a 
ceremony the Pirates apparently did not know about until recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen, the Pirates' right fielder the last two seasons, was  
granted the standard nonimmigrant working visa on Jan. 19, 
permitting him to enter the United States for the baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen also traveled to Pittsburgh in January to have his  
shoulder examined by team doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	But prior to leaving the Dominican Republic for spring training,  
Guillen attempted to secure a travel visa for his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a statement issued Saturday by the Pirates -- their  
first since Guillen failed to report to camp -- officials of the 
Consular Section determined Guillen violated immigration laws by 
misrepresenting himself on behalf of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen's working visa then was revoked. Guillen's agent  
subsequently hired an immigration lawyer, and the case is under 
review by the U.S. consulate. A ruling is expected Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not going to let him leave the country until they get  
this cleared up,'' Pirates general manager Cam Bonifay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen's absence isn't affecting the Pirates' lineup as manager  
Gene Lamont plays mostly farmhands early in the spring training 
schedule. But Guillen is missing valuable training time, a bigger 
factor than normal because he played only a few games in winter 
ball.

<HEADLINE> Three Illinois Children Found Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPERVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- Police are investigating the apparent  
poisoning deaths of three children whose mother has been 
hospitalized for what officers believe was a suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother, Marilyn Lemak, 41, called 911 Friday. When police  
arrived, they discovered the bodies of 7-year-old Nicholas, 
6-year-old Emily and 3-year-old Thomas, said DuPage County State's 
Attorney Joseph Birkett. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no evidence to suggest that there is any suspect  
outside of the immediate family,'' Birkett said. ``There are 
definite leads being followed up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police say the children were caught up in a domestic dispute  
between the parents. Mrs. Lemak and her husband, David, were 
separated and were getting a divorce, Birkett said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Lemak, an emergency room physician, has been cooperating  
with the investigation, Birkett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marilyn Lemak was hospitalized in fair condition late Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The children were apparently poisoned, but toxicology results  
from the medical examiner's office are still pending, Birkett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Naperville is 28 miles west of Chicago.

<HEADLINE>  Austrian Wins Women Skiing Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. MORITZ, Switzerland (AP) -- Austrian Alexandra Meissnitzer  
captured the women's overall World Cup title today with a 
fourth-place finish in the super-G race. 
</P>
<P>
	Michaela Dorfmeister, another Austrian, won the race and kept  
alive her chances for the super-G season title. Dorfmeister was 
timed in 1:29.17. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Renate Goetschl finished in 1:29.37, beating out  
American Kathleen Monahan, who was clocked in 1:29.57. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Monahan's first career trip to the podium. Monahan's  
previous-best result was an eighth place in the super-G in Mommoth 
Mountain earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really surprised but it's dawning on me more and more,''  
said Monahan, who was the first skier out of the start hut. 
``Because I was first I didn't know what to expect so I tried for 
an aggressive line. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw Meissnitzer's time was slower than mine I knew I'd  
had an awesome run, because she's been skiing really fast,'' added 
Monahan, who joined the World Cup circuit in 1992. ``This is really 
good for the upcoming finals in Sierra Nevada, because it gives me 
a lot of confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Meissnitzer's fourth place finish was enough to get her  
the overall championship, it was not quite enough to wrap up the 
disipline title. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorfmeister advanced to second place in the super-G standings,  
and had an outside shot at the title going into the World Cup final 
next week. She has to win in Spain to capture the discipline 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory today was was Dorfmeister's first ever in the

<HEADLINE> McGwire Doesn't Homer in 1999 Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Maybe hitting 70 homers again won't be so  
easy for Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Mac looked like a regular ballplayer preparing for the  
season, not baseball's new single-season home run king, as he made 
his 1999 debut Saturday against the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, whose 450-foot home runs in last year's spring opener  
set off his record-setting spree of 70 homers, flied out to center 
and was hit by a pitch in his two plate appearances in the St. 
Louis Cardinals' 4-3 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just wanted the get him two at-bats,'' Cardinals manager  
Tony La Russa said. ``It's early in the spring. He still has time 
to loosen up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire received a standing ovation before his first at-bat as  
the 6,938 fans thanked him for the glorious run he took the sport 
on last year and urged an encore in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Thurman, who allowed No. 69 on the last day of the 1998  
season, didn't give up No. 1 this season. Instead, he got McGwire 
to fly out to Rondell White on a 2-2 pitch for the second out of 
the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
	In his second at-bat, McGwire was hit on his left elbow pad by a  
Mike Johnson fastball, drawing scattered boos from the crowd. 
McGwire calmly jogged to first, where he was stranded. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heart skips a beat whenever one of my players is hit,'' La  
Russa said, pretending McGwire is no different than the other 59 
players in camp. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire was replaced by Chris Haas after the third inning and  
didn't talk after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans did see one long ball, when Cardinals phenom J.D. Drew hit  
a two-run homer in the third off Johnson for St. Louis' first two 
runs. Drew finished 2-for-3 with a stolen base and was hit by a 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Expos may have been the home team at Roger Dean Stadium,  
which they share with the Cardinals, but they couldn't have felt 
like it. There was only a smattering of Expos blue in the 
Cardinal-red sea of St. Louis hats and McGwire shirts in the 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans lined up more than five hours before first pitch for a  
chance at the 200 standing room only tickets to the sold out game, 
and those lucky enough to have a ticket were frustrated to find out 
only Expos programs would be on sale -- a cover photo of Valdimir 
Guerrero doesn't have the same allure as Big Mac. 
</P>
<P>
	As has become customary everywhere McGwire goes, fans arrived  
early to see one of baseball's best shows, McGwire taking batting 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of fans with cameras clicking gathered near the slugger  
as he hit soft tosses into a screen behind home plate while his 
teammates hit live pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an electricity here,'' said St. Louis' Carlos Baerga,  
who is spending his first spring with baseball's biggest attraction 
after nine seasons with the Indians and Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes later, McGwire took his first turn in the cage and  
bunted twice, much to the disappointment to the fans. He then hit 
four home runs in eight swings, including two that easily cleared 
the Expos' offices more than 50 feet behind the left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was here last year for batting practice, I was almost  
alone,'' Cardinals fan Rob Biondolino said. ``Now there are 
thousands of fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the stadium, Cletus Boyer -- no relation to the former  
Yankees third baseman of the same name or his brother Ken of the 
Cardinals -- was selling copies of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch's 
coverage of McGwire's record 62nd homer for $15. 
</P>
<P>
	If the fans have their way, that will soon be old news.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no reason why he can't break the record again,''  
Biondolino said. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Derrick May's RBI single off Mike Busby capped a two-run  
ninth inning rally for Montreal. ... Keith Evans picked up the win, 
allowing one run in the ninth.

<HEADLINE> Garth Brooks Leaves Padres Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Country singer Garth Brooks abruptly left  
the San Diego Padres training camp, apparently due to a family 
illness, and the club isn't sure when he might return. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday morning, club officials would only say that Brooks  
wasn't in camp due to personal reasons. The Associated Press 
learned that Brooks left for Los Angeles to be with his mother, who 
has had cancer. The team said it was waiting for more information 
from those close to Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds like a serious health problem,'' owner John Moores  
said. ``A guy like him wouldn't leave camp if he didn't think it 
was serious. I'm sure he's concerned about his mom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Kevin Towers' termed it a ``leave of absence''  
and likened it to the recent illness of the daughter of outfielder 
Reggie Sanders. When Sanders' 16-month-old daughter fell ill from a 
viral infection on Monday, Sanders rushed home to Florida and was 
told by the team he could stay with her until he knew she was OK. 
Sanders returned to camp on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to him (Brooks) when he comes back,'' Towers said.  
``His locker's there waiting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Moores: ``Obviously he's welcome back, but we're a lot more  
concerned about his mom's situation as opposed to whether he's just 
coming back. It would be a shame if he doesn't because it's obvious 
to everybody he was committed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks was invited to camp on a non-roster basis as a way for  
him to kick-start his baseball-related Touch 'Em All Foundation. He 
has no chance of making the big-league roster, and would be sent to 
a minor-league team only if he showed he was competitive. He's yet 
to get a hit in eight at-bats in two intrasquad games, an ``A'' 
game and a ``B'' game, but he has been putting the ball in play. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks has been wildly popular with the fans and has spent hours  
signing autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	Moores said Towers and Bochy told the team's board of directors  
Saturday that Brooks' work ethic was inspirational to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``From that standpoint, we wish that he'll be back in camp,''  
Moores said.

<HEADLINE> Clemens Loses Yankees Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAINES CITY, Fla. (AP) -- Roger Clemens could hardly wait.  
</P>
<P>
	Eager to make his New York Yankees debut, he drove himself  
almost halfway across the state of Florida, beating the team bus to 
the ballpark. He dressed quickly. And when it was time to pitch, he 
jogged to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every spring I get excited about the challenges,'' he said  
Saturday. ``This year, there is a new environment and my adrenaline 
was pumping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens wound up with a loss, giving up three runs and seven  
hits in three innings as the Kansas City Royals beat New York's 
split squad 9-1. 
</P>
<P>
	But more than the ``L'' next to his name in the boxscore, there  
was this strange sight -- ``NY'' on his cap. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing funny about it,'' the five-time Cy Young Award  
winner said. ``Ever since the first couple of days in camp, I've 
felt comfortable with this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others are taking a bit longer to adjust.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's like, `Wow!' '' pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre said. ``I  
occasionally pinch myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun to see him out there in pinstripes,'' right fielder  
Paul O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
	On this day, Clemens was wearing a navy jersey instead of the  
Yankees' more famed uniform. No matter -- the notion of Clemens 
playing for New York was what many came to see. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 6,525 was close to the first sellout at Baseball  
City Stadium since 1990, and it featured a lot of Yankees shirts 
and hats, far more than Royals attire. 
</P>
<P>
	A lot of fans made the one-hour drive from Tampa, where the team  
holds spring training. Owner George Steinbrenner, however, stayed 
back as the other Yankees' split squad played Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	WABC radio, unlike The Boss, decided not to miss this one. The  
Yankees' flagship station reshuffled its plans and had its crew 
drive to this game instead of broadcasting the other one against 
the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that Clemens did not blow away the Royals, even though  
he struck out four and walked none, bothered no one. Traded from 
Toronto last month, he's expected to help the Yankees win another 
World Series championship, not a spring training title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bought tickets as soon as I heard he was going to pitch,''  
said 24-year-old Rob Bologna of Orlando. ``I mean, I just had to 
see his first game for the Yanks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in a Yankees top and shorts, Bologna took 20 pictures of  
Clemens. And that was just when he was warming up in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens wound up throwing 58 pitches, more than starters usually  
throw in their first spring outing. He mixed in a few sliders and 
splitters with his fastball, which he estimated he threw at ``75-80 
percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was focused on just trying to not do anything crazy as far  
as my legs,'' he said. ``I've done that before when I've been too 
revved up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens got off to an easy start, barehanding a weak comebacker  
by Carlos Beltran. He later gave up four singles and three doubles, 
though several of the hits were opposite-field slices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pleased. It was nice,'' he said. ``I wanted to get this  
first one out of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees also got to witness first-hand the kind of intensity  
the Rocket brings. 
</P>
<P>
	After striking out Johnny Damon to end the second inning,  
Clemens gave a slight pump of his fist, congratulating catcher 
Jorge Posada for his selection of pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	His next start probably will come Thursday in Tampa against  
Texas. And though manager Joe Torre has not announced it yet, it's 
thought that Clemens will start the season opener April 5 at 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when the Yankees and their fans will get to enjoy  
watching the ace who won his final 15 decisions and did not lose 
after May. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't see the real Clemens today,'' O'Neill said.

	Dole Expects Kosovo Deal Sunday  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Former Sen. Bob Dole said today ethnic Albanians  
had promised to sign a Kosovo peace plan tomorrow that would give 
them autonomy -- and the breakthrough puts pressure on the Serbs to 
accept the deal or face NATO airstrikes. Dole delivered the news to 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright after traveling to the 
region, at President Clinton's request, to meet with Kosovo's 
ethnic Albanians. The mission is intended to reach agreement before 
a new round of peace talks March 15.

	Clinton Pushes Senate on Education  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton pressured Senate GOP leaders  
today to allow a vote on a measure subsidizing the hiring of more 
teachers and aimed at reducing class size in America's schools. 
``The choice is simple: Are we going to give Americans smaller 
classes, or more partisanship?'' Clinton said in his weekly radio 
address. Clinton was addressing Republican objections to an 
amendment to the GOP-written ``ed-flex'' bill, which would give 
state and local officials more leeway in how they spend federal 
education funds.

	U.S. Jets Bomb Iraqi Sites

	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. Air Force jets today bombed five  
Iraqi anti-aircraft sites after being fired upon during a patrol 
over northern Iraq, U.S. military officials said. The Iraqi sites 
were south of the Saddam Lake near the city of Mosul, 250 miles 
north of Baghdad, said a statement from Operation Northern Watch, 
which enforces the northern no-fly zone. U.S. jets have been 
striking Iraqi military sites on an almost daily basis since late 
December in response to Iraq firing at the planes or locking its 
radar systems on to them.

	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Cambodian soldiers arrested the last  
senior leader of the murderous Khmer Rouge guerrilla army today 
near the northern border with Thailand, senior generals said. Known 
as ``The Butcher'' because of his legendary brutality, Ta Mok was 
captured alone and flown by helicopter to Phnom Penh for trial, 
Defense Minister Tea Banh said. The one-legged guerrilla army chief 
was the last senior leader of the brutal 1975-79 Khmer Rouge regime 
at large.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- China reportedly stole secrets from an American  
government lab, and used the information to help increase its 
nuclear capabilities. Today's New York Times reports that China's 
technological advance was gained from the mid-1980s theft of U.S. 
nuclear secrets from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New 
Mexico, according to administration officials. The espionage was 
not detected until 1995, when American experts analyzing Chinese 
nuclear test results found similarities to America's most advanced 
miniature warhead, the W-88, The Times reported.

	Texas Gov. Bush Had Death Threat

<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Federal agents failed to tell the security staff  
for Gov. George W. Bush about a plot by a group of militant 
separatists to kill him two years ago, The Dallas Morning News 
reported today. An FBI informant who infiltrated the antigovernment 
Republic of Texas said he told the agents about two meetings when 
assassination was discussed. Dudley M. Thomas, director of the 
state agency that protects the governor, said his officers should 
have known about the threats. But FBI agents said they didn't 
confide in the agency because the threats were not considered 
credible.

	Aspirin Centennial Celebrated  
</P>
<P>
	LEVERKUSEN, Germany (AP) -- Bayer AG celebrated the 100th  
anniversary of its wonder drug -- aspirin -- today by turning its 
company headquarters into the world's largest pillbox. Using 
242,190 square feet of cloth, hung from scaffolding by 50 mountain 
climbers, Bayer turned the 400-foot tall building into a giant 
Bayer aspirin carton. On Aug. 10, 1897, a young Bayer researcher, 
Felix Hoffman, first synthesized acetylsalicylic acid, aspirin's 
active ingredient. The celebration marked the 100th anniversary of 
the day the name ``aspirin'' was first registered as a trademark.

	LONDON (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee is backing off  
a plan to strip rank-and-file members of voting for Olympic cities. 
IOC leaders told The Associated Press yesterday that a reform 
commission will be proposed at the special general assembly March 
17-18 in Lausanne, Switzerland. The panel will consider ways of 
changing the structure and operations of the IOC, setting the stage 
for what could be the biggest changes in the body's 105 years.

<HEADLINE> Law Benefiting Rape Victims Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- An appeals court struck down a federal law  
allowing rape victims to sue their attackers for civil rights 
violations, ruling the law was a ``sweeping intrusion'' into 
matters traditionally handled by states. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's groups hoped Friday's decision by the 4th U.S. Circuit  
Court of Appeals would be reviewed and overturned by the Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a tragedy if this became the law of the land,''  
said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Smeal called the 1994 Violence Against Women Act the first major  
advance for women since Congress banned sex discrimination in 
federally funded schools in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th Circuit held that Congress stretched too far its  
interpretation of its right to regulate interstate commerce when it 
passed the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a statute, we are constrained to conclude, simply cannot  
be reconciled with the principles of limited federal government 
upon which this nation is founded,'' Judge J. Michael Luttig wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling is binding in Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland,  
North Carolina and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Eileen Wagner, lawyer for plaintiff Christy Brzonkala, said she  
expected the case would be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can either give it a thumbs-up -- in which case people  
will use this law, which they are reluctant to do now -- or a 
thumbs-down, which would encourage Congress to go back to the 
drawing board and rewrite the thing,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In her suit, Ms. Brzonkala, a Virginia Tech student who has  
allowed her name to be disclosed, sought unspecified damages 
against two football players whom she said had raped her in 
dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
	She did not report the alleged incident for several months and  
no charges were filed against the players. Their lawyers did not 
return calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Brzonkala's lawyers defended the Violence Against Women Act  
by arguing that gender-motivated violence affects commerce by 
imposing medical and legal costs on victims, inhibiting travel by 
those who fear violence and lessening productivity.

<HEADLINE> Research Satellite Out of Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ground controllers were racing against time  
to save a newly launched, $49 million NASA satellite that was 
spinning out of control after being launched into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	The mishap is apparently due to the thruster-like action of  
hydrogen gas venting from a system needed to keep the satellite's 
telescope extremely cold. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wide-Field Infrared Explorer, or Wire, was spinning Friday  
at the rate of once per second. Unless engineers gain control, all 
the hydrogen could be lost, said Don Savage, a spokesman at 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration headquarters in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a race with the clock to turn this and hopefully cool  
down the spacecraft before all the hydrogen is vented,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wire carries a 12.5-inch Cassegrain telescope with infrared  
detectors. 
</P>
<P>
	The 561-pound satellite is the fifth mission under NASA's Small  
Explorer program. The mission was designed to help scientists 
understand how and when galaxies formed and the history of star 
formation. 
</P>
<P>
	The launch cost $18 million.

<HEADLINE> Germans Debate Reichstag Naming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- The old Reichstag building in Berlin should keep  
its name when it becomes the seat of parliament again next month, 
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was quoted Saturday as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The neo-Renaissance stone edifice has been known as the  
Reichstag since its completion in 1894. But some lawmakers, 
including the parliamentary president, feel that the name -- Reich 
means empire in German -- has too many negative historical 
connotations. 
</P>
<P>
	To many, it conjures images of Prussian militarism and they want  
it changed before the key is handed over April 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder, however, was quoted by the Frankfurter Allgemeine  
Zeitung newspaper as saying everyone knows the historic structure 
as the Reichstag and he saw no reason to change the name. The 
Germans are ``too uptight'' in dealing with their history, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper quoted him as saying his Social Democratic Party had  
an ``old bad habit'' of trying to tell people how to behave, and 
calling the Reichstag something neutral like Assembly Hall, one of 
the proposals, would be ``absurd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parliamentary president Wolfgang Thierse had called for renaming  
the building, which is nearing the end of massive renovations. He 
said the name ``Reichstag'' no longer fits with Germany's postwar 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Parliament's council of elders put off a decision on Thursday,  
but agreed that signs pointing to the building, nearing the end of 
renovations, and a planned subway stop would refer to the Deutscher 
Bundestag, the name of the postwar German parliament.

	Robert Cyrus Stewart III, 40, told the newspaper that he posed  
as an arms dealer to infiltrate the group. He is a former Green 
Beret medic who describes himself as an ``independent information 
broker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys wanted me to do Bush and take another (Republic of  
Texas) guy they didn't like along with me and do him, too,'' said 
Stewart. ``They didn't think the threat was credible since I was 
the guy they were talking to about doing the job.''

	Members of the Republic contend the annexation of Texas as a  
state in 1845 was illegal.

<HEADLINE> NASA Tries To Save Spinning Craft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ground controllers worked Saturday to develop  
a method of regaining control of a science satellite that was 
spinning uselessly in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wide-Field Infrared Explorer, or Wire, has been spinning at  
one revolution per second since its launch Thursday night, 
apparently because of the thruster-like action of hydrogen gas 
venting from a system used to keep the satellite's telescope 
extremely cold. 
</P>
<P>
	The $67 million mission was designed to help scientists  
understand how and when galaxies formed, and the history of star 
formation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ground controllers were in contact with the spacecraft and were  
trying to write a software program that would use the spacecraft's 
limited attitude control system to make it stop spinning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The subsystems are in good shape,'' said Jim Watzin, a project  
manager in NASA's Small Explorer program. ``The solar arrays are 
generating power and the battery is fully charged. We have plenty 
of power to effect a recovery.''

<HEADLINE> Few States Gain Ground in Reading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Connecticut led the nation in the latest  
national reading test scores for fourth- and eighth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
	The state-by-state results were released Friday by the  
Department of Education. The test, the National Assessment of 
Educational Progress, was given by 39 states last year. These 
results measure about 18,680 fourth and eighth graders. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut had the nation's highest student scores as  
determined by the National Assessment Governing Board, which sets 
the test standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakdown of state-by-state test results date back to 1992.  
</P>
<P>
	The national results of the 1998 reading tests, released last  
month, showed improvements in each of the three tested grade levels 
-- fourth, eighth and 12th -- from the 1994 tests. Eighth graders 
improved from 1992. Public and private school students were tested. 
</P>
<P>
	The state results, which exclude private school students and  
12th graders, showed average reading scores increased significantly 
in nine states, and there were no significant declines. 
</P>
<P>
	For fourth-graders, Connecticut's students scored highest. The  
next highest, in alphabetical order, include Colorado, Iowa, 
Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire and 
Wisconsin, as well as the Department of Defense overseas schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut also scored highest among eighth-graders. Coming  
next, in alphabetical order, were Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, 
Minnesota, Montana, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, 
Washington, Wisconsin, Washington and Department of Defense 
overseas and domestic schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1992 and 1998, Connecticut, Colorado, Kentucky,  
Mississippi, North Carolina and the Virgin Islands all showed 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite progress, gains in reading haven't been as widespread or  
consistent as those in math, said Wilmer S. Cody, the Kentucky 
education commissioner and a member of the testing board. Also, 
there are still wide gaps in achievement by race, gender and 
poverty level, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	States that did not participate were Alaska, Idaho, Illinois,  
Indiana, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, 
South Dakota and Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	Individual state scores are available on the Internet, at the  
Education Department Web site, http://nces.ed.gov

<HEADLINE> Reid Wins 400m at NCAA Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Suziann Reid of Texas extended her streak of  
collegiate victories at 400 meters Saturday by successfully 
defending her title in the event and then ran a strong anchor in 
the 1,600-meter relay as Texas retained the NCAA Indoors Track and 
Field championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid got out first in the 400, completing her first lap in a  
speedy 24.29 seconds. She pulled away from Baylor's Yulana Nelson 
down the backstretch to win the event for a 10th consecutive time 
in 51.68, nearly a second faster than her winning time last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas senior came up short in a bid to improve on the meet  
record of 51.05 set by Maicel Malone of Arizona State in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping to get the record, but it's fine,'' said Reid,  
whose time was the fastest by a woman in collegiate competition 
this season. ``I did my job. I'm here to make points for my team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She helped do that again in the final event, which began with  
the Lady Longhorns tied for the team lead with LSU. Texas moved to 
the front about halfway through the relay and was still there when 
Reid got the baton. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Reid on the winning team was Angel Patterson, Aminah  
Haddad and Tanya Jarrett. The quartet combined to cover the 
distance in 3:31.55, the second-fastest women's collegiate time 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid had special motivation as she ran at the RCA Dome with  
members of her family in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came all the way from Maryland. I had to put on a show,''  
she said. ``I felt comfortable, confident and relaxed. My top goal 
was to defend my title in my last indoor champions and I was really 
happy to be able to do it in front of my parents who drove 14 hours 
just to watch me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas finished with 61 points and LSU, which had its streak of  
five straight championships snapped by the Lady Longhorns last 
year, was second with 57 and Southern Methoidist was third with 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas used depth to win its 15th men's indoor title in 16  
years. The Razorbacks accumulated 65 points although their only 
victory came in the triple jump -- an event they've dominated. 
Melvin Lister went 55-0 3/4 as a Razorback won the event for the 12th 
time in 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford was runner-up for the second straight year with 42 1/2  
points and South Carolina placed third with 27. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's meet produced the only collegiate record when Jacob  
Davis of Texas cleared 19-2 1/2 in the pole vault, topping the 
collegiate and meet record of 19-1 1/2 set in 1994 by Lawrence Johnson 
of Tennessee 
</P>
<P>
	LSU's bid suffered a serious blow with Peta-Gaye Dowdie, the 200  
champion on Friday and the fastest qualifier for the finals of the 
60 was disqualified for a false start. Debbie Ferguson of Georgia, 
the runner-up in 1998, won the event in 7:24 and LaKeisha Backus of 
Texas, who placed seventh in defense of her 1998 championship in 
the 200 on Friday, was third. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's Hazel Clark successfully defended her championship in  
the 800, covering the distance in a meet record 2:01.77. Amy Wickus 
of Wisconsin set the former mark of 2:02.05 in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming out quickly, Clark completed the first 200 in 29.1 and  
was never seriously challenged. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stayed away from track for a long time because I wasn't sure  
I could live up to expectations,'' said Clark, who now plans to 
compete professionally. ``I'm sad to be leaving this (college), but 
I'm very excited about the next stage of my life. I'm going to try 
to get some sponsorships and we'll see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another defending champion, Pittsburgh's Trecia Smith, finished  
second in the triple jump. North Carolina's Nicole Gamble soared 
46-1 1/4 to win the event, while Smith's best effort was 46 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Other women's champions determined Saturday included freshman  
Kate Vermoulen of West Virginia, 4:39.07 in the mile; Villanova's 
Carrie Tollefson, 9:15.05 in the 3,000; and Erin Aldrich of Texas, 
6-3 1/2 in the high jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri's Derrick Peterson flirted with the meet record in the  
men's 800 after placing second in the event last year. Peterson won 
the event this year in 1:45.88, just a fraction of a second off the 
record mark of 1:45.80 set by Einars Tupuritis of Wichita State in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Two freshmen left the RCA Dome with collegiate titles. Clemson's  
Ato Modibo won the men's 400 in 46.11 and Tennessee's Leonard Scott 
took top honors in the 60-meter dash in 6.58.46 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Washington State's Bernard Lagat became the first  
men's competitor to finish first in both the mile and 3,000 on 
Saturday since Joe Falcon of Arkansas completed the feat in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Abilene Christian successfully defended its  
championships in the men's and women's competition for Division II 
schools.

	Applications Rise at Colleges  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Growing Internet use combined with a surge in high  
school graduates helped boost the number of college applications 
submitted last year, several school officials have reported. 
Although most colleges don't accept applications via the Internet, 
it's becoming far more common for them to post blank applications 
on the Web, allowing would-be students to download forms and mail 
them in later. Even without the Internet, schools would probably be 
reporting a jump in applicants. The number of high school seniors 
has been increasing about 3 percent annually in recent years. 
Experts predict there will be close to 3 million high school 
graduates next year, up from 2.6 million in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the number of applications is outstripping the increase  
in students.

questionnaires to screen out disabled applicants. The suit claims 
Wal-Mart violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, attorneys 
for the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said 
yesterday. The questionnaire asked applicants to indicate if they 
might need any accommodation to perform required duties. The EEOC 
says it is illegal to ask about disability before a job offer is 
made.

readying a new program to curb fraud on the Web. Stock trading by 
computer, online auctions and direct sales of products to 
businesses and consumers already account for billions of dollars in 
sales each year. The new program, being developed under Vice 
President Al Gore, will ``represent the first time the department 
has made Internet fraud a priority,'' said Assistant Attorney 
General James K. Robinson.

the first time to finish at 9,736.08, topping its Jan. 8 record

<P>
	MAEBASHI, Japan (AP) -- The pole vault competition at the World  
Indoor Track and Field Championships was held up for 10 minutes 
today while officials tried to decide whether French vaulter Jean 
Galfione touched the bar with his hands on what turned out to be 
the winning jump of 6.00 meters (19 feet, 8 1/4 inches). The jump was 
at first disallowed by technical delegate Cecil Smith of Canada. 
But that decision was overruled and Galfione, the 1996 Olympic 
champion, was declared the winner.

	Tyson Won't Face More Jail in Ind.  
</P>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson can  
look forward to restarting his boxing career now that his legal 
problems are resolved. Tyson must serve an extra 60 days in a 
Maryland jail for violating his Indiana probation for a 1992 rape 
conviction, under an agreement filed yesterday in Marion County 
(Ind.) Superior Court. But when Tyson will actually be released 
from jail and resume his career is unclear.

<HEADLINE> UConn's Freeman Named Tourney MVP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On a team with as many weapons as Big East  
champion Connecticut, Kevin Freeman often gets overlooked, hidden 
behind teammates like Richard Hamilton, the conference's co-Player 
of the Year, and point guard Khalid El-Amin. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's why when it came time to pick this season's  
all-conference team, Freeman was missing in action. 
</P>
<P>
	Not on the first team.  
</P>
<P>
	Not on the second team.  
</P>
<P>
	Not on the third team.  
</P>
<P>
	Not a problem.  
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7 junior from Springfield, Mass., made up for the  
snub by winning the Most Outstanding Player award Saturday night as 
the Huskies captured the conference tournament for the second 
straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not making one of the teams really hurt,'' Freeman said.  
``This is probably the best thing that can happen without having 
them vote over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman had a modest nine points and six rebounds in the 82-63  
destruction of St. John's but was a major part of the defensive 
effort that turned the game into a blowout early. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a role change for him after he had been the difference on  
offense for the Huskies in their first two tournament wins, scoring 
22 against Seton Hall and 21 against Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played like that most of the year,'' Freeman said. ``I do  
what the team needs me to do to help us win. Today was defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman had plenty of credentials for all-conference honors. He  
was UConn's No. 3 scorer with 12.8 points per game and leading 
rebounder with 208 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	He is No. 2 in career field goal percentage for the Huskies at  
56 percent and led the team with a 60.7 percentage this season. 
During the Big East tournament, he passed the 1,000-point plateau, 
becoming only the fourth player in UConn basketball history with at 
least 1,000 points and 600 rebounds before the conclusion of his 
junior season. 
</P>
<P>
	All of this is often hidden by the flash and dash of Hamilton  
and El-Amin. Those two took care of the offense against St. John's 
but Freeman wasn't overlooked this time. 
</P>
<P>
	When he stepped to the foul line with just over 10 minutes to  
play and the issue well in hand, the sellout Madison Square Garden 
crowd of 19,548 expressed its appreciation, chanting ``MVP! MVP! 
MVP!'' Freeman responded with a huge grin. Somebody had noticed. 
</P>
<P>
	It was payback for the earlier snub.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised at that,'' he said of the all-conference vote.  
``I did a good job. I thought I was at least third team. I play 
hard. You should be recognized for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not a problem within his team.  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim Calhoun has been touting Freeman for some time.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think Kevin had nothing more remarkable than in the sense  
that he showed more of what he is.'' he said. ``We see this every 
day in practice. He ignited us to where we are tonight. He was one 
of the major, major reasons we came into this tournament at 25-2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he's a major reason why they leave it 28-2.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Senate on Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton argued Saturday to get a  
vote on teacher hiring subsidies, the centerpiece of his education 
agenda, attached to a popular Republican school bill moving through 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``The choice is simple: Are we going to give Americans smaller  
classes, or more partisanship?'' Clinton said in his weekly radio 
address. ``Are we going to put politics ahead of progress, or put 
100,000 teachers in our nation's classrooms?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton accused GOP congressional leaders of ``trying to shut  
down debate'' and thwart his proposal for another round of grants 
to help schools reach the goal Clinton and Congress set in 1998 of 
hiring 100,000 new teachers over the next six years. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is the GOP-written legislation, dubbed ``Ed Flex,'' to  
give states more flexibility in spending federal school dollars. It 
appeared destined for swift enactment until Democrats, in what is 
shaping into the first big policy battle of the post-impeachment 
Congress, sought to expand the bill to fit the president's 
education agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has promised a vote  
Monday to force the legislation's passage without Democratic 
amendments. The legislation expands nationwide a 12-state pilot 
project that waives regulations for many federal school programs in 
order to encourage local reform efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and congressional Democrats want to use the bill as a  
vehicle for winning a second year of financing for grants to help 
school districts hire and train 100,000 new teachers over seven 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	In budget negotiations leading up to last November's election,  
Republicans agreed to the first round of grants, more than $1 
billion to be released in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have the first big test of whether this Congress is  
really willing to work together across party lines and with the 
White House to get things done,'' Clinton said Saturday, ``whether 
the Congress is serious about giving our children the education 
they need and deserve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to cut pupil-teacher ratios in the first through  
third grades. The national average now is 22 pupils per teacher, 
and Clinton wants that reduced to 18 or fewer.

<HEADLINE> Milk Producers Expect Price Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A plunge in milk prices over the next month  
could spell economic turmoil for some dairy producers, but 
consumers will reap benefits of lower-priced milk, cheese and 
butter, economists say. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department said Friday the basic milk price  
received by producers will drop from $16.27 per hundred pounds of 
milk to $10.27 -- the sharpest ever month-to-month decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The government determines the price each month by surveying  
processors about the price they are paying to producers, then 
announcing the figure as a guideline for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Nubern, an economist with the National Milk Producers  
Federation, said the largest month-to-month decline ever recorded 
was $2.52. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are some very low prices for dairy farmers,'' Nubern  
said. ``Ten-dollar milk is not very profitable for dairy farmers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone across the country is going to feel some of the price  
decline in some shape or form,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nubern said the dip is partly due to increased production  
prompted by record prices: ``We're in a market where a lot of milk 
is being produced, and that's driving prices down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the size of the drop, the price will not reach the  
lowest level dairy farmers have seen. In February 1991, for 
instance, prices were at $10.04, Nubern said. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers also have a cushion waiting for them. Congress  
included $200 million for dairy producers in last year's emergency 
farm aid package. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman is still 
deciding how to distribute the money. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop comes after a record year where, unique among producers  
in other agricultural sectors, milk producers received extremely 
high prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers were getting about $10.88 in May of last year, but  
prices jumped to $17.34 by December. Consumers saw the price of 
milk and dairy products rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The average retail price of a gallon of whole milk in January  
was $2.94, compared with $2.63 a year ago, said Annette Clausson, a 
USDA economist. Butter was $3 a pound in January, compared with 
$2.35 a pound a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're expecting that retail prices for milk and other dairy  
products will start coming down midsummer,'' Clausson said.

<HEADLINE> Meissnitzer Eyes 2 World Cup Wins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. MORITZ, Switzerland (AP) -- Renate Goetschl has already  
wrapped up the World Cup downhill title, and Austria could load up 
on two more crystal globes before the weekend is out if Alexandra 
Meissnitzer has her way. 
</P>
<P>
	A double gold medalist at the World Championships in Vail last  
month, Meissnitzer now has her sights set firmly on two World Cup 
crowns. 
</P>
<P>
	All she needs is a win in today's Super-G -- a specialty of  
Meissnitzer's -- and the 25-year-old Austrian would own both the 
overall and Super-G crowns when she leaves St. Moritz for the World 
Cup finals in Sierra Nevada, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Though her sixth-place tie with Hilde Gerg in Friday's downhill  
did not allow her to clinch the overall -- Gerg is the only skier 
who can mathematically still overtake her -- Meissnitzer only needs 
to score two more points than Gerg in today's super-G to clinch the 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still 100 percent motivated because there is still so much  
at stake,'' said Meissnitzer, who won gold in the super-G and giant 
slalom at the worlds. ``I hope I can win the titles, but in Sierra 
Nevada there will still be the giant slalom to be decided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With super-G specialists Martina Ertl of Germany and France's  
Regine Cavagnoud both sidelined with knee injuries, Meissnitzer has 
received help from two of her other main challengers. 
</P>
<P>
	With 1,490 points, Meissnitzer holds a 399-point advantage over  
Gerg in the overall rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	If Gerg can finish ahead of Meissnitzer, the German would  
virtually still have to sweep all four races at the finals if she 
wants to overtake her Austrian rival. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a tall order for the German, who saw her chances at the  
downhill title evaporate Friday when Goetschl rocketed to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Goetschl, meanwhile, can rest easy, having already claimed the  
only title she is realistically in contention for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so happy to have clinched the title here so I can go to  
the finals, relax and enjoy everything Sierra Nevada has to 
offer,'' said Goetschl, the World Cup downhill titlist in 1997 and 
runnerup behind Germany's Katja Seizinger last year. ``I'm so happy 
I was so consistent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't explain how I did so well,'' added Goetschl, who won  
four World Cup downhill races in addition to her victory at the 
worlds. ``I just think everything came together at the same time. I 
have good equipment, great physical and mental form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since joining the World Cup circuit in 1993 Goetschl had one  
victory each year until this season.

<HEADLINE> Defense Experts Cite Cyberattacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The threat of a cyberattack -- an electronic  
Pearl Harbor -- is the most immediate, compelling danger facing the 
United States, former government officials and defense experts told 
a Senate panel Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Their other concerns include the proliferation of missiles  
capable of mass destruction among rogue states and terrorists 
developing their capability to use chemical and biological weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	At the first meeting of the Senate Armed Services Committee's  
new panel on emerging threats and capabilities, witnesses were 
asked what ``good grief situations'' kept them awake at night. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Ellsworth, former deputy defense secretary, said his main  
fear was a cyberattack against critical information 
infrastructures. Among them, systems that control medical services, 
electric power generation, telecommunications, banking and finance 
and oil and gas production. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most important, most compelling danger and one to  
which we should apply our resources immediately,'' Ellsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, Ellsworth warned against cyber-based attacks  
disguised as Y2K computer problems. Many computer systems worldwide 
are expected to malfunction on Jan 1, 2000 because some computers 
will fail to recognize the change in century. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disruptions may result from the malicious embedding of code in  
existing programs by programers ostensibly 'fixing' software to 
make it Y2K compliant, '' Ellsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former U.N Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick said one of her  
preoccupations was missile proliferation, particularly by a 
``psychotic'' nation such as North Korea. She said China also was 
busy developing the capacity to deliver weapons of mass destruction 
and passing that technology on to Iran and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Krepinevich, head of the Center for Strategic and  
Budgetary Assessments, a Washington-based defense think tank, 
warned about terrorists learning ``to alter toxins so they could 
develop a weapon that could target a specific group-- a genetically 
engineered Holocaust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress and the Clinton administration have increased their  
attention and resources on counterterrorism. In January, President 
Clinton proposed spending $1.4 billion for the coming fiscal year 
to enhance domestic readiness in the event of a chemical or 
biological terrorist attack.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Won't Face More Jail in Ind. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson can  
look forward to restarting his boxing career now that his legal 
problems are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see no reason why he doesn't resume training and fighting''  
once he is released from a Maryland jail, James Voyles, Tyson's 
Indianapolis lawyer, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson must serve an extra 60 days in a Maryland jail for  
violating his Indiana probation for a 1992 rape conviction, under 
an agreement filed Friday in Marion County (Ind.) Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Tyson will actually be released from jail and resume  
his career is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's 60-day sentence for violating probation won't affect his  
Nevada boxing license, said Kirk Hendrick, legal counsel for the 
Nevada State Athletic Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hendrick said just having the license doesn't guarantee  
Tyson's right to fight. He said a promoter has to put together a 
card that would include Tyson, and that card would have to be 
approved by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are probably some tough questions Mike and his people  
would have to answer'' if promoters sought commission approval for 
such a card, Hendrick said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's 60-day sentence will begin at the end of the one year he  
is serving in Montgomery County, Md., for a misdemeanor assault. 
The Maryland sentence still could be reduced for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana authorities could have forced Tyson to serve up to four  
years in prison, but they wanted to resolve the issue at no further 
cost to taxpayers while still holding Tyson accountable, Marion 
County prosecutor Scott Newman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were frankly not anxious -- and I don't think the people of  
Indiana were anxious -- to have Mike Tyson back in our courts and in 
our jails,'' Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson will pay Indiana $80 per day, or a total of $4,800, for  
the cost of his incarceration, and Indiana will reimburse Maryland 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Tyson admitted he violated his probation.  
He also waived his right to appeal his no-contest plea to charges 
he assaulted two men after a minor traffic accident in August. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving the additional 60 days, his record will show that  
his Indiana probation was terminated as ``unsatisfactory,'' the 
agreement said. That would be taken into consideration if Tyson 
gets into legal trouble again. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's probation was scheduled to end March 24. If he had been  
forced to appear in court in Indiana on a probation violation, he 
probably would have withdrawn his Maryland plea and appealed his 
sentence, Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would have been protracted litigation in this matter,  
probably in two states,'' Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was signed Thursday by Newman, Tyson and Voyles  
and was accepted Friday by Judge Patricia Gifford, who had 
sentenced Tyson for his 1992 conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson began serving his Maryland sentence Feb. 5. He had until  
Sunday to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Evander Holyfield, who has twice beaten Tyson in the ring, was  
unmoved when told that Tyson will serve an extra 60 days for 
violating parole. Tyson was disqualified for biting Holyfield's 
ears in their last fight, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike has to handle his business and I think I'll be most  
effective if I handle my own,'' Holyfield said in Burbank, Calif., 
where he is preparing for his March 13 title bout against Lennox 
Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Muhammad Siddeeq, a spiritual adviser to Tyson, said those close  
to the boxer are ``extremely grateful'' a deal could be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure that Mike would want me to say on his behalf ... that  
he's going to try to be worthy of the consideration that's been 
given him,'' Siddeeq said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was on probation in Indiana for raping a beauty pageant  
contestant in an Indianapolis hotel room in 1991. He was released 
from prison in March 1995 after serving three years of a six-year 
sentence.

<HEADLINE> Oregon Wreck Becomes Tourist Stop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALDPORT, Ore. (AP) -- While the wreck of the New Carissa is an  
environmental time bomb to some, its rusty hulk means profits to 
savvy entrepreneurs cashing in on a wave of gawkers here to have a 
look. 
</P>
<P>
	Only hours after the ship's oil-laden, broken bow nosed onto the  
beach, T-shirts began appearing emblazoned with the words: ``The 
New Carissa Tour '99 -- Floating to a coastal town near you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going like crazy. We can't keep them in,'' Cherie  
Turner, a clerk at a local drug store, said Friday. ``Visitors are 
buying them and so are local people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No vacancy'' signs glowed at many motels where two or three  
guests on another winter weekday would be a welcome event. 
</P>
<P>
	So many sightseers have flooded this town of 1,750 to catch a  
glimpse of the wreck that Gov. John Kitzhaber declared a local 
state of emergency and warned people to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
	Against this backdrop, workers on the beach unfurled a new,  
9-ton 14-inch-thick, polyester tow rope that will be used to haul 
away the wreck. Salvage crews hope to connect the rope today. 
</P>
<P>
	The bow is still believed to be holding up to 130,000 gallons of  
fuel oil, apparently the source of tar balls clinging to 23 miles 
of beach. Already, wildlife officials have counted 242 dead birds, 
105 of which were oiled. Another 116 shore birds are still in 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans call for towing the hulk more than 200 miles out to sea  
and sinking it. Salvage experts say water pressure and the 
34-degree temperature on the ocean floor will solidify the oil and 
prevent it from becoming an environmental hazard. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since the ship ran aground down the coast at Coos Bay on  
Feb. 4, Coast Guard and salvage crews have faced one setback after 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship was set afire, which succeeded in burning away half the  
oil on board. But it broke in two and spilled 70,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	The first attempt to bury the bow at sea failed earlier this  
week when the tow line ripped loose. The carcass of the ship ended 
up here, 80 miles north of its last stop along the coast.

<HEADLINE> Russians Lead Grand Prix Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) -- Rising star Tatiana Malinina of  
Uzbekistan and world champion Alexei Yagudin dominated the women's 
and men's short programs Friday in the opening of the ISU Grand 
Prix finals. 
</P>
<P>
	China's Xue Shen and Hongbo Zhao took the pairs short program,  
while Russia's Anjelica Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov came out on 
top in both the compulsory and original ice dances. 
</P>
<P>
	Malinina took the women's short program, upsetting favorite  
Maria Butyrskaya despite a difficult program. Malinina nailed a 
triple lutz-double toe, a triple flip and a strong high double 
axel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time I've been in the final and I was hoping  
only to give a good performance,'' said Malinina, who is training 
in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians had been expected to dominate on their home ice in  
the Grand Prix, which lasts through Sunday and offers a preview of 
the sport's best before the world championships in Helsinki, 
Finland, on March 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin of Russia executed a clean triple axel-triple toe and  
triple lutz, as did 16-year-old runner-up Evgeny Plushenko. But 
Yagudin's artistic program was stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	Xue and Hongbo shined with a very high double twist and a throw  
on the triple loop. Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton 
Sikharulidze, Olympic silver medalists, had been expected to fare 
more strongly, but Berezhnaya made three mistakes, including a fall 
right in front of the judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Krylova and Ovsyannikov placed first in the compulsory and  
original dances Friday, with difficult, fast programs that they 
performed smoothly. French pair Marina Anissina and Gwendal 
Peizerat came in second in both programs.

<HEADLINE> Appointment of Robertson Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The appointment of Pat Robertson to an  
economic development panel is being criticized by people who point 
out that one of the religious broadcaster's charitable enterprises 
is being investigated for alleged unethical business practices. 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. Janet D. Howell, whose complaint two years ago set  
off the probe, said Robertson's ``ethics are under serious 
question, and that's not the kind of image that should be put forth 
by Virginia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations relate to Operation Blessing, a food and medical  
relief organization that provides flights around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	As a charity, the organization gets a sales tax exemption. But  
Howell challenged the exemption after two Operation Blessing pilots 
complained that some of their planes were used almost exclusively 
to ferry equipment to a Robertson-owned diamond mine in Congo. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Miner, a spokesman for Gov. Jim Gilmore, defended  
Robertson's appointment to the Virginia Economic Development 
Partnership, saying no wrongdoing has been proven. 
</P>
<P>
	A Robertson spokeswoman, Patty Silverman, said ``we're very  
confident that the outcome will be resolved'' favorably to 
Operation Blessing, which she said has provided $96 million in 
relief to 130 million people since 1978.

<HEADLINE> Gebrselassie, Szabo Finish Doubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAEBASHI, Japan (AP) -- Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie and  
Romania's Gabriela Szabo completed distance doubles at the World 
Indoor Championships on Sunday, becoming only the second and third 
athletes to win two individual gold medals in the same 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The smiling Gebrselassie added the 1,500-meter title to the  
3,000 he won Friday, while the intense Szabo took the 3,000 after 
having won the 1,500 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other athlete to win two individual events at the  
biennial championships was Germany's Hieke Drechsler in 1987, 
taking the women's 200 and long jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Sunday's two winners, Gebrselassie had the more difficult  
time. He never led the fast-paced 1,500 until overtaking Kenya's 
Laban Rotich with six meters remaining. He finished in 3 minutes, 
33.77 seconds, breaking the meet record of 3:35.31 by Morocco's 
Hicham el Guerrouj in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebrselassie never was far off the pace, settling into second  
all the way, behind Rotich or another Kenyan, William Tanui. But 
down the final straightaway, he kept closing in on Rotich, before 
finally passing him shortly before the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fantastic,'' Gebrselassie said. ``It's not only important  
to run OK. I knew it was a very fast time. One gold medal in a 
championships is ordinary. I wanted to get two gold and be a little 
different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was the first major championship in the 1,500 for  
Gebrselassie, the world record-holder in the outdoor 5,000 and 
10,000 meters, who prefers the longer races. 
</P>
<P>
	Szabo, the youngest indoor gold medalist when she won her first  
title four years ago at 19, stayed behind the early pace of 
Slovenia's Helena Javornik. Then, she exchanged the lead with 
Morocco's Zahra Quaziz before taking it for good starting the final 
lap. Throughout the race, however, she appeared to be in full 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	Szabo finished in 8:36.42, with Quaziz second at 8:38.43 and  
Regina Jacobs third in an American record 8:39.14. 
</P>
<P>
	``How could things be better?'' Szabo said. ``One gold is great,  
two in a championships, now that is remarkable. Look, even the time 
is excellent. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a lot of running to do in a couple of days, and so all  
I have to concentrate on now is rest, rest and more rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a stunning upset, Ludmila Formanova of the Czech Republic  
handed Mozambique's Maria Mutola her first indoor defeat in six 
years, winning the women's 800 in 1:56.90, the second-fastest time 
in history. Germany's Christine Wachtel holds the world record of 
1:56.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutola, leading into the final straightaway in quest of her  
fourth straight title, wound up second at 1:57.17. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's Javier Sotomayor, the world indoor and outdoor  
record-holder in the men's high jump, won his fourth indoor title, 
clearing 7 feet, 8 3/4 inches, the best in the world this year. 
Russia's Vyacheslav Voronin also leaped 7-8 3/4, but Sotomayor won on 
fewer misses. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic champion Charles Austin of the United States was third  
at 7-7 3/4, a season's best. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Jamie Baulch, the silver medalist in the men's 400 at  
the 1997 championships, led all the way this time in winning by 1 1/2 
meters over Milt Campbell of the United States in 45.73. Campbell 
was timed in 45.99. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Grit Breuer, who spent three years on drug suspension  
from 1992-95 but since has won two European championships, won the 
women's 400 by three meters in 50.80, the best in the world this 
year. Nigeria's Falilat Ogunkoya was second at 51.25 and 1997 gold 
medalist Jearl Miles-Clark of the United States took third at 
51.45. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain got another gold medal in the women's triple jump, as  
Ashia Hansen, the world record-holder, soared 49-3 1/2 on her first 
attempt and it stood up the rest of the way. Bulgaria's Iva 
Prandzheva was runner-up at 49-0 1/4, making her the fourth-best 
performer in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice Greene, the indoor world record-holder in the 60 meters,  
and Gail Devers, the two-time world indoor champion, did not have 
auspicious debuts at the championships 
</P>
<P>
	Upset by a false start against him and a series of false starts  
against several other sprinters in the first round, Greene was last 
out of the blocks in his heat and finished second to Georgios 
Theodoridis of Greece. Both were timed in 6.56, but the 
little-known Theodoridis, who ran his personal best, was declared 
the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system is too sensitive, but you've got to deal with  
whatever it is,'' Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene came back later and won his semifinal heat in 6.45,  
breaking the meet record of 6.46 by Canada's Bruny Surin in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Harden, who beat Greene in the final of the USA  
Championships last week, won his opening heat in 6.51 and his 
semifinal heat in 6.47. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 60, Devers, owner of the fastest time in the  
world this year at 6.98, also was beaten by a Greek in the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	Katerina Thanou, the 1996 European indoor champion, outraced  
Devers in 7.01, making her the No. 6 performer in history. Devers, 
the 1993 and 1997 indoor champion and the 1992 and 1996 100-meter 
gold medalist, was a distant second at 7.14. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanou again beat Devers in the semifinals, clocking 6.99,  
moving her to fifth on the all-time list. Devers finished at 7.07, 
behind Sevatheda Fynes of the Bahamas (7.01). 
</P>
<P>
	Devers' American teammate, Inger Miller, won her heat in a  
personal-best 7.07 and lowered her time in winning her semifinal 
heat in 7.03. 
</P>
<P>
	After six events of the heptathlon, France's Sebastian Chmara  
held a four-point lead over Erkl Nool of Estonia. Chmara had a 
total of 5,489 points, as only 74 points separated the top five 
heptathletes going into the final event, the 1,000 meters.

</P>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Avery C. Alexander, a patriarch of New  
Orleans' civil rights movement who was arrested 20 times before he 
lost count, died Friday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	A black Baptist minister and six-term Democratic state  
representative, Alexander championed anti-discrimination, voter 
registration, labor, closer police oversight and environmental 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, he served as an adviser to Gov. deLesseps ``Chep''  
Morrison, helping blacks get their first chance at political 
patronage in menial, janitor-level jobs. He went on to become the 
first black to hold seats on parish and state Democratic Party 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1963, New Orleans police dragged him by his heels down the  
steps of City Hall after he led an unsuccessful effort to integrate 
its cafeteria.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lord Denning, one of Britain's longest-serving and  
most respected judges, died Friday. He was 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Denning served 38 years on the bench, the last 20 as Master of  
the Rolls, the head of the Court of Appeal. He had a reputation as 
a legal innovator who did not feel restricted by literal 
interpretations of statutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his notable decisions, Denning ruled that the government  
did not have the right to prevent Sir Freddie Laker from operating 
his cut-price Skytrain service to New York, a decision that ushered 
in low-cost air travel across the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	He also helped draft a law that prevented manufacturers and  
suppliers from voiding a buyer's basic rights by the small print in 
their warranty forms.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Richard Kiley, who was Broadway's original ``Man  
of La Mancha'' and had countless other roles on TV, in movies and 
on the stage, died Friday at 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiley was a strong-voiced baritone who became of one of  
Broadway's stalwart leading men in musicals and dramas of the 1950s 
and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiley had his biggest success singing ``The Impossible Dream''  
in ``La Mancha.'' He won a Tony Award for his role as Don Quixote 
in the musical, which opened in 1965 and ran for more than five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor also won a Tony for his performance in ``Redhead,'' a  
Victorian murder-mystery musical. 
</P>
<P>
	On television, Kiley appeared in ``The Thorn Birds,'' one of the  
most successful miniseries of all time, and won an Emmy Award for 
playing an Australian sheep farmer. He also won Emmys for the TV 
series ``A Year in the Life,'' which lasted only a year on NBC, and 
for ``Picket Fences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the movies in which he appeared were ``The Blackboard  
Jungle,'' ``The Little Prince,'' ``Looking for Mr. Goodbar,'' 
``Endless Love'' and ``Patch Adams.''

</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Retired Navy Capt. William L. McGonagle, who  
received the Medal of Honor for heroism as skipper of the USS 
Liberty when Israel unleashed a deadly attack on the 
intelligence-gathering ship in 1967, died Wednesday in Palm 
Springs. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-four crewmen were killed and 171 were wounded when the  
Liberty was attacked by Israeli air force planes and torpedo boats 
in international waters north of Sinai during the Six Day War 
between Israel and its Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship was bombed with napalm, torpedoed and shelled.  
</P>
<P>
	The attack, blamed on a mistaken identification of the Liberty  
as an Egyptian ship, remains one of the most controversial events 
in U.S.-Israeli relations and led to allegations of a cover-up by 
the governments. 
</P>
<P>
	McGonagle, who was severely wounded but stayed in command on the  
bridge through the battle and for many hours afterward, broke his 
silence years later and joined former shipmates in demanding the 
two governments release all details of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel apologized to the United States but claimed there had  
been a misidentification and that the ship's markings were 
inadequate. Israel paid more than $12 million in compensation.

	LEXINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- Gordon C. McKibben, a retired journalist  
for The Boston Globe, The Wall Street Journal and Business Week, 
died Wednesday of cancer. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	McKibben served as business editor, European correspondent and  
ombudsman for the Globe. He worked several years for The Wall 
Street Journal in Los Angeles, and then 17 years for Business Week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe hired him as business editor in 1980, and he remade  
the newspaper's financial section and expanded its staff and 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Later he went to London as European correspondent, and then  
returned to Boston as ombudsman, representing readers and writing a 
biweekly column on the newspaper's operations. 
</P>
<P>
	After he retired, McKibben wrote ``The Cutting Edge,'' a history  
of The Gillette Co., published last year by the Harvard Business

<P>
	MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- The emir of Bahrain, a key western ally  
who struggled to subdue unrest from his Gulf island's Shiite 
majority, died today after suffering a heart attack at his palace. 
He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheik Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa allowed use of Bahraini  
airfields by British and American warplanes. After the Persian Gulf 
War he traveled to Washington to sign a security pact with the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Bahrain, an island nation in the Persian Gulf, is home to the  
biggest U.S. naval base in the region. Sheik Isa offered facilities 
to the U.S. Navy, discreetly at first because of likely popular 
resentment against a foreign military presence, then openly during 
and after the 1990-91 Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The transition of power was expected to be smooth because Crown  
Prince Sheik Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa has been heavily involved in 
the day-to-day running of the country. Hamad, a graduate of the 
Sandhurst Military Academy in Britain, is the commander in chief of 
the Bahraini defense forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheik Isa is the first monarch to die in the Gulf region in 17  
years, since the death of Saudi Arabia's King Khaled in 1982. The 
emir ascended the throne in 1961.

<HEADLINE> Gore Borrows From Clinton Playbook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From traffic jams to dirty drinking water, Al  
Gore is tackling bite-sized problems to impress swing voters for 
the 2000 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president's schedule over the next two weeks could have  
come from President Clinton's 1996 playbook. Clinton promised 
uniforms for school children, safety locks for handguns, and a host 
of similar poll-tested quality of life initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Clinton was accused of pandering, the strategy helped  
convince voter -- particularly suburbanites and parents -- that he 
cared about issues that touch their lives. Gore intends to do the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not small ideas,'' the vice president said in an  
interview Friday. ``They're important ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the president in the Caribbean and Arkansas all week, Gore  
has scheduled events reflecting his desire for a vote-getting 
agenda he can claim as his own. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he plays host to local traffic reporters and  
announces a proposal to help provide alternative transportation for 
people stuck in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, Gore will unveil rules to make flying easier and  
safer. One official equated the package to a passengers' bill of 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, he returns to an issue he handled in Congress:  
health care policies that discriminate against people whose genetic 
composition makes them prone to an illness or disease. 
</P>
<P>
	He travels to Miami on Friday to announce an empowerment zone, a  
pitch toward more traditional Democratic voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Next week, after a one-day swing through Iowa and New Hampshire,  
Gore will return to his mini-agenda, announcing a ``major step'' in 
the administration's clean water plan and a proposal to ``help 
consumers understand how to take prescription medicine safely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Morris, who engineered Clinton's 1996 strategy, said these  
types of events can help define Gore as something other than the 
president's understudy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He needs to get out from the president's shadow,'' said  
Morris, who does not advise Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's following a well-tested script,'' Democratic consultant  
Jim Duffy said. ``It worked once. Keep on going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican strategists will be quick to criticize Gore, as  
they did Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Dick Morris is not on his payroll, Gore is certainly  
reading his (newspaper) columns. This is vintage Dick Morris, itty 
bitty policy prescriptions and photo-op approach to politics and 
governing,'' said Ed Gillespie, who hopes to help Rep. John Kasich 
of Ohio become president in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	That criticism rankles Gore.  
</P>
<P>
	``Putting empowerment zones in communities that need  
revitalization means the world to families that live there. It's 
not a small idea,'' Gore said. ``Having clean water and freedom 
from (health care) discrimination are goals that are part of the 
American dream. They're not small ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These are not new issues to Gore; he has talked about suburban  
sprawl and traffic for months. But this week is the most 
concentrated effort by his political team to highlight the 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillespie said the schedule suggests that Gore does not intend  
to distance himself much from Clinton during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the president's approval rating so high, stealing his  
strategy may not work.

	``Maybe people are a little tired of the Clinton-Gore approach  
and might be looking for something a little fresher,'' Gillespie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Copying Clinton appears to be his gambit,'' he said. ``We'll  
see if it works.'

<HEADLINE> Iverson Has Some Scores To Settle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson shares at least one trait with  
Michael Jordan. The kid has a fabulous memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan always kept score on the court, remembering the player  
who beat him off the dribble 10 years ago or the coach who refused 
to double-team him. Now that Iverson is leading the NBA in scoring 
and carrying the Philadelphia 76ers to their best start in nearly a 
decade, he remembers all those who disrespected him. 
</P>
<P>
	He knows Charles Barkley and Karl Malone are talking about him  
when they use the word ``knucklehead.'' Hecklers call him punk, 
jailbird, ball hog and Barkley's pet name for him -- Allen ``Me, 
Myself and Iverson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cheap shots won't be forgotten. Turns out Iverson wasn't  
just indulging himself with between-the-legs, behind-the-back 
showmanship and 40-point scoring outbursts in his first two years 
in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Turns out he's been keeping score.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I win that scoring title, do you know how many people are  
going to be mad that I did that?'' Iverson said. ``People don't 
want that for me. And the way I look at it, even if I go with a 
clean slate, don't get in any trouble, win the scoring title and we 
have a great season and go to the playoffs and make noise, they'll 
still be hesitant to market Allen Iverson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson, it seems, has turned his journey from behind bars to  
No. 1 draft pick to fascinating, yet polarizing basketball star 
into a personal grudge match. He remembers everyone who ever talked 
down to him, tried to hold him back or judge him on his past and 
appearance -- the ostentatious jewelry, tattoos, braided corn rows 
and do-rag. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want people to say -- behind closed doors if they have to --  
`That's the best player in the NBA,''' Iverson said. ``That's the 
type of effect that I want to have on this league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first month of the NBA season belonged to the 23-year-old  
Iverson, who was finally recognized for something positive when he 
was named player of the month. For the first time since college, 
Iverson knows what it's like to be the dominant player on a winning 
team instead of a sideshow. 
</P>
<P>
	``That meant a lot,'' said Iverson, who was averaging 28.8  
points a game going into the weekend. ``It really felt like I was 
turning the corner, for myself, looking at it through my own eyes. 
I'm like, `Man, you know, they recognized me for something GOOD.' 
And it felt good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's come a long way since being booed at All-Star weekend in  
Cleveland his rookie year for comments he believes to this day were 
taken out of context. Asked earlier that season if he respected 
Jordan, Iverson says he replied, ``I'm not going to respect anybody 
on the basketball court.'' When Iverson saw the quote in print and 
heard it on the air, the last four words had been dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson was the MVP of the rookie game, only to be heckled with  
the NBA's 50 greatest players of all time sitting courtside -- Wilt 
Chamberlain, Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson was distraught. But not many people know what happened  
after he left the court and picked up his trophy. He handed it to a 
team official who dropped it, making a huge chip in the base. 
</P>
<P>
	``Get it fixed,'' Iverson pleaded. ``You have no idea how much  
this means to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson is clearly a different player now. Is he a different  
person? 
</P>
<P>
	His family says his personal life is more settled than ever. His  
coach, Larry Brown, says he understands the game better and has 
better players around him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Allen always wants to do the right thing,'' said  
Brown, who has smoothed over early differences with Iverson. ``He 
listens to everybody. He's just growing up, becoming more 
responsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown moved Iverson from point guard to off-guard this year, and  
he's thriving in the role. His tendency to showboat has faded, 
replaced by a keener notion for getting open and passing. The 
result is the Sixers' best start since the 1990-91 season and an 
early push for their second playoff appearance this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Iverson learned that he can't do it all by himself,''  
Chicago's Ron Harper said. ``I think that he sees the fun part is 
if your team does good, you do good, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most intriguing aspects of Iverson is that he refuses  
to forget the past while asking others to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	To him, the past is a very real part of the man he has become.  
To others, it is still blotted with unseemly mistakes -- the four 
months he spent in jail over a bowling-alley brawl he says did not 
involve him; an arrest on drug charges just after his rookie 
season; and countless betrayals and missteps by childhood friends 
he says he will never renounce. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want the bad-boy image in the league. I don't want to  
be that person, because I'm not,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, it's just a whole media thing,'' he said. ``It's,  
`OK, we're going to make him the bad boy of the NBA because he made 
mistakes in his life.' And people are driving it, and driving it 
and driving it into the ground. It's starting to get old now. Soon, 
they're not going to be able to keep writing about negative things, 
especially if I'm not doing anything negative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, Iverson found himself in the middle of controversy  
again. As is often the case, his only mistake was trusting someone 
too much. 
</P>
<P>
	Two friends were arrested in Norfolk, Va., after driving away  
from an alleged drug deal in one of Iverson's Mercedes. One of them 
was Andre Steele, whom Iverson has called a surrogate father. His 
real father, Allen Broughton, pleaded guilty to stabbing his 
ex-girlfriend last year and was sentenced to nine years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson has said that another father figure, Tony Clark, was  
killed by Clark's girlfriend. It is little wonder why Iverson is so 
eager for recognition and respect. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson's mom attends nearly every game at the First Union  
Center, often toting a sign proclaiming some variation of, ``That's 
my son, No. 3!'' His aunt Jessie watched Iverson score 24 points 
with the flu Wednesday night in a 102-86 victory over Jordan's 
former team, the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson, who has two children with his longtime girlfriend, no  
longer allows friends to live at his home and now invites only 
relatives to stay with him. His aunt called the change a sign of 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
	``That first year it was his friends around, but now the family  
is here in Philadelphia and that is important to Allen,'' she said. 
``We pray together; we celebrate the holidays together. I'm blessed 
to be a part of his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How far can Iverson and the Sixers go? As far as he can carry  
them, now that he is playing basketball instead of highlight-ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson knows it, and he is starting to thrive.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not playing as good as I'm going to play when this season  
keeps on rolling on,'' he said. ``When we get into 25 or 30 games, 
then that's when I'll be playing at the level I want to play at. 
I'm pretty sure of that.''

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Jim Abbott is anxious for his next plate appearance.  
</P>
<P>
	Abbott, who pitched into the third inning, flied out to center  
field in the second on Friday in his first at-bat of the spring as 
a Milwaukee Brewers split squad beat the San Francisco Giants 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to try to go up there with a little more aggressive  
intention from now on,'' said Abbott, who was born without a right 
hand and played exclusively in the AL before this year and rarely 
batted. ``In the American League, it was just kind of fun to go up 
there. Now, I have to change my attitude a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just making contact isn't good enough. I have to try to do  
something up there. I certainly don't expect to set the world on 
fire, but I'm going to be more aggressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott, who quit baseball in 1997, but returned late last season  
and went 5-0 with a 4.55 ERA for the Chicago White Sox, is pegged 
as Milwaukee's No. 4 starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Giants, he allowed two hits and walked one before  
reaching his pitch limit in the top of the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee scored all its runs in the first inning against Mark  
Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernando Vina led off with a double, Jeff Cirillo walked, Jeromy  
Burnitz blooped an RBI double and Marquis Grissom hit a two-run 
double. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner allowed three hits and a walk in two innings.  
</P>
<P>
	Eric Plunk, David Weathers, Jeff Granger and Rod Henderson  
combined for five-hit relief for Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	-- After bursting on the scene with a 20-strikeout game and  
winning the NL Rookie of the Year award, Chicago Cubs pitcher Kerry 
Wood was rewarded with a $690,000, one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is by far the largest for a player with less than one  
year of major league service. Wood, who has 169 days in the major 
leagues and made the minimum $170,000 last year, will not be 
eligible for salary arbitration until after the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old right-hander was 13-6 with a 3.40 ERA and 233  
strikeouts in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	-- At Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Baltimore Orioles second baseman  
Delino DeShields found out he won't need surgery to repair a 
fractured bone in his left thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	DeShields, injured during an intrasquad game Thursday, will wear  
the cast for about seven days before replacing it with a splint, 
but it will be 3-4 weeks before he can begin baseball-related 
activities and another 2-3 weeks before he can return to the 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	On the field:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Florida Marlins pitcher Alex Fernandez threw two scoreless  
innings and 29 pitches in an 8-1 win over Tampa Bay at Melbourne, 
Fla., his first outing since surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff. 
The game was his first since the NL championship series in October 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Awesome,'' he said. ``I felt really good. I was able to locate  
my pitches, and it was good to be out there with different uniforms 
facing you. It's a step in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- At Kissimmee, Fla., Mark Wohlers' first appearance of 1999 was  
much like his outings in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves reliever faced eight batters in the third  
inning of a 7-4 loss to Houston, allowing four earned runs, three 
hits and two walks. 
</P>
<P>
	He fanned his first batter, Ken Caminiti, on a changeup and  
ended the inning by striking out Carl Everett with a low fastball. 
Craig Biggio and Ricky Gutierrez hit two-run singles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results weren't there, but I'm not going to worry about  
the results,'' Wohlers said. ``I think how I felt on the mound, the 
way I handled myself, and the pitches that I made, I feel good 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other games: 	
</P>
<P>
                       *Dodgers 5, Cardinals 4 	
</P>
<P>
	At Vero Beach, Fla., while Davey Johnson won his debut as the  
Los Angeles manager, fans were disappointed Mark McGwire didn't 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers opened their 52nd -- and possibly last -- exhibition  
season at Dodgertown with Johnson's favorite offensive weapon, a 
three-run homer, this one by Paul LoDuca. Rupert Murdoch's Fox 
Group is considering moving the team's spring site to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disappointed McGwire didn't at least make an  
appearance for the fans,'' said long-time Cardinals backer Charles 
Swisher, 72, who came from Pennsylvania to see the game. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Blue Jays 8, Yankees 6    	
</P>
<P>
	At Dunedin, Fla., Hideki Irabu has a shaky spring debut for New  
York. While he allowed just two hits in three shutout innings, he 
struggled with his control, throwing just 26 of 48 pitches for 
strikes and falling behind 10 of 12 batters. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Royals 9, Indians (ss) 3    	
</P>
<P>
	At Winter Haven, Fla., Cleveland's new infield combination of  
Omar Vizquel and Roberto Alomar executed its first double play. 
Jermaine Dye doubled and homered for Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
                      *Phillies 7, Indians (ss) 6    	
</P>
<P>
	At Clearwater, Fla., rookie Marlon Anderson had three hits and  
two stolen bases. Bobby Abreu added two doubles and drove in three 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Twins 6, Reds (ss) 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Fort Myers, Fla., Terry Steinbach hit his first  
exhibition-season homer in two years, a two-run shot. Eddie 
Williams, a non-roster invitee trying to make the seventh major 
league team of his 17-year career, also homered. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Reds (ss) 5, Rangers 4    	
</P>
<P>
	At Sarasota, Fla, Mark Lewis singled home the winning run with  
the bases loaded in the 10th. Lewis also had an RBI single during a 
three-run fourth as the Reds overcame a 4-0 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Tigers 8, Pirates 6    	
</P>
<P>
	At Bradenton, Fla., Karim Garcia hit a go-ahead homer in the  
eighth inning, and Ben Candelaria also homered. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Athletics 17, Angels 4    	
</P>
<P>
	At Tempe, Ariz., Mo Vaughn went 2-for-3 with a run scored and  
two RBIs in his spring debut for Anaheim. After Vaughn's two-run 
single in the second inning put Anaheim up 4-1, Angels 
knuckleballer Steve Sparks was unable to hold the lead. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Mariners 8, Cubs 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Mesa, Matt Mieske hit a two-run homer and run-scoring double  
against his former teammates. 
</P>
<P>
                   *Diamondbacks (ss) 10, White Sox 6    	
</P>
<P>
	At Tucson, Ariz., David Dellucci was 2-for-3 with a triple,  
stole a base and threw a runner out at the plate from left field. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Padres 4, Brewers (ss) 3    	
</P>
<P>
	At Peoria, Ariz., Gary Matthews Jr. hit a two-run homer,  
connecting off Reggie Harris in the eighth to tie the score at 3. 
Mark Parent hit a bases-loaded single over a drawn-in outfield 
against Brian Passini in the 11th to win it. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Red Sox 4, Boston Coll. 3    	
</P>
<P>
	At Fort Myers, Fla., Creighton Gubanich hit a three-run double  
in the fifth inning. The Eagles used aluminum bats while Boston 
used wood. 
</P>
<P>
                           *Mets 8, Expos 4    	
</P>
<P>
	At Jupiter, Fla., Jack Nicklaus opened Montreal's exhibition  
season by tossing out the first pitch, and then the Mets defeated 
Montreal with eight runs in the final two innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, recovering from hip replacement surgery, entered the  
stadium in a golf cart and walked to the mound aided by a cane. His 
low strike was handled easily by Expos catcher Chris Widger. 
</P>
<P>
	Doubles by Roger Cedeno and Mo Bruce highlighted a four-run  
eighth that tied the score, and New York scored four more runs in 
the ninth, highlighted by Yohanny Valera's two-run double.

<HEADLINE> Church Vote for Gay Elder Is Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A Stamford church's election of a gay  
elder to serve on the church's governing board has been upheld by 
an ecclesiastical court of the Presbyterian Church U.S.A., a lawyer 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came from William Prey, who helped argue the  
case on behalf of two members of the congregation of the First 
Presbyterian Church who said the election violated church law 
prohibiting practicing homosexuals from serving on church boards. 
</P>
<P>
	Prey said the Southern New England Presbytery notified the  
principals of the decision on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Sassi, spokesman for the First Presbyterian Church, said  
church officials would have no comment until a news conference 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prey issued a statement in which he said the complainants were  
disappointed that the Presbytery's Permanent Judicial Commission 
had ruled against them and that they would consider appealing the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Elder Wayne Osborne, the person at the center of the  
controversy, said he would reserve comment until Sunday's news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue arose last spring after the congregation at First  
Presbyterian elected Osborne, 38, to serve on the governing board, 
known as a session. He had previously served on the session but in 
the interim had begun to live openly as a homosexual.

<HEADLINE> Applications Rise at Colleges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The growing use of the Internet combined with a  
surge in high school graduates helped boost the number of college 
applications submitted last year, said several school officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Although most colleges don't accept applications via the  
Internet, it's becoming far more common for them to post blank 
applications on the Web, allowing would-be students to download 
forms and mail them in later. 
</P>
<P>
	For those schools that do accept applications over the Internet,  
some even waive the fees -- typically $35 to $60. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the candidate's point of view, it is a much easier  
ballgame and the Internet has facilitated that,'' said Marlyn 
McGrath Lewis, director of admissions for Harvard University, which 
saw the number of applicants rise almost 8 percent this year over 
last. 
</P>
<P>
	Applications to Yale University rose 10.5 percent; University of  
California-Riverside applications were up 14.6 percent; Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., was up 13 percent; and Temple 
University in Philadelphia was up a whopping 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Maxey, Temple's vice president for enrollment management,  
said many of the applicants took advantage of the school's 
electronic forms. The Web, he said, ``is certainly giving us and 
our colleagues a lot more exposure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It used to be prospective applicants learned about colleges by  
sending away for brochures or poring over hefty guidebooks. Now, 
most universities have Web pages that contain everything from 
course descriptions to virtual walking tours of campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Even without the Internet, schools would probably be reporting a  
jump in applicants. The number of high school seniors has been 
increasing about 3 percent annually in recent years. Experts 
predict there will be close to 3 million high school graduates next 
year, up from 2.6 million in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the number of applications is outstripping the increase  
in students. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Paxton, president of the electronic service CollegeLink,  
runs a business that lets students fill in their applications on 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time when federal financial aid for college is dwindling,  
he says some students are applying to more schools to see where 
they can get the best financial package, and electronic access 
makes that easier. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all of the 1,000 participating CollegeLink schools are  
reporting an increase in applications of 3 percent to 5 percent 
this year, Paxton said, and the percentages are higher at the more 
selective institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is a downside to the Internet application boom.  
</P>
<P>
	College officials are finding it harder to gauge the seriousness  
of applicants, said Joyce Smith, executive director of the National 
Association for College Admissions Counseling in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is talking about how great the applicant pool was,''  
Smith said. ``I truly sit and just wonder if the students are just 
applying to more schools.''

<HEADLINE> Smoke Forces 2 Jets To Land Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Smoke in the cabin forced a Boeing 757  
with at least 150 people on board to make an emergency landing 
Saturday at Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Cleveland, a Continental Express plane returned after  
takeoff when smoke appeared in the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing was traveling from Atlanta to Washington, D.C., when  
the pilot reported oil-pressure problems and landed in South 
Carolina shortly after 11 a.m., Airport Operations Supervisor Fred 
Bright said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured and the plane was grounded for repairs.  
</P>
<P>
	WSPA-TV reported the plane was a Delta Air Lines flight. Calls  
to Delta's headquarters in Atlanta were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Continental Express was headed to Minneapolis on Saturday  
with 40 passengers when it landed at about 6:30 p.m. at Cleveland 
Hopkins International Airport. The plane taxied to a gate without 
evacuations. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the smoke was de-icing fluid getting in the air  
conditioning system, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Controversy at Pole Vault Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAEBASHI, Japan (AP) -- It's a rule American pole vaulter Jeff  
Hartwig has always believed should be stricken from the books. Now 
he has even better reason to oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
	The pole vault competition at the World Indoor Track and Field  
Championships was held up for 10 minutes today while officials 
tried to decide whether French vaulter Jean Galfione touched the 
bar with his hands on what turned out to be the winning jump of 
6.00 meters (19 feet, 8 1/4 inches). 
</P>
<P>
	The jump was at first disallowed by technical delegate Cecil  
Smith of Canada. But that decision was overruled and Galfione, the 
1996 Olympic champion, was declared the winner. He is only the 
fourth person ever to clear 6.00 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the rule, a vault is only a foul if the athlete  
deliberately replaces a bar about to fall from the supports with 
his hands or fingers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig finished with 19-6 1/4, an American record.  
</P>
<P>
	``I tried not to touch the bar, but I probably did. I didn't put  
it back,'' Galfione said. ``But it's finished. This law is stupid. 
I feel sorry for Jeff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Had Hartwig won, it would have been the first major pole vault  
title for the United States in 31 years. He said he was happy with 
the American record, but felt the controversy stopped him from 
going higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'm disappointed about is that they held the competition  
up for 10 minutes while they discussed it,'' he said. ``That killed 
everything. Ignorance on the part of the officials killed it for 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team appealed the ruling, but the appeal failed.  
</P>
<P>
	Craig Masbach, chief executive of U.S. Track and Field, said the  
ruling was a ``mockery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They admit he touched it, but they didn't feel he replaced it.  
They've made a mockery of the rule,'' he said. ``Either get rid of 
the rule and I'll accept the decision, or enforce the rule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's competition held few other surprises -- but some very  
good performances. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them was by Frankie Fredericks of Namibia, winner of four  
Olympic silver medals, who finally came up gold. 
</P>
<P>
	He won the 200 in meet-record time 20.10 seconds, the  
second-fastest time in history. Obadele Thompson of Barbados became 
the No. 3 career performer, finishing second at 20.26. Kevin Little 
of the United States won his third bronze in the event, placing 
third at 20.42. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to add as many titles to my name as I can,''  
Fredericks said. ``And it's not a silver this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romania's Gabriela Szabo, the 1997 women's 3,000 champion, won  
the 1,500 in 4:03.23, a meet record and the fastest time in the 
world this year. She is going for a distance double in the 3,000 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to think about the 3,000 yet,'' she said. ``I'm  
just so happy to have won today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haile Gebrselassie, who is already halfway to an unprecedented  
double in the men's distance events, advanced to Sunday's 
1,500-meter final by winning his semifinal heat in 3:41.21 -- the 
fastest of the two heats. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebrselassie won his second straight 3,000-meter title Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Ionela Tirlea of Romania won the women's 200 in 22.39, the best  
in the world this year; Tatyana Kotova of Russia took the women's 
long jump at 22-6, and Vita Pavlysh of Ukraine successfully 
defended her title in the women's shot put at 70-3 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Mozambique's Maria Mutola, seeking to become the first woman to  
win four track gold medals at the championships, cruised into the 
women's 800-meter final with an easy victory at 2:02.18. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutola is the 1993, 1995 and 1997. Only Bulgarian high jumper  
Stefka Kostadinova, with five titles, has won more world indoor 
titles than Mutola. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutola is unbeaten this season in six races, including a world  
record at 1,000 meters, and is the prohibitive favorite in Sunday's 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	American Jearl Miles-Clark, the defending champion in the  
women's 400, had the world's fastest time, 50.83, in winning her 
semifinal heat and leading the way into Sunday's final. 
</P>
<P>
	Her performance came shortly after Germany's Grit Breuer, the  
European indoor and outdoor champion, won the other heat in 50.88, 
also under the previous 1999 world best of 50.91. 
</P>
<P>
	Denmark's Wilson Kipketer, who seemed invincible at the 1997  
championships, breaking the world 800-meter record twice, finished 
second to South Africa's Johan Botha in a semifinal heat, 1:46.65 
to 1:46.76. Germany's Nico Motchebon (1:47.05) and Hungary's Balazs 
Koranyi (1:48.74) won the other heats.

<HEADLINE> Wis. Postmaster Fired for Mailings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOUSMAN, Wis. (AP) -- The U.S. Postal Service fired a Wisconsin  
postmaster for allegedly mailing fliers for a charity she founded 
without paying about $10,000 in postage. 
</P>
<P>
	Betty Igl was fired Friday after investigators concluded she  
sent unpaid mailings twice a year for about a decade, Postal 
Service spokeswoman Debra Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 64-year-old Igl had worked for the Postal Service for 30  
years, and was postmaster in Dousman for 13 years. Postal 
authorities were expected to request that federal criminal charges 
be filed, Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dousman residents have rallied around Igl, even pledging in a  
petition signed by 398 residents to raise the $10,000 she is said 
to owe. Yellow ribbons tied into bows have been attached to utility 
poles up and down Main Street. Beneath each bow is a poster that 
reads: ``We Want Betty Back Now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She has been on administrative leave since early last month  
while investigators probed the mailings for the Adopt a Grandparent 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Igl, who has 10 days to appeal the firing, declined to comment  
Friday.

<HEADLINE> IUP Moves To Change Indian Mascot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. (AP) -- The trustees at Indiana University of  
Pennsylvania have voted to change the school's mascot from an 
Indian to a bear, although the team's nickname will remain the 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanimous vote on Friday at the school's satellite campus in  
Punxsutawney, 64 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, follows the 
recommendation made by a school panel on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	University president Lawrence Pettit recommended changing the  
mascot to improve the school's image and allow it to use the new 
mascot as a marketing tool. The university stopped using the Indian 
mascot and Indian-head logo in 1991, instead using the campus bell 
tower or the letter ``I'' as a symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been without a mascot for nine years, and we were  
feeling a little lost,'' university spokeswoman Michelle Fryling 
said. ``We want to maintain the respect and recognition of the 
Native American culture, and we know that the bear will not be used 
in a demeaning way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pettit said the nickname ``Indians'' should stay because many  
rivers and counties carry Indian names. The panel recommended that 
a bear be used as a mascot because it is native to the region and 
revered by many tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the committee and Pettit consulted Indian advocacy groups  
about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the name `Indians' that people find objectionable,''  
Fryling said. ``It's when you try to have a stereotypical Indian in 
headdress and war paint that it is objectionable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the leader of one national Indian advocacy group found the  
compromise ``silly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a small step in the right direction, but it's a foolish  
compromise,'' said Suzan Shown Harjo, president of The Morning Star 
Institute in Washington. ``It would be like a school team name 
called the Whites or the Blacks, and the mascot is a monkey. I 
mean, what is the thinking here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Harjo filed a lawsuit seeking to force the NFL's  
Washington Redskins to change their nickname. A decision is still 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people lose their sense of subtlety and discernment  
when it comes to native people,'' she said. ``I don't know how many 
times we can say this, that we're people, not mascots, and we're 
human beings, and we do not want to be used for America's 
recreation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fryling said the university has not yet chosen a design for its  
new mascot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have the bear yet,'' she said. ``We don't know what  
we're going to do, but we know we can have a lot of fun with it, 
and we know that we can maintain the respect for the bear as a 
Native American symbol.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Eyes Reform Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee is backing off  
a plan to strip rank-and-file members of voting for Olympic cities. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC leaders told The Associated Press on Friday that a reform  
commission will be proposed at the special general assembly March 
17-18 in Lausanne, Switzerland. The panel will consider ways of 
changing the structure and operations of the IOC, setting the stage 
for what could be the biggest changes in the body's 105 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea is to have a fresh look at the way the IOC  
functions,'' executive board member Jacques Rogge said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge also confirmed the executive board was changing plans for  
the selection of the 2006 Winter Games site, which had been 
criticized by a large percentage of members. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, the board wanted a small group to pick the winner.  
But after fierce opposition from the membership, the board now 
would propose that the general assembly select the winner under 
tight controls after the smaller group pared the six-city field to 
two finalists, Rogge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has been under tremendous pressure, from within and  
without, to enact reforms in the wake of the Salt Lake City 
corruption scandal -- the biggest crisis in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the internal investigation into the final group of 19  
members implicated in the scandal won't be concluded until sometime 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings had been expected to be announced by the end of  
this week, but Rogge -- a member of the six-man hoc inquiry 
commission -- said the panel's report was still being finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a long report, a very substantial report with a lot of  
information,'' he said in a telephone interview from Belgium. ``I 
personally don't expect any news before the beginning or middle of 
next week. The end of next week is also possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel can recommend expulsions, exonerations or warnings.  
</P>
<P>
	So far, nine members have resigned or been ousted following  
allegations they received cash payments or other improper 
inducements during Salt Lake's successful bid for the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The expulsions will go to the full IOC session, where a  
two-thirds vote is required for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	The watershed meeting also will appoint an ethics committee to  
police a new code-of-conduct for IOC members, and Rogge said 
outside members would be represented on both the ethics committee 
and the reform panel. 
</P>
<P>
	While specific reform proposals aren't expected to be discussed  
at the March assembly, officials said the IOC is already studying 
fundamental structural changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Possible reforms include altering the way IOC members are  
selected. Traditionally, members are hand picked by the IOC 
president and appointed to virtual life terms. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. ethics panel, headed by former Senate Majority Leader  
George Mitchell, recommended this week that IOC members be elected 
by national Olympic committees and other sports bodies and 
subjected to term limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mitchell panel also recommended the IOC open its books to  
outside audits and release the financial figures to the public at 
least once a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever changes the reform commission recommends, the final  
decisions will be up to the full IOC, Rogge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Reedie, an IOC member from Britain, said fundamental  
reforms were paramount in the wake of the scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having been caught with your pants down, changes seem  
inevitable,'' he said. ``The more secret, elitist and private you 
make the organization, the more suspicion you create in people's 
minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and his executive board  
proposed in January new bidding and selection procedures for the 
2006 games, including a ban on member visits to the six European 
candidate cities. 
</P>
<P>
	But members rebelled against the proposal to have a 15-member  
body select the host city. Many members, whose primary duty is 
choosing host cities, protested that the entire assembly was being 
branded corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said he and the majority of the executive board now  
support a new proposal. While the ban on visits would remain in 
place, the 15-member panel would choose two finalists and let the 
entire membership select the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the process should take place behind closed doors on  
the same day and in the same building, with bid city officials 
barred from contact with the selectors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be like the selection of a pope: you lock up all the  
cardinals, no one comes in or out, and you wait for the white smoke 
to come out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the possibility of corruption is reduced by having  
more, rather than fewer, people involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you only have a small number deciding, there is far more  
possibility that the candidate cities could try and influence them 
very heavily,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge also said a small electoral panel lacks the universality  
and geographical representation of the general assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2006 site is scheduled to be chosen at the IOC session in  
Seoul, South Korea, in June. The candidates are Helsinki, Finland; 
Klagenfurt, Austria; Sion, Switzerland; Turin, Italy; Poprad-Tatry, 
Slovakia; and Zakopane, Poland.

<HEADLINE> Ski Resort Residents Angry at U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAVALESE, Italy (AP) -- The people of this Alpine hamlet expected  
more from the United States than the shiny new gondola that 
ominously detours around the spot where 20 people plunged to their 
deaths last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of all, they wanted the truth about why a Marine pilot flew  
so low and so fast through their valley. But now that Capt. Richard 
Ashby has been acquitted, they feel angry and betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest offense is that the United States is telling us  
that no one is to blame for the deaths of 20 people,'' said Anna 
Vanzo, the 19-year-old daughter of the gondola operator who died. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't care whether Ashby got 200 years in prison or two,  
but I wanted to hear the truth,'' Vanzo said. ``Someone killed 
those people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gondola had just begun its ascent when Ashby's EA-6B Prowler  
swooped into the valley on a training flight on Feb. 3, 1998, and 
severed the cable with its wing. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone from Cavalese's baker to its newspaper vendor expressed  
outrage at Thursday's verdict in a U.S. military court. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the regional council, Lorenzo Dellai, called it  
a ``punch in the stomach.'' The town council said it would look for 
a way to appeal the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've killed them a second time,'' blared Saturday's headline  
in the local paper. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Vanzo, two other Italians died, along with a  
Polish mother and son, seven German friends, five Belgians, two 
Austrians and a Dutch student. 
</P>
<P>
	A military jury at Camp Lejeune, N.C., acquitted Ashby of 20  
counts of involuntary manslaughter. He still faces an obstruction 
of justice charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors alleged that Ashby, 31, was flying too fast and too  
low. The cable was severed less than 400 feet from the ground. The 
defense blamed faulty equipment and a map that didn't show the ski 
lift. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the United States, but they really shouldn't have  
behaved this way,'' said Gian Battista Costa, 71, with his wife 
Nanda, 68, as they rode up the new gondola. 
</P>
<P>
	Ilda Gilmozzi, 63, whose family runs a pastry shop, said the  
whole town feared the jets that regularly blasted through the 
valley. But their complaints went unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you imagine what would have happened if a jet fell on the  
town?'' she asked. ``They need to change the NATO treaty so we can 
carry out our own justice when something like this happens on our 
territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the NATO treaty, Ashby was tried in his home country.  
</P>
<P>
	The United States has said it will pay the lion's share of  
claims from the accident. But they have to go through the Italian 
courts, which often takes years to issue rulings, because of a NATO 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The new gondola was built with funds from the regional  
government and a consortium of banks and businesses. A memorial now 
marks where the cable car fell, and the new gondola was rerouted 
out of respect for the dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least I'm back at work,'' said a middle-aged gondola  
operator who refused to give his name. ``But the memory is too 
painful to talk about.''

<HEADLINE> Thorn Apple Files for Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTHFIELD, Mich. (AP) -- The meat producer Thorn Apple Valley  
Inc. has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after losing 
millions of dollars in a huge meat recall and the Russian economic 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Company President Joel Dorfman said an investment banking firm  
was looking for new investors, or possibly a buyer, for the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm reported a $12 million loss for its second fiscal  
quarter, ending in December. And it may lose $5 million to $6 
million more this quarter from the recall of 30 million pounds of 
meat from its Forest City, Ark., plant, where meat samples tested 
positive for harmful bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southfield-based meat producer will continue to operate its  
plants in Michigan, North Carolina, Arkansas and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorfman said Thorn Apple Valley was recovering from the loss of  
sales from Russia when the meat recall hit Jan. 22. When the 
Russian currency collapsed, Thorn Apple Valley was left without a 
customer for 1.5 million hot dogs.

<HEADLINE> Working Helps Wilson, Hanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When Rita Wilson started reading the script  
for a TV movie, ``Invisible Child,'' she feared it would be another 
``nanny-from-hell story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out to be very different. In the Lifetime channel  
movie showing Monday, March 8 at 9 p.m., Tushka Bergen portrays a 
perfectly kind and efficient caretaker of children. It's the family 
that seems a little nuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Wilson and Victor Garber play parents who claim to have  
three children: Doc, Maggie and Sam. But Maggie is imaginary. 
</P>
<P>
	The psycho-drama explores why the mother maintains the fantasy,  
and why her family supports her in it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I liked the theme of the movie, which is that life is full of  
mysteries, and you never know why people do things,'' Miss Wilson 
says. ``It doesn't change how you feel about them, because you love 
them. I liked the fact that the story wasn't pat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The actress has enjoyed a busy couple of years. She has worked  
in feature movies: the upcoming ``Runaway Bride'' with Richard Gere 
and Julia Roberts, directed by Garry Marshall, and ``The Story of 
Us,'' with Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer, directed by Rob 
Reiner. She also appeared in the ``Psycho'' redo, in the secretary 
role originally played by Patricia Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids are a little bigger, which makes it easier to work,''  
commented Miss Wilson, the mother of two. Their ages? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get into details like that, just because we try to  
protect their privacy,'' she said firmly. 
</P>
<P>
	Her caution is perhaps natural. Her husband and the father of  
the children is Tom Hanks, who has two best-actor Oscars and is up 
for another for ``Saving Private Ryan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Invisible Child'' originally was to be filmed in Portland,  
Ore. When the script was offered to Miss Wilson, she replied: ``I'd 
love to do this, but Tom and I try not to work at the same time, 
and he's doing a movie.'' The Lifetime people did some rearranging, 
and filming was moved to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	When one is working, the other brings the kids on location for  
extended visits. Miss Wilson and the children joined Hanks during 
the long spells on location for ``Saving Private Ryan.'' And the 
family remained together when she worked in New York on ``Mixed 
Nuts'' with Steve Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	They know first-hand the perils wrought by separation on  
location. They met in 1985 when they co-starred in ``Volunteers,'' 
one of Hanks' more forgettable endeavors. They married after his 
1987 divorce from Samantha Lewes. As part of their togetherness 
policy, they have appeared in ``Bonfire of the Vanities,'' 
``Sleepless in Seattle,'' ``That Thing You Do'' (which Hanks wrote 
and directed), and in his 12-part HBO series, ``From the Earth to 
the Moon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Staying together ``is a problem only if it's not discussed, only  
if people pretend it's not going to create a problem,'' she said. 
``You have to be honest and work it out, you have to schedule 
things, and sometimes you'll have to give up some things. It's not 
that hard -- if you're honest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Is Hanks' all-round-decent-guy image for real? Does he ever get  
cranky in the morning or snap at the kids? 
</P>
<P>
	His wife contemplated the questions for a moment, then replied,  
laughing: ``Well, let's just say he's human.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Wilson grew up in Hollywood. On her first day at Hollywood  
High, she was photographed for Harper's Bazaar, which was doing a 
feature on high schoolers. That got her an agent. Then she 
accompanied a cheerleader friend to an audition for ``The Brady 
Bunch'' and she was chosen for a role, which got her into the 
Screen Actors Guild. 
</P>
<P>
	Her first substantial acting role was in ``Happy Days,'' the  
1970s TV sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
	In an otherwise slow start to her career, Miss Wilson appeared  
in a flock of TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great job,'' she recalls. ``It always made me laugh  
when actors said, `I won't do commercials.' I just never understood 
that. First of all, people don't really recognize you. I wouldn't 
do tacky things, products I didn't believe in. 
</P>
<P>
	``You name it, I've done it. I did a gazillion Burger King,  
McDonald's, car commercials, coffee commercials. They paid the 
rent.''

<HEADLINE> Marlins' Manager Has Uphill Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) -- Step inside the office of the Florida  
Marlins' manager and notice change in the air. It's no longer 
filled with expletives or the smell of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	Chain-smoking, chain-cursing Jim Leyland has departed for the  
Colorado Rockies, taking along his bad habits and leaving behind a 
bad team. That's where John Boles comes in. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 Marlins will probably be bad again, but better. And  
while last year's 108 losses wore on Leyland to the point where he 
could take no more, new manager Boles is braced for the 
tribulations of rebuilding baseball's worst team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I refuse to get frustrated or depressed about anything,''  
Boles said. ``If I'm going to have moments like that, they're going 
to be behind these four walls by myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marlins players and officials consider the 50-year-old manager a  
perfect fit for a young team listed as a million-to-1 shot to win 
the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Boles has a sense of humor -- which he'll need -- and an  
irrepressible optimism. When it comes to proven major league 
talent, Boles sees the Marlins' clubhouse as half-full rather than 
half-empty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody in this business is negative,'' he said. ``Everybody  
talks about what a guy can't do. Why don't we spend more time 
talking about his strengths rather than his weaknesses?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In that spirit, let's downplay the challenge Boles faces in  
replacing a manager who has 996 career victories. Instead, let's 
note that Boles is the only skipper in the Marlins' six-season 
history with a winning career record. 
</P>
<P>
	He went 40-35 for Florida in the second half of 1996 after Rene  
Lachemann was fired. Around the country, Boles is remembered for a 
wide-eyed look in the dugout that became a familiar sight on ESPN 
highlights. He joked that he resembled comedian Marty Feldman, but 
nobody laughed about the way Boles stabilized an underachieving 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very positive experience,'' he said. ``Not to pat  
myself on the back, but I did feel good about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the season, Boles knew the Marlins were on the  
verge of title contention. But when general manager David 
Dombrowski had a chance to hire Leyland, Boles graciously stepped 
aside and returned to his former position as vice president of 
player development. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an unusual situation that John dealt with as well as  
anybody possibly could,'' Dombrowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boles knew the depth of Leyland's credentials, and thought the  
Marlins were fortunate to be able to get him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing anybody ever said to me was that I'm a company  
man,'' Boles said. '' People look at it in a negative way. I think 
it's the best thing you can say about a person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Leyland, the Marlins won the 1997 World Series. Then came  
the dismantling, capped by Leyland's departure after last season. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one manager with a World Series ring was interested in  
the job, but Dombrowski wanted Boles, who signed a three-year 
contract in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Boles has paid his dues. The Chicago native never played  
professional baseball, but he was a minor league manager from 1981 
to 1986 in such outposts as Appleton, Buffalo and Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Kansas City Royals wanted Boles to help with player  
development, he switched to the administrative side in 1986. He 
became the Marlins' director of player development in November 
1991, 18 months before the first game in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	As the former head of the Florida farm system, Boles knows most  
of the players in camp this spring. Youngsters Mark Kotsay, Ryan 
Dempster and Luis Castillo rave about him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm much more relaxed this spring,'' said Castillo, trying to  
win the starting job at second base. ``He knows me, and he's 
followed me a long time. There's a lot less pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boles thought his career path would lead to a job as general  
manager, but instead he finds himself back in the dugout. That's 
where the company needs him, and that's fine with Boles. 
</P>
<P>
	He bought new glasses for his new job, hoping he won't appear so  
wide-eyed this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Marty Feldman look is leaving,'' he said, adjusting the  
glasses. ``With these on, it hides some flaws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's what managing the Marlins will be all about: hiding  
flaws.

<HEADLINE> Soap Star Goes Solo in Singing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Bold and the Beautiful'' star Bobbie  
Eakes used her soap opera exposure to sell millions of records in 
Europe with a co-star. Now she's going solo. 
</P>
<P>
	Eakes, who has played fashion executive Macy Alexander on the  
CBS soap for a decade, went double-platinum in Europe with her 
``Bold and Beautiful Duets I and II,'' sung with fellow soap actor 
Jeff Trachta. 
</P>
<P>
	Her as-yet untitled solo album was produced by songwriter Don  
Cook, who produced 13 No. 1 singles for the country duo Brooks and 
Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like a strong melody and singers that have big range,''  
Eakes said Saturday. ``I used to sit for hours with the lights off 
trying to hit Barbra Streisand's high notes and Karen Carpenter's 
low notes.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Joe Camel's Creator Speaks Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Joe Camel was designed to appeal to young  
adults, not children, the character's creator says. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Beasley, a marketing executive for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco  
Co., said she rejected plans to give the cartoon character a 
punk-style haircut or to show him skating or skateboarding. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio labor union trust funds are suing several major tobacco  
companies in federal court for nearly $2 billion to cover the costs 
of treating workers for smoking-related illnesses. Beasley 
testified Friday; the trial resumes this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Union lawyers contend that Joe Camel was created to attract  
young smokers who were switching to other brands. They said the 
character was more recognizable than Ronald McDonald among 
consumers ages 10 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
	James Morgan, who was president and CEO at Philip Morris until  
he retired in 1997, denied claims that the companies tried to get 
young customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cost of being accused of marketing to minors dwarfs any  
profits you could ever make,'' Morgan said.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Won't Give Expos Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Baseball commissioner Bud Selig  
won't grant an extension to the Montreal Expos, who missed a 
deadline Saturday to complete a new ownership group and obtain 
stadium financing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm done making predictions on things,'' Selig said during an  
exhibition game between the Atlanta Braves and Tampa Bay Devils 
Rays. ``Baseball, especially in my 30 years in the game, has tried 
to keep teams where they are ... But responsibility runs both ways, 
and we need that team to be economically viable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner said there would not be an extension of the  
150-day period the team was given to attract new investors and show 
it has the funds to build a downtown ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig said baseball will begin examining alternatives in a  
``reasonably short period of time,'' but didn't elaborate. A 
baseball official, speaking on the condition he not be identified, 
said Friday that Selig won't act for several weeks or months. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to make progress dealing with your problems,''  
Selig said. ``I don't believe I have either the legal or moral 
authority to consign a team to bankruptcy. If anybody thinks that 
the Expos can make it playing in their facility and stay an 
economically viable franchise, they're just kidding themselves. And 
on that note, my patience is beginning to wear very thin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Expos president Claude Brochu, who has been feuding with team  
chairman Jacques Menard, resumed control of the team when the 
deadline passed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Quebec government has held to its refusal to use tax money  
to build a new downtown ballpark, and Brochu has said the team 
can't survive in Montreal without a new facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern Virginia, Washington and Charlotte, N.C., are possible  
relocation sites should the Expos' current owners decide to sell to 
out-of-town buyers. No move would be possible before the 2000 
season.

<HEADLINE> Starr Evidence May Enter Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A federal judge has barred lawyers for  
Whitewater figure Susan McDougal from presenting evidence of 
``prosecutorial vindictiveness'' during her trial next week on 
criminal contempt and obstruction charges. 
</P>
<P>
	However, U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. on Friday did not  
rule out letting Mrs. McDougal present evidence of ``misconduct'' 
by the government or by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in his 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges against Mrs. McDougal relate to her testimony in the  
Whitewater probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand jurors were investigating whether Mrs. McDougal had  
improper financial dealings with President Clinton and Hillary 
Rodham Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas. McDougal and the 
Clintons were business partners in the failed real estate 
development known as Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal has said she refused to answer questions because  
she believes Starr would twist her words to suit his purposes and 
may charge her with perjury if he doesn't get the testimony he 
wants. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources have said defense lawyers were considering calling  
Monica Lewinsky to testify about her experiences with Starr. Ms. 
Lewinsky has described one of Starr's prosecutors as a ``revolting 
specimen of humanity'' and another as a ``pit-bull terrier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Howard ruled he wouldn't permit evidence of  
``vindictiveness,'' he deferred a decision on whether to permit 
evidence of misconduct, specifically whether Starr wanted Mrs. 
McDougal to lie about the business dealings of the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Mark Geragos of Los Angeles would not say Friday  
whom he would call as witnesses, but he did characterize the ruling 
as a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will attempt to show a pattern by this guy ... Starr and  
his office ... to go through and wreak havoc in people's lives and 
just make them so miserable and threaten them so badly and scare 
them so much that they will say whatever it is he wants them to 
say,'' Geragos said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Independent Counsel Hickman Ewing Jr. said testimony from  
Ms. Lewinsky would be irrelevant to the case and the prosecution 
would fight such an effort. Ewing also considered irrelevant what 
Mrs. McDougal thinks of Starr's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously from our standpoint, we want to keep the jury  
focused on the real issues of the trial,'' Ewing said.

<HEADLINE> Abilene Christian Wins Track Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Delloreen Ennis-London captured her fourth  
NCAA title in the 55-meter hurdles Saturday, helping Abilerne 
Christian to a sweep of the men's and women's titles in the NCAA 
Division II Track and Field Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Ennis-London led from the first hurdle en route to setting an  
NCAA Division II record of 7.62 seconds. The old record of 7.67 was 
set in 1994 by Sherlese Taylor of St. Augustine's. 
</P>
<P>
	Abilene Christian swept the event with Suzanee Dickenson and  
Shawntel Newhouse finishing second and third at 7.86 and 7.95. 
</P>
<P>
	The sweep helped the Wildcats set a meet record with 119 points,  
more than the combined total of the next three teams. Abilene 
Christian's men won the championship for a fourth straight year, 
accumulating 85 points, its sixth title in seven years. St 
Augustine was second with 50 points and Morehouse College took 
third with 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Ennis-London had no time to rest after hurdling, returning to  
the track less than five minutes later to finish second in the 
55-meter dash in 6.95. Humbolt State's Trinity Davis won in 6.94. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad that I broke the record, but there is always room for  
improvement,'' Ennis-London said, adding that the quick turnaround 
may have deprived her of being a double winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is hardly enough time in between. If I had five or 10  
minutes I would have done better.'' she said, adding that during 
the break and before the event she tried to ``stay away from the 
crowd ... pray and listen to Reggae music. It helps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the seventh straight NCAA women's indoor title and 11th  
in 12 years for Abilene Christian. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew we had a really strong team and I thought we'd win, but  
it wasn't expected that we would do this well,'' Abiliene Christian 
coach Wes Kittley said. ``We really dominated up top. You dream 
that it can happen like this and today it did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abilene Christian also swept the triple jump, with Renna Toniste  
winning at 40-9, followed by Hillerie Shelton and Dawnyel Newhouse 
took third. 
</P>
<P>
	St Augustine finished second with 44 points, while Adams State  
earned third with 32. 
</P>
<P>
	Another record was set by Lewis freshman Lana Jekabsone, who  
lowered tbe 800 mark of 2:07.08 set by Stacey Mill of Adams State 
in 1997. Jekabsone won the race in 2:06.00. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas A&AMP;M-Kingsville's Matt Hickl went 18-1. breaking the pole  
vault record of 18-0 1/4 set by Dustin DeRosier of St. Cloud State in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	South Dakota's Nic Burrow won the mile in 4:03.71, breaking the  
mark of 4:04.76 set by Abilene Christian's Musa Gwanzura last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Abilene Christian's winners included Terrance Woods in the men's  
triple jump at 52-1.

<HEADLINE> Hubert Pops Into Winston Cup Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- At the first two Winston Cup races off 1998,  
Tom Hubert was changing tires. In Sunday's Las Vegas 400, he'll be 
starting fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	After Hubert suddenly popped into the upper reaches of the speed  
chart with his surprising qualifying lap Friday at Las Vegas Motor 
Speedway, the biggest question in among the media covering the race 
was: ``Who is this guy?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually during the week I work for the 22 car,'' said Hubert,  
referring to the Pontiac driven by Ward Burton. ``On the weekends, 
I change tires for Steve Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's just kind of a part-time deal until they get some  
things straightened out, but this weekend we're not doing any of 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubert, a 34-year-old Californian now living near Charlotte,  
N.C., says he has driven only a ``handful of races'' since 1987. 
This will be only his fourth Winston Cup start, and his first on an 
oval after three road races. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be interesting to get in a weekly situation and see  
what we could do,'' Hubert said. ``Hopefully, this will help get 
something going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, his Winston Cup plans call for three races with car  
owner Bradford White, including the road race in Sonoma, Calif., 
and an oval event at Michigan Speedway. He's also close to a deal 
to run the entire NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can get more sponsor money for this, we'll run the Cup  
car as many times as we can,'' Hubert said. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a simple plan.  
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing for me is just to run all day and not cause  
any of these guys any problems.'' Hubert said. ``They're in the big 
deal, and we're here to learn. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're capable to run with them, we will. But, hopefully,  
we'll be smart enough to get out of the way when we need to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, he'll go back to work as a crewman when he gets home.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll go back to work for the 22,'' Hubert said. ``Park's deal,  
if they need me, I'll still keep changing tires. They've got 
someone else over there now that's going to do it this weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	MISSING IN ACTION: Among the nine drivers who failed to make the  
43-car field for Sunday's race were series regulars Kyle Petty, Ted 
Musgrave and Dave Marcis. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five drivers qualified on Friday and 11 more made it into  
the lineup by standing on their first-day laps. Rusty Wallace, Dale 
Earnhardt, Jimmy Spencer, Ernie Irvan, Steve Park and rookie 
Stanton Barrett all made it as provisionals, based on last year's 
car owner points. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrell Waltrip got the final spot, the third straight race he  
has had to fall back on the former series champion's provisional. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a first for me,'' said Musgrave, in his first season  
with car owner Butch Mock. ``It's very disgusting. We saved the car 
and came back in the second round and we're fastest in the second 
round. But as slow as the racetrack got today, nobody made it 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	GOOD OPPORTUNITY: Mike Skinner, who heads into the Las Vegas  
race leading the Winston Cup points, likes his chances of getting 
his first series win on the 1 1/2, nearly-flat oval. 
</P>
<P>
	One part of his reasoning is his success at Twin Ring Motegi,  
the oval track in Japan where Skinner has won two straight fall 
exhibition races. 
</P>
<P>
	``Las Vegas has some similarities to the Japan track,'' he said.  
``It's flat, fast, long and smooth. It's a place I think that my 
Chevrolet has a good chance of running good.''

<HEADLINE> Free House Wins Big 'Cap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Free House, often overshadowed by Silver  
Charm, beat the 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner and four 
others Saturday in the $1 million Santa Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	Free House, a 5-year-old colt who went off at 4-1, proved the  
best of one of the finest Big 'Cap fields in years, finishing a 
half-length in front. Event of the Year was second and Silver Charm 
wound up another half-length behind in third. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Chris McCarron, Free House opened a slight lead in the  
turn for home, then held off challenges by Event of the Year and 
Silver Charm down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the ninth of Free House's 21-race career, and  
the son of Smokester is now 3-for-5 in eight career meetings with 
Silver Charm. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was the second straight for Silver Charm, who finished  
a badly beaten third behind winner Puerto Madero in the Jan. 30 
Donn Handicap at Gulfstream. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Madero, the second choice in the Big 'Cap wagering,  
wasn't able to duplicate his Donn victory, finishing fifth at Santa 
Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	Free House carried 123 pounds, one less than high weight Silver  
Charm, and was clocked in 2:00 3-5 for 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner paid $10.20, $5.20 and $2.80. Event of the Year,  
ridden by Corey Nakatani and carrying 119, paid $5.40 and $2.80. 
The show payoff on Silver Charm, with Gary Stevens up, was $2.20.

<HEADLINE> Starr Evidence May Enter Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A federal judge has barred lawyers for  
Whitewater figure Susan McDougal from presenting evidence of 
``prosecutorial vindictiveness'' during her trial next week on 
criminal contempt and obstruction charges. 
</P>
<P>
	However, U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. on Friday did not  
rule out letting Mrs. McDougal present evidence of ``misconduct'' 
by the government or by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in his 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges against Mrs. McDougal relate to her testimony in the  
Whitewater probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand jurors were investigating whether Mrs. McDougal had  
improper financial dealings with President Clinton and Hillary 
Rodham Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas. McDougal and the 
Clintons were business partners in the failed real estate 
development known as Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal has said she refused to answer questions because  
she believes Starr would twist her words to suit his purposes and 
may charge her with perjury if he doesn't get the testimony he 
wants. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources have said defense lawyers were considering calling  
Monica Lewinsky to testify about her experiences with Starr. Ms. 
Lewinsky has described one of Starr's prosecutors as a ``revolting 
specimen of humanity'' and another as a ``pit-bull terrier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Howard ruled he wouldn't permit evidence of  
``vindictiveness,'' he deferred a decision on whether to permit 
evidence of misconduct, specifically whether Starr wanted Mrs. 
McDougal to lie about the business dealings of the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Mark Geragos of Los Angeles would not say Friday  
whom he would call as witnesses, but he did characterize the ruling 
as a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will attempt to show a pattern by this guy ... Starr and  
his office ... to go through and wreak havoc in people's lives and 
just make them so miserable and threaten them so badly and scare 
them so much that they will say whatever it is he wants them to 
say,'' Geragos said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Independent Counsel Hickman Ewing Jr. said testimony from  
Ms. Lewinsky would be irrelevant to the case and the prosecution 
would fight such an effort. Ewing also considered irrelevant what 
Mrs. McDougal thinks of Starr's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously from our standpoint, we want to keep the jury  
focused on the real issues of the trial,'' Ewing said.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Acquire Burt from Hurricanes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers acquired defenseman  
Adam Burt from the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for left wing 
Andrei Kovalenko, team officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Burt, 30, has spent his entire 11-year NHL career with Carolina.  
He has recorded three assists and 46 penalty minutes in 51 games 
for the Hurricanes this season. He has scored 36 goals and 106 
assists in 626 career games. 
</P>
<P>
	Kovalenko, 28, has one assist and two penalty minutes in 13  
games for the Flyers this year since being acquired from Edmonton 
in exchange for Alexandre Daigle on Jan. 29. He has 136 goals and 
155 assists in 450 games during his seven-year career. He also has 
played for Quebec-Colorado and Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not using Kovalenko and we're going to need defensive  
depth through the playoff run,'' Philadelphia president and general 
manager Bob Clarke said in a prepared statement. ``We think that 
Burt is a pretty good player and is going to be a regular on our 
defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia is winless in its last six games (0-5-1) and 2-9-3  
in their last 14 games.

<HEADLINE> Controversy Surrounds Mass. HMOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Prompted by the loud complaints of senior  
citizens, Massachusetts' secretary of state has given health 
maintenance organizations three weeks to convince him they really 
are nonprofits. 
</P>
<P>
	If they fail, the matter could be referred for court action  
barring the companies from doing business. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary William Galvin's demand on Thursday followed the  
decision of several HMOs to stop providing unlimited prescription 
coverage to seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, the state was the only one in the nation to  
require such coverage, but a federal judge in Boston ruled in 
October that HMOs needn't provide it. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurers have implemented limited drug benefits and special  
plans to help lower-income people pay for their drugs, but 
activists say the elderly are still hurting. An estimated 10,000 
will end up paying more for their health-sustaining prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Mula, 72, of Hudson, said he expects to spend $1,700 more  
this year on prescription drugs for his wife Isabelle, who has 
congestive heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel the United States government, the drug industry and the  
medical industry are not taking care of their seniors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The HMOs blame Medicare for failing to adequately reimburse  
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the secretary's frustration is misplaced. He's  
confusing the issues,'' said Karen Ignagni, president of the 
American Association of Health Plans. 
</P>
<P>
	It was far from certain the state attorney general would put  
teeth into Galvin's threat, and Galvin himself admits his power is 
limited. But he says he's acting because thousands of Medicare HMO 
patients are suffering.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Wins World Cup Downhill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KVITFJELL, Norway (AP) -- Andreas Schifferer of Austria won his  
second World Cup downhill in two days Saturday while Lasse Kjus of 
Norway finished second, helping his bid for the overall title. 
</P>
<P>
	Schifferer was timed in 1 minute, 46.78 seconds. Kjus was .18  
second back and helped his chances in a three-way race for the 
overall championship with leader Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway and 
defending champion Hermann Maier of Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier chances dimmed with an 11th place finish after an even  
more disappointing 16th on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt was fifth in Saturday's downhill, but he picked up enough  
points to keep his overall lead with 1,235 to 1,219 for Kjus. Maier 
was third with 1,142. 
</P>
<P>
	A super-G was scheduled for Sunday with the final round of  
season races to begin Wednesday in Sierra Nevada, Spain, where the 
overall title will be decided. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt said he fears his friend and teammate Kjus more than the  
Maier, the ``Herminator''. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kjus is going to be the toughest competitor, and he gained  
many points on me today. It's going to be one of us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, who clinched the World Cup downhill title Friday, called  
the race even. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kjetil is going to be tough, but so is Maier. We're about  
equal,'' Kjus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schifferer has a chance of taking second in the downhill overall  
standings with one more race to go. He vaulted from sixth to third 
place ending up with 398 points. He is 13 points behind teammate 
Werner Franz, who finished eighth Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Rockies' Hamilton Had Track Tryout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Every winter, Colorado Rockies outfielder  
Darryl Hamilton relives his version of the Olympic dream, settling 
into the starting blocks with sprinters Carl Lewis and LeRoy 
Burrell. 
</P>
<P>
	It's often a humbling experience for Hamilton as he receives a  
yearly reminder that stealing bases and patrolling center field is 
a lot different than keeping up with the world's fastest men. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still in awe of those guys,'' Hamilton said. ``I'm sitting  
there thinking after I did it, `Wow! I had Carl Lewis to my left! I 
had LeRoy Burrell to my right!' Not too many people can say that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The workouts are part the offseason training program Hamilton  
started in 1995 when his brother recommended he improve his 
mechanics and flexibility in hopes of avoiding injuries that dogged 
him for two straight seasons with the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton has returned to the Houston to train with the  
prestigious Santa Monica Track Club every winter since, marking one 
of the few constants in his professional life as he goes through 
spring training with his fourth team in five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking for a leadoff hitter to roam center field in expansive  
Coors Field, the Rockies acquired Hamilton in a July 31 trade that 
sent Ellis Burks to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton never saw the trade coming. When it did, his immediate  
reaction was one of revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love those guys to death over there, but I was thinking that  
the best thing I could do is make it so they don't go (to the 
playoffs),'' Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton got his chance as the Giants came to Denver for a  
season-ending three game series with the Rockies. After winning the 
first two games, San Francisco needed one more victory to win the 
NL Wild Card. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were talking about that in the training room the week  
before the actual game,'' Hamilton said. ``I told them, `Man, I've 
got a feeling we're going to lose the first two games. It's going 
to get down to the last day, and we're going to win and we're going 
to break their hearts.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The premonition came true as the Rockies erased a seven-run  
deficit to beat San Francisco, and the Giants lost a one-game 
playoff to the Chicago Cubs the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton tormented his former team with two hits in the season  
finale, completing an impressive two-month run with the Rockies. 
After the trade, he hit .335 with five homers, 25 RBIs and 30 runs 
scored, prompting Colorado to re-sign him after the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone put the emphasis on me being in a situation where I  
was trying out for the Rockies, but basically it was the other way 
around,'' Hamilton said. ``I was feeling things out and trying to 
decide if this is where I want to be. If I felt weird or 
uncomfortable about the situation, I wouldn't have come back. I 
felt good about the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies' feelings are mutual. Burks was ill-suited for  
center field, and his predecessors form a forgettable list that 
includes Alex Cole and Mike Kingery. 
</P>
<P>
	Though some fans bristled when Colorado didn't go after bigger  
free-agent names such as Bernie Williams, Devon White, Brian Jordan 
and Steve Finley, Rockies general manager Bob Gebhard feels the 
best man was also the closest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bringing him back sometimes gets lost in the shuffle,''  
Gebhard said. ``We had him for two months and he's huge. We have a 
tough center field to play. Darryl's a professional center fielder, 
and he's a leadoff guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With their powerful lineup, the Rockies are a leadoff hitters  
dream. If Hamilton can come close to matching last year's .398 
on-base percentage, he has an excellent chance to score 100 runs 
for the first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those runs are sure to come as Hamilton jogs around the  
bases ahead of home runs hit by Larry Walker, Dante Bichette and 
Vinny Castilla. 
</P>
<P>
	He can save the sprinting for the offseason.

	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- When leaders of the world's richest  
nations meet in Germany this summer, R.E.M. hopes to be there 
performing at a protest concert.

<P>
	The so-called G8 summit of leading industrial nations is

	``I can't yet say exactly if we really will appear there or if  
we'll maybe participate in another form,'' Stipe says in Saturday's 
Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper. ``That's still being discussed 
now, who will do what. But we'd like to be there. I was always a 
political person.''

200 pieces of art to the Mint Museum of Charlotte, died Thursday. 
She was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Dalton and her late husband built a multimillion-dollar art and  
rare book collection and gave most of it away to institutions 
around the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Their collection of American and European art was once  
considered the state's finest collection, public or private. A wing 
bearing their names was built before their donation. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Dalton, a successful banker and textile executive, died in  
1990 at age 95. 
</P>
<P>
	Museums and universities around the Southeast bear their  
generosity. There's the Dalton Rare Book room at Duke University, 
where Harry Dalton graduated, and the Dalton Art Gallery at Agnes 
Scott College in Georgia, where Mrs. Dalton attended. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters in 1982 rejected a bond issue to pay for an expansion of  
the Mint Museum, prompting the Daltons to offer much of their 
collection to the museum if a wing could be built to house it. 
Voters passed a bond issue and the museum raised money to fund the

</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Retired Navy Capt. William L. McGonagle, who  
received the Medal of Honor for heroism as skipper of the USS 
Liberty when Israel unleashed a deadly attack on the 
intelligence-gathering ship in 1967, died Wednesday. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-four crewmen were killed and 171 were wounded when the  
Liberty was attacked by Israeli air force planes and torpedo boats 
in international waters north of Sinai during the Six Day War 
between Israel and its Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship was bombed with napalm, torpedoed and shelled.  
</P>
<P>
	The attack, blamed on a mistaken identification of the Liberty  
as an Egyptian ship, remains one of the most controversial events 
in U.S.-Israeli relations and led to allegations of a cover-up by 
the governments. 
</P>
<P>
	McGonagle, who was severely wounded but stayed in command on the  
bridge through the battle and for many hours afterward, broke his 
silence years later and joined former shipmates in demanding the 
two governments release all details of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel apologized to the United States but claimed there had  
been a misidentification and that the ship's markings were 
inadequate. Israel paid more than $12 million in compensation.

 *Sheik Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa,    	
</P>
<P>
	MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- Sheik Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the emir  
of Bahrain, died Saturday of a heart attack shortly after a meeting 
with Defense Secretary William Cohen. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheik Isa, who ruled for 38 years, was buried within hours, with  
thousands of Bahrainis showering the 12-mile funeral route with 
flowers in a traditional display of mourning. 
</P>
<P>
	His son, Sheik Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, assumed the throne.  
Cohen and his entourage left for Saudi Arabia shortly after the 
emir's death. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the second pro-Western Arab leader to die in two months,  
following the death of Jordan's King Hussein in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Bahrain, a nation of 35 islands covering 260 square miles, is  
home to the biggest U.S. naval presence in the region. Sheik Isa 
allowed British and American warplanes to use Bahraini airfields 
during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Afterward, he traveled to 
Washington and signed a security pact with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton offered his condolences to the people of  
Bahrain and said the emir will be missed. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,500 Americans live and work in Bahrain, including about  
1,000 in the military. U.S. warships often dock in Bahrain, home to 
the 5th Fleet, so sailors can take shore leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheik Isa had offered the facilities to the Navy, discreetly at  
first fearing popular resentment against a foreign military 
presence. During and after the 1990-91 Gulf crisis, he became more 
open about the U.S. presence.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon IDs World War II Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The remains of three American servicemen  
missing in action from World War II have been identified and are 
being returned to their families in the United States for burial, 
the Pentagon said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The three were identified as Maj. Frank H. Blakey, Millbrook,  
Ala.; 2nd Lt. John S. McConnon, Pittsburgh; and Tech. Sgt. Wayne O. 
Shaffner, Martinsville, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnon and Shaffner were crew members aboard a B-24 Liberator  
shot down by German anti-aircraft fire in Albania on Aug. 10, 1944. 
The plane was returning to a base in Italy after a bombing run over 
Romania when it came under attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Blakey was commanding officer of the 305th Airdrome Squadron  
near Aitape, New Guinea, when he was last seen driving a jeep on 
June 10, 1944. The area -- now part of Papua New Guinea -- was under 
Japanese control at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains of the three servicemen were sent to the U.S.  
military identification lab in Hawaii, which officially confirmed 
the identities. 
</P>
<P>
	About 78,000 U.S. military personnel who fought in World War II  
are still missing. Most are believed to have perished at sea.

<HEADLINE> Snowboarder Dies After Fall in Utah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OGDEN, Utah (AP) -- A 23-year-old snowboarder died early Saturday  
from head injuries he suffered after falling almost 200 feet off a 
cliff and into rocks near Snowbasin Ski Resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Banning Doak, 23, was alone Friday afternoon when he attempted  
to go down a chute near Mt. Allen, north of Snowbasin's new upper 
tram terminal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The snow field he was on just ended,'' said Kent Matthews,  
Snowbasin's mountain manager. ``He had nowhere to go, so down he 
went, over the rocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doak had hiked out of bounds, Matthews said.  
</P>
<P>
	Carson Young of Eden, a witness, said it appeared the  
snowboarder was looking for a chute and fell. 
</P>
<P>
	``He must have lost his balance. He just came tumbling down in  
no control, like a rag doll bouncing off the rocks,'' Young said.

<HEADLINE> Victims' Bodies Leave Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- In a subdued culmination to a tragic  
week, the bodies of eight foreign tourists killed by Hutu rebels in 
a Ugandan national park were flown out of the country and began 
their journey home. 
</P>
<P>
	The coffins bearing the remains of the tourists, including two  
Americans, arrived early today at London's Gatwick airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Before being put on the plane at Entebbe airport in the Ugandan  
capital of Kampala, a private flag-folding ceremony was held for 
the two Americans, Rob Haubner, 48, and Susan Miller, 42. 
</P>
<P>
	Haubner and Miller were Oregon-based executives at the computer  
chip giant Intel. Like the other victims, they were visiting 
southwestern Uganda's Bwindi National Park to see its rare mountain 
gorillas. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight tourists were hacked and bludgeoned to death by Hutu  
Rwandan rebels who attacked three campsites Monday. Four rangers 
were also killed, and six other tourists managed to escape. 
</P>
<P>
	The flags were given to the slain Americans' friends, Susan  
Studd and Bob McLaurin, also Intel employees, who survived the 
rebel attack and who accompanied the bodies on the flight to 
Britain, said U.S. Embassy Public Affairs Officer Virgil Bodeen. 
</P>
<P>
	Bodeen said they would take the flags to the victims' families.  
The other victims included four Britons and two New Zealanders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ugandan government, meanwhile, said it would make every  
effort to ensure the safety of future tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ugandan army has intensified a joint manhunt with Rwandan  
forces to capture or kill the Hutu rebels behind the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of troops are combing the dense jungles along the  
Uganda-Congo border looking for the rebels. Fifteen rebels, some 
wearing clothes stolen from the tourists, were killed by the troops 
Wednesday, Ugandan officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can assure you we are doing everything possible so that this  
point of tourism is safe for everyone,'' said Ugandan Foreign 
Minister Eriya Kategaya. Still, the rebels -- Rwandans who are based 
in eastern Congo -- may be difficult to stop because of Congo's 
uncooperative government, Kategaya said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kategaya met with the U.S. and British ambassadors Friday to  
express his country's condolences. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an FBI team and detectives from Scotland yard are  
working with Kenyan investigators. Kategaya said he hoped the 
investigation might shed light on how the rebels had obtained such 
precise information about the campsites. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe there are some collaborators within our population,  
because the attacks seemed to have been very precise and clear with 
prior information on the positions of the people and even the look 
of the place,'' Kategaya said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was unaware of the detention of a suspect, which had  
been reported in a government-owned newspaper Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rwandan rebels were among Hutu fighters who fled Rwanda in  
1994 after killing more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and 
politically moderate Hutus in a government-orchestrated genocide. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, they have been operating from bases in Congo,  
launching cross-border attacks in Rwanda and more recently inside 
Congo and in Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Powell, the U.S. ambassador to Uganda, said a note that  
the rebels gave to an American survivor of the attack criticized 
the U.S. and British governments for supporting Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
	She said it was signed with the acronym ALIR, or the Rwanda  
Liberation Army, which put a bounty on the heads of Americans in 
Rwanda in 1996. The group has claimed responsibility for several 
rebel attacks in northwestern Rwanda in 1996 and 1997.

<HEADLINE> NYSE Tests Y2K Readiness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- World financial markets were in their usual  
Saturday slumber, but stock traders hustled on the littered floor 
of the New York Stock Exchange as if it was a typical weekday 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason for the weekend activity was the start of a two-month  
series of tests by the securities industry to determine whether its 
computer systems will be bitten by the year 2000 bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Fixing and testing for so-called Y2K troubles is expected to  
cost the U.S. securities industry $5 billion, according the 
Securities Industry Association, the trade group coordinating the 
test. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary results were ``better than expected,'' according  
to the Securities Industry Association, the industry group 
coordinating the test. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first day's success is important because it demonstrates  
that the participating firms have done their homework,'' said 
Donald Kittell, SIA executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer glitch is expected to affect an unknown number of  
computers whose programs will not be able to recognize the year 
2000. Instead, many of these computers will read that date as the 
year 1900, potentially causing them to shut down or malfunction, 
wreaking havoc on everything from financial markets to utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's activity at the New York Stock Exchange was just one  
part of a nationwide effort to find problem computer programs 
before Jan. 1. Nationally, more than 5,000 employees from 400 
brokerages, investment banks and securities clearing houses took 
part in the test of systems used to trade stocks, bonds and other 
financial products. 
</P>
<P>
	With the clocks turned ahead to Dec. 29, they followed carefully  
prepared scripts, executing more than 170,000 trades that would 
clear just after the turn of the millennium. All seemed business as 
usual with one big difference: None of the trades counted. 
</P>
<P>
	The test will run on weekends through April 24, simulating  
trades made on various dates between Dec. 29 and Jan. 22, 1999, and 
is expected to cost $100 million, the trade group said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kittell cautioned the test is still in the early stages and that  
more meaningful information would be available later this month. A 
detailed report is expected to be released April 29. 
</P>
<P>
	``The test schedule does not cross over to the year 2000 until  
April 10,'' Kittell said.

	Apparent Haiti Smuggling Boats Sink  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Two boats carrying as many as 43 Haitians in an  
apparent bid to smuggle them into the United States sank today off 
the South Florida coast, and rescuers found only three survivors. 
The Coast Guard recovered the bodies of two men and saw two other 
bodies sink below the surface. Three men rescued off West Palm 
Beach told U.S. Border Patrol officers that one boat -- carrying 18 
Haitians -- broke down and that the other boat -- carrying between 18 
to 25 more refugees -- came to help out. Both boats then went under, 
they said.

	Ethnic Albanians Vow to Sign Pact  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have vowed to sign a  
peace plan tomorrow to give them autonomy, the Clinton 
administration said today. The Serbs face the threat of NATO 
airstrikes if they refuse to sign the deal and if they continue a 
military buildup. The Serbs have accepted most of the political 
aspects of the peace plan to give broad self-rule to Kosovo for the 
next three years. But Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has 
rejected allowing a 30,000-member, NATO-led peacekeeping force to 
police the deal.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House demanded today that a  
Colombian rebel group turn over those responsible for the 
kidnapping and murder of three Americans found dead in Venezuela. 
``We are outraged by the murders,'' White House press secretary Joe 
Lockhart said. ``We have strong indications they were kidnapped and 
murdered by members of the Colombian rebel group'' known as the 
Revolutionary Armed Force of Colombia, Lockhart said.

	Sinn Fein Invited to Belfast Talks

<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The Protestant leader charged  
with forming Northern Ireland's new government said today he has 
invited the senior Sinn Fein leaders to urgent talks, the first 
time he's done so. Although Ulster Unionist Party leader David 
Trimble began talking with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams six months 
ago, until now such contact has always been at the behest of the 
Irish Republican Army-allied party. Trimble's invitation comes as 
the deadline set by the British government approaches to hand back 
power to local politicians in accord with last year's peace 
agreement.

	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- The last senior leader of the Khmer  
Rouge guerrilla army was arrested today and flown to Phnom Penh, 
where authorities said he will face trial for his alleged role in a 
regime that killed up to 2 million people. Soldiers captured Ta 
Mok, known as ``The Butcher'' for his ruthlessness, near the 
northern border with Thailand, senior Cambodian generals said. The 
guerrilla chief topped the most-wanted list of senior Khmer Rouge 
figures after the death last year of the movement's leader, Pol 
Pot.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Protesters across the country demonstrated today  
outside stores they say sell clothing made in sweatshop conditions. 
Several hundred activists marched up Manhattan's Fifth Avenue to 
the Nike store on East 57th Street. In San Francisco, as many as 
300 activists crowded in front of the Gap flagship store. Other 
anti-Gap protests happened in front of Northern California stores 
in Berkeley, Fresno, Santa Monica and Santa Barbara. In Cambridge, 
Mass., about 10 Harvard University students protested outside The 
Gap there.

tonight. It was their third championship in the last four years and 
their fourth of the '90s, twice what any other school managed in 
that time. The Huskies' (28-2) win over the Red Storm (24-8) at 
Madison Square Garden ended any doubts about the Huskies being a

<HEADLINE> Sotheby's Auctions 'Mulan' Artwork </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cartoons from Disney's film ``Mulan'' hit the  
auction block at Sotheby's on Saturday and danced past pre-sale 
estimates as the animation art brought in more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of buyers cheered as an animated image of the villain  
Shan Yu and his falcon sold for $43,700 -- much higher than its 
estimated value of $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone loves a good villain,'' said auctioneer David N.  
Redden, responding to the applause. 
</P>
<P>
	The forbidding image shows Shan Yu's falcon, his wings  
outstretched, coming to perch on his master's arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had just started a villains room in my house ... and Shan Yu  
is perfect for it,'' said Heide R. Fowler, a private collector from 
Austin, Texas who was the winning bidder. 
</P>
<P>
	The items for sale were all original animation art cell setups,  
which feature the actual hand-painted backgrounds or production 
overlays used in the making of the film. 
</P>
<P>
	While auction lots normally sell in fewer than 30 seconds, the  
bidding for Shan Yu lasted several tense minutes, going back and 
forth between Fowler and a telephone bidder. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was sort of like a tennis match,'' said Sotheby's spokesman  
Matt Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 film chronicles the adventures of a young woman whose  
irrepressible spirit clashes with Chinese traditional society. 
</P>
<P>
	Other highlights of the auction included the image of Mulan and  
her love interest, Captain Shang, which surpassed pre-sale 
estimates of $2,000, selling for $39,100. 
</P>
<P>
	A miniature of the dragon Mushu, estimated at $1,800, went for  
$14,950. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale, which took in $507,000, also featured illustrations  
from the Disney storybooks in mediums ranging from watercolor, pen, 
and pencil. 
</P>
<P>
	The record for sales of animation artwork belongs to another  
Disney film: Sales from ``The Lion King'' totaled nearly $2 million 
at Sotheby's in 1995.

<HEADLINE> $40 Tip May Have Come From Heist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- A big tip is usually welcome, but  
this one for a short, quick trip to a bank was big enough to make 
cab driver Travis Vaughn a little suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
	Then police told Vaughn his passenger was suspected of robbing  
the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn picked the man up at a house Friday morning, drove him to  
a bank branch, then took him back. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his passenger was in and out of the bank in what seemed  
like a minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so calm,'' Vaughn said. ``He didn't rush me. He didn't  
tell me to step on it or anything like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn said he wasn't suspicious until the guy handed him a $50  
bill for the $8.60 fare and told him to keep the change. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the passenger was Wayne R. Thomas, 40, who they  
identified from surveillance videos made while the bank was being 
robbed. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was arrested Friday night on a charge of armed robbery  
and was in jail Saturday in lieu of $100,000 bail, said police Lt. 
Jim Tesh.

<HEADLINE> Research Satellite Out of Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ground controllers were racing against time  
to save a newly launched, $49 million NASA satellite that was 
spinning out of control after being launched into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	The mishap is apparently due to the thruster-like action of  
hydrogen gas venting from a system needed to keep the satellite's 
telescope extremely cold. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wide-Field Infrared Explorer, or Wire, was spinning Friday  
at the rate of once per second. Unless engineers gain control, all 
the hydrogen could be lost, said Don Savage, a spokesman at 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration headquarters in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a race with the clock to turn this and hopefully cool  
down the spacecraft before all the hydrogen is vented,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wire carries a 12.5-inch Cassegrain telescope with infrared  
detectors. 
</P>
<P>
	The 561-pound satellite is the fifth mission under NASA's Small  
Explorer program. The mission was designed to help scientists 
understand how and when galaxies formed and the history of star 
formation. 
</P>
<P>
	The launch cost $18 million.

<HEADLINE> Working Helps Wilson, Hanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When Rita Wilson started reading the script  
for a TV movie, ``Invisible Child,'' she feared it would be another 
``nanny-from-hell story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out to be very different. In the Lifetime channel  
movie showing Monday, March 8 at 9 p.m., Tushka Bergen portrays a 
perfectly kind and efficient caretaker of children. It's the family 
that seems a little nuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Wilson and Victor Garber play parents who claim to have  
three children: Doc, Maggie and Sam. But Maggie is imaginary. 
</P>
<P>
	The psycho-drama explores why the mother maintains the fantasy,  
and why her family supports her in it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I liked the theme of the movie, which is that life is full of  
mysteries, and you never know why people do things,'' Miss Wilson 
says. ``It doesn't change how you feel about them, because you love 
them. I liked the fact that the story wasn't pat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The actress has enjoyed a busy couple of years. She has worked  
in feature movies: the upcoming ``Runaway Bride'' with Richard Gere 
and Julia Roberts, directed by Garry Marshall, and ``The Story of 
Us,'' with Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer, directed by Rob 
Reiner. She also appeared in the ``Psycho'' redo, in the secretary 
role originally played by Patricia Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids are a little bigger, which makes it easier to work,''  
commented Miss Wilson, the mother of two. Their ages? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get into details like that, just because we try to  
protect their privacy,'' she said firmly. 
</P>
<P>
	Her caution is perhaps natural. Her husband and the father of  
the children is Tom Hanks, who has two best-actor Oscars and is up 
for another for ``Saving Private Ryan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Invisible Child'' originally was to be filmed in Portland,  
Ore. When the script was offered to Miss Wilson, she replied: ``I'd 
love to do this, but Tom and I try not to work at the same time, 
and he's doing a movie.'' The Lifetime people did some rearranging, 
and filming was moved to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	When one is working, the other brings the kids on location for  
extended visits. Miss Wilson and the children joined Hanks during 
the long spells on location for ``Saving Private Ryan.'' And the 
family remained together when she worked in New York on ``Mixed 
Nuts'' with Steve Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	They know first-hand the perils wrought by separation on  
location. They met in 1985 when they co-starred in ``Volunteers,'' 
one of Hanks' more forgettable endeavors. They married after his 
1987 divorce from Samantha Lewes. As part of their togetherness 
policy, they have appeared in ``Bonfire of the Vanities,'' 
``Sleepless in Seattle,'' ``That Thing You Do'' (which Hanks wrote 
and directed), and in his 12-part HBO series, ``From the Earth to 
the Moon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Staying together ``is a problem only if it's not discussed, only  
if people pretend it's not going to create a problem,'' she said. 
``You have to be honest and work it out, you have to schedule 
things, and sometimes you'll have to give up some things. It's not 
that hard -- if you're honest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Is Hanks' all-round-decent-guy image for real? Does he ever get  
cranky in the morning or snap at the kids? 
</P>
<P>
	His wife contemplated the questions for a moment, then replied,  
laughing: ``Well, let's just say he's human.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Wilson grew up in Hollywood. On her first day at Hollywood  
High, she was photographed for Harper's Bazaar, which was doing a 
feature on high schoolers. That got her an agent. Then she 
accompanied a cheerleader friend to an audition for ``The Brady 
Bunch'' and she was chosen for a role, which got her into the 
Screen Actors Guild. 
</P>
<P>
	Her first substantial acting role was in ``Happy Days,'' the  
1970s TV sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
	In an otherwise slow start to her career, Miss Wilson appeared  
in a flock of TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great job,'' she recalls. ``It always made me laugh  
when actors said, `I won't do commercials.' I just never understood 
that. First of all, people don't really recognize you. I wouldn't 
do tacky things, products I didn't believe in. 
</P>
<P>
	``You name it, I've done it. I did a gazillion Burger King,  
McDonald's, car commercials, coffee commercials. They paid the 
rent.''

<HEADLINE> 27th Iditarod Starts in Alaska </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Nearly five dozen mushers and some 800  
eager huskies in harness set out toward the wilderness Saturday to 
begin the 27th Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, the 56 dog teams first pulled their sleds down a  
snow-covered street in downtown Anchorage, past hundreds of race 
fans whose enthusiasm blended with mild, sunny weather to create 
the feel of a sprawling block party. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's start was ceremonial, with dogs and drivers traveling  
at an easy pace along city trails for 18 miles. The 1,100-mile race 
to Nome starts for real on Sunday in Wasilla, 40 miles north of 
Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	The mushers are competing for a $450,000 purse, of which $54,000  
goes to the winner. Prize money is paid to the first 20 finishers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 field includes defending champ Jeff King, who has won  
the race three times; three-time winner Martin Buser; Rick Swenson, 
a five-time champion; and perennial front-runner DeeDee Jonrowe. 
</P>
<P>
	Other top competitors include Montana musher Doug Swingley, who  
in 1995 became the only non-Alaskan to win the race. While waiting 
for the start, he laid back in his sled relaxing, seemingly without 
a care about the trail ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the time you set out of here, either you've done your  
homework, or you haven't,'' said Swingley, who holds the race's 
speed record of 9 days and 3 hours. He finished ninth last year. 
</P>
<P>
	For months the mushers have been preparing their teams for the  
rugged and remote trail, many of them building up to the Iditarod 
distance by running shorter races in Alaska and the Lower 48. 
</P>
<P>
	John Baker, an Inupiat Eskimo from northwest Alaska, chose to  
prepare by not putting too many miles on a team that placed fifth 
in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've already proven themselves (in the Iditarod),'' Baker  
said. ``The physical ability is there -- I just need to have them in 
good mental shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Musher Robert Moore, a 63-year-old doctor from Vero Beach, Fla.,  
was in good mental shape, but his body let him down even before the 
race began. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore started training in September, but he was sidelined by  
back surgery before Christmas that he said still causes him severe 
pain. So instead of aiming toward the finish line in Nome, he's now 
only striving to get to the first checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't give up very easily,'' said Moore, the oldest  
rookie in this year's field. ``I said in Vero Beach that if I could 
stand at the starting line, I'd be on the (sled) runners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday each mushers carried an ``Iditarider'' in their  
sled. Those race fans paid up to $4,000 each for the chance to ride 
behind the dogs through Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	Among this year's Iditariders was soap-opera star Susan Lucci,  
who came north from New York for her ride with 1983 Iditarod champ

<HEADLINE> Cuba, Orioles Work Out Game Details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles, already cautiously  
optimistic about the possibility of playing an exhibition game in 
Cuba, worked Saturday toward finalizing plans for a return game in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles met with State Department and baseball officials for  
a second straight day in an effort to gain governmental approval 
for the home-and-home series. Baltimore would play the Cuban 
national team in Havana on March 28 and be host to the Cubans at 
Camden Yards on April 3 or 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is settled yet,'' a source familiar with the talks  
said, speaking on the condition he not be identified. ``The first 
game is almost assured and the second game is being discussed. 
There are other things still in dispute, issues that must be 
settled before this all can happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There isn't much time, however, because the Orioles and Cubans  
would have to scramble to make travel arrangements immediately 
after an agreement is reached. Baltimore is scheduled to play the 
Philadelphia Phillies in Alabama on April 3 and has an off day 
April 4 before opening the regular season at home April 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles owner Peter Angelos attended Saturday's late-afternoon  
meeting, as did Sandy Alderson, the executive director of baseball 
operations in the commissioner's office. The same officials met 
Friday night but failed to arrive at any firm conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Approval from the Clinton administration is necessary for each  
game. 
</P>
<P>
	A State Department official said the main hurdle is the  
distribution of the proceeds. The State Department is providing 
technical assistance to the parties on matters of U.S. law and 
policy, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration does not want profits to go to the  
government of Cuban President Fidel Castro. The Americans have 
suggested the money go to the Cuban operation of the Roman Catholic 
charity Caritas. Cuban leaders suggest using the money to help 
Cuban doctors in Central America who are assisting victims of 
Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of having the Orioles play in Cuba has been criticized  
by Cuban exiles and national groups in Florida, which oppose 
contact with the Castro government that seized power 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban exile groups, responding to the latest news, planned a  
Sunday protest during an exhibition game between the Orioles and 
the Florida Marlins at Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Alanis: Being Famous Not Worth It </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Alanis Morissette is questioning the value of  
fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I've gone from repression to explosion to  
contemplation,'' Morissette says in the April issue of Spin 
magazine. ``I always believed in black and white; something was 
either great or horrible, including myself. And now it's just 
gray.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the overwhelming success of her 1995 album ``Jagged  
Little Pill,'' Morissette took a lengthy recording break to find 
herself, studying yoga, spending time at a nudist colony and 
reading self-help books. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't always that way for the 24-year-old who started  
singing professionally as a girl in Canada, and recently released 
her second major album ``Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very intrigued by what celebrity status, fame, adulation  
could bring me,'' she says. ``It was touted as something that would 
raise your self-esteem and provide you with eternal happiness. Food 
would taste better, people would be more exciting, relationships 
would be great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She found that wasn't true.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wish people could achieve what they think would give them  
happiness in order for them to realize that that's not the way that 
happiness can be found,'' she says, acknowledging that her success 
and wealth makes such judgments suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get `easy for her to say' all the time,'' she says. ``It is  
much easier for me to say.''

<HEADLINE> 'Dream Home' Has Few Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND FORKS, N.D. (AP) --Christa and Steve Larson's new home has  
almost everything they wanted -- big kitchen with new appliances, 
two bedrooms, open living room with picture window. What's missing 
are neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Houses are all around, but in their immediate four-square-block  
neighborhood, only three others are occupied. The yards are only 
partly sodded. The windows have no curtains and ``For Sale'' signs 
are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``We love it here,'' Christa Larson says. ``But, yes, of course  
we would love to have neighbors. It's TOO quiet, sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After flood and fire ravaged the city in 1997, two new  
subdivisions with 193 houses were built in a hurry, with the help 
of federal grant money. 
</P>
<P>
	But even after offers of free snowblowers, lawn mowers and an  
allowance of up to $5,000 for appliances, 180 of the homes in the 
Congressional 1 and Congressional 2 subdivisions remain vacant. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics complain the homes are too near trailer courts and that  
schools and supermarkets are too far away. Many say the prices -- 
ranging from $105,000 to $145,000 -- are too high. And most grumble 
that the subdivisions' names, echoing government-issue housing, put 
some buyers off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took time to buy the land and get the houses started,''  
said Grand Forks area planner Floyd Hickok. ``By the time they 
became available, most of the people displaced by the flood had 
made other arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said, ``most of the houses that were lost in the  
flood were in the $50,000 to $80,000 range, 50-year-old houses. 
There's no way that you can build new for anywhere near that 
price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Real estate agents, city officials and Grand Forks Homes, the  
non-profit agency in charge of the development, all say they have 
put their squabbles behind them to focus on sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our biggest concern was that we were not involved in  
the process early on,'' said Janelle Kerr, president of the Grand 
Forks Board of Realtors. ``But we have really taken a proactive 
view, as everyone has, that the important thing now is to be part 
of the solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We know something needs to be done,'' said Mayor Pat Owens.  
``In hindsight, would we have done things differently in the 
beginning? Absolutely. But at the time, all we knew is there was a 
demand for homes and private builders weren't interested in taking 
the risk of building on their own, so somebody had to step in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1997, the City Council approved the purchase of 50  
acres of open fields on the west side of town with $4 million in 
federal grant money. 
</P>
<P>
	To head the project, the city called on the expertise of Grand  
Forks Homes, an eight-member board of people appointed by local 
churches that builds housing for low- and moderate-income families. 
</P>
<P>
	The city sold the land to Grand Forks Homes for $12,000 per acre  
and approved $10.15 million in bonds to build up to 200 houses. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Keeley, a Grand Forks Homes board member, said he was  
skeptical of the project in the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first, I resisted it,'' he said. ``I didn't think it was  
our position as a non-profit housing group to be in the business of 
building 200 new homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But private contractors didn't step forward, Keeley said, and he  
became convinced people would buy the homes. Grand Forks Homes did 
a survey that found 176 property owners interested in buying a 
house for about $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeley still doesn't understand why the homes are not selling.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a mystery to me. But there has been an incredible amount  
of badmouthing about the project, talk of bad construction and poor 
quality, that kind of thing,'' Keeley said. ``We feel that 
virtually everything being said is either untrue or unfair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larson, who still hasn't completely unpacked since moving in two  
months ago, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of people who badmouth the houses haven't even  
been out to see them,'' she said. ``People told us the same thing, 
`Oh, you don't want to buy one of those homes. They're not quality 
built.' But I think our house is fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Larsons are not Grand Forks flood victims. They moved from  
Fargo to take new jobs with local hotels. Their two-bedroom house 
in Congressional 1, which cost $119,000, came with an unfinished 
basement, but Larson's father and stepfather are filling it with a 
second bathroom, a third bedroom, a family room and a den. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the fact that we can put our own finishing touches on  
it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	While people drive through the subdivisions looking at the  
homes, serious inquiries are still rare. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand Forks Homes plans to ask the City Council to approve $10.4  
million more in grant money, half of it for maintenance expenses 
and half to offer more incentives to lure buyers. The non-profit 
has also arranged for a local radio station to give away one of the 
houses as a ``dream home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keeley is confident the homes will sell quickly if the  
incentives are approved. But he said word of the incentives may 
also be to blame for stalled sales right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one's going to buy a home today if they think they'll get a  
better deal in a couple weeks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Larson, whose only incentives were a new snowblower and kitchen  
appliances, said she supports more incentives if it means she'll 
have neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd open up my door any time to someone who wanted to look at  
my house,'' she said. ``We want this to be a neighborhood, and that 
takes people.''

<HEADLINE> Infielder Shipley Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Infielder Craig Shipley, a veteran of 15  
years in professional baseball, told the Anaheim Angels on Saturday 
that he is retiring.

professional baseball career with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1984. 
He also played for the New York Mets, San Diego Padres, Houston 
Astros and the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly appreciate and respect Craig's decision. ... It  
was obvious he had given this a great deal of thought,'' Angels 
general manager Bill Bavasi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipley, who hopes to play for Australia in next year's Sydney  
Olympics and has invested in Australia's professional baseball 
league, appeared in 77 games for the Angels last season, hitting 
.259 with two homers and 17 RBIs. He has a .271 career average with 
20 homers and 138 RBIs.
