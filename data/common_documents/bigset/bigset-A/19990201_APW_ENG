<HEADLINE> Calif. Court Rules on Infant Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A parent who violently shakes a baby can be  
convicted of felony child abuse even if unaware of the dangers of 
the act, the state Supreme Court ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a unanimous decision, the court said the prosecution in a  
felony abuse case must prove only that a parent or caretaker 
deliberately took some action that caused ``unjustifiable physical 
pain or mental suffering,'' and that the action posed a danger of 
death or serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no need to prove the defendant knew, or should have  
known, that he or she was endangering the child, the justices said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing intrinsically distinct about the act of  
violently shaking a vulnerable infant that separates it from other 
methods of direct child abuse,'' said the opinion by Justice Janice 
Rogers Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	The court rejected a lower-court ruling that a parent who had no  
reason to be aware of the danger of shaking a child was guilty only 
of a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail. Felony child 
abuse is punishable by up to six years in prison, or longer in the 
case of serious injury or death. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling stems from a case in Yuba County and applies to any  
child-abuse case in which the defendant directly injured the child. 
</P>
<P>
	The case dates from August 1993, when 4-month-old Michael D.  
Sargent Jr. was found unconscious and not breathing on the floor. 
His father told police the child had fallen, but later admitted 
shaking him twice that day after losing his temper. He said he 
hadn't intended to hurt the baby and had no idea shaking could do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
	He was convicted of felony child abuse and sentenced to 11 years  
in prison, the maximum six years for the crime and five years for a 
previous felony conviction. The child has fully recovered, said 
Sargent's lawyer, Barry Zimmerman. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3rd District Court of Appeal overturned the felony  
conviction in December 1997, ruling 2-1 the charge required proof 
Sargent knew or should have known how dangerous his conduct was. 
</P>
<P>
	But the state's high court ruled that Sargent's knowledge was  
irrelevant, because he deliberately shook the child, an act the 
jury found to be dangerous.

<HEADLINE>  Iran Marks Khomeini Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- School bells rang and helicopters showered  
flowers on the tomb of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini today as Iran 
marked the 20th anniversary of his return from exile. 
</P>
<P>
	The bells -- along with whistles from trains and ships at port --  
were sounded at 9:33 a.m., the moment Khomeini's jet touched down 
at Tehran's Mehrabad airport on Feb. 1, 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Helicopters also dropped flowers on Khomeini's golden-domed tomb  
inside the sprawling Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery south of Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
	After returning from 15 years of exile, Khomeini overthrew the  
U.S.-supported shah and proclaimed the Islamic Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	His actions shocked the United States and raised fears across  
the Arab world that Khomeini would follow through on his pledge to 
export his strict vision of Islam. Fifty-two Americans were held 
hostage in the Iranian capital for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands gathered today inside the shrine -- aglow with lights  
from giant chandeliers and adorned with precious Persian carpets -- 
to pay tribute to Khomeini, who died on June 3, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	State-run television broadcast live from the shrine, where  
Khomeini's grandson, Hassan, said his grandfather had ``come as a 
hero and left as a hero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's former president who now heads a  
powerful policy-making body, told the crowds that the United States 
was still the enemy and claimed that only Iran's military might 
prevented the United States and Britain from carrying out attacks 
on Iran similar to those against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Khomeini's successor as Iran's  
supreme leader, and President Mohammad Khatami paid their respects 
at the shrine. 
</P>
<P>
	Every Iranian newspaper ran front-page pictures of Khomeini  
along with articles glorifying the father of the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a full 20 years now since that memorable day in history  
which cleansed Iran of the cobwebs of corruption and ushered in the 
dawn of Islamic rule,'' said the English-language Kayhan 
International. 
</P>
<P>
	Television interspersed live coverage from the tomb with old  
footage of Khomeini's return. It showed the dour cleric in his 
beard, black turban and flowing robe as he stepped down the stairs 
of the Air France jet with a French steward holding his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	One goal was to keep Khomeini's memory alive, especially for the  
generation born since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	The festivities are to climax on Feb. 11, the day the shah's  
government collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	A bomb explosion Sunday in northeastern Tehran failed to mar the  
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran acknowledged claims by the Iraq-based Mujahedeen Khalq  
opposition group that it had launched the attack, but differed on 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mujahedeen claimed that a mortar attack on the Intelligence  
Ministry headquarters in Tehran caused considerable damage. 
</P>
<P>
	But the official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted an  
unidentified official as saying the bomb had shattered glass in 
homes and cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Islamic republic that Khomeini left behind is now in the  
midst of a power struggle. Hard-liners want to continue to rule in 
his uncompromising style, while moderates are following the lead of 
the reformist president, Khatami.

<HEADLINE> Teddy Bear May Help Ramsey Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- A Denver woman's teddy bear closely  
resembling a toy that was in JonBenet Ramsey's room around the time 
she was killed could provide a lead in the two-year murder mystery, 
the Boulder District Attorney's Office said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears it will give us some information,'' spokeswoman  
Suzanne Laurion said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The toy was turned in to authorities Friday, the day after  
District Attorney Alex Hunter sought help from the public in 
tracking down information about a foot-long stuffed teddy bear 
dressed in a Santa suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The stuffed animal in the photo was reportedly among toys found  
in JonBenet's room, but family members said it did not belong to 
the little girl. The teddy bear is now apparently missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter posted a fuzzy snapshot of the white, furry bear on an  
Internet site, hoping that someone would be able to identify the 
toy's manufacturer and retailers where it was sold in 1996 or 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The site logged 10,000 hits within 24 hours, 100 voice mails,  
two faxes and two ``personal contacts,'' the District Attorney's 
Office said. 
</P>
<P>
	The photo was also published and shown on television, and a  
Denver woman who saw the photo of the bear on TV turned over her 
similar toy to officials on Friday. No information was disclosed on 
where that bear was purchased or whether it had any identifying 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
	``We find ourselves emotionally moved by the caring people have  
shown and how much people want to help,'' said Laurion, adding that 
an announcement will be made when prosecutors are confident they 
have found what they needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurion confirmed that the Coldwater police department in  
Michigan had been quietly working to find the maker of the stuffed 
bear since ``late last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Coldwater police department put two photographs of the teddy  
bear on their own World Wide Web site without mentioning the Ramsey 
case. That site did not elicit a single response. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys had a vacation home in Charlevoix, in northwestern  
Michigan, which is more than 300 miles away from Coldwater, a small 
town near the southern border of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal was to conduct a search from a distant police  
department,'' said Laurion. ``When this effort failed, we knew our 
next step was to issue a plea for assistance from the general 
public, which we did on Thursday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet, 6, was found beaten and strangled in her family's home  
on the day after Christmas 1996. There have been no arrests, 
although police have said JonBenet's parents, John and Patsy 
Ramsey, are under suspicion. They have denied involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	A Boulder County grand jury has been hearing evidence in the  
slaying since September. 
</P>
<P>
	Pam Paugh, an aunt of JonBenet, said in an interview Friday that  
a small brown pouch attached to the bear contained a note. 
</P>
<P>
	The note was not alarming, but in view of the circumstances it  
was both ``telling'' and ``a bit prophetic,'' Paugh said in an 
interview with the TV show ``Inside Edition.'' She speculated that 
the bear may have been used to lure JonBenet out of her room.

<HEADLINE> Europe May Follow Fed's Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- European Central Bank President Wim  
Duisenberg hinted Monday he wanted to model his bank on the U.S. 
Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the Council of Foreign Relations in Chicago,  
Duisenberg said the ECB was a young bank whose role would develop 
gradually. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will also build on the experience of those central banks  
which have played an important international role in the past,'' 
Duisenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You may guess which central bank outside the euro area I have  
in mind in particular,'' he told his U.S. audience, according to a 
copy of the speech released in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Duisenberg, whose ECB launched a common European currency, the  
euro, on Jan. 1 and began setting monetary policy for 11 European 
countries that day, said the ECB wouldn't try to challenge the 
dominance of the dollar as the international currency of choice. 
</P>
<P>
	That might happen on its own, Duisenberg warned.  
</P>
<P>
	``The possibility of the euro assuming a prominent role more  
rapidly than is perhaps suggested by past experience cannot be 
ruled out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro represents a currency bloc roughly equivalent to that  
of the United States, while it has a larger share of world exports 
and is second in terms of its capital market. 
</P>
<P>
	Challenges facing the euro bloc, where inflation is under  
control, include the recent economic crisis in Brazil and excessive 
wage demands in Europe, Duisenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11 countries in the euro bloc are Austria, Belgium, Finland,  
France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, 
Portugal and Spain.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Rebels May Oppose Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ethnic Albanian rebels are hinting  
at opposition to international peace talks on Kosovo this week, 
saying negotiations ``organized in a rush'' cannot resolve the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. envoy Christopher Hill and Wolfgang Petritsch of the  
European Union were expected to press the proposal for talks during 
a visit to Kosovo today -- just five days before the peace 
conference is to open. 
</P>
<P>
	However, amid peace efforts and international demands to halt  
the fighting, violence erupted in Kosovo again Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A small bomb was thrown into an Albanian-run cafe, reportedly  
killing one person and injuring two. It was the third bombing in as 
many days in Pristina, Kosovo's capital. On Friday, both an 
Albanian- and Serb-run cafe were bombed. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, police sources said three Serb policemen returning from  
the funeral of a slain officer were wounded late Sunday when ethnic 
Albanian rebels fired a grenade at their van in the southwestern 
village of Istinic. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Serb Media Center reported that three ethnic Albanians  
were wounded Sunday when gunmen broke into their home in a village 
near Stimlje, 20 miles southwest of Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting between ethnic Albanian separatists and Serbian  
security forces in Kosovo has left at least 2,000 people dead and 
displaced hundreds of thousands from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and five major European powers have demanded  
that both sides attend a conference this week in France to end the 
11 months of violence and establish self-rule for the Serbian 
province where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has authorized Secretary-General Javier Solana to launch  
military action in Yugoslavia if the diplomatic initiative fails to 
produce negotiations in a week and a settlement two weeks after 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic nor the rebel  
Kosovo Liberation Army has announced whether they will accept the 
demand, and told British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on Saturday 
they would reply within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	In the rebels' first public statement since the demand was  
issued, a senior KLA official, Jakup Krasniqi, was quoted by 
Albanian state television Sunday as saying ``negotiations organized 
in a rush do not guarantee success for the solving of the Kosovo 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krasniqi, who met last week in Kosovo with Hill and Petritsch,  
was quoted by the rebel news agency Kosova Press as saying the 
guerrillas ``remain open to negotiations with relevant 
international actors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo's leading moderate ethnic Albanian politician, Ibrahim  
Rugova, accepted the offer Saturday, but the participation of the 
rebels is essential to the success of any agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a U.S. formula worked out by the Contact Group -- the  
United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- the 
talks would produce an ``interim agreement'' granting Kosovo 
substantial self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
	After three years, the Serbs and ethnic Albanians could take up  
the issue of complete independence -- the goal of most of the 
Albanian community. Milosevic has strongly opposed independence and 
has denounced the rebels as ``terrorists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA has long refused to join any talks unless they would  
lead to complete independence for the province in Serbia, the 
largest of Yugoslavia's two remaining republics. The rebels also 
insist that the Serb-led government first remove security forces 
from the province. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the rebels have come under strong international  
pressure to accept the interim settlement and attend the talks in 
Rambouillet, France. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic has resisted talks outside Yugoslavia or any formula  
that limits the participants to Serbs and Albanians without the 
province's other ethnic groups, including Gypsies and Turks. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Sunday, the Yugoslav Left -- led by Milosevic's  
influential wife -- said ``pressures exerted on our country 
regarding Kosovo are aimed at its destruction or destabilization'' 
and transforming Yugoslavia into ``a colonial state with a puppet 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the statement stopped short of recommending the government  
reject the peace talks ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the negative signals, the chief international peace  
monitor in Kosovo said Sunday he expected all the parties to attend 
the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one said no,'' William Walker told British Broadcasting  
Corp. television.

<HEADLINE> Fed Issues Banks Credit Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the heels on a report critical of how  
bankers dealt with hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, the 
Federal Reserve has issued guidelines to bankers and bank examiners 
aimed at reducing banks' credit risks. 
</P>
<P>
	In issuing the guidelines Monday, the Fed noted that the losses  
from the hedge fund debacle showed that ``basic credit 
risk-management policies, procedures and internal controls were 
insufficient at some (banks) to address the risks of new, 
fast-growing or evolving (financial) products and activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banks must devote sufficient resources and attention to ensuring  
``the integrity and adequacy'' of their risk-management procedures, 
the central bank said. Similar guidelines were released last month 
by the office of the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, which 
regulates nationally chartered banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall some of the nation's biggest banks and brokerage firms  
spent $3.6 billion to bail out Long-Term Capital, a high-risk hedge 
fund for wealthy investors that had nearly borrowed itself into 
extinction. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York helped arrange the 
private rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	After Long-Term Capital's managers bet big on interest-rate  
swings and lost, the fund's meltdown threatened to disrupt world 
financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a  
report that found a group of major U.S. and European banks had 
failed to adequately oversee their loans to and trading activities 
with Long-Term Capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The report cited what it said were lapses in judgment by the  
banks in their dealings with Long-Term Capital and other hedge 
funds. It also said such investment funds are very difficult to 
regulate and that lenders should be far more cautious. 
</P>
<P>
	A presidential working group is looking at possible restrictions  
on bank loans to high-risk hedge funds in the aftermath of 
Long-Term Capital's near-collapse, a Fed official recently told a 
Senate committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve oversees the foreign and holding-company  
banks that invested in Long-Term Capital, including Citigroup, 
Chase Manhattan, Germany's Deutsche Bank and Britain's Barclays 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this year, several of the banks and investment firms --  
including Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Morgan Stanley 
Dean Witter &AMP; Co. and Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. -- formed a new group to 
develop risk standards for financial institutions extending credit 
in volatile global markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said their move was supported by Arthur Levitt,  
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission; Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.

<HEADLINE> IOC Approves Ethics Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The IOC, wracked by its biggest  
ethics scandal, now has its first ethics commission and code of 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the Salt Lake City corruption scandal, the two  
measures were adopted Monday by the IOC executive board during a 
special meeting on the eve of the world drug summit. 
</P>
<P>
	Director general Francois Carrard said the ethics panel would  
police ``the general conduct of IOC members and their business 
practices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the five-member panel would include three officials from  
outside the International Olympic Committee. He said they would be 
``very serious independent personalities'' from different parts of 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said the ethics panel should be in operation before the  
special IOC general assembly March 17-18, called to deal with the 
scandal, and would eventually replace the commission formed to 
investigate allegations of misconduct stemming from Salt Lake 
City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said the existing panel would continue its work until  
the ethics panel takes over.

skilled offensive weapons, agreed to a three-year contract 
extension with the club Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kapanen's new contract will average about $2.2 million a season.  
That's a hefty raise over the $650,000 he'll make this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, since that (initial) contract he's done very  
well,'' Carolina general manager Jim Rutherford said in a telephone 
interview from Palm Springs, Calif., where he's attending an NHL 
meeting of general managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kapanen, 25, was drafted by the franchise in 1995. The  
5-foot-10, 175-pound forward leads the Hurricanes this season with 
nine multi-point games and is third in points (34) and goals (14). 
</P>
<P>
	Kapanen, who would have been a restricted free agent after the  
season, recorded career bests in the 1997-98 season with 26 goals, 
37 assists and 63 points. His points tied for the team lead with 
Keith Primeau. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a skilled guy, he's a guy who could put big numbers up,''  
Rutherford said of Kapanen's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Kapanen helped Finland capture the bronze medal in the 1998  
Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, and has scored 58 goals and 73 
assists for a total of 131 points in 209 NHL games. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutherford said he has sought to extend the contracts of other  
potential Carolina free agents, which include captain Keith 
Primeau, goaltenders Trevor Kidd and Arturs Irbe, and Ray Sheppard. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can agree to the right numbers I'll look at signing some  
other guys,'' Rutherford said. ``But there is no priority list. 
It's not like if somebody doesn't get signed (during the season) 
we're not interested in them. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just one where talks moved along and we agreed with  
where Sami fell within our team and within the league and it got 
done,'' he added. ``He wants to be here and rightfully so.''

<HEADLINE> Personal Income and Spending Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans ended 1998 with a spending spree,  
giving the economy momentum as it entered the new year. But 
economists wonder how long consumers can sustain the breakneck 
pace. Their incomes grew strongly, but they spent every bit of the 
increase -- and more. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal income jumped 0.5 percent in December, the best gain in  
10 months, the Commerce Department said Monday. Spending surged an 
even stronger 0.8 percent, the most since May. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basic message is the consumer is still ready, willing and  
able to spend,'' said economist Robert Dederick of Northern Trust 
Co. in Chicago. ``There is nothing to suggest the consumer is 
beginning to turn tail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strong stock-market gains, low interest rates and robust  
inflation-adjusted wage gains are all supporting consumer spending, 
which accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fundamentals ... suggest continued gains,'' said economist  
Lynn Reaser of Nationsbank in Jacksonville, Fla. ``In addition, 
many individuals this spring will be receiving tax refunds, with 
the child and education tax credits'' effective for the first time 
for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But, because Americans spent more than they earned in December,  
their personal savings rate went negative -- to minus 0.1 percent -- 
for the second time last year. The measure of savings as a 
percentage of after-tax income has fluctuated around zero for four 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	And spending was bolstered in December by two factors that  
weren't helping in January: a last-minute surge in holiday shopping 
in response to discounts and very strong auto sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bad weather, less aggressive price discounting and a slowdown  
in employment growth point to slower consumer spending gains in 
January,'' said Kathleen Wylie of Scotiabank in Toronto. ``Further 
slowdowns are likely as the year progresses given the low savings 
rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Americans saved just 0.5 percent of their income,  
the least since 1933, compared with 2.1 percent in 1997 and 2.9 
percent in 1996. But, the figure is not as grim as it appears. 
</P>
<P>
	It reflects the fact that prosperous Americans spent a portion  
of their stock-market gains and tapped their home equity during a 
wave of refinancing spurred by the lowest mortgage rates since the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Income in 1998 rose a healthy 5 percent, the fourth consecutive  
year at or above that level, but still the smallest rise since 
1993. That included a 6.7 percent increase in wages and salaries -- 
the most-watched component of income -- and a 23.6 percent plunge in 
farm owners' income, reflecting the worldwide economic slump's 
impact on commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending jumped 5.7 percent, the largest gain since 1994. It was  
propelled by a 7.5 percent increase for big-ticket durable goods, 
as low interest rates fueled car sales and record home sales 
encouraged furniture and appliance purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report, the Commerce Department said construction  
spending surged 1.7 percent in December, the largest gain in six 
months, helped by unseasonably mild weather for much of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction spending for the year rose 6.3 percent to $657  
billion, following a 5.9 percent rise in 1997. The categories with 
the biggest gains included single-family homes, 13.9 percent; 
apartments, 8 percent; offices, 16.4 percent, and hotels and 
motels, 12.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, an index compiled by the National Association of  
Purchasing Management showed manufacturing declined for the eighth 
consecutive month in January, but at a slower rate than during the 
previous seven months. 
</P>
<P>
	Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the organization's survey committee,  
found ``signs of encouragement,'' including marked increases in 
both production and new orders.

<HEADLINE> Denver Cleans Up After Free-For-All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Crews swept broken glass, empty beer cans and  
other debris off downtown streets Monday after a post-Super Bowl 
free-for-all pitted vandalizing fans against police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd, estimated at 1,000 or more, tipped over trash cans  
and cars, broke windows in dozens of buildings, spilled newspaper 
boxes, ripped down street signs and lit bonfires. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like following the path of a tornado,'' said Andrew  
Hudson, a spokesman for Mayor Wellington Webb. ``It was just a 
really ugly scene by a lot of obnoxious people who were drunk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 20 people were arrested and property damage was  
estimated at $160,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 people were treated at Denver Health Medical  
Center, mostly for exposure to tear gas, said Chris Colwell, 
associate director of the hospital's paramedic division. 
</P>
<P>
	There also were five victims of automobile-pedestrian accidents  
that occurred during and after the game, and a number of assaults. 
Two of the accident victims were children, who were hospitalized in 
serious condition Monday. The others were treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely saw more people than we would on a more typical  
Sunday evening, but we did not see a dramatic rise in very serious 
incidents,'' Colwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vandalism, which marked the city's Super Bowl victory for a  
second year, left officials disappointed and angry, particularly 
because they had taken steps this year to control crowds by 
blocking access to downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, this was a crowd that had no respect for other  
people's property,'' Hudson said. ``They were hell-bent on causing 
trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Violence also erupted in several other Colorado cities, from  
Grand Junction to Greeley to Pueblo, but there were no reports of 
serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	In Denver, police officers had predicted problems from rowdy  
fans, based on the aftermath of the 1998 Super Bowl, when police 
arrested more than 25 revelers and 50 people were overcome by tear 
gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Store windows were broken, cars were overturned and bonfires  
were set in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, police blocked access to the downtown area, banned  
parking along some streets and practiced crowd-control measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Police used tear gas to control the crowds as sporadic violence  
broke out from Coors Field, on one end of downtown, to the State 
Capitol at the other end. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans scurried away from the smoke, some collapsing on the  
street. ``They didn't give us any time,'' said John Giomin of 
Denver. ``This really hurts. This really hurts. I've never been 
gassed before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In some instances, young people wore surgical masks, gas masks  
and bandanas around their faces to ward off tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers in full riot gear banged nightsticks on shields and  
walked side by side through the streets to force the crowds to 
disperse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was rowdy and the police acted with as much restraint as  
they could,'' Hudson said. ``They also effectively used tear gas 
where it got really out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In northern Colorado, police officers in Greeley also used tear  
gas to disperse crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 Fort Collins officers resorted to pepper spray and  
batons to control a crowd of between 2,000 and 4,000 revelers, who 
were mostly students at nearby Colorado State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokeswoman Rita Davis said there was one arrest, but  
damage and injuries were minor. 
</P>
<P>
	In Grand Junction, officers tried dogs and tear gas before  
resorting to water streaming from fire hoses to break up fans 
packing a main street, tying up traffic. At least five people were 
arrested but there were few reports of vandalism, said police 
spokeswoman Shari Zen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just got to the point where the safety of the community and  
the businesses were (at issue),'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pueblo officers said they had numerous arrests for firecrackers,  
drunken driving and a bonfire.

<HEADLINE> Elway Deciding Whether To Drive Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- While the last thing John Elway needed was another  
car, the latest addition to his garage is one he'd never refuse -- 
it goes with the Super Bowl MVP award. 
</P>
<P>
	But he still isn't saying whether he'll drive off into  
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway recently sold his seven auto dealerships for $82 million,  
remains the front man for 17 dealerships and owns a stable of cars. 
NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue joked about that as he introduced 
Elway at a news conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be that a car was an incentive to win,'' Tagliabue  
said. ``Now, it's clear that not even a dealership is incentive to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway won the MVP trophy for leading the Denver Broncos to a  
34-19 victory over the Atlanta Falcons in the Super Bowl on Sunday. 
He also got a choice of a Ford Mustang or Expedition. He took the 
latter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our staff met last night to try to come up with something that  
would give John an incentive to play another season,'' Tagliabue 
said. ``The best they could come up with was the idea that you have 
a chance to be the first player in NFL history to be the MVP in two 
different centuries. We decided not to offer that to you because it 
might emphasize your age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old quarterback completed 18 of 29 passes for 336  
yards, and threw for one touchdown and ran for another in his fifth 
and possibly final trip to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really never thought I would be standing up here the morning  
after a Super Bowl as the MVP,'' said Elway, who clearly had his 
best performance in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
	``After you lose three in a row, you're just hoping your team  
can win. So this is a bonus. It's really one of the great thrills 
of my career, and I've had many of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After last year's Super Bowl victory, Elway agonized for four  
months about retirement. He expects to make a quicker decision 
about playing next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Although believed to be leaning toward retirement, Elway  
admitted the opportunity for an unprecedented third straight Super 
Bowl title is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be great to come back and three-peat,'' he said.  
``But also, it would be nice to walk away at the level that I'm 
playing right now. I don't want to walk away too late, but I also 
know that if I play like I played last night that I can play a 
little bit longer. There will be a bunch of things that go into the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm just cherishing the moment, cherishing the win  
and everything that has happened to us this year. At 38 years old 
and in the twilight of my career, I have a tendency to focus on the 
now and not tomorrow. Once the dust settles, I'll weigh those 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before making his decision, Elway said he will talk to his wife  
and four children, his father and mother, coach Mike Shanahan and 
Broncos owner Pat Bowlen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said all week and I said this year that it's a 90 percent  
chance I'm going to quit,'' he said. ``But the last thing I want to 
do is shut the door. I don't want to say that I'm done, then get 
into March or April and say that I can play one more year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His 90 percent estimate is a reduction of the 99.9 percent  
guarantee he gave last June that 1998 would be his final season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are physical considerations,'' said Elway, who  
uncharacteristically missed all or parts of six games this season 
with hamstring, back and rib injuries. ``Can I compete for an 
entire 16-game schedule? Can I spend the time working on what we do 
offensively in Denver from a mental standpoint? It was a long haul 
for me this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And one well worth it.

<HEADLINE>  Brazil-IMF Talks Calm Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's currency strengthened and  
markets calmed down Monday as a top official of the International 
Monetary Fund flew here to discuss ways to fix the nation's 
battered economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Fischer, the IMF's chief economist, is to meet with  
Finance Minister Pedro Malan on Tuesday in Brasilia, the capital. 
The talks could expedite release of the second installment of a 
$41.5 billion aid package. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Brazil received $9 billion from the IMF and used it  
to bolster its sagging currency reserves, now at $36 billion -- down 
from $74 billion last July. A second parcel might help restore the 
confidence of skittish investors. 
</P>
<P>
	But first the two sides must agree on how to stabilize the real,  
which has plunged since the government devalued the currency on 
Jan. 13 and then let it float freely. 
</P>
<P>
	The real closed stronger Monday at 1.91 to the dollar, up from  
2.06 at Friday's close. The currency has lost 39 percent of its 
value since the devaluations began. 
</P>
<P>
	The panic that gripped markets on Friday also subsided, after  
rumors that the government would freeze bank deposits sent 
Brazilians scurrying to withdraw their savings. Such a freeze was 
imposed in the early 1990s, leaving many unable to pay their bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan went on television and gave his ``word of honor'' that  
savings wouldn't be touched. ``There is no possibility whatever 
that the government would commit any such violence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When those rumors proved not to be true Monday, the Sao Paulo  
Stock Exchange, Latin America's largest, rose substantially, 
closing up 8.80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	President Fernando Henrique Cardoso attributed Friday's panic to  
speculators in the futures market who profit when the real falls. 
Currency dealers on Friday confirmed that some banks were pushing 
the real down. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brazilians and the IMF have diverged on the best way to  
control inflation in the new era of the free-floating real. After 
reaching 2,700 percent in 1993, inflation plunged to near zero last 
year but now threatens to return. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF favors a sharp rise in interest rates to restrict the  
amount of money in circulation and avert speculation. The problem 
is that high interest rates will worsen the recession and the 
government's own spending deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Sunday at the World Economic Forum in Davos,  
Switzerland, Fischer said that the real has depreciated far beyond 
where it should, but said the country still needs a credible 
monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank on Monday raised its lending rate for banks for  
the fourth straight day. The new rate is 39 percent, up from 37 
percent on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's close to the ceiling of 41 percent set last month.  
Central Bank President Francisco Lopes said a special meeting could 
be convened to raise the limit. 
</P>
<P>
	An IMF team arrived in Brasilia over the weekend to review the  
terms of the aid package. Published reports said the 
Washington-based fund would likely urge Brazil to make deeper cuts 
in spending to reduce its budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the government shaved 5.8 billion reals, or about  
$2.9 billion, off the budget -- surpassing the target of 5 billion 
reals, or $2.5 billion. For 1999, Brazil has pledged to reduce its 
deficit by 28 billion reals, now worth about $14 billion.

	Today is Tuesday, Feb. 2, the 33rd day of 1999. There are 332  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 2, 1848, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, ending the  
Mexican War, was signed. The treaty turned over to the United 
States a huge portion of the present-day Southwest, including 
Texas, New Mexico and California. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1536, the Argentine city of Buenos Aires was founded by Pedro  
de Mendoza of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1653, New Amsterdam -- now New York City -- was incorporated.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1876, the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs was  
formed in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1882, Irish poet and novelist James Joyce was born near  
Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1897, fire destroyed the Pennsylvania state capitol in  
Harrisburg. A new statehouse was dedicated on the same site nine 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1942, a Los Angeles Times column urged security measures  
against Japanese-Americans, arguing that a Japanese-American 
``almost inevitably ... grows up to be a Japanese, not an 
American.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1943, the remainder of Nazi forces from the Battle of  
Stalingrad surrendered in a major victory for the Soviets in World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1945, President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston  
Churchill departed Malta for the summit in Yalta with Soviet leader 
Josef Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1971, Idi Amin assumed power in Uganda, following a coup that  
ousted President Milton Obote. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, dancer, actor and choreographer Gene Kelly died at his  
Beverly Hills, California, home; he was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: President Bush met at the White House with  
Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, after which both leaders 
sounded upbeat about U.S-Japanese relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: The Commerce Department reported that its Index  
of Leading Economic Indicators rose for the fifth straight month. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: President Clinton unveiled a $1.73 trillion budget  
claiming the first surpluses in 30 years and pumping billions to 
schools, health and child care. The government released statistics 
showing deaths from AIDS fell by almost half during the first half 
of 1997, a decrease attributed to increased use of powerful 
combinations of medicines.

<HEADLINE> Town Wants Dragging Trials To End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Drive east on Texas 190, across the Neches  
River, and it's not hard to feel lost here, deep among the towering 
East Texas pines. 
</P>
<P>
	Cellular phones don't work well. Radio stations from Louisiana  
to the east and Houston to the southwest battle for dominance over 
faint, flickering frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
	On a typical night, Jasper's handful of restaurants shut down by  
10 p.m. The only activity until dawn comes at the 24-hour Wal-Mart 
and the glowing courthouse clock tower, with its hourly chime. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife thought if we weren't at the end of the world, you  
could sure see it from here,'' says Tom Hilton, a timber buyer who 
moved here years ago. ``But you couldn't get her to leave Jasper 
for nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This sleepy town of 8,000 burst into national prominence last  
summer with the horrific dragging death of a black man, followed by 
the arrests of three white men. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven months later, the tragedy lingers.  
</P>
<P>
	Today, lawyers begin their second week of trying to find 12  
people to judge 24-year-old John William King, the first suspect to 
go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	All the while, outside the historic Jasper County Courthouse,  
residents continue trying to move on with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really hesitate to say I'm from Jasper, at first, because  
everybody all over the world knows what Jasper is,'' says Hilton, 
shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
	To many, Jasper is this: 49-year-old James Byrd Jr., his right  
arm and head ripped from his torso. His knees, buttocks and elbows 
ground past skin and bone. His body parts and personal belongings -- 
even his dentures -- flung along a Jasper County road. 
</P>
<P>
	The details of how Byrd was dragged by his ankles for 2 1/2 miles  
horrified the nation, especially the locals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole thing is just a shock,'' says Hilton, among the 55  
percent of Jasper residents who are white. ``That's basically the 
consensus most people feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rarely a month has gone by without reporters from around the  
world coming to Jasper to take the emotional temperature of its 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Many shake their heads, their lips pinched in a tense smile,  
when asked for the hundredth time what they think and what they 
feel. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you ask the masses of the whites, yes, they want to see  
this pass over,'' says Bobby Hudson, a retired Air Force sergeant 
who moved here from Indianapolis with his wife in 1989. ``But for 
the most part, those people who are grounded and rooted in Jasper 
know and believe that Jasper is going to make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jasper, the so-called ``Jewel of the Forest,'' has a cozy,  
addictive charm about it. Folks here are close, and children are 
raised to say ``Sir'' or ``Ma'am'' when addressing adults. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 40-some churches to attend, fishing to be done at  
nearby Lake Sam Rayburn, duck and deer hunting, Kiwanis and Lions 
Club projects, the Chamber of Commerce meetings and even the annual 
rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
	Many residents work in the lumber industry, at a smattering of  
small state prisons or at local hospitals, banks, stores and 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the town is mostly white, skin color is not an  
obstacle. The mayor is black, as are a hospital administrator and 
many business owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, life isn't all harmonious, says Hudson, minister of the  
Goodwill Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do we have racism? Yes. But you know what? That doesn't bother  
me,'' says Hudson, 65, who is white. ``You deal with racism the 
same way you deal with any kind of problem. You mind your own 
business, do what you're supposed to do and give the rest of it to 
God. He's our protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``In other words, treat others the way you want to be treated,''  
he insists. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony in King's trial is expected to begin Feb. 16. If  
convicted of capital murder, he could be sentenced to life in 
prison or lethal injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Trials for the other two defendants -- Shawn Allen Berry and  
Lawrence Russell Brewer -- will follow. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Jasper will hold its collective breath and wait  
for the day when life can return to normal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer it takes to get over,'' says Hudson, ``the longer  
we're going to be on pins and needles.''

<HEADLINE>  Tech Titans Speak at World Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- The heads of high-tech titans  
Microsoft and Dell said today that distributors and dealers face a 
stiff challenge from trade over the Internet but that traditional 
business shouldn't feel too threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft chairman Bill Gates told the World Economic Forum that  
he saw the biggest potential for small companies to trade worldwide 
because they ``are able to offer their unique services through the 
Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Dell, chief executive of the world's biggest direct  
seller of personal computers, Dell Computer Corp., called the 
Internet ``a turbocharger for our success in our business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The companies which use a series of distributors or dealers  
are challenged by this,'' Dell told industry and political 
heavyweights at this annual economic gathering. 
</P>
<P>
	But Scott McNealy, chief executive of leading computer systems  
maker Sun Microsystems Inc., said companies should focus on their 
products rather than Internet-based business itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a hard time with the concept of a virtual corporation  
because it might lead to virtual profits,'' McNealy said. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. government report last week said 52,000 Americans log on  
to the Internet for the first time every day. Companies across the 
economy are exploring sales and marketing on the Internet of 
products from flowers to plane tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cost of comparison shopping has gone to zero -- that is a  
huge, huge win,'' said McNealy. 
</P>
<P>
	The process ``sets up some winners and losers,'' he added. ``I'd  
rather bet on Ford long-term than the dealer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On-line commerce will make recognized brand names even more  
valuable, McNealy claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Martin, international president of the retail giant Wal-Mart  
Stores Inc., said Internet business is ``at the threshold'' of 
takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``I don't think that traditional business should be  
threatened by what's taking place,'' Martin said. ``We've 
established the brand, we've established the trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates said ``operating in a very digital way'' would be a key to  
global success in future. 
</P>
<P>
	McNealy said he primarily sees electronic commerce creating new  
opportunities -- not edging out existing business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly it's easy to get on line, but that doesn't mean that  
everyone who does it is going to do as well as companies which 
excel in that medium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters later, McNealy said the millennium bug  
could still create problems for the computer industry because Asia 
is ``disastrously behind'' in preparing for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Other regions are in ``pretty reasonable shape'' in stocking up  
on bug-free components, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates said the bug, ``although it's a terrible distraction, a  
terrible cost, and there will be some disruption,'' had helped push 
companies toward using more standardized software. 
</P>
<P>
	Some programs, especially older ones, may fail when the date  
changes to 2000. Because they were written to recognize only the 
last two digits of a year, they could read the digits ``00'' as 
1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder also was to speak at the  
forum, a day after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak called for a 
rethinking of the free-market approach and U.N. chief Kofi Annan 
urged business leaders to accept largely ignored U.N. labor and 
other human rights conventions.

<HEADLINE> Kwan, Weiss To Challenge Russians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Now that the Russians have  
conquered Europe, they can turn their attention to overcoming the 
rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, that appears to be only North Americans Michelle  
Kwan, Michael Weiss and Elvis Stojko. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Kwan and Weiss will compete in the U.S. championships next  
week, although Weiss has already qualified for the Grand Prix 
finals, which will be held the beginning of March. World champion 
Kwan is virtually certain to defend her title at the end of March 
in Helsinki, Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	Stojko, who missed part of the season because of an injury,  
forcing him to withdraw from the Grand Prix finals, captured the 
Canadian title over the weekend even though he fell in the short 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stojko, Weiss and Kwan will be outnumbered by the Russians,  
who took the top three spots in both men and women's event in the 
European competition along with capturing the ice dance and pairs 
event. It was the third consecutive year the Russians swept all 
four European titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Now come the Grand Prix finals, where Russians make up more than  
half the field. Additionally, they will have home-ice advantage. 
The event will be held in St. Petersburg, Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	No less than four Russian men will be in the Grand Prix finals,  
all with impressive credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Alexei Yagudin, who successfully defended his European title  
and is the current world champion. He retained his European title 
with an emotional routine in a winner-take-all free skate against 
his Russian teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Yevgeny Plushenko, who beat Yagudin twice earlier in January  
and completed the quadruple-triple combination at the Europeans, 
</P>
<P>
	-- Alexei Urmanov, the 1994 Olympic champion returning to top  
form who was leading the other two entering the European free 
skating final. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Alexander Abt, who has arguably the most difficult program  
attempted in men's competition, including a triple axel-triple loop 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
	All the Russians have done quads in competition and Weiss will  
have to nail his own -- he's come close on several occasions -- to be 
able to have a chance against the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan is not competing in the Grand Prix finals, choosing to pass  
up the six qualifying events leading up to it. 
</P>
<P>
	At worlds, she'll likely be facing Maria Butyrskaya, who looms  
to be Kwan's only threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Butyrskaya may have two advantages.  
</P>
<P>
	She has had to face top competition from her Russian teammates  
in every meet this year, including a tough Russian nationals where 
at least six top skaters vied for the three spots that were 
virtually certain to be the top three in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian field was so tough that Irina Slutskaya, the  
two-time European champion and silver medalist to Kwan, came in 
fourth at her nationals. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, Butyrskaya will have the advantage of passing  
through qualifying rounds that counted this year and affected other 
skaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Kwan has skated in preliminary rounds before, new ISU  
rules put a factor on this year's qualification, forcing the 
skaters to put more effort into them. 
</P>
<P>
	This took its toll on some skaters, noticeably Viktoria  
Volhkova, who came in third to Butyrskaya at the Europeans. In the 
finals, she was better than Butyrskaya for the first half of 
routine before tiring visibly and faltering. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya believes Kwan can be beaten.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I can compete with Michelle Kwan,'' Butyrskaya said.  
``Of course, she has developed a reputation as someone who is 
unbeatable. Actually, her elements aren't that strong. Her 
advantage is she skates cleanly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya cites her own improvement.  
</P>
<P>
	``For the last two years, I've been skating quite  
consistently,'' she said. ``Some become Olympic champion at 16, but 
to me success came later. I had to fight with myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only other threat to Russian domination may come from  
France. 
</P>
<P>
	French ice dancers Marina Anissina and Gwendel Peizerat are  
poised to upset the new European ice dancing champions Angelika 
Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian pairs skating got an unexpected boost at Europeans when  
a couple training together only since June, Maria Petrova and Alexi 
Tikhonov, won the event after teammates and current world champion 
Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze dropped out with the flu.

<HEADLINE> Nichols Wants Conviction Reversed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Terry Nichols has asked an appeals court to  
reverse his conviction in the Oklahoma City bombing, contending a 
judge erred by refusing to allow an FBI whistleblower to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Tigar, who represents Nichols, also contended Monday  
that U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch made a mistake by giving 
Nichols a life prison term based on sentencing guidelines for 
murder, instead of a lighter sentence based on guidelines for 
involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to honor what the jury did,'' Tigar told the  
three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
``Conspiracy has never been a predicate for felony murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Sean Connelly insisted Nichols received a fair trial  
and a just sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``He committed this nation's most deadly conspiracy. There was  
nothing unfair about that sentence,'' Connelly said before the 
courtroom audience that included bombing survivors and family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, which included judges from Wyoming, New Mexico and  
Colorado, took the arguments under advisement. A ruling is not 
expected for several months. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols, 43, a former Michigan farmer turned gun dealer, was  
convicted of involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy, but acquitted 
of murder in the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah 
Federal Building. The blast killed 168 people and injured hundreds 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had argued that Nichols helped Timothy McVeigh amass  
the ingredients for the bomb, finance their operations and stash a 
getaway car. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigar challenged Matsch's decision to deny FBI whistleblower  
Frederick Whitehurst an opportunity to testify about fertilizer 
crystals found on a piece of the truck used in the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigar said Whitehurst, then an FBI scientist, was prepared to  
offer new evidence questioning prosecutors' claims that fertilizer 
crystals found on the truck piece could have survived a night in 
the rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigar said Whitehurst was threatened with losing his job if he  
continued to help Nichols' attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Connelly denied the government tried to intimidate Whitehurst,  
noting Whitehurst had contacted Tigar and volunteered to testify on 
Nichols' behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't seem like he was intimidated,'' Judge John C.  
Porfilio told Connelly.

<HEADLINE> Personal Income and Spending Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans ended 1998 with a spending spree,  
giving the economy momentum as it entered the new year. But 
economists wonder how long consumers can sustain the breakneck 
pace. Their incomes grew strongly, but they spent every bit of the 
increase -- and more. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal income jumped 0.5 percent in December, the best gain in  
10 months, the Commerce Department said Monday. Spending surged an 
even stronger 0.8 percent, the most since May. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basic message is the consumer is still ready, willing and  
able to spend,'' said economist Robert Dederick of Northern Trust 
Co. in Chicago. ``There is nothing to suggest the consumer is 
beginning to turn tail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strong stock-market gains, low interest rates and robust  
inflation-adjusted wage gains are all supporting consumer spending, 
which accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fundamentals ... suggest continued gains,'' said economist  
Lynn Reaser of Nationsbank in Jacksonville, Fla. ``In addition, 
many individuals this spring will be receiving tax refunds, with 
the child and education tax credits'' effective for the first time 
for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But, because Americans spent more than they earned in December,  
their personal savings rate went negative -- to minus 0.1 percent -- 
for the second time last year. The measure of savings as a 
percentage of after-tax income has fluctuated around zero for four 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	And spending was bolstered in December by two factors that  
weren't helping in January: a last-minute surge in holiday shopping 
in response to discounts and very strong auto sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bad weather, less aggressive price discounting and a slowdown  
in employment growth point to slower consumer spending gains in 
January,'' said Kathleen Wylie of Scotiabank in Toronto. ``Further 
slowdowns are likely as the year progresses given the low savings 
rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Americans saved just 0.5 percent of their income,  
the least since 1933, compared with 2.1 percent in 1997 and 2.9 
percent in 1996. But, the figure is not as grim as it appears. 
</P>
<P>
	It reflects the fact that prosperous Americans spent a portion  
of their stock-market gains and tapped their home equity during a 
wave of refinancing spurred by the lowest mortgage rates since the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Income in 1998 rose a healthy 5 percent, the fourth consecutive  
year at or above that level, but still the smallest rise since 
1993. That included a 6.7 percent increase in wages and salaries -- 
the most-watched component of income -- and a 23.6 percent plunge in 
farm owners' income, reflecting the worldwide economic slump's 
impact on commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending jumped 5.7 percent, the largest gain since 1994. It was  
propelled by a 7.5 percent increase for big-ticket durable goods, 
as low interest rates fueled car sales and record home sales 
encouraged furniture and appliance purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report, the Commerce Department said construction  
spending surged 1.7 percent in December, the largest gain in six 
months, helped by unseasonably mild weather for much of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction spending for the year rose 6.3 percent to $657  
billion, following a 5.9 percent rise in 1997. The categories with 
the biggest gains included single-family homes, 13.9 percent; 
apartments, 8 percent; offices, 16.4 percent, and hotels and 
motels, 12.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, an index compiled by the National Association of  
Purchasing Management showed manufacturing declined for the eighth 
consecutive month in January, but at a slower rate than during the 
previous seven months. 
</P>
<P>
	Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the organization's survey committee,  
found ``signs of encouragement,'' including marked increases in 
both production and new orders.

<HEADLINE> Driver May Have Smuggled Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Four Chinese women and the man accused of  
trying to smuggle them into the United States were stopped at the 
Canadian border as the women clung to the underbody of a truck. 
</P>
<P>
	They were discovered Sunday in 16-degree cold when a U.S.  
Customs inspector spotted a piece of clothing hanging underneath 
the refrigerated fish truck during a routine check at a bridge, 
said Winston Barrus, deputy director of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	The women were wedged under the truck's carriage using a piece  
of plywood, Barrus said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing how death-defying this was,'' he said. ``Could  
you imagine actually riding under a vehicle like that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the women were unresponsive when they were freed. Barrus  
speculated that they suffered from the effects of fumes from the 
truck's exhaust or from exposure. They were taken to St. Mary's 
Hospital in Lewiston and released to INS custody. 
</P>
<P>
	``The customs inspector might have saved those women's lives,''  
Barrus said. ``It really shows what a callous disregard smugglers 
have for people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The names of the five were not immediately released.  
</P>
<P>
	The truck driver faces smuggling charges. The women, who were  
believed to have recently arrived in Canada from China, face 
charges of attempted illegal entry.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Tobacco Decision Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A Florida appeals court has overturned  
a landmark $1 million award to the family of a smoker who died of 
lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, a Jacksonville jury ordered Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco  
Corp. to pay the family of Roland Maddox $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unsigned one-paragraph order, the appellate court on  
Friday vacated the award and ordered the case transferred to either 
Palm Beach County or Broward County in south Florida and not 
Jacksonville, some 275 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court did not explain its decision. But two months  
after the $1 million award, it said the case should have been tried 
in south Florida, near Maddox's hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, a trial judge in Jacksonville refused to overturn  
the award but transferred the case to a Palm Beach County court for 
any further legal issues. Brown &AMP; Williamson appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	The award was the first time punitive damages were awarded in a  
tobacco liability case and the third time a jury awarded 
compensatory damages. The first two cases also were overturned on 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for the tobacco company said he believed there were  
numerous errors in the original trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is now clear that the trial should never have occurred in  
Jacksonville,'' Thomas Riley said in a statement released by Brown 
&AMP; Williamson. He predicted that court decisions since then would 
ensure a fair trial ``if this suit is ever retried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney in the office of Jacksonville lawyer Norwood  
``Woody'' Wilner, who represented Maddox's family, said there was a 
question of the appeals court's jurisdiction to decide the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are likely to appeal, but it is a client's decision,''  
Stephanie Hartley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilner was the only apparent connection the case had to  
Jacksonville. Maddox was from Palm Beach County. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddox died at age 67 after 50 years of smoking two packs of  
Lucky Strikes a day. He quit smoking in 1995, was diagnosed with 
lung cancer in the fall of 1996 and died a year later.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sends Budget to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton sent Congress a $1.77  
trillion spending plan today for 2000, beginning a new century with 
record budget surpluses that he would use to shore up Social 
Security and shower billions in new spending on favored initiatives 
from education and the environment to child care and the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Proclaiming his budget marks a ``new era of opportunity,''  
Clinton's blueprint proposes increasing spending for the fiscal 
year that begins next Oct. 1 by 2.3 percent. Even with the $39 
billion increase over the current year, Clinton's budget projects a 
record $117 billion surplus, thanks to a booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Clinton's spending plan forecasts $2.41 trillion in  
surpluses over the next decade, laying out a vision of a budget 
landscape the country has not known in 70 years, before the Great 
Depression, World War II and the Cold War put the United States 
into a rut of chronic deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this budget, our fiscal house is in order, our spirit  
strong and our resources prepare us to meet the challenges of the 
next century,'' Clinton proclaimed in a budget message at the front 
of a massive five-volume set of documents, which this year have a 
black and white to mark the new era of projected surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's unveiling of his budget was the opening shot in what  
is expected to be a bitter struggle with the Republican-controlled 
Congress over government priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have put tax relief at center stage of their agenda  
after protecting Social Security. They are seeking an 
across-the-board 10 percent cut in income tax rates, returning at 
least $600 billion to taxpayers over the next decade. That, they 
say, is critical to keep the Democrats from creating new spending 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question that this document is the rebirth of big  
government,'' Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, 
R-N.M., said of Clinton's spending blueprint. ``The president can't 
resist a program for every problem.''

<HEADLINE> Men Accused of Selling Phony Clubs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Federal agents on Monday arrested six golf  
club distributors and four manufacturers who allegedly sold 
millions of dollars in counterfeit golf equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests by U.S. Customs Service agents in Orlando, Atlanta,  
Houston and Savannah, Ga., followed an undercover investigation, 
dubbed ``Project Teed Off,'' in which agents posed as importers for 
two major counterfeit golf club manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents made 303 seizures of phony golf equipment worth $6  
million during the two-year investigation, which was initiated at 
the request of the golf equipment industry. The arrests were timed 
to coincide with the Professional Golf Association's Merchandise 
Show being held this week in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were aware of a counterfeiting problem in the golfing  
industry and we attempted to infiltrate the underground, the 
counterfeit component,'' said Agent Joe Henderson, agent in charge 
of the agency's Orlando office. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation focused on fake U.S. brand-name golf equipment  
made in Taiwan, China, Vietnam and Thailand. Investigators said the 
majority of counterfeit golf club parts in the United States are 
imported into the country, sold to a group of distributors and 
resold to retailers. Some distributors also had their own retail 
outlets and some of the sales were made by mail orders or over the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The counterfeit golf clubs were sold for a third of the price of  
the real product, agents said. 
</P>
<P>
	The distributors arrested were Andrew Lee and Oscar Gonzales in  
Houston; Mike Cohen and Rob Isola in Savannah, Ga.; and Albert and 
Angie Chung in Atlanta. Two distributors in Los Angeles were still 
at large. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturers arrested in Orlando were Midi Liu, owner of  
Tourney Golf in Taiwan; Ben Liao, and his brother David, whose 
father owns Join Wee International, a Taiwanese golf manufacturer; 
and Stephen Cheng, of Los Angeles. Cheng was released on a $50,000 
bond, Henderson said. The three others were being held in federal 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents also executed search warrants Monday in Orlando, Tampa,  
Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles and Philadelphia in search of 
additional phony golf equipment.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T, Time Warner Strike Phone Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. extended its push to provide one-stop  
shopping for TV, telephone and Internet service Monday, announcing 
a deal to use Time Warner Inc. cable TV wires in a partnership that 
could mean huge savings for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pledging to charge at least 20 percent less than competitors,  
the companies said they would offer local and long-distance 
calling, TV programming and high-speed Internet access via Time 
Warner's cable systems in 33 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined with earlier moves -- notably last year's purchase of  
cable TV company Tele-Communications Inc. -- Monday's deal will 
allow AT&AMP;T to offer these services to 42.7 million homes within 
five years, the companies said. That's about 42 percent of U.S. 
households. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal follows a series of smaller alliances with cable  
companies announced last month by AT&AMP;T and marks the most pivotal 
step in its return to local phone service since the agreement to 
buy TCI. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T left the local calling business in 1984 when it was split  
up by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said it is talking with other cable companies about deals,  
but declined to elaborate. The company hopes increase its potential 
customer base to 60 percent of the nation's homes by late spring, 
said TCI President Leo Hindery Jr., who will head all of AT&AMP;T's 
cable service operations. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 25 percent of those households are expected to sign up  
within six years, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies wouldn't give specifics about what they plan to  
charge for the new services, except to say the savings would be 
considerable. 
</P>
<P>
	For Time Warner, a joint venture with AT&AMP;T adds a credible  
partner in a battle to win customers away from deeply entrenched 
local phone monopolies. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a perception problem. Customers don't perceive cable  
as being reliable as local telephone service from a local telephone 
company,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, an Atlanta-based industry analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``Customers expect cable outages a few hours a month, which is  
aggravating, but that's only TV. Customers wouldn't put up with 
telephone service being out a few hours a month. That perception 
will change over time,'' said Kagan, asserting that cable telephone 
service ``is going to be a lot more popular in the future than it 
will be in next couple of years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T and Time Warner said they will test the television and  
telephone services in one or two cities by the end of 1999 and 
expand the venture next year. AT&AMP;T has already begun a pilot 
program through a TCI cable system in Fremont, Calif., and plans to 
begin 10 others with TCI later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot programs will be used to determine which combinations  
of services -- including AT&AMP;T's and Time Warner's competing Internet 
access businesses -- are most popular, said Time Warner chairman and 
chief executive Gerald M. Levin. 
</P>
<P>
	``The principal of this joint venture is to find out in the  
market place what type of packaging makes sense,'' said Levin. 
</P>
<P>
	While AT&AMP;T's foray into cable telephone services has been the  
most ambitious in the industry, it will face some major competitors 
in the rapid convergence of voice, data and video technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	Big cable companies such as Cox Communications are also starting  
to offer local phone service over their cable lines. Satellite 
television companies such as DirecTV are partnering with regional 
phone companies to provide a bundle of similar services. Meanwhile, 
many high-tech companies are developing technologies to offer phone 
service over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of the companies were mixed on the news. AT&AMP;T gained  
$2.81 1/4 to $93.56 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. Time Warner 
initially rose, but finished 18 3/4 cents lower at $62.31 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T will own slightly more than three-quarters of the joint  
venture and Time Warner the rest. AT&AMP;T estimates it will spend $600 
million on the venture in the first two years. In addition, it will 
spend between $300 and $500 to equip each home to handle telephone 
services over cable lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner will get monthly fees from the venture ranging from  
$1.50 to $6 per home over six years. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies expect the arrangement to generate annual sales of  
$4 billion after three years. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has been spending furiously to break into the $110 billion  
local phone market, while its share of the long-distance business 
is slipping to rivals like MCI Worldcom and Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the acquisition of TCI, the nation's  
second-largest cable company, AT&AMP;T spent $11.3 billion last year on 
Teleport Communications, a smaller local phone company.

<P>
	ENCINITAS, Calif. (AP) -- Two Marines were killed and a third was  
critically injured Sunday when their car slammed into a highway 
divider and landed upside down. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1987 Mazda RX-7 was traveling north on Interstate 5 when it  
veered across all four northbound lanes and landed in a ditch, said 
California Highway Patrol dispatcher Alethia Alonzo. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, Raul Rodolfo Ruiz, 21, was found dead hanging by his  
seatbelt; a backseat passenger, Miguel Ramirez Sanchez, 21, was 
killed after being ejected through the rear hatch window, Ms. 
Alonzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the crash was not immediately known, but  
investigators did not believe alcohol was involved, Ms. Alonzo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Theus, 20, the front-seat passenger, was in critical  
condition at Scripps Memorial Hospital, a nursing supervisor said.

<HEADLINE> Broncos: We Got Everyone's Best Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- If ever a team won by losing, it was this season's  
Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Shanahan said just about as much on Monday, the day  
after the Broncos won their second straight Super Bowl, beating the 
Atlanta Falcons 34-19. 
</P>
<P>
	``After winning last year, we were going to get everyone's best  
shot,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout the whole year, that's how our team played. The  
only time we didn't play at that level was when we ... played the 
Giants and Miami. We didn't play at the level we were capable of 
playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants and Miami handed the Broncos their only losses during  
a 17-2 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Those defeats came after two mediocre wins against San Diego and  
Kansas City that improved the team's record to 13-0, three games 
short of becoming the first team to finish the regular season 
unbeaten since the 1972 Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	It was clear at the time that the pressure was building on a  
team that otherwise could have cruised into the playoff with the 
home field and a perfect record. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the Broncos lost 20-16 on the road to the Giants and  
31-21 eight days later in Pro Player Stadium -- where they beat the 
Falcons on Sunday night -- they were relieved of the burden of 
making NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	When they got another shot at Miami at home 19 days later in  
their first playoff game, they were ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we didn't play great in that game, I would have been the  
most surprised guy in the world,'' Shanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	They did, winning 38-3, then beating the New York Jets 23-10 in  
the AFC championship game before going on to Sunday's victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Broncos will try to become the first team to win three  
straight Super Bowls. Their chances should become clearer in the 
spring when John Elway decides whether to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, who won the game's MVP award by completing 18 of 29  
passes for 336 yards, almost retired before this season and said 
again in December that he would finally step down. He emphasized 
that with a victory lap after the AFC title game in what was 
presumed to be his final game at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	But after Sunday's game, he wasn't so sure, as teammates  
implored him to stick around one more season. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he said what he said at this time last year -- that  
he'd talk with his wife, children, parents and friends before 
making a final decision. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to decide by April so Shanahan and the Broncos will  
know if they'll have to run a quarterback competition in camp among 
veteran Bubby Brister, who was 4-0 in starts last season and won 
two other games off the bench, and two youngsters -- Jeff Lewis and 
Brian Griese. 
</P>
<P>
	``At 38 years old in the twilight of my career, I tend to favor  
the now and not tomorrow,'' he said. ``I don't want to walk away 
too late. But I also know by the way I played last night that I can 
still play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan, meanwhile, was engaging in a little wistful thinking.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've got a good shot,'' he said. ``We have our  
nucleus coming back next season. That certainly can't hurt us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Especially if that nucleus includes John Elway.

<HEADLINE> Seven Rare California Condors Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIG SUR, Calif. (AP) -- Born and bred in captivity, seven of the  
rarest birds on earth tentatively stretched their wings and soared 
to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	The California condors were released Saturday from a foggy  
Monterey County mountaintop some 2,500 feet above the Big Sur 
coast, joining 49 other condors now living in the wild in 
California and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	California condors, among the most ancient of North America's  
birds, were nearly shot, poisoned and electrocuted into extinction 
until biologists launched a controversial $1 million recovery 
program in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	They trapped all 22 surviving wild condors and brought them into  
zoos, setting their offspring free in California and Arizona. About 
100 still are in zoos, said Sal Lucido, president of the Ventana 
Wildnerness Society, which helped release the birds. 
</P>
<P>
	At nine months, the young condors are put into a wire netting  
enclosure on the ridgetop to acclimate for a few weeks. On Friday, 
scientists laid out a stillborn calf as a first meal, and the net 
was opened Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The first to take flight was a 10-month-old male known as No.  
94, who hopped onto a rocky ridge and then haltingly flew a few 
dozen yards. He was soon soaring, and was joined by the rest of the 
birds, one by one. 
</P>
<P>
	``There they go!'' said naturalist Kelly Sorenson, watching from  
a nearby ridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Transmitters attached to the condors' wings let scientists  
monitor their whereabouts for a few years. They will continue to 
leave the birds food. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven birds released a year ago have thrived and are roosting in  
a redwood grove near the Big Sur Lodge, scientists said. They are 
waiting to see if the birds will successfully reproduce in the wild 
when they reach adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
	California condors, whose wings span a majestic 11 feet, are an  
ancient breed. Fossils suggest a condor-like bird existed more than 
60 million years ago in what is now Wyoming, and by the time 
Europeans landed in North America, the bird had made its home 
everywhere from Texas to British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	But then came the Gold Rush of 1849. Miners discovered that  
condor quills -- light, hollow and nearly half an inch in diameter -- 
were ideal containers for gold dust. 
</P>
<P>
	The birds also were shot because they preyed on hunters' kills,  
and still more died from lead poisoning and high-tension electrical 
wires. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1924, there were no wild condors left outside California, the  
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said. It was named an endangered 
species in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am optimistic about the condor,'' Lucido said. ``So far,  
we've had only five years to recover a species that we've used and 
abused for 400 years. ... But this is not the end for the condor, 
this is the beginning.''

<HEADLINE> China Loans To Hurt Hong Kong Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Bad loans in China have clouded Hong Kong's  
banking industry, and the troubles that rattled the bankers are 
about to show up on the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the territory's banks will write off millions in  
non-performing loans as they release 1998 results, beginning this 
week, analysts said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The focal point of the mess has been Guangdong International  
Trust and Investment Corp., the lending arm of China's wealthiest 
province. The trust, known as ``Gitic,'' was declared bankrupt last 
month with debts of $4.3 billion and assets of just $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Several banks say they are taking provisions against unsecured  
Gitic loans. Some analysts fear Gitic was just the tip of the 
iceberg in a financial mess that will hurt commercial banks who 
lent money to other provincial and municipal lending trusts in 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust problems ``will not be the last of the China-related  
issues to plague Hong Kong banks' credit quality,'' the investment 
bank Lehman Brothers predicted Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	HSBC Holdings PLC, which controls Hong Kong's largest bank, has  
an estimated $321 million of loans to Gitic out of a total of $654 
million in Chinese investment trust loans, Lehman Brothers said. 
</P>
<P>
	HSBC and its affiliate, Hang Seng Bank, have stayed quiet on the  
extent of their problems. A spokesman said the bank will disclose 
how it will cover its bad Gitic loans when it announces its results 
on Feb. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Some smaller banks have already confirmed they are writing off  
loans they can't recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of East Asia, or BEA; International Bank of Asia, or IBA;  
and the smaller Dao Heng Bank have indicated they will take full 
provisions for their unsecured Gitic loans, which analysts estimate 
totaling at least $81 million. 
</P>
<P>
	BEA, which will release its results Tuesday, is likely to be the  
hardest hit of those three, said Haydn Meadows, Asian banking 
analyst for the investment bank BNP Prime Peregrine. Meadows 
estimated Gitic provisions will contribute to an estimated 63 
percent drop in BEA profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the debt worries, some banks are pulling credit lines for  
fear their Chinese clients are too risky. With less hard currency 
flowing into the system, repayments from some trusts could become 
more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody knows how bad the credit crunch will get,'' Meadows  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems at Gitic shook investor confidence in the trusts  
that were set up by provincial Chinese governments to finance 
infrastructure projects, many of them ill-advised developments that 
reflected the desires of provincial Chinese leaders more than good 
investment strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	The crisis has hurt even those companies which claim to be  
financially sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign banks have cut credit lines worth $100 million to Fujian  
International Trust and Investment Corp., known as Fitic, drawing 
strong criticism from its officials, London's daily Financial Times 
reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gitic was a special case. We are a normal case,'' Xin Shimin,  
vice chairman of Fitic, was quoted as saying. ``Fitic will 
definitely not be closed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the municipal Guangzhou International Trust and  
Investment Corp. appears on the verge of bankruptcy and officials 
said they might let it go under rather than pumping in any cash. 
And at least six state companies in southern China have missed 
repayment of domestic bonds.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks China Spying Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has ordered a formal  
assessment of possible damage to U.S. national security after a 
congressional panel concluded that America's interests were harmed 
by China's military espionage, an administration official said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take it very seriously,'' National Security Council  
spokesman David Leavy said. ``And we're going to conduct a formal 
damage assessment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the administration had not embraced the committee's  
conclusion that U.S. interests were harmed. Instead, he said, 
``We're reviewing the information that was gathered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We take this issue very seriously and we are organizing an  
interagency team including nuclear weapons and counterintelligence 
experts to conduct a formal damage assessment, which will be 
reviewed by a panel of independent experts,'' Leavy said. He said 
the panel would report its findings to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's action came in response to a study conducted by a  
special House committee investigating military and commercial deals 
with China. The panel, headed by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., 
concluded late last year that China has been pursuing U.S. military 
information aggressively for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's investigation began with an inquiry into the  
administration's satellite export dealings with China but looked 
beyond those transactions to Republican and Democratic 
administrations over the last two decades. In releasing the report, 
Cox had said that, ``Based on unclassified information, we have 
found that nation security harm did occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox said transfers from the United States to China were not  
limited to satellite and missile technology, ``but cover militarily 
significant technology.'' The committee, five Republicans and four 
Democrats, adopted the report without dissent. 
</P>
<P>
	China has dismissed the allegations as ``groundless and  
irresponsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration generally accepted the panel's  
recommendations, Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president agreed with the broad conclusions and  
recommendations of the (Cox) report and accepted in the bipartisan 
fashion in which it was offered to move forward on a comprehensive 
approach to maintain effective export controls and protection to 
U.S. exports worldwide,'' Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House committee made more than three dozen recommendations  
for legislation and executive action to remedy the problem. Leavy 
said, ``In this regard, we support and agree with the majority of 
the committee's recommendations.'' Many of them already are being 
implemented, he said.

<HEADLINE> Rohm-Haas Buying Morton Salt Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chemical manufacturing giant Rohm and Haas is  
buying Morton International Inc., best known for its salt, for $4.6 
billion in cash and stock in a deal creating a world leader in 
specialty chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction announced today creates a global specialty  
chemicals company with combined annual revenues of $6.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Morton acquisition comes just more than a month after Rohm  
and Haas agreed to acquire LeaRonal, a maker of plastic additives 
and electronic and agricultural chemicals, for $460 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia-based Rohm and Hass will also assume $268 million  
of Morton's debt as part of the latest deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rohm and Haas, with $4 billion in annual sales, makes chemicals  
found in such products as decorative and industrial paints, 
semiconductors and shampoos. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago-based Morton, whose products also include adhesives,  
dyes and electronic materials, had total annual sales of $2.5 
billion for the fiscal year that ended June 30, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``The marriage of Morton's highly respected applications  
expertise with our technology strengths will provide customers 
unsurpassed value,'' said J. Lawrence Wilson, chairman and chief 
executive of Rohm and Haas. 
</P>
<P>
	S. Jay Stewart, Morton's chairman and chief executive, said the  
deal gives Morton greater resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the agreement, Rohm and Haas will begin a cash  
tender offer for up to 67 percent of Morton's common stock at 
$37.12 a share. Based on Morton's closing price of $25.87 on 
Friday, this represents a premium of 43 percent, the companies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rohm and Haas will acquire the remaining Morton shares in a  
``second-step merger'' in which each share of Morton will be 
exchanged for Rohm and Haas shares valued at $37.12. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson will remain chairman and chief executive officer of Rohm  
and Haas and Stewart will become a vice chairman of Rohm and Haas 
and will join the board of directors. Two members of Morton's board 
will join Stewart on the Rohm and Haas board.

<HEADLINE> Report Card in on Gov't Agencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The future of Social Security may be in peril  
but in its day-to-day operations -- getting the correct checks in 
the mail on time -- its managers get top grades, a report released 
Monday said. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, the Federal Aviation Administration which runs the  
air traffic control system, and the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service, which patrols the nation's borders, get much lower 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	The conclusions are part of the first government-rating survey  
by the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse 
University. It analyzed and ranked 15 federal agencies and all 50 
states with the help of a $2.5 million, four-year grant from the 
Pew Charitable Trusts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Government Performance Project gave four states top grades --  
Missouri, Utah, Virginia and Washington. Virginia emerged as the 
top-ranked state with a composite grade of A-. 
</P>
<P>
	The study concluded that strong leadership still works to  
``transform government from a creaky engine to a well-oiled 
machine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report said some of the federal agencies it surveyed have  
turned failure into success, such as the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. FEMA transformed itself from ``an impediment to 
disaster relief to a first-class customer-focused organization,'' 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Veterans Health Administration, it said, has improved care  
for veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Social Security Administration is at the vanguard, the  
report said. It cited a $1 billion project ``to speed data 
retrieval and processing of the 860 million payments it makes each 
year.'' President Clinton recently announced the agency has 
completed all work to fix the year 2000 computer problem and 
guarantee that checks are mailed on time. 
</P>
<P>
	The study gave the agency an overall grade of A, with high marks  
for financial management, information technology, and managing 
human resources. 
</P>
<P>
	These are the survey's grades for all 15 agencies: Social  
Security Administration, A; Food and Nutrition Service, B; Food and 
Drug Administration, B; Federal Emergency Management Agency, B; 
Food Safety and Inspection Service, B; Veterans Health 
Administration, B; Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 
B-; Patent and Trademark Office, B-; Environmental Protection 
Agency, B-; Federal Housing Administration, B-; Internal Revenue 
Service, C; U.S. Customs Service, C; Health Care Financing 
Administration, C; Federal Aviation Administration, C; and the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service, C-.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Down at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese share prices sank Tuesday amid concerns  
about rising long-term interest rates. The dollar was slightly 
lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average shed 95.10 points, or 0.66 percent, to  
close the morning session at 14,370.08. On Monday, the average 
closed down 34.07 points, or 0.23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.04 yen in early trading, down 0.44 yen  
from late Monday in Tokyo and marginally lower than its level of 
115.08 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, stocks started lower amid worries about  
rising interest rates following a fall in bond prices as well the 
yen's strength earlier in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharply surging interest rates are seen as bearish for the stock  
market because they could hurt companies through such factors as 
lower export-related earnings from a stronger yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said  
Tuesday that the government would let the market decide interest 
rates, but would watch closely if moves are sharp. 
</P>
<P>
	``If moves are abnormal, we will be cautious, but if not, we  
will leave it up to the market,'' Miyazawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Growing skepticism about a government proposal to set up a body  
to absorb dumped stocks also weighed on the market, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has been considering making  
Japan Securities Finance Co. and two other firms buy stocks from 
companies that unwind cross-shareholdings, or chunks of shares held 
in other companies to cement business relationships. 
</P>
<P>
	But Taichi Sakaiya, head of the Economic Planning Agency, said  
Tuesday the government isn't discussing such a plan. Finance 
Minister Miyazawa also said that it's premature for the government 
to propose such schemes. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section lost 3.40 points, or 0.30 percent to 1,115.97. The 
TOPIX closed down 5.89 points, or 0.52 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the yen was slightly higher against the  
dollar at midday, but analysts said the U.S. currency was gaining 
strength as overseas funds bought the dollar to adjust positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was traded at 130.20 yen, up from 131.14 yen  
late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 2.100  
percent from 2.035 percent, driving its price down to 97.65 yen 
from 98.15 yen.

<HEADLINE> Fox Nearly Misses Big Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It was the biggest play of the game and viewers almost didn't  
get to see it. 
</P>
<P>
	A technical difficulty nearly caused Fox to miss John Elway's  
80-yard second-quarter touchdown pass to Rod Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The network was three seconds tardy going into a commercial  
after Morten Andersen's missed field goal. That resulted in 
resuming game coverage after Elway already had the ball in his 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We almost didn't get back in time,'' said Fox play-by-play  
announcer Pat Summerall. ``Atlanta didn't get back in time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith ran by Atlanta safety Eugene Robinson on the play, giving  
Denver a 17-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's literally billions of dollars of technical equipment  
here and everything doesn't go perfect,'' Fox spokesman Vince 
Wladika said. ``Pat did an excellent job of recovering and we 
didn't miss the play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The broadcasting duo of Summerall and analyst John Madden,  
working their seventh Super Bowl together, had more good moments 
than bad. 
</P>
<P>
	Madden was on the mark when he said the Falcons should take the  
``automatic'' field goal from Morten Andersen instead of going for 
it on fourth-and-1 from the Denver 26 early in the second quarter. 
Atlanta gave the ball to Jamal Anderson, who was stopped for a 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Madden also mentioned that the loss of Shannon Sharpe wouldn't  
affect Elway as much as losing a top target would hurt most 
quarterbacks. Third-string tight end Byron Chamberlain caught a 
pair of key passes early in the second quarter, and both Smith and 
Ed McCaffrey had big games. 
</P>
<P>
	Andersen, however, was far from automatic and he proved that  
later in the first half when he shanked a 26-yarder that would have 
cut the Atlanta deficit to 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Producer Bob Stenner and director Sandy Grossman did a solid job  
of using their record-31 cameras for the telecast, although there 
were no controversial calls in which a replay was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those cameras was certain to catch Elway as he jogged off  
the field for what could be the final time. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Madden nor Summerall, who announced that Elway was the  
Super Bowl MVP with about one minute left, believe that Elway will 
return in an attempt to win a third ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Elway can be the most valuable player for a lot of  
years,'' Madden said. ``He's going to miss the competition and 
playing the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know,'' Elway told Fox's Terry Bradshaw immediately  
after the game about his future. ``This definitely throws a kink in 
it ... I'm going to take some time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway may be leaving, but Jerry Seinfeld returned to television  
-- in a commercial, of course. 
</P>
<P>
	The game commercials, which cost advertisers $1.6 million for a  
30-second spot, were somewhat of a disappointment. Seinfield's 
anticipated American Express commercial aired during the third 
quarter and Victoria's Secret made its Super Bowl debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Thankfully, the game went by much quicker than the seven-plus  
hour pregame show, which moved about as fast as William ``The 
Refrigerator'' Perry. 
</P>
<P>
	The festivities began at 11 a.m. EST with the kickoff show and  
the preliminary action lasting until Jason Elam's kickoff at 6:27 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson took some of the focus off the game after being charged  
with soliciting an undercover police officer for oral sex, but Fox 
did a good job not to overdo it. While Howie Long tried to defend 
Robinson and his character, Terry Bradshaw disagreed, saying, ``How 
stupid, how stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was even less discussion of Robinson's incident during the  
game. 
</P>
<P>
	The top segment of the afternoon belonged to Bradshaw, who went  
to Texas to speak to Hollywood Henderson, the former Dallas 
linebacker who 20 years ago said that Bradshaw couldn't spell 
``cat'' even if spotted two letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Their reunion was both informative, humorous and heartfelt.  
</P>
<P>
	``I could spell `cat,''' Bradshaw laughed. ``I don't care what  
you spotted me.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Blocks Internet Porn Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A federal judge issued a preliminary  
injunction Monday to continue blocking a federal law aimed at 
shielding children from online pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Lowell A. Reed said the Child Online  
Protection Act could have the effect of hindering constitutionally 
protected speech and issued a preliminary injunction that shields 
Web site operators from prosecution. The judge had issued a 
temporary restraining order in the fall that expired Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps we do the minors of this country harm if First  
Amendment protections, which they will with age inherit fully, are 
chipped away in the name of their protection,'' Reed wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit against the law on  
behalf of 17 clients. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrilled that the judge has realized at this stage that  
our clients have some very credible fears,'' ACLU spokeswoman Emily 
Whitfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers must decide whether to appeal the  
preliminary injunction, ask for a full-blown trial or agree to 
allow Reed's decision to become permanent. Department spokeswoman 
Chris Watney would only say that the department will review the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the bill's sponsors, Rep. James Greenwood, R-Pa., said he  
hopes the law will eventually be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still hope to prevail in the Appeals Court, but if not, we  
will continue to revise this legislation until it passes 
constitutional muster,'' Greenwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, the second major effort by Congress to protect children  
on the Internet, would require commercial Web sites to collect a 
credit card number or some other access code as proof of age before 
allowing Internet users to view online material ``harmful to 
minors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Violators would face penalties of up to six months in jail and  
$150,000 per day in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the measure is a sensible way to keep Internet  
pornography away from children. Unlike the Communications Decency 
Act of 1996, which the Supreme Court struck down, the new law 
applies only to commercial Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed had temporarily blocked enforcement of the law in November.  
In a hearing before Reed last week, the Justice Department argued 
that the law would act as a ``brown paper wrapper'' protecting 
children from pornographic material. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also maintained that requiring Web sites to  
install checkpoint areas in front of pornographic material would be 
easy and inexpensive and would not hurt their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU argued that the law, signed by President Clinton in  
October, violates the First Amendment's free speech guarantee and 
could be used to unfairly prosecute gays and lesbians, AIDS 
activists or doctors distributing gynecological information. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU also says checkpoints could be costly and would deter  
people from visiting affected Web sites, putting some out of 
business.

<HEADLINE> Watergate-Inspired Play Premiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A year ago, after watching President Clinton deny  
he had sex with ``that woman, Miss Lewinsky,'' Rob Bundy couldn't 
help but equate the budding scandal to Shakespeare's tragic heroes, 
such as Lear, Macbeth and Richard III. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet when Bundy, the artistic director of Stages Repertory  
Theater in Houston, was putting together the 1998-99 season, he 
scheduled a play about another tragic leader, one whose downfall 
hit closer to home: Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
	The playhouse's production of ``Nixon's Nixon'' -- a fictitious  
look at Nixon's last night in the White House -- opened last week, 
smack in the midst of Clinton's impeachment trial. The play is 
scheduled to run through Feb. 14, while Senate leaders hope their 
work will be done by Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to say it was really lucky timing,'' Bundy said. ``I  
picked the play for this season because of the Clinton situation, 
but I had no idea I'd hit the mark on the bull's-eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bundy actually was a bit concerned that playwright Russell Lees'  
1996 work might hit too close to home. After all, people often look 
to theater as a way to escape their daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little afraid that, because we were so right on  
target, the public would say, `I'm tired of this. I don't want to 
think of another president falling from grace,''' Bundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	That hasn't been the case. Bundy said attendance has increased  
over the play's first week and the theater's phone is ``ringing off 
the wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one-act play is Lees' version of what might have happened  
during a secret White House meeting between Nixon and Secretary of 
State Henry Kissinger the night of Aug. 7, 1974, in the hours 
before the president resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	The play debuted off-Broadway to rave reviews. It has since  
moved to several playhouses across the country, including the 
170-seat Stages and the 218-seat Round House Theater outside 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Whiddon, artistic director of the Silver Springs, Md.,  
theater, shared some of Bundy's doubts about audience reaction. 
He'll find out next month as his theater's run of ``Nixon's Nixon'' 
begins March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wondered if, No. 1, being inside the Beltway, so to speak,  
and No. 2, this budding scandal, were going to dampen some of the 
satiric edge of the play,'' Whiddon said. ``We decided the play 
stood on its own as a biting satirical view of the presidency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a showing of the Stages production, theatergoers often  
could be seen nodding and prodding each other with knowing looks 
when moments in the play paralleled the Clinton saga. 
</P>
<P>
	A slight rumble rolled across the audience when Nixon furiously  
concocting a military conflict to save his skin. Clinton came under 
fire last year for his timing of attacks on Sudan and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	``A good play reverberates beyond the confines of its plot,''  
Bundy said. ``To me, that's what really good theater is.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Sends Budget to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton sent Congress a $1.77  
trillion spending plan today for 2000, beginning a new century with 
record budget surpluses that he would use to shore up Social 
Security and shower billions in new spending on programs from child 
care to the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	The release of Clinton's budget is the opening shot in what's  
sure to be a bitter struggle with the Republican-controlled 
Congress. While agreeing with Clinton's goal of strengthening 
Social Security, the GOP prefers using the bulk of the remaining 
federal surpluses for across-the-board tax cuts. Republicans 
accused Clinton of reverting to spendthrift liberal ways. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, proclaiming his budget marks a ``new era of  
opportunity,'' proposes increasing spending by 2.3 percent for the 
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Even with the $39 billion increase 
over this year, Clinton's budget projects a record $117 billion 
surplus, thanks to the booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton forecasts $2.41 trillion in surpluses over the next  
decade, laying out a vision of plenty the country has not known in 
70 years, before the Great Depression, World War II and the Cold 
War put the United States into the rut of chronic deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year for the first time in three decades, we turned red  
ink to black,'' Clinton said at a budget kickoff pep rally at the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a rare opportunity that comes along once in a blue  
moon to any group of Americans,'' Clinton said, urging Congress to 
use the coming windfalls to pay down the national debt as part of 
his plan to shore up Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort would have an enormous payoff, Clinton said, driving  
the national debt held by the public to its lowest level since 1917 
and reducing the interest payment on that debt to just 2 cents of 
every budget $1. Now, interest payments account for 11 cents of 
every $1. 
</P>
<P>
	But private economists warn that an unexpected recession could  
wipe out the surpluses just as quickly as the booming economy 
created them. Janet Yellen, the president's chief economist, 
defended the forecasts as ``realistic assumptions about the 
economy's performance and not ... rosy scenarios.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans seek a 10 percent cut in income tax rates, returning  
$600 billion or more to taxpayers over the next decade. That, they 
say, is critical to keep the Democrats from creating new spending 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big government has been reborn and reinvented in this  
budget,'' complained Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete 
Domenici, R-N.M. ``It's clear that the president has initiated 
scores of new programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican Leader Dick Armey of Texas said, ``Out of $4  
trillion in projected surpluses over the next 15 years, the 
president can't find one penny for tax cuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposals require approval by Congress, and it's  
unclear how eager the two sides will be to reach compromise given 
the impeachment battle and a looming presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to the GOP call for hundreds of billions in  
across-the-board tax cuts, Clinton's budget offers targeted tax 
relief of $36.2 billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	That includes a $1,000 tax credit to help people handle  
long-term health care costs, and a $250 credit for stay-at-home 
parents caring for infants below age 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also includes several proposals that Republicans have  
rejected in past years -- including a 55-cent-a-pack increase in 
cigarette taxes. The president would raise $53.4 billion over five 
years from that, and from a new controversial claim on part of the 
$246 billion tobacco settlement states won. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Clinton proposes increasing taxes by $82 billion in the  
next five years. Many of the proposals to limit tax benefits for 
corporations and wealthy investors also have been rejected by 
Congress in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	As first outlined in his State of the Union speech, Clinton  
wants to use 62 percent of the $4.85 trillion in projected 
surpluses over the next 15 years to shore up Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans agree much of the surplus should be set aside for  
the retirement of 76 million baby boomers, although they disagree 
with the president on how to do this. 
</P>
<P>
	But the big fight will be over what to do with the rest of the  
projected surplus. Clinton wants to devote the rest to support 
Medicare, provide additional spending for the military and domestic 
programs and set up new retirement accounts to funnel $36 billion 
annually into individuals' savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget projects the government will collect $1.88  
trillion in revenues, up 4.3 percent from the current year. The 
$117 billion surplus for 2000 follows a projected $79 billion 
surplus this year and an actual $69 billion surplus in 1998, the 
first year the government finished in the black in 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The $2.41 trillion in total surpluses that Clinton envisions is  
about $160 billion below the amount forecast by the nonpartisan 
Congressional Budget Office. The administration foresees growth of 
2 percent or more the next five years with no recession in sight, 
even though the current boom is already the longest in peacetime 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Among highlights of Clinton's plan:  
</P>
<P>
	--Billions more for the Pentagon over the next five years  
although spending would actually go down in 2000. For the entire 
period, Clinton proposes billions in new weapons purchases and the 
largest pay raise for the military in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	--$5 billion to build and renovate schools and hire teachers.  
Clinton would tie part of that for the first time to requirements 
that states upgrade the academic quality of their weakest schools. 
</P>
<P>
	--$5.3 billion for health care initiatives over the next five  
years, including expanding access to Medicare to people below the 
65-year eligibility age.

<HEADLINE> Sumitomo Bank Agrees To Settle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Sumitomo Bank agreed Monday to pay $26 million to a  
government-backed agency to settle lawsuits that claimed it 
introduced unqualified borrowers to housing loan companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo will pay the Housing Loan Administration Corp., which  
was set up in 1996 to collect debts left by seven failed housing 
lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	In lawsuits filed in June and October last year, the Housing  
Loan Administration Corp. demanded $43 million in compensation from 
Sumitomo, accusing the bank of introducing borrowers to the lenders 
although they had no ability to repay the loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Housing Loan Administration Corp. will drop its lawsuits  
against Sumitomo Bank for 73 dubious borrowings under the 
settlement orchestrated at Tokyo District Court, said Yaeko Seike, 
a loan administration official. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, out-of-court settlements are often coordinated by the  
court. 
</P>
<P>
	The loans gone sour are a key part of the bad debt problem  
plaguing Japan's financial sector, leftover from massive 
speculative lending in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad debts have aggravated Japan's credit crunch and ailing  
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	As of last year, the Housing Loan Administration Corp. has  
collected $12.309 billion out of some $35.6 billion of debts left 
by the housing loan companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo Bank said it agreed to the settlement because it was  
``the best choice for our future business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bank acknowledged ``excesses'' in introducing borrowers to  
the lenders from 1985 through 1991. Sumitomo was also legally 
responsible in giving incorrect information on the borrowers, it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, Sumitomo had defended itself by saying that the  
lenders had made their own decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides had been negotiating since the court recommended  
on Nov. 2 last year that they settle the case as quickly as 
possible to help stabilize Japan's financial system.

<HEADLINE>  Lewinsky Deposed for Senate Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House prosecutor and President Clinton's  
lawyers questioned Monica Lewinsky under oath Monday with each side 
hoping to benefit from fresh testimony as the impeachment trial 
headed into what could be its final two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The all-day deposition of the former intern took place in  
private -- in the Mayflower Hotel's presidential suite -- but was 
videotaped for senators weighing the impeachment charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators can view the tape as early as Tuesday, and excerpts  
could end up being shown as part of the trial. Or senators could 
vote to bring Ms. Lewinsky to the floor for live testimony about 
her relationship with Clinton and attempts to conceal it, a less 
likely development. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's recollection of Clinton's actions and words are  
crucial to the Senate's consideration of several matters: her 
affidavit in the Paula Jones civil lawsuit falsely denying a sexual 
affair with Clinton, the job search after she appeared on the Jones 
witness list and the retrieval of presidential gifts by Clinton's 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	The House team promised in advance to shun intimate questions  
about the affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential friend Vernon Jordan will be questioned on Tuesday  
and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal on Wednesday -- in 
depositions in a private room at the Capitol -- before the trial 
resumes on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Rep. Ed Bryant of Tennessee, a former prosecutor with  
a low-key style, questioned Ms. Lewinsky for the prosecutors who 
are pushing to remove Clinton from office. Two female lawyers -- 
private attorney Nicole Seligman and Deputy White House Counsel 
Cheryl Mills -- were the main questioners for Clinton's side. 
</P>
<P>
	The chances were slim for any bombshells since Ms. Lewinsky  
would risk her immunity deal with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr 
by saying anything that was inconsistent with her prior testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	If senators decide that viewing the videotapes provides all the  
information they need, they can proceed to closing arguments in the 
perjury and-obstruction case and meet the goal of ending the trial 
by Friday, Feb. 12, or sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	In previous votes on procedural matters, Democrats have  
demonstrated more than enough strength to block conviction and 
removal of the president by the required two-thirds vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, some Republicans have questioned the strength of the  
House case alleging grand jury perjury, raising the possibility 
that charge may not receive even a majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some GOP senators also reacted negatively to a New  
York Times story that said Starr had concluded a grand jury could 
indict a sitting president. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kendall, a private lawyer representing Clinton, said  
Monday he was asking a federal court to require Starr to show why 
he and his staff ``should not be held in contempt for improper 
violations of grand jury secrecy'' in connection with such 
speculation of a possible indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr, asked outside his home if he planned to seek an  
indictment of the president, said, ``It is premature for us to be 
commenting at all on this, so we're not going to comment. There's a 
process that is under way and that process should go forward, the 
process that's under way in the U.S. Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sen. Mike DeWine of Ohio said the speculation was  
``unfortunate because it gets in the way of our focus on what our 
constitutional obligation is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeWine and Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., were in charge of the  
Lewinsky deposition and empowered to rule on objections to keep the 
proceeding moving. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky arrived at the stately Mayflower on Saturday. She  
was questioned in the same suite where she was interviewed more 
than a week ago by three House prosecutors -- including Bryant.

<HEADLINE> Kendall Accuses Starr of Leaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's lawyer Monday again  
accused independent counsel Kenneth Starr of illegally leaking 
grand jury material, this time over a report that Starr has 
concluded the president can be indicted while still in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, asked a federal judge to  
require Starr to show why he and his staff should not be held in 
contempt for improper violations of grand jury secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall told reporters Starr's office ``engaged in illegal and  
partisan leaking,'' citing a weekend report in The New York Times 
that said Starr had concluded a grand jury has the constitutional 
authority to charge Clinton with a crime while he remains in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr released a statement saying he was ``deeply troubled'' by  
the Times report. 
</P>
<P>
	``This office has no desire to inject itself into the  
constitutional process under way in the Senate,'' the independent 
counsel said, adding that he was investigating to determine whether 
anyone in his office improperly disclosed information to the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr, asked outside his home if he planned to seek an  
indictment of the president, said, ``It is premature for us to be 
commenting at all on this, so we're not going to comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson last year appointed  
an investigator to look into Kendall's previous allegations that 
Starr's office was responsible for leaks of grand jury material in 
the investigation of whether Clinton illegally tried to cover up 
his affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr contended the White House and defense lawyers were the  
prime suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal grand jury secrecy rule bars prosecutors, grand  
jurors and court personnel from disclosing grand jury information. 
An appeals court in Washington, D.C., said last year that protected 
information ``includes not only what has occurred and what is 
occurring, but also what is likely to occur,'' including the 
investigation's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	However, witnesses who testify before a grand jury are allowed  
to disclose what is said inside the grand jury room. 
</P>
<P>
	The news report that Starr has concluded Clinton can be indicted  
in office drew criticism from senators as the Senate tries to find 
a way to end the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that the timing was extremely unfortunate and that  
it was inappropriate to come out while the Senate is concluding the 
president's trial,'' said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal scholars differ over whether a sitting president can be  
indicted. The Constitution makes clear that federal officials 
ousted through impeachment can be charged with a crime, but it does 
not spell out whether removal from office must come first. 
</P>
<P>
	Indicting a president would ``seriously interfere with the  
ability of the president to govern,'' said New York University law 
professor Burt Neuborne. ``The time to indict him is after he 
leaves office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court ruled in 1997 that sitting presidents can be  
forced to face civil lawsuits over their unofficial acts. And some 
federal judges and members of Congress have been prosecuted while 
in office. 
</P>
<P>
	But Yale University law professor Akhil Reed Amar contends the  
president is unique because he is the sole head of the executive 
branch of government. If Starr obtained an indictment of Clinton, 
``he would be claiming for himself the power to imprison the chief 
executive officer,'' Amar told Congress last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Colorado law professor Robert Nagel suggested a  
president could be charged and perhaps even forced to go to trial 
while in office, but there was a ``strong argument'' that he could 
not be imprisoned until after leaving office. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepperdine University law professor Doug Kmiec said he believes  
the Constitution does allow a sitting president to be indicted. 
However, once a prosecutor has referred a case to Congress for 
impeachment, Kmiec said he believed it would be unwise to pursue it 
in criminal court as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's made his choice of avenues. I think he should  
rest with it,'' Kmiec said.

<HEADLINE> Man Removed From Course Over Gun  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- The downside of Tiger Woods' enormous  
popularity showed its face at the Phoenix Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian K. Murphy, 40, of Phoenix was arrested and charged with  
aggravated assault and disorderly conduct Sunday after a policeman 
who told him to stop heckling Woods found a semiautomatic pistol in 
Murphy's fanny pack. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy followed the final threesome, which included Woods,  
tournament winner Rocco Mediate and Harrison Frazar, for four holes 
of the final round, Sgt. Doug Dirren said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Murphy was near the sixth tee area when officer Rob  
Rucker, who was assigned to follow Woods and was wearing only a 
modified uniform designed to blend with the crowd, told him to be 
quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy, who had been drinking, became belligerent and persisted,  
even though Rucker identified himself as an officer, Dirren said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time, the guy turned toward him (Rucker) again and  
started using abusive language, and then lunged at the officer,'' 
Dirren said. ``The guy was yelling, `What are you going to do? 
Arrest me?' and the officer had to subdue him by putting him on the 
ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy had a permit to carry a concealed weapon, and Dirren did  
not know if the handgun was loaded. 
</P>
<P>
	After being booked on assault, a felony, and the misdemeanor,  
Murphy was released on his own recognizance pending referral of the 
charges to the Maricopa County attorney's office, Dirren said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods and Mediate, who played in the final threesome with  
Harrison Frazar, were not aware Murphy was armed until after the 
event ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just kept walking,'' Woods said. ``Rocco and I were walking  
down the fairway and just kind of talking about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mediate heard a man using vulgar language.  
</P>
<P>
	``An officer told him to watch his mouth, and he pushed him,''  
Mediate said. ``Wrong thing to do. The officer put him on his back 
right away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Told the man had a gun, Mediate asked for confirmation. Then he  
said, ``Oh no. It's just a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods said it was his second brush with armed fans.  
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old star said he was about 18, playing a practice  
round alone in Dallas, when two women approached. 
</P>
<P>
	``A policeman asked them what they were doing there, and they  
kind of lost it,'' Woods said. When the officer checked, he found 
guns in the backpacks of both.

<HEADLINE> Agent Says Strickland Has Changed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rod Strickland's agent says last year's NBA  
assists leader is a changed man who deserves a five-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Wizards aren't impressed, and general manager Wes  
Unseld says if a deal isn't reached with the free agent by Friday's 
opener, he'll ``go with what we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those were the two new wrinkles Monday in another round of sharp  
words from two men who remain millions apart as they haggle over 
one of the best point guards in the league. The sticking point is 
that Strickland is 32 and has not always taken good care of his 
body, so the Wizards are balking at agent David Falk's demand for a 
five-year, fully guaranteed deal. 
</P>
<P>
	With tipoff nearing -- and both sides waiting for the other to  
make a move -- Falk offered a timely revelation about Strickland. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's completely changed his lifestyle in the last nine  
months,'' Falk said. ``And he works out religiously with the same 
trainer that works out Patrick Ewing, Alonzo Mourning and others in 
Maryland. He's probably in the best physical condition he's been. 
He's changed his diet. He's gotten very serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falk is asking for a five-year deal worth $55 million -- $10  
million less than his original offer -- for Strickland. The Wizards 
are offering a three-year deal worth $27 million guaranteed, plus 
two more years worth $23 million if Strickland meets certain 
performance incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players of his caliber don't have non-guaranteed contracts,''  
Falk said. ``Do I think he'll be able to play when he's 35? 
Absolutely. Do I think he'll be a $10 million player? I think 
players of his caliber when he's 35 will probably be earning $15 
million to $16 million per year. So I think what we've asked for is 
below the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Strickland would show up late, eat junk food in a  
hurry and sometimes get sick at courtside during games. Falk 
declined to make Strickland available for comment, but Wizards 
guard Mitch Richmond backed up Falk's claims that Strickland has 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been working out at the same gym,'' Richmond said. ``His  
body looks good. He told me that he changed his habits, eating hot 
dogs and all that stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unseld maintained his public stance that age is ``not related''  
to the Wizards' negotiations with Strickland, a position he has to 
take because 33-year-old Richmond will be a free agent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we first talked about contracts, I spoke to (Falk) about  
a three-year contract. There are a number of reasons for coming up 
with that,'' Unseld said, declining to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Unseld added he would not let the matter hang over the team once  
the season starts. Fans chanted, ``We want Rod!'' at a scrimmage 
and an exhibition game last week, and Unseld doesn't want them in a 
``Rod watch'' mode all season. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's not done by the time we open up the season, then it's  
not going to get done,'' Unseld said. ``We're not going to have 
this situation where we go in and lose four or five games and 
everybody's says it's because Rod's not here. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will know beforehand that's the way it's going to be. ...  
If it's not successful, then I have to live with that, I have to 
suffer whatever repercussions come with that. I'll willing to do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland's options are limited because no other team with  
salary cap room wants to pay him close to the Wizards' offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Unseld and Falk haven't spoken since Friday. Falk said the  
``ball's in their court.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Sends Budget to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton sent Congress a $1.77  
trillion spending plan today for 2000, beginning a new century with 
record budget surpluses that he would use to shore up Social 
Security and shower billions in new spending on programs from child 
care to the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	The release of Clinton's budget is the opening shot in what's  
sure to be a bitter struggle with the Republican-controlled 
Congress. While agreeing with Clinton's goal of strengthening 
Social Security, the GOP prefers using the bulk of the remaining 
federal surpluses for across-the-board tax cuts. Republicans 
accused Clinton of reverting to spendthrift liberal ways. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, proclaiming his budget marks a ``new era of  
opportunity,'' proposes increasing spending by 2.3 percent for the 
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Even with the $39 billion increase 
over this year, Clinton's budget projects a record $117 billion 
surplus, thanks to the booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton forecasts $2.41 trillion in surpluses over the next  
decade, laying out a vision of plenty the country has not known in 
70 years, before the Great Depression, World War II and the Cold 
War put the United States into the rut of chronic deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year for the first time in three decades, we turned red  
ink to black,'' Clinton said at a budget kickoff pep rally at the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a rare opportunity that comes along once in a blue  
moon to any group of Americans,'' Clinton said, urging Congress to 
use the coming windfalls to pay down the national debt as part of 
his plan to shore up Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort would have an enormous payoff, Clinton said, driving  
the national debt held by the public to its lowest level since 1917 
and reducing the interest payment on that debt to just 2 cents of 
every budget $1. Now, interest payments account for 11 cents of 
every $1. 
</P>
<P>
	But private economists warn that an unexpected recession could  
wipe out the surpluses just as quickly as the booming economy 
created them. Janet Yellen, the president's chief economist, 
defended the forecasts as ``realistic assumptions about the 
economy's performance and not ... rosy scenarios.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans seek a 10 percent cut in income tax rates, returning  
$600 billion or more to taxpayers over the next decade. That, they 
say, is critical to keep the Democrats from creating new spending 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big government has been reborn and reinvented in this  
budget,'' complained Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete 
Domenici, R-N.M. ``It's clear that the president has initiated 
scores of new programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican Leader Dick Armey of Texas said, ``Out of $4  
trillion in projected surpluses over the next 15 years, the 
president can't find one penny for tax cuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposals require approval by Congress, and it's  
unclear how eager the two sides will be to reach compromise given 
the impeachment battle and a looming presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to the GOP call for hundreds of billions in  
across-the-board tax cuts, Clinton's budget offers targeted tax 
relief of $36.2 billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	That includes a $1,000 tax credit to help people handle  
long-term health care costs, and a $250 credit for stay-at-home 
parents caring for infants below age 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also includes several proposals that Republicans have  
rejected in past years -- including a 55-cent-a-pack increase in 
cigarette taxes. The president would raise $53.4 billion over five 
years from that, and from a new controversial claim on part of the 
$246 billion tobacco settlement states won. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Clinton proposes increasing taxes by $82 billion in the  
next five years. Many of the proposals to limit tax benefits for 
corporations and wealthy investors also have been rejected by 
Congress in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	As first outlined in his State of the Union speech, Clinton  
wants to use 62 percent of the $4.85 trillion in projected 
surpluses over the next 15 years to shore up Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans agree much of the surplus should be set aside for  
the retirement of 76 million baby boomers, although they disagree 
with the president on how to do this. 
</P>
<P>
	But the big fight will be over what to do with the rest of the  
projected surplus. Clinton wants to devote the rest to support 
Medicare, provide additional spending for the military and domestic 
programs and set up new retirement accounts to funnel $36 billion 
annually into individuals' savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget projects the government will collect $1.88  
trillion in revenues, up 4.3 percent from the current year. The 
$117 billion surplus for 2000 follows a projected $79 billion 
surplus this year and an actual $69 billion surplus in 1998, the 
first year the government finished in the black in 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The $2.41 trillion in total surpluses that Clinton envisions is  
about $160 billion below the amount forecast by the nonpartisan 
Congressional Budget Office. The administration foresees growth of 
2 percent or more the next five years with no recession in sight, 
even though the current boom is already the longest in peacetime 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Among highlights of Clinton's plan:  
</P>
<P>
	--Billions more for the Pentagon over the next five years  
although spending would actually go down in 2000. For the entire 
period, Clinton proposes billions in new weapons purchases and the 
largest pay raise for the military in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	--$5 billion to build and renovate schools and hire teachers.  
Clinton would tie part of that for the first time to requirements 
that states upgrade the academic quality of their weakest schools. 
</P>
<P>
	--$5.3 billion for health care initiatives over the next five  
years, including expanding access to Medicare to people below the 
65-year eligibility age.

<HEADLINE> It's Time To Vote on Stamps of '80s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's time to crank your memory back to the  
1980s and decide what were the most important events of that recent 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The post office is once again inviting the public to vote on 15  
stamps to represent the decade. Already stamps of the 1950s, '60s 
and '70s have been chosen by public voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Balloting on the 1980s stamps began Monday and lasts until the  
end of February. Forms are available in post offices and via the 
Internet at http://stampvote.msn.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The stamps will be released next year.  
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, the public cast millions of votes to let us know  
what they wanted to see on postage stamps honoring the 1950s, 1960s 
and 1970s,'' said Postmaster General William Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now is their chance to immortalize the 1980s, a decade marked  
as much by increasing awareness of the AIDS epidemic as it was by 
the dramatic removal of the Berlin Wall, our national obsession 
with the personal computer and our children's love for the Cabbage 
Patch Kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates for 1980s stamp subjects are:  
</P>
<P>
	--People &AMP; Events: pianist Vladimir Horowitz returns to Russia to  
perform, fall of the Berlin Wall, Arms Reduction Treaty, Vietnam 
Veterans Memorial, American Hostages Freed in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	--Arts and Entertainment: ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,'' hip-hop  
culture, country music, ``The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' ``Cats,'' 
``The Cosby Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Sports: NCAA March basketball madness, popularity of figure  
skating, senior PGA golf tour, Los Angeles Lakers vs. Boston 
Celtics basketball, San Francisco 49ers football dynasty, beach 
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
	--Science and Technology: popularity of personal computers, AIDS  
awareness, Space Shuttle program, compact discs, cable TV, gene 
mapping. 
</P>
<P>
	--Lifestyle: Video games, aerobics, minivans, mountain biking,  
Cabbage Patch Kids, camcorders, talk shows.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Finish Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stock prices closed marginally lower today  
while the dollar fell against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 34.07 points,  
or 0.23 percent, to end at 14,465.18. On Friday, the average closed 
up 156.93 points, or 1.09 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.48 yen in late trading, down 0.50 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
116.43 yen Friday. During the day, it ranged from 115.40 yen to 
116.01 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices opened higher following  
Friday's gains on Wall Street where the Dow Jones industrial 
average finished up 77.50 points, or 0.8 percent, to 9,358.83. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Nikkei average drifted lower during the day as some  
Japanese companies sold shares they hold in other companies to 
cement business relationships. Companies have begun to sell such 
holdings in efforts to use their capital more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
	``Buyers are being cautious. This isn't a market where investors  
are going to keep sending shares higher and higher,'' said Kaoru 
Ichikawa, a trader at Kokusai Securities. ``The economic 
fundamentals aren't good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A reported government proposal to keep companies from dumping  
stocks helped support share prices, but many investors remained on 
the sidelines to await details of the plan, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai newspaper reported Saturday that the ruling  
Liberal Democratic Party is considering making Japan Securities 
Finance Co. and two other firms buy stocks from companies that 
unwind cross-shareholdings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unclear what will happen to stocks after Japan  
Securities Finance buys them,'' said Masatoshi Sato, manager of 
investment information at Kankaku Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	About 310.78 million shares changed hands on the first section  
of the Tokyo Stock exchange, with declines outnumbering advances 
582 to 546, while 177 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 5.89 points, or 0.52 percent, to 1,119.37. The 
TOPIX rose 15.04, or 1.35 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, Japanese exporters and overseas funds  
bought back the yen to lock in profits following the U.S. 
currency's rise to near 116.50 yen in New York on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar surged Friday after the Commerce Department said the  
U.S. economy grew at an astounding 5.6 percent annual rate during 
the final quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was traded at 131.14 yen at midafternoon, down from  
132.45 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro hit an intraday low today of 131.08 yen -- its weakest  
level since its inception on Jan. 1 -- further weighing down the 
dollar in Tokyo, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond rose to 2.035 percent from Friday's finish of 1.990 
percent, driving its price down to 98.15 yen from 98.49 yen.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends 13.13 Lower / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks gave back moderate gains in the  
final minutes of trading to end lower on Monday, but the Nasdaq 
composite inched higher to close at a record level for the third 
consecutive session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,345.70, down 13.13,  
breaking two days of gains. The Dow got as high as 9,430.66, up 
nearly 72 points from Friday's close. It was up more than 50 points 
near the close, only to give way to profit-taking in the final 20 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	And although the Nasdaq composite managed to push to a record  
high again, gaining 4.20 to 2,510.09, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 
composite fell 6.61 to 1,273.03. 
</P>
<P>
	But nervousness ahead of Tuesday's meeting of Federal Reserve  
policy-makers dampened Wall Street's enthusiasm all day, said Barry 
Berman, head stock trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed is kind of stuck'' between an impulse to cool the  
stock market down because its high-flying advances could prove 
inflationary, and the realization that any action that would send 
the market lower could slow consumption and have grave consequences 
for the economy, Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed is ``taking the stock market into consideration more  
than they ever have as a factor in everybody's economic 
well-being,'' Berman said. ``It's gotten to be a bigger part of 
everybody's wealth, and as such, if people were to suddenly lose a 
portion of that, it would affect their spending habits, which would 
affect the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow opened stronger after high-profile merger news in Europe  
pushed European stock markets sharply higher, and after Washington 
released data showing consumers earned and spent more money last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said Americans' personal income climbed  
0.5 percent that month, while personal spending surged 0.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The market got another boost early on as the National  
Association of Purchasing Management reported that its index of 
manufacturing activity rose to 49.5 percent in January from 45.3 
percent in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Although a reading under 50 percent is a sign of contraction in  
the industrial sector, the increase was bigger than economists had 
expected, and it sent manufacturing shares higher. Among Dow 
components, for example, General Motors added 3 5/8 to 93 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing data represented ``a very strong rebound'' in  
manufacturing, said Anthony Karydakis, senior financial economist 
at First Chicago Capital Markets, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined with last week's report on strong gains in  
durable-goods orders, and a strong report from the Philadelphia 
area on manufacturing activity, it ``shows a manufacturing sector 
making a comeback,'' Karydakis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow industrials were led higher by AT&AMP;T, which rose 2 13/16  
to 93 9/16. The telecommunications giant announced a deal to 
provide telephone service over Time Warner's existing cable 
television systems. Time Warner shares ended down 3/16 at 62 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow components were also supported by Hewlett-Packard, whose  
shares rose 3 5/8 to 81 15/16 after the company introduced a new line 
of printers. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some merger news helped individual names.  
</P>
<P>
	Rohm &AMP; Haas agreed to buy salt processor Morton International in  
a $4.6 billion transaction that will create a chemical processing 
powerhouse. Morton's shares shot up 9 3/4 to 35 5/8, while Rohm &AMP; Haas's 
shares added 3/4 to 31 3/4. And Aeroquip-Vickers soared 20 3/4 to 56, after 
the company agreed to be acquired by Eaton Corp., whose shares fell 
2 13/16 to 66 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	In other Wall Street action, the NYSE composite index fell 2.98  
at 597.46, and the American Stock Exchange composite index dropped 
2.23 to 712.63. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 
1.14 to 426.08. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Big Board, decliners led advancers by 6 to 5. Volume came  
to 961.51 million shares, down from Friday's pace 
</P>
<P>
	European stocks soared after Societe Generale said it would buy  
Paribas, combining two French banking powerhouses, and the French 
insurance giant Axa-UAP agreed to buy Britain's Guardian Royal 
Exchange PLC. Axa's American depositary receipts fell 1 to 72. 
</P>
<P>
	London's FT-SE 100 stock index rose 1.97 percent. The DAX index  
in Frankfurt rose 0.60 percent, and the CAC in Paris added 1.23 
percent. The Nikkei index in Tokyo eased 0.23 percent.

	MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) -- Uruguayan authorities have released  
two suspected members of an Egyptian terrorist group, while a third 
man reportedly linked to the group remained in custody Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The three were detained with fake Malaysian passports at  
Uruguay's border with Brazil over the weekend. It was unclear why 
two were released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge said El Said Hazaan al Mokhis was being held for  
possession of falsified documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Local reports said U.S. intelligence officials suspect the  
Egyptian man is linked to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused

	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- An appeals court opened hearings Monday to  
review the September convictions of three Swiss citizens, including 
a former Nestle executive, on drug-smuggling charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearings in the northern city of Zacapa mark the latest  
twist in a case known as the ``German Connection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A German and a Guatemalan citizen also were sentenced in the  
case, which involved shipments of cocaine worth $100 million from 
Guatemala to Europe. The cocaine was placed in shipping containers 
and ornamental plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreas Heanggi Wyndler, 62, the former manager of a Nestle  
subsidiary in Guatemala, was unaware that there was cocaine in a 
freight container on one of the company's trucks, said his lawyer, 
Fernando Linares. 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, a court ordered Haenggi Wyndler, 60, to serve 12  
years in prison and pay a fine of $77,000. His son, Nicholas 
Haenggi Chalandrian, 22, was sentenced to 20 years and fined 
$155,000, as was Swiss citizen Silvio Giovanoli, 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss Foreign Ministry called the sentences  
``disproportionate'' and officials asserted that parts of the 
proceedings ``didn't meet legal requirements.'' The Swiss 
government said Sunday it expected the three would get fair 
treatment on appeal.

	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro is ``a  
loser'' who has lost sight of the ideals of his 1959 revolution, 
said former Polish President and Nobel Peace Prize winner Lech 
Walesa. 
</P>
<P>
	The former labor leader who helped bring about sweeping changes  
in East Europe is scheduled to speak at a forum in San Juan on 
Tuesday titled ``Democracy: The Never-Ending Battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview published Monday in the San Juan Star, which is  
co-sponsoring Walesa's visit, the former electrician said Castro 
has failed to fulfill his promises and has created a flawed system 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	But Walesa also said the U.S. trade embargo of Cuba was not a  
sound long-term strategy. He said the visit by Pope John Paul II 
would have more effect on Cuba than U.S. attempts to isolate the 
communist country in the Caribbean.

	LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- Tens of thousands of public school  
teachers went on strike throughout Bolivia on Monday, protesting 
government efforts to reform the country's educational system. 
</P>
<P>
	The government declared the strike illegal and issued a decree  
that would allow the firing of teachers who fail to show up for 
work within six days. Education Minister Tito Hoz de Vila said the 
dismissed teachers would be replaced by retirees and university 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Teacher's Union leader Javier Baldivieso said the strike was  
called to protest changes in the educational system and low wages. 
The country's public school teachers earn an average of $100 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The government sent police to public schools in anticipation of  
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	During previous strikes, the teachers clashed with police in  
downtown La Paz and set up roadblocks. The strike has shut down 
schools throughout the country.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the presidential helicopter landed on the  
White House lawn, Buddy raced down the steps and turned to wait for 
his master. A moment later, President Clinton stepped off and 
tossed a yellow tennis ball for his dog to chase. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	The first lady had flown to Camp David with her husband Saturday

Maryland's Catoctin Mountains. But she did not return with the 
president Monday morning.

<P>
	``She decided to drive back separately,'' said spokeswoman Toby  
Graff. The first lady had no morning appointments and ``she didn't 
have to come back early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president had to be at the White House for a 10:15 a.m.  
ceremony to present his $1.77 trillion budget for 2000.

<HEADLINE> Nicklaus Released From Hospital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Jack Nicklaus has set his priorities in his  
recovery from hip replacement surgery: The Masters is out, the U.S. 
Open is a maybe, but his son's wedding is a must. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife told me the one thing I'm going to do is dance at my  
son's wedding,'' he said as he checked out of New England Baptist 
Hospital on crutches Monday. ``Other than that, I'm going to do 
nothing for six weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the 59-year-old golf great does intend to be in shape for  
the Feb. 20 marriage of his youngest son, Michael. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus will be on crutches for six weeks, and doctors want him  
to get plenty of rest before beginning rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Postoperative recovery to date has been right on track,'' said  
Dr. Benjamin Bierbaum, who operated on Nicklaus on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus will miss the Masters in April for the first time in 40  
years and possibly the U.S. Open in June. However, he should be 
able to play competitively again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any illusions, at the age of 59 or 60, of coming  
back and competing with the Tiger Woodses and David Duvals,'' 
Nicklaus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, winner of a record 18 majors, had a degenerative left  
hip for years. He tried to avoid a hip replacement with a rigorous 
exercise routine, but finally yielded when the hip began to affect 
his quality of life as well as his game. 
</P>
<P>
	Bierbaum, head of orthopedic surgery at the hospital, said  
Nicklaus will be on crutches so the bone and soft tissue can heal. 
After that, he will go through a rehabilitation program that could 
take at least six more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Nicklaus is just plain tired.  
</P>
<P>
	``It wears me out to shower and shave,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus agreed to receive a ceramic hip as part of a study  
directed by Bierbaum and involving 10 hospitals. Ceramic is 
smoother than materials typically used in hip implants and is 
believed to last longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the hip problems, Nicklaus became the oldest player to  
finish in the top 10 in the Masters last April when he thrilled the 
Augusta gallery yet again with a final-round 68 to tie for sixth. 
But he was hobbling so badly in the summer that he pulled out of 
the British Open, ending his streak of 146 consecutive majors. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the first time Nicklaus has missed the Masters  
since 1958, four years before he turned pro and began one of golf's 
greatest careers.

<HEADLINE>  Elway Deciding Whether To Drive Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- While the last thing John Elway needed was another  
car, the latest addition to his garage is one he'd never refuse -- 
it goes with the Super Bowl MVP award. 
</P>
<P>
	But he still isn't saying whether he'll drive off into  
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway recently sold his seven auto dealerships for $82 million,  
remains the front man for 17 dealerships and owns a stable of cars. 
NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue joked about that as he introduced 
Elway at a news conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be that a car was an incentive to win,'' Tagliabue  
said. ``Now, it's clear that not even a dealership is incentive to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway won the MVP trophy for leading the Denver Broncos to a  
34-19 victory over the Atlanta Falcons in the Super Bowl on Sunday. 
He also got a choice of a Ford Mustang or Expedition. He took the 
latter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our staff met last night to try to come up with something that  
would give John an incentive to play another season,'' Tagliabue 
said. ``The best they could come up with was the idea that you have 
a chance to be the first player in NFL history to be the MVP in two 
different centuries. We decided not to offer that to you because it 
might emphasize your age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old quarterback completed 18 of 29 passes for 336  
yards, and threw for one touchdown and ran for another in his fifth 
and possibly final trip to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really never thought I would be standing up here the morning  
after a Super Bowl as the MVP,'' said Elway, who clearly had his 
best performance in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
	``After you lose three in a row, you're just hoping your team  
can win. So this is a bonus. It's really one of the great thrills 
of my career, and I've had many of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After last year's Super Bowl victory, Elway agonized for four  
months about retirement. He expects to make a quicker decision 
about playing next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Although believed to be leaning toward retirement, Elway  
admitted the opportunity for an unprecedented third straight Super 
Bowl title is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be great to come back and three-peat,'' he said.  
``But also, it would be nice to walk away at the level that I'm 
playing right now. I don't want to walk away too late, but I also 
know that if I play like I played last night that I can play a 
little bit longer. There will be a bunch of things that go into the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm just cherishing the moment, cherishing the win  
and everything that has happened to us this year. At 38 years old 
and in the twilight of my career, I have a tendency to focus on the 
now and not tomorrow. Once the dust settles, I'll weigh those 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before making his decision, Elway said he will talk to his wife  
and four children, his father and mother, coach Mike Shanahan and 
Broncos owner Pat Bowlen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said all week and I said this year that it's a 90 percent  
chance I'm going to quit,'' he said. ``But the last thing I want to 
do is shut the door. I don't want to say that I'm done, then get 
into March or April and say that I can play one more year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His 90 percent estimate is a reduction of the 99.9 percent  
guarantee he gave last June that 1998 would be his final season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are physical considerations,'' said Elway, who  
uncharacteristically missed all or parts of six games this season 
with hamstring, back and rib injuries. ``Can I compete for an 
entire 16-game schedule? Can I spend the time working on what we do 
offensively in Denver from a mental standpoint? It was a long haul 
for me this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And one well worth it.

<HEADLINE> `She's All That' Opens at No. 1 / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- With the box office deflated by the Super  
Bowl, one teen film -- ``She's All That'' -- knocked another one -- 
``Varsity Blues'' -- from No. 1, while ``Shakespeare in Love'' got a 
boost from the Golden Globes, final figures showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Business overall was down nearly 32 percent from the same  
weekend last year, when there wasn't a Super Bowl but there was the 
Super Bowl of movies in theaters, with ``Titanic'' cruising toward 
record grosses. 
</P>
<P>
	Atop the box office was ``She's All That,'' the Pygmalion-style  
story of a high school class president who tries to transform an 
art geek into a prom queen. ``She's All That'' opened with $16.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's leader, the high school football movie ``Varsity  
Blues'' dropped to third with $5.9 million. ``Patch Adams'' 
remained in second place with $6 million and ``A Civil Action'' was 
fourth with $4.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love,'' which picked up three Golden Globe  
awards Jan. 24, added screens and business, grossing $4 million for 
fifth place. After eight weeks in release, ``Shakespeare'' 
maintained a strong $5,320-per-location average. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stepmom'' was sixth with $3.6 million, ``The Thin Red Line''  
seventh with $3.3 million, ``You've Got Mail'' eighth with $3 
million, ``At First Sight'' ninth with $2.7 million and ``The 
Prince of Egypt'' 10th with $2.6 million.

playing right now. I don't want to walk away too late, but I also 
know that if I play like I played last night that I can play a 
little bit longer. There will be a bunch of things that go into the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm just cherishing the moment, cherishing the win  
and everything that has happened to us this year. At 38 years old 
and in the twilight of my career, I have a tendency to focus on the 
now and not tomorrow. Once the dust settles, I'll weigh those 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before making his decision, Elway said he will talk to his wife  
and four children, his father and mother, coach Mike Shanahan and 
Broncos owner Pat Bowlen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said all week and I said this year that it's a 90 percent  
chance I'm going to quit,'' he said. ``But the last thing I want to 
do is shut the door. I don't want to say that I'm done, then get 
into March or April and say that I can play one more year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His 90 percent estimate is a reduction of the 99.9 percent  
guarantee he gave last June that 1998 would be his final season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are physical considerations,'' said Elway, who  
uncharacteristically missed all or parts of six games this season 
with hamstring, back and rib injuries. ``Can I compete for an 
entire 16-game schedule? Can I spend the time working on what we do 
offensively in Denver from a mental standpoint? It was a long haul 
for me this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And one well worth it.

<HEADLINE> Will Pro Bowl Be White's Last Game? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Reggie White, in Hawaii for his record 11th Pro  
Bowl appearance, is preparing to strap on the shoulder pads one 
last time. 
</P>
<P>
	Or is he?  
</P>
<P>
	White insisted all year that this was his final season, and at  
37, he had a great farewell, garnering 16 sacks and the NFL 
Defensive Player of the Year award. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Michael Jordan, he went out on the top of his considerable  
game. 
</P>
<P>
	But White, who changed his mind 48 hours after announcing his  
retirement last April, gave Green Bay Packers fans another glimmer 
of hope Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Fox network show before the Super Bowl, White, who was  
due to make $3.9 million in 1999, said he was ``intrigued'' about 
the idea of returning to play under new coach Ray Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Ray got the job, if anyone else had gotten the job I  
wouldn't have been intrigued,'' White told Fox. ``I've really been 
praying about it and thinking about it. Right now I'm retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White's agent, Jimmy Sexton, said he doesn't think White will  
change his mind despite several meetings between his client and 
Rhodes, who replaced Mike Holmgren. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he'll play next year, that's just my gut  
feeling,'' Sexton said Monday from Memphis, Tenn. ``He hasn't 
expressed to me that he's going to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White was en route to Hawaii on Monday and Rhodes was shuttling  
between Green Bay and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Brett Favre had tried to change White's mind.  
</P>
<P>
	``Seriously, I am trying my best,'' Favre said last month.  
``Heck, he got 16 sacks. Well, OK, he has an off-year next year and 
has 12. That's 12 we could use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers' two biggest needs after failing to return to the  
Super Bowl are retooling the defensive line and soft secondary. 
White's return would help immensely. 
</P>
<P>
	Sexton said contrary to published reports, White wasn't angered  
when the Packers made him available to the expansion draft for the 
Cleveland Browns. Sexton said general manager Ron Wolf had informed 
White before doing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They discussed it and Reggie wanted him to do whatever would  
help the team,'' Sexton said. ``I don't think Cleveland would take 
him, I really don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns would have to assume the final three years of a  
five-year, $19 million extension White signed in December 1996, and 
White has said he wanted to retire in the Packers green and gold.

<HEADLINE>  Seattle Gets 2001 All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- After a 22-year absence, the All-Star game is  
returning to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2001 All-Star game will be played at Safeco Field,  
commissioner Bud Selig and AL president Gene Budig said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners are scheduled to move into their new  
retractable-roof stadium on July 15 after opening the season in the 
Kingdome, site of the 1979 All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	``As my friend, Gene Budig, will tell you, I've been after these  
people to try to get the All-Star game just as early as we could so 
we could begin using that place for the benefit of everyone,'' 
Mariners chief executive officer John Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2001 game will be held in the 47,000-seat ballpark in July,  
probably July 10. But the exact date won't be determined until next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 58,905 watched the NL win 7-6 in the 50th All-Star  
game in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig, whose group bought the Seattle Pilots in bankruptcy court  
in 1970, moved the team to Milwaukee and renamed it the Brewers, 
said the 2001 All-Star game will mean ``in excess of $60 million'' 
to Seattle's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boy, is this a home run or what?'' Gov. Gary Locke said. ``A  
home run for the Mariners. A home run for Safeco Field. A home run 
for Seattle and the state of Washington. Being awarded the All-Star 
game is a fitting tribute to all our community has done over the 
last several years to save the Mariners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star game could mark the return to Seattle of the  
Mariners top two players: Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez. Both 
are eligible for free agency after the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle wants to negotiate contract extensions with the pair.  
Both want to wait and see if the team can compete this year on its 
current budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look forward to seeing two players in that All-Star game,  
two players who will be very, very familiar with that field: Ken 
Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez,'' Locke said.

<HEADLINE> Mo. Gov. Praised for Commutation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Louis DeFeo and Samuel Lee rank among  
the top critics of Gov. Mel Carnahan's support for abortion rights, 
including the Democrat's veto of a late-term abortion ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet on Sunday, the governor received unusual public praise from  
both men for his politically risky commutation of a death sentence 
for triple murderer Darrell Mease. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``act of mercy,'' as Carnahan put it, was prompted by a  
face-to-face appeal from Pope John Paul II after a St. Louis 
worship service last week. John Paul declared that capital 
punishment, abortion, euthanasia and assisted suicide are part of a 
``culture of death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeFeo and Lee, both devout and activist Roman Catholics, are in  
total agreement with the pope and with the response from Carnahan, 
a deacon at First Baptist Church in his hometown of Rolla. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFeo, the statehouse voice of Missouri's Catholic bishops, said  
he was surprised during a weekend wedding and several other events 
that ``everyone I talked to was impressed by the governor's act of 
mercy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure I expected that,'' DeFeo said. ``I've seen the  
polls showing 75 percent of Missourians support capital 
punishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the commutation have been angry, amazed and troubled  
about the precedents and philosophical debates triggered by 
Carnahan's decision to overturn the death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	By Sunday, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch had accumulated plenty of  
anti-Carnahan blasts from visitors to its World Wide Web chat 
forum. In a weekend editorial, Columbia Daily Tribune publisher 
Hank Waters said Carnahan, whom he frequently supports, should have 
ignored the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor, added Waters, ``surprises by playing  
life-and-death games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Lee, a statehouse lobbyist for the anti-abortion  
organization Campaign Life Missouri, said Carnahan's decision to 
spare Mease so impressed him that he wrote a personal note to the 
governor on Friday. Lee said he knew Carnahan ``would be subject to 
criticism, but that I admire his courage. And I'm not a fan of 
his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee noted that many of his allies in the struggle against  
abortion favor capital punishment. Those activists, no matter their 
faith, ``might be more persuasive'' by wrapping themselves in a 
philosophical ``seamless garment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That means opposing unnecessary death,'' Lee said, ``and means  
being truly pro-life, toward a triple murderer and toward an 
innocent unborn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite obvious broad support for the death penalty in Missouri,  
DeFeo and Lee said they consider capital punishment a matter of 
societal morality, not popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	A politician's popularity, or lack of it, undeniably translates  
into votes. But Lee said: ``What the governor has done should 
transcend politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Carnahan, a lawyer who has allowed 26 executions in six  
years, said the decision came from his heart, not the merits of 
Mease's ``heinous'' case. 
</P>
<P>
	Some call Mease's commutation a miracle. Others believe it was a  
strange coincidence of the calendar, since Missouri had executed 
another triple murderer just days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Still others said it indicated Carnahan valued a 52-year-old  
multiple murderer's life more than the unlived life of an unborn 
fetus. 
</P>
<P>
	For Lee and DeFeo, the governor has earned praise.  
</P>
<P>
	``The power to pardon isn't for the prisoner, it's for the  
benefit of the greater good,'' DeFeo said. ``I think of President 
Ford pardoning Richard Nixon and saying he did it because the 
country would be more at peace after Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, the question is: Is Mel Carnahan's self-stated `act of  
mercy' not something beneficial for the common good?''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Talks of Weapons Check Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Security Council members moved ahead  
Monday with discussions to establish expert panels to assess Iraq's 
disarmament and adherence to other U.N. resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's U.N. Ambassador Celso Amorim, who will chair the three  
panels, held separate talks Monday on the council's review with 
U.N. chief Kofi Annan and the ambassadors of Iraq, Kuwait, Russia 
and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first formal action on Iraq since the United States and  
Britain launched airstrikes in mid-December, the council ended a 
diplomatic impasse by agreeing to form panels to study Iraqi 
disarmament, humanitarian needs and the fate of missing Kuwaitis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iraqi leadership on Sunday rejected the council's decision,  
saying Baghdad wasn't consulted and the assessment would only delay 
the lifting of economic sanctions. Iraq wants the council to 
condemn the airstrikes and recent conflicts with allied aircraft 
over the ``no-fly zones,'' the Iraqi News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	France's U.N. Ambassador Alain Dejammet told a news conference  
Monday that Iraq's reaction was not unexpected -- and would hold 
``no weight'' in the work of the panels. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which is charged  
with disarming Iraq, pulled out before the airstrikes, and Baghdad 
has refused to allow its inspectors to return. Under U.N. 
resolutions, the oil embargo cannot be lifted until U.N. arms 
inspectors report Iraq is free of its weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The panels are expected to submit recommendations to the  
Security Council by April 15 on re-establishing an effective 
disarmament program in Iraq, on improving the humanitarian 
situation in the country, and on what to do about looted property 
and hundreds of people who disappeared after Iraq's 1990 invasion 
of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	The council has given Amorim a lot of latitude to decide such  
issues as the composition of the panels, how technical or political 
their work might be, and whether panel members might seek to visit 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Several initiatives to resume U.N. oversight of Iraq remain  
before the Security Council. But there are deep divisions among 
council members on whether sanctions against Iraq should be lifted, 
whether UNSCOM has any future role, and how to ensure that Baghdad 
doesn't resume building banned weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Britain back UNSCOM but Russia and China  
want it replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	France has proposed lifting the oil embargo entirely but keeping  
strict financial controls to ensure that proceeds from oil sales 
aren't used to buy and rebuild banned weapons. The United States 
proposed letting Baghdad sell unlimited amounts of oil -- but only 
if the proceeds go to buy food and other humanitarian supplies for 
Iraqis.

	Lewinsky Deposed on Videotape  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House prosecutor questioned Monica Lewinsky  
under oath today in her first sworn statements since President 
Clinton's impeachment trial began. White House lawyers passed on 
the opportunity to pose their own questions. The five-hour 
deposition of the former intern took place in private but was 
videotaped for the full Senate. Senators can view the tape as early 
as tomorrow, and excerpts could end up being shown as part of the 
trial. Senators also could vote to bring Lewinsky to the floor for 
live testimony about her relationship with Clinton and attempts to 
conceal it. Clinton's friend Vernon Jordan will be deposed tomorrow 
and aide Sidney Blumenthal will be questioned Wednesday.

	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- At least one person died today in an  
explosion and fire at a generating station of a Ford Motor plant. 
Three workers also were unaccounted for after the blast at the 
coal-fired plant, the company said. Oakwood Hospitals received 21 
patients, six to eight with severe burns, said the director of 
emergency services. Garden City Hospital received one patient and 
was told to expect more. The cause of the explosion was under 
investigation. The power house generates electricity for the entire 
complex, producing enough electricity to serve a city the size of 
Boston.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton unveiled today a $1.77  
trillion budget for the year 2000 that would buttress Social 
Security and bestow billions on everything from troops to teachers. 
Republicans, who control Congress, immediately vowed to rework much 
of it, insisting that part of the $2.41 trillion in surpluses 
Clinton envisions over the next decade should go for tax-rate cuts, 
not new spending. But Republicans agreed with Clinton that most of 
the surpluses should be set aside to trim the national debt and 
strengthen Social Security.

monitoring group with European forces. With peace talks due to 
begin on Saturday at Rambouillet, France, U.S. and European envoys 
still lacked a clear commitment from Kosovo Albanian rebels to

	Clinton Apologizes to Lewinsky  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawyers defending President Clinton in the  
Senate impeachment trial turned down an opportunity to question 
Monica Lewinsky under oath. But in their first face-to-face 
meeting, the White House lawyers offered Lewinsky an apology ``on 
behalf of the president'' for the difficulties the impeachment 
investigation has caused her. The president's team had planned not 
to ask questions if they felt House prosecutors had broken no new 
ground during their four-hour deposition earlier in the day, said 
several Democratic sources. Today's deposition was private but was

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.S. and European envoys failed  
today to win a commitment from Kosovo's rebels to attend peace 
talks described as the ``last chance'' for the combatants to 
resolve their differences. U.S. envoy Christopher Hill said he 
expects an answer from the Kosovo Liberation Army by Wednesday. 
Meanwhile, President Slobodan Milosevic's government in Belgrade 
announced that the hard-line Serbian parliament will decide 
Thursday whether the Serbs will show up for Saturday's conference

	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- An explosion and fire at a power station  
for a huge Ford Motor Co. plant killed one worker and critically 
injured 12 others as crews battled the blaze for hours. Nine more 
workers also were hospitalized. The fire broke out about 1 p.m. at 
the coal-fired plant at Ford's huge River Rouge Complex. The cause 
was being investigated. Gas was shut off at the complex, a standard 
procedure, and there was no evidence the explosion was gas-related.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A federal judge issued a preliminary  
injunction Monday to continue blocking a federal law aimed at 
shielding children from online pornography. U.S. District Judge 
Lowell A. Reed said the Child Online Protection Act could have the 
effect of hindering constitutionally protected speech. Justice 
Department lawyers now must decide whether to appeal the 
preliminary injunction, ask for a full-blown trial or agree to 
allow Reed's decision to become permanent.

<HEADLINE> Goldman Sachs Moves Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MENLO PARK, Calif. (AP) -- Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. moved its  
technology underwriting business from San Francisco to the heart of 
Silicon Valley Monday in an effort to be closer to its clients. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment banking giant has leased a 48,000-square-foot  
building in Menlo Park, Calif., near a number of high-tech 
companies and venture capital firms. Goldman Sachs will keep a 
major office in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Goldman Sachs' technology division handled 15 initial  
public offerings, 20 secondary offerings and 20 mergers and 
acquisitions, with about half of that business in Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradford Koening, co-head of the company's global technology  
group, said technology represents more than 25 percent of the value 
of the domestic stock markets, up from less than 10 percent just 
five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pace of high-technology company formation and growth  
continues at an unprecedented pace,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman is following several of its competitors into Silicon  
Valley. In July 1994, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter opened an office 
in Menlo Park with 15 people, an operation that has grown to 75 
people today. Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Credit Suisse First Boston 
opened Menlo Park offices last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Menlo Park is 25 miles south of San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> IOC Claims Media `Inaccuracies' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The IOC issued a statement today to  
rebut what it described as ``a great number of inaccuracies and 
misrepresentations'' in the media about president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	In a two-page press release, the International Olympic Committee  
listed 12 ``corrections'' to various news reports about Samaranch 
in connection with the widening corruption scandal rocking the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement was released a day before the opening of a world  
summit on drugs in sport, a meeting that IOC officials fear is 
being overshadowed by the scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch told reporters Sunday he was fed up with the  
``rubbish'' written about him in some newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC statement read in full:  
</P>
<P>
	--The IOC president is a volunteer and does not draw a salary for  
his work with the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	--In his 18 years as the IOC president, he has never once  
traveled from Lausanne to Geneva via helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	--When in Lausanne, the IOC president resides in a small suite at  
a cost of 300 Swiss Francs ($211) a night. When he is traveling, 
the room is maintained for him at a discounted rate of 100 Swiss 
Francs ($70) per day. Additionally, the IOC president does not own 
a villa outside Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	--The IOC president asked several years ago that people stop  
referring to him with the diplomatic courtesy title of `excellency' 
from his days of service as Spain's ambassador to the USSR and the 
People's Republic of Mongolia. 
</P>
<P>
	--The IOC president does not request luxury cars, such as stretch  
limousines, to transport him. Bid or host cities select 
transportation for the president. The present requests that his 
hosts do not provide luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
	--The IOC president does not request luxury hotel accommodations,  
in fact, he asks that hosts to do not provide luxury 
accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
	--The only food that the IOC stipulates during the games is the  
quality and diversity of food served at the Olympic Village for the 
athletes, not for IOC members. There are no IOC demands for any 
type of food. 
</P>
<P>
	--The IOC president was Undersecretary of Sports, not a cabinet  
level minister, under Franco. He was later appointed ambassador for 
the new Spanish Republic to the USSR and the People's Republic of 
Mongolia. The IOC president was the first Spanish ambassador to the 
USSR. Reports that he was exiled from Spain are inaccurate and 
unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
	--The president accepts gifts on behalf of the IOC. The gifts are  
either displayed in the Olympic Museum, placed into storage at the 
Olympic Museum or placed into storage at the IOC offices. The 
president also presents many gifts to dignitaries and others as an 
international gesture of goodwill on behalf of the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	--With due respect to the governor of Nagano, there is absolutely  
no record or recollection of any Japanese samurai sword given to 
the IOC president. The IOC has thoroughly checked all of its 
records, conferred with the IOC president, his translator and 
others that were with him on the trip in question, and thoroughly 
checked the archives and records of the Olympic Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Browning Company estimates that the value of the engraved  
rifle presented to the IOC president by the people of Utah to be 
less than $5,000. This rifle is currently located in a storage room 
in the IOC offices. 
</P>
<P>
	--The IOC president's daughter was never involved in the Sydney  
Bid Committee. She was appointed as the honorary attache to the 
Australian National Olympic Team for the Barcelona Games in 1992, 
which has nothing to do with the bid.

<HEADLINE> AXA Buys Guardian Royal Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- French insurer AXA's British subsidiary is buying  
rival Guardian Royal Exchange PLC for about $5.65 billion in a deal 
that will make AXA the third biggest insurer in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will make AXA a major player in the British and Irish  
general insurance markets. Analysts had been eagerly anticipating 
the deal, the latest in a consolidating industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Life said it is confident of getting regulatory approval for  
the deal, which Guardian has agreed to accept. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't anticipate any problems. We don't become dominant in  
any one market,'' said Andy Homer, head of Sun Life's United 
Kingdom general insurance operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Life said that as part of the deal, it will sell Guardian  
Royal Overseas to AXA for $1.594 billion, and will sell Guardian 
Royal U.S. to Liberty Mutual for $1.465 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement said Sun Life will pay 249 pence ($4.08) in  
cash and 0.243 new Sun Life shares for each Guardian share, valuing 
the stock at 389 pence ($6.40) per share. 
</P>
<P>
	To help fund the acquisition, AXA will lend Sun Life up to $3.6  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	AXA has agreed to sell Guardian's German unit to Axa Colonia,  
its 73 percent owned subsidiary, for nearly $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	When the deal is complete, AXA's shareholding in the enlarged  
group will be reduced to about 56 percent from nearly 72 percent. 
Former Guardian shareholders will have a 22 percent stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Life expressed interest in buying Guardian Royal last  
November. In a bid to maximize returns, Guardian Royal's management 
called an auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the weekend, the leading contenders in the Guardian Royal  
auction appeared to be Royal and Sun Alliance and Eureko, an 
alliance of seven European insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Guardian Royal, a general insurer with large motor insurance  
businesses, employs 22,400 people in Britain and 41,000 worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect more mergers in the banking and insurance  
industries as the euro, the common currency now used by 11 European 
nations, gains strength and prompts more ventures between member 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, Societe Generale said it would buy Paribas for  
$17.07 billion in stock, combining two French banking powerhouses.

<HEADLINE> Mir Crew Hopes To Light Earth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The crew of the Russian Mir space station will  
stage what it hopes will be a spectacular experiment Thursday using 
a huge mirror to reflect a beam of sunlight over Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Znamya (Banner) experiment envisages unfolding a space  
mirror made of a membrane covered by a metal layer. In theory, the 
mirror is to work like the moon, reflecting sunlight onto Europe 
and North America, Mission Control spokesman Valery Lyndin said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The mirror, 83 feet in diameter, would serve as a prototype for  
even larger models that may be used to illuminate sun-starved 
northern cities. In the more distant future, such devices may act 
as ``solar sails,'' allowing spaceships to glide through space 
using solar wind. 
</P>
<P>
	If the sky is clear, the space mirror would resemble a shooting  
star racing quickly across the sky, Lyndin said. Clouds would make 
it invisible. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyndin wouldn't say what exact areas would be illuminated during  
the experiment. More detailed information will be released on the 
eve of the experiment, when flight controllers set the precise 
parameters of Mir's orbit, some 200 miles above the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The folded membrane is now attached to a cargo ship docked to  
the station. Mir cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev will 
jettison the Progress cargo ship, guide it to some 400 yards away 
from the station, then send a signal to unfold the mirror. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the mirror is fully open, the crew will steer the Progress  
to hold the spot of light steady and see how the mirror performs. 
The experiment will last for about four hours and for as many Mir 
orbits around the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the cargo ship, which is filled with garbage, will  
be allowed to burn up in the atmosphere as usual. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Russia ran a similar experiment but the crew didn't try  
to maneuver the mirror and it was barely visible only to those who 
knew its position, Lyndin said.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl TV Ratings Dip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons and Denver Broncos don't  
have quite the same appeal as Dallas or Green Bay -- and it showed 
in one of the worst Super Bowl ratings ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox's telecast of the Super Bowl between the Falcons and Broncos  
on Sunday night -- a game essentially over early in the second half 
-- drew a 40.2 national rating, the lowest since 1990. The 61 share 
matched the lowest ever for the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco's victory over Denver in 1990 drew a 39.0 rating;  
Washington's win over Buffalo in 1992 also posted a 61 share. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the game Sunday might have been the last time  
viewers could see Denver quarterback John Elway in action, the 
rating was down 9 percent from NBC's 44.5 last year when the 
Broncos defeated Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 Super Bowl did draw an estimated 127 million viewers in  
the United States, making it the sixth most-watched program in TV 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 Super Bowl featuring Dallas and Pittsburgh was the  
most-watched program in U.S. television history, with more than 138 
million viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the major reasons for the decline in this year's Super  
Bowl ratings was the lack of a top draw. Denver doesn't play in a 
big market such as New York, and the Falcons were playing in their 
first Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The game also lacked excitement after Denver took a big lead in  
their 34-19 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think both certainly played a role,'' said Giles Lundberg,  
Fox senior vice president for marketing and research. ``There was 
not a team in the Super Bowl with the kind of draw of Dallas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, the game posted its highest ratings in the markets of  
the two teams. Atlanta was the top draw with a 58.2/79, while 
Denver was second, with a 51.6/83. 
</P>
<P>
	The peak rating, a 41.5/64, came from 7-7:30 p.m. EST, during  
the second quarter when the outcome of the game was still in doubt. 
That was a far cry from the 50.4/70 that tuned in to see the final 
half hour of Elway's first title run last season. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the number of viewers dropped off significantly during  
the second half when the Broncos put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
	``The interception (of Chris Chandler) in the third quarter  
really made a difference,'' Lundberg said. ``Our audience really 
dropped in the fourth quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-hour pregame held its own in the final three hours  
leading up to the game. From 3:30-6:26 p.m., Fox posted a 14.9 
rating, down from a 15.4 mark for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox began the day with a 30-minute kickoff show at 11 a.m. that  
posted a 2.1 rating. Hardcore Football followed with a 2.7 and 
Keith Olbermann's All-Access gained a 4.1. John Madden's 
All-Millennium Team was the hit of the early part of the day with a 
5.9 rating. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the postgame shows struggled. ``The Family Guy,'' which had  
its premiere immediately after the game, had just a 12.6 rating -- 
the lowest of any programming this decade a post-Super Bowl time 
slot. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the nation  
tuned to a program, and each point represents 994,000 homes. The 
share is the percentage tuned to a program among those televisions 
on at the time.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T, Time Warner Strike Phone Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. has asked federal regulators to  
stop BellSouth Corp. from continuing to market a prepaid card that 
people can use anywhere in the country to make long-distance and 
other phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T contends the arrangement violates a provision of a 1996 law  
that bars BellSouth and the nation's four other regional Bell 
telephone companies from providing long-distance service to their 
local phone customers. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth defended the legality of the card, which the company  
began marketing inside and outside the company's nine-state local 
phone region in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is completely legal,'' said Jim Harralson, general counsel  
for BellSouth Long Distance. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth has been selling various forms of popular prepaid  
cards since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-distance service for the card is being provided by an  
unaffiliated company, U.S. South Communications, although the card 
is being marketed by BellSouth, said BellSouth spokesman Bill 
McCloskey. 
</P>
<P>
	McCloskey did not know how many of the disputed cards, which  
people also can use for local and other phone services, the company 
has sold since December. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T filed its complaint to the Federal Communications  
Commission on Jan. 29, but announced the action Monday. It was 
filed under a new process to quickly resolve disputes. Under that 
process, the FCC must resolve the complaint by March 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law says a Bell company must open its market to  
competitors and get FCC approval before it may provide 
long-distance service to local customers. No Bell has done so. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the FCC declared that separate marketing alliances US  
West Communications Inc. and Ameritech Corp. -- both Bell companies 
-- had with long-distance company, Qwest Communications Corp., 
violated the 1996 law. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the pacts, Qwest paid US West and Ameritech an undisclosed  
recruiting fee for each client in the Baby Bells' local phone 
regions that chose Qwest for long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said the FCC's decision against Ameritech and US West  
bolsters its complaint against BellSouth. But BellSouth disagreed.

<HEADLINE> Smoke Makes Plane Return to Seattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A Tokyo-bound American Airlines jet turned back  
and landed safely after smoke seeped into the cabin from a 
malfunctioning VCR. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire trucks met the MD-11 on Sunday at Seattle-Tacoma  
International Airport but no action was necessary. The plane taxied 
to a gate and passengers got off without incident. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no injuries.  
</P>
<P>
	The pilot reported smoke about an hour out of the airport, but  
the smoke had diminished by the time the plane returned. The smoke 
was caused by a short in an electronics board in the VCR that shows 
in-flight movies, airline spokesman John Hotard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 64 passengers and 13 crew members were flying to Tokyo  
today, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered  
airlines to inspect MD-11s for wiring and insulation problems and 
make any necessary repairs. The directive stemmed from the Sept. 2 
crash of Swissair Flight 111, which plunged into the ocean off Nova 
Scotia 16 minutes after the pilot reported smoke in the cockpit. 
All 229 aboard were killed.

<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh coach Ralph Willard, unwilling to  
wait until March to learn if a string of losing seasons and a 
player arrest would cause him to be fired, resigned Monday 
effective at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Willard will finish out the season -- the Panthers (11-9) play  
Tuesday at Georgetown -- but athletic director Steve Pederson will 
begin searching immediately for a successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Willard's 60-75 record in five seasons is the second worst for a  
Pitt coach this century and includes no NCAA tournament 
appearances, only one winning record and ongoing roster upheaval 
created by the departures of players such as Mark Blount, Andre 
Howard and Michael Gill. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitt moved into the Top 25 early in the season after starting  
6-0 and upsetting defending champion Kentucky, but had lost nine of 
13 before defeating No. 23 Miami 60-54 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the Panthers' already struggling program was  
stained by the arrest of freshman guard Fred Primus for stealing 
$2,200 worth of jewelry during a road trip to Villanova. Primus has 
applied for probation and is back in school, but was kicked off the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Willard also allowed guard Kellii Taylor to rejoin the team  
after missing six games for alcohol rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old Willard blamed media speculation concerning his  
job status and its negative effect on recruiting for his decision 
to quit now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I met (Saturday) with Steve ... to explain our situation and  
tell him I felt it was in the best interests of all concerned that 
I would pursue other opportunities,'' Willard said at a news 
conference held shortly before Pitt left for Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the opportunity to leave several times before, (but) I  
decided it was the best thing for all concerned (to leave now),'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Willard and Pederson said the coach did not ask for a vote of  
confidence, but there was no indication Pederson offered one or 
tried to change Willard's mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Resigning now allows Willard ``to pursue other opportunities''  
and permits Pitt to hire a coach before the NCAA signing period in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson, speaking to reporters after Willard left the room,  
seemed upbeat and positive despite the departure of a coach he 
called ``one of the best in America'' less than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about it ... and I'm confident we can find the  
right coach,'' Pederson said. ``I'm exited about the future here. 
I'm a future guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson did not mention any candidates as a possible successor  
and said he wouldn't comment until a coach was hired. 
</P>
<P>
	Willard was given a five-year contract extension in May 1997  
after rejecting Boston Celtics coach Rick Pitino's offer to become 
the Celtics' general manager. The remaining years of Willard's 
contract will be bought out, Pederson said, under an agreement 
``fair to Ralph and not burdensome to the athletic department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Willard nor Pederson would admit to a strained  
relationship, but athletic department sources told The Associated 
Press last week that problems between the two worsened with the 
Primus arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the sources, Pederson was adamant that Primus be  
thrown off the basketball team immediately, but Willard apparently 
wanted the situation to be reevaluated at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Willard praised Primus and, surprisingly, called the  
incident ``a positive'' for his program. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is looked upon as a black eye, but I didn't consider it an  
embarrassment,'' Willard said. ``The goodness we saw in the young 
man is still there despite the mistake he made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while Pederson said the university would help Primus, of  
Washington, D.C., search for another school, it would not allow him 
to rejoin the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took away Fred Primus' opportunity to be a member of the  
basketball team,'' Pederson said. ``Being on one of our athletic 
teams is a privilege.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willard, a former assistant coach under Pitino at Kentucky  
(1989-90) and with the New York Knicks (1987-89), was 81-42 with 
two NCAA tournament appearances at Western Kentucky from 1990-94 
before replacing Paul Evans at Pitt. Evans had coached five NCAA 
tournament teams in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Willard also was an assistant coach at Syracuse and Hofstra  
following 13 seasons as coach and athletic director at alma mater 
St. Dominic High School in Oyster Bay, N.Y. He also was an 
assistant at the Merchant Marine Academy.

<HEADLINE> Judge Blocks Internet Porn Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A federal judge issued a preliminary  
injunction Monday to continue blocking a federal law aimed at 
shielding children from online pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Lowell A. Reed said the Child Online  
Protection Act could have the effect of hindering constitutionally 
protected speech and issued a preliminary injunction that shields 
Web site operators from prosecution. The judge had issued a 
temporary restraining order in the fall that expired Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps we do the minors of this country harm if First  
Amendment protections, which they will with age inherit fully, are 
chipped away in the name of their protection,'' Reed wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit against the law on  
behalf of 17 clients. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrilled that the judge has realized at this stage that  
our clients have some very credible fears,'' ACLU spokeswoman Emily 
Whitfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers must decide whether to appeal the  
preliminary injunction, ask for a full-blown trial or agree to 
allow Reed's decision to become permanent. Department spokeswoman 
Chris Watney would only say that the department will review the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the bill's sponsors, Rep. James Greenwood, R-Pa., said he  
hopes the law will eventually be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still hope to prevail in the Appeals Court, but if not, we  
will continue to revise this legislation until it passes 
constitutional muster,'' Greenwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, the second major effort by Congress to protect children  
on the Internet, would require commercial Web sites to collect a 
credit card number or some other access code as proof of age before 
allowing Internet users to view online material ``harmful to 
minors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Violators would face penalties of up to six months in jail and  
$150,000 per day in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the measure is a sensible way to keep Internet  
pornography away from children. Unlike the Communications Decency 
Act of 1996, which the Supreme Court struck down, the new law 
applies only to commercial Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed had temporarily blocked enforcement of the law in November.  
In a hearing before Reed last week, the Justice Department argued 
that the law would act as a ``brown paper wrapper'' protecting 
children from pornographic material. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also maintained that requiring Web sites to  
install checkpoint areas in front of pornographic material would be 
easy and inexpensive and would not hurt their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU argued that the law, signed by President Clinton in  
October, violates the First Amendment's free speech guarantee and 
could be used to unfairly prosecute gays and lesbians, AIDS 
activists or doctors distributing gynecological information. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU also says checkpoints could be costly and would deter  
people from visiting affected Web sites, putting some out of 
business.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Falls Sharply / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures fell sharply Monday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade, weighed down by a lack of export demand and ample 
supplies, while corn and soybeans advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat tumbled after Egypt, the largest buyer of U.S. grain,  
again passed over American exporters this weekend in favor of 
French and Australian wheat, boosting concerns that U.S. wheat 
still is too expensive to compete on the open market. Market 
participants also were concerned about the potential for a bumper 
winter wheat crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans shrugged off weakness tied to expectations that  
beneficial weather in South American growing regions has increased 
the potential for competing bumper crops and talk that the U.S. 
Agriculture Department is considering new export subsidies to help 
boost shipments overseas. Corn futures rose in step. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery fell 5 3/4 cents to $2.69 3/4 a bushel; March  
corn rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.15 3/4 a bushel; March oats fell 1/2 cent to 
$1.05 3/4 a bushel; March soybeans rose 1 3/4 cents to $5.08 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and pork futures were mixed on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while feeder cattle retreated on signs of 
ample supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle rose .62 cent to 62.57 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell .13 cent to 72.47 cents a pound; February lean 
hogs rose 1.58 cents to 42.60 cents a pound; February pork bellies 
rose .37 cent to 54.92 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Salutes Black History Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton issued his annual Black  
History Month proclamation Monday, urging the nation to ``not only 
remember the tragic errors of our past, but also celebrate the 
achievements'' of the American descendants of African slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said this year's events should focus on the proud legacy  
of leadership blacks have built over their 350-year history in the 
United States despite the trauma of slavery and 
government-sanctioned segregation. He urged public officials, 
educators, librarians and citizens in general to draw from the 
power of this collective achievement as they seek to resolve racial 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, Clinton listed notable blacks from NAACP  
co-founder W.E.B. DuBois to Martin Luther King Jr., and said all 
Americans could draw from the ``skills, determination and 
indefatigable spirit'' they displayed as they were ``shaped but not 
defeated by their experience of racism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We remember Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth, whose  
powerful firsthand accounts of their lives as slaves and the moral 
strength of their argument helped create the momentum that brought 
an end to slavery in America,'' Clinton said. ``In our own century, 
... we remember the strength of Rosa Parks, who stood up for civil 
rights by sitting down where she belonged. 
</P>
<P>
	``African Americans have been a central element of our national  
identity, and their long journey from the horrors of slavery and 
oppression ... informs our national experience,'' Clinton said. 
``We not only remember the tragic errors of our past, but also 
celebrate the achievements of African Americans and the promise 
they hold for our future as one America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his proclamation, Clinton referred to February as ``National  
African American History Month,'' incorporating the increasingly 
popular reference to black Americans that was advanced by civil 
rights activist Jesse Jackson roughly 10 years ago.

<HEADLINE> 6 China Companies Miss Bond Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUANGZHOU, China (AP) -- At least six state companies in southern  
China have missed repayment of domestic bonds, adding to a string 
of defaults that have burned banks and investors. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the companies are in Guangdong province. The amount  
involved appears to be below 500 million yuan ($60 million) -- far 
less than the 36.15 billion yuan ($4.3 billion) owed by Guangdong 
International Trust and Investment Corp., which failed last month. 
</P>
<P>
	But it could hurt support for domestic bonds China plans to sell  
to finance a spending spree meant to revitalize the slowing 
economy. A fresh blow to confidence would come at a bad time, with 
economic growth expected to fall to 7 percent this year from 7.8 
percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could undermine the Guangdong provincial government's  
ability to raise funds in the domestic bond market,'' said Dong 
Tao, senior regional economist for Credit Suisse First Boston in 
Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest recent default was by Maoming Qinghua Co., an  
acrylic fiber maker. Its underwriter, Guangdong Securities Co., 
said the bond totaled more than 100 million yuan ($12 million). 
</P>
<P>
	A Maoming city official said the city is considering putting the  
company into bankruptcy or merging it with another enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Guangdong province is facing severe cash needs as it struggles  
to bail out bigger state-owned companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Deputy Gov. Wang Qishan said Guangdong may inject as  
much as 30 billion yuan ($3.6 billion) into Guangdong Enterprises 
Ltd., the provincial government's main investment arm in Hong Kong. 
That sum is equal to half the Guangdong government revenue last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Guangdong International Trust is trying to  
renegotiate its debts after announcing in January that it couldn't 
repay them on time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong central bank on Friday urged creditors to  
cooperate in hopes of preventing a rush to call in loans at other 
China-linked Hong Kong firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aggressive collection actions will only be counterproductive  
and make the situation even worse for everyone,'' said a letter to 
banks from David Carse, deputy chief executive of the Hong Kong 
Monetary Authority.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Greece: Don't Keep Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey warned Greece not to give refuge  
Monday to Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who it claimed had 
landed at Athens airport after being rebuffed by the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in Athens immediately denied the charge.  
</P>
<P>
	Early Monday, Ocalan was turned back by Dutch authorities as he  
headed to Rotterdam airport, where 200 Kurds were waiting to 
welcome him. There was no indication where he had come from. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on national radio, Dutch attorney Britta Bohler said  
Ocalan wanted to ask the International Court of Arbitration in The 
Hague to mediate between the Turkish government and Turkey's rebel 
Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Turkey's Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Korkmaz Haktanir  
told reporters that Ocalan was in a private plane in Athens, 
awaiting permission to disembark. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan's quest for a base to lead the Kurdistan Workers Party,  
or PKK, began last year, after Turkey successfully pressured Syria 
into ending years of refuge for him. Ocalan reported left Italy on 
Jan. 16 after two months of trying to win asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect Greece to be loyal to its assurances that it would  
not accept the terrorist leader,'' Haktanir said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Athens, Foreign ministry spokesman Theodoros Theodorou  
insisted no request has been made for Ocalan to come there. Asked 
whether Ocalan was in Greece, he replied ``No, of course not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greece's ambassador, Dimitrios Nezeritis, was summoned twice by  
Turkey's foreign ministry Monday and reiterated that Ocalan was not 
in Greece and that Athens would not let him in. 
</P>
<P>
	The PKK has been at war with Turkey since 1984, in a conflict  
that has killed close to 37,000 people. Turkey has issued an 
international warrant against Ocalan on numerous charges, including 
leading a terrorist organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkish Premier Bulent Ecevit warned nations not to accept  
Ocalan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Welcoming Ocalan means becoming an accomplice to his crimes,''  
Ecevit said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since leaving Italy, Ocalan's whereabouts were unknown although  
reports had placed him in locations ranging from Russia to Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Ecevit claimed that Ocalan had returned to Rome;  
Italian authorities denied that.

<HEADLINE> Chiang Kai-Shek Personals Autioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH NORWALK, Conn. (AP) -- Furnishings from an estate that was  
home to Madame Chiang Kai-Shek, the 101-year-old widow of former 
Chinese leader Chiang Kai-Shek, brought thousands of dollars at 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 420 people registered to bid at the weekend auction at  
Braswell Galleries; several hundred attended and others left sealed 
bids or made bids by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for a few years in the late 1980s and early '90s, Madame  
Chiang has spent most of the years since her husband's 1975 death 
in the United States, mostly at her 36-acre estate at Lattingtown, 
N.Y., an exclusive New York City suburb on Long Island. She 
recently sold the estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Soong Mayling, Madame Chiang became widely known in the  
West as a diplomat and spokeswoman. She headed the Chinese air 
force in the 1930s and sometimes was called the ``brains of 
China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband sometimes sent her to the United States to rally  
support for the Nationalist government, first in their fight 
against the Japanese in World War II and then against the 
Communists. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Communist victory in China, the Chiangs fled to Taiwan,  
declaring the island the seat of China's true government. Most 
countries, including the United States, have since recognized the 
People's Republic of China in Beijing as the legitimate government. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 700 items from the Long Island estate went on the  
auction block Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of French chandeliers sold for $62,500; a clock sold for  
$65,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Collections of ink drawings done by Madame Chiang sold for as  
much as $21,000, and hundreds of more everyday items sold for as 
much as several thousand dollars, gallery spokeswoman Cathy 
Braswell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Madam Chiang last visited Taiwan in 1995 to see an ailing niece.  
Supporters there still observe her birthday.

<HEADLINE> IOC Says No Sydney Bid Probe Opened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
stressed today it had not opened an investigation into Sydney's 
winning bid for the 2000 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC issued a statement to ``correct a false news report''  
from Australia that the commission investigating the Salt Lake City 
bribery scandal had extended its inquiry to Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement reiterated that IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch sent letters to all bidding cities for the games of 1996 
through 2004, asking for any details of misconduct by IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sydney is expected to respond to this letter, as are the other  
bidding cities, before Feb. 15,'' the statement said. ``No further 
official inquiry has been opened, and no decision to open any 
inquiry on past bidding practices will be taken until further 
information is received from the bidding cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC wishes to reiterate that the inquiry into the bidding  
practices of Salt Lake City was based on specific facts and 
documents, not rumors or unfounded allegations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members have resigned or been expelled for receiving  
cash payments, scholarships, medical care and other favors stemming 
from Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney has also come under scrutiny after Australian officials  
admitted they offered $70,000 in inducements to two African IOC 
members the night before the vote for the 2000 Games. Sydney beat 
Beijing by two votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Two high-ranking IOC officials, executive board member Jacques  
Rogge and director general Francois Carrard, are due to visit 
Sydney from Feb. 26-28 to look into the incident. But IOC and 
Sydney officials say the visit does not constitute an inquiry or 
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Book Excerpts Sold With Diet Coke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In an era of mega-bookstores and mega-marketing,  
when many complain the written word is being peddled like a soft 
drink, The Coca-Cola Company and several publishers have decided to 
do just that. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting today, purchasers of 12- and 24-packs of Diet Coke and  
caffeine-free Diet Coke will find colorful booklets enclosed, 
affixed like a straw on a juice box. Each will contain excerpts 
from a new work by a popular writer, among them Elmore Leonard, 
Barbara Taylor Bradford and Lisa Scottoline. 
</P>
<P>
	With 40-45 million such packages planned, that means an enormous  
potential readership. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's terrific. It's a very creative idea,'' said  
Scottoline, author of ``Mistaken Identity'' and other legal 
thrillers. ``I love being in grocery stores. I want to be in gas 
stations. My goal as an author is to be read.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all of us around New York City publishing brightened  
up when we heard about this,'' said Cathy Hemming, executive vice 
president and publisher of HarperCollins. ``It's unusual to have 
the opportunity to reach that many consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diet Coke drinkers also will have the chance to submit 500-word  
essays, fact or fiction, on ``Living Life to the Fullest.'' The 
contest, which ends March 12, offers an all-expense paid trip for 
two to New York City, ``the chance to live the life of a 
best-selling author.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The visit will include a tour of HarperCollins and meetings with  
professional editors to discuss the winner's writing. The winning 
story, along with those of the 24 finalists, will be packaged as a 
virtual book on the Diet Coke Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``The beverage industry is a very crowded field and every year  
the big beverage companies plan a vast array of promotions,'' said 
John Sicher, editor and publisher of the trade publication Beverage 
Digest. ``Any promotion that stands out and draws attention to the 
brand by definition is successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Putman, a Coca-Cola executive, said research indicates Diet  
Coke drinkers may be better educated and more affluent than other 
soft drink consumers. They also tended to read more books. 
</P>
<P>
	``Across the board, our consumers said they liked empowerment  
stories, underdog stories. They also were looking for thrilling 
stories and mysteries,'' said Putman, managing director for 
carbonated soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	From Walt Whitman endorsing his own brand of cigars to John  
Irving contributing an original story for an Absolut vodka 
promotion, the writing world has a long history with the world of 
advertisement. A major reason newspapers started book review 
sections, at the turn of the century, was to create space for 
publishing ads. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Diet Coke campaign is an especially blunt presentation  
of the printed word as commerce. And not all publishing houses 
think that's a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tend to be a bit traditional,'' said Laurie Brown, vice  
president of marketing for Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, whose writers 
include National Book Award winners Alice McDermott and Edward 
Ball. ``It will always depend on the book and the author, but 
generally the house thinks of itself in a slightly different way 
and probably wouldn't participate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the writers involved with the Diet Coke campaign are  
being paid-- although Bradford said she will do some promotion. And, 
unlike Irving, none have tailored their work for the product. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Levine, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, likens the Diet  
Coke booklets to the poems that appear on subway trains in New York 
City: Not the most dignified way to get your work read, but better 
than not being read at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I'd have any objections to having my work used  
by Diet Coke,'' Levine mused. ``But I would also expect some 
remuneration. They must make hundreds of millions of dollars and I 
make a pittance. They're using it to promote their rotten drink, so 
maybe I can get some subsistence from them to promote my rotten 
career.''

<HEADLINE> German Unions Stage Warn Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Thousands of autoworkers laid down  
their tools in warning strikes Monday to press their demand for 6.5 
percent pay increases, while employers got backing for their calls 
for lower raises from a leading economist. 
</P>
<P>
	Contract talks resumed in Bremen for the northern states between  
employers and the IG Metall union, Germany's biggest. Talks in 
Baden-Wuerttemberg state, home of DaimlerChrysler, were set for 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	IG Metall planned warning strikes all week to increase pressure  
on employers, who have offered 2 percent pay increases. The 
contract affects some 3.4 million workers in the metal-working and 
electrical industries, including the country's big automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's biggest demonstration was at Ford in Cologne, where  
about 11,000 workers laid down their tools temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers say excessive pay hikes would be foolhardy as Germany  
faces shrinking growth -- 2 percent compared to 1998's 2.8 percent -- 
and chronically high unemployment at 10.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Two leading economists backed their position Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Herbert Hax, chairman of the government's independent Council of  
Economic Advisers, said on German radio that current pay demands 
were ``poison'' for job creation and had wrecked any confidence in 
moderate wage policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hax blamed the government for encouraging unions to make big pay  
demands. Its theory that more pay will lead to more demand and 
increase industrial output meant that for the first time a 
government was backing excessive pay rises, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the government has been cautious about commenting on wage  
talks, Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine has repeatedly called for 
a mix of fiscal, monetary and wage policy to boost domestic demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Hax rejected union assertions that their restraint in the last  
wage talks failed to make a dent in unemployment, saying ``one 
can't expect that it shows results so quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But IG Metall says the 2 percent offer is far too low after  
years of rising company profits, and that an offer of an extra 0.5 
percent from firms that can afford it is an attempt to reduce the 
unions' bargaining power by making wage increases dependent on 
company profits. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200,000 IG Metall workers walked off their jobs on  
Friday, after a no-strike pledge expired Thursday. The union says 
it will call a full strike vote among its members unless there's a 
contract by Feb. 11.

<HEADLINE> Rev.'s Mailing Results Embarrassing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- It seemed like an ingenious marketing move:  
Give $1 million to the National Baptist Convention USA in exchange 
for the names and addresses of its 8.3 million members -- all 
potential customers. 
</P>
<P>
	But George Burke's business deal backfired. After buying the  
lists, his insurance company's marketing letters were sent to, 
among others, a grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan and the 
non-Baptist chief executive officer of his parent company. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of the most embarrassing moments of my career,''  
said Burke, senior vice president of marketing for Globe Accident 
and Life Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Within days of sending the direct mail solicitation, the company  
weathered a storm of complaints from non-Baptists who received the 
mailing, Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke testified Friday in the racketeering trial of the Rev.  
Henry Lyons, the Baptist convention's president, and Bernice 
Edwards, his alleged mistress. They are accused of faking 
membership figures to swindle more than $4 million from companies 
to buy fancy cars, expensive jewelry and classy homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial resumes today  
</P>
<P>
	Globe, a direct mail company based in Oklahoma City, paid a  
total of $1 million for mailing lists, based on Lyons' claim that 
the group had 8.5 million members, former Globe marketing official 
Robert Richey testified. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the convention has fewer than 1 million members, and  
made up the phony lists to pad the numbers, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys contend that the agreement between the Baptist  
convention and the insurance company was simply a deal gone sour -- 
not a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Before sending the mailing, Globe conducted a telephone survey  
of 861 people on the list, Burke said. Just 25 percent of those 
surveyed were members of convention churches, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 10,000 policies were sold through the mailing, but it  
was not enough for Globe to generate a profit, Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it was a loss of a little over $1 million,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE>  Willard Resigns As Pitt's Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh coach Ralph Willard, unwilling to  
wait until March to learn if a string of losing seasons and a 
player arrest would cause him to be fired, resigned Monday 
effective at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Willard will finish out the season -- the Panthers (11-9) play  
Tuesday at Georgetown -- but athletic director Steve Pederson will 
begin searching immediately for a successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Willard's 60-75 record in five seasons is the second worst for a  
Pitt coach this century and includes no NCAA tournament 
appearances, only one winning record and ongoing roster upheaval 
created by the departures of players such as Mark Blount, Andre 
Howard and Michael Gill. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitt moved into the Top 25 early in the season after starting  
6-0 and upsetting defending champion Kentucky, but had lost nine of 
13 before defeating No. 23 Miami 60-54 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the Panthers' already struggling program was  
stained by the arrest of freshman guard Fred Primus for stealing 
$2,200 worth of jewelry during a road trip to Villanova. Primus has 
applied for probation and is back in school, but was kicked off the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Willard also allowed guard Kellii Taylor to rejoin the team  
after missing six games for alcohol rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old Willard blamed media speculation concerning his  
job status and its negative effect on recruiting for his decision 
to quit now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I met (Saturday) with Steve ... to explain our situation and  
tell him I felt it was in the best interests of all concerned that 
I would pursue other opportunities,'' Willard said at a news 
conference held shortly before Pitt left for Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the opportunity to leave several times before, (but) I  
decided it was the best thing for all concerned (to leave now),'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Willard and Pederson said the coach did not ask for a vote of  
confidence, but there was no indication Pederson offered one or 
tried to change Willard's mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Resigning now allows Willard ``to pursue other opportunities''  
and permits Pitt to hire a coach before the NCAA signing period in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson, speaking to reporters after Willard left the room,  
seemed upbeat and positive despite the departure of a coach he 
called ``one of the best in America'' less than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about it ... and I'm confident we can find the  
right coach,'' Pederson said. ``I'm exited about the future here. 
I'm a future guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson did not mention any candidates as a possible successor  
and said he wouldn't comment until a coach was hired. 
</P>
<P>
	Willard was given a five-year contract extension in May 1997  
after rejecting Boston Celtics coach Rick Pitino's offer to become 
the Celtics' general manager. The remaining years of Willard's 
contract will be bought out, Pederson said, under an agreement 
``fair to Ralph and not burdensome to the athletic department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Willard nor Pederson would admit to a strained  
relationship, but athletic department sources told The Associated 
Press last week that problems between the two worsened with the 
Primus arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the sources, Pederson was adamant that Primus be  
thrown off the basketball team immediately, but Willard apparently 
wanted the situation to be reevaluated at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Willard praised Primus and, surprisingly, called the  
incident ``a positive'' for his program. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is looked upon as a black eye, but I didn't consider it an  
embarrassment,'' Willard said. ``The goodness we saw in the young 
man is still there despite the mistake he made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while Pederson said the university would help Primus, of  
Washington, D.C., search for another school, it would not allow him 
to rejoin the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took away Fred Primus' opportunity to be a member of the  
basketball team,'' Pederson said. ``Being on one of our athletic 
teams is a privilege.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willard, a former assistant coach under Pitino at Kentucky  
(1989-90) and with the New York Knicks (1987-89), was 81-42 with 
two NCAA tournament appearances at Western Kentucky from 1990-94 
before replacing Paul Evans at Pitt. Evans had coached five NCAA 
tournament teams in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Willard also was an assistant coach at Syracuse and Hofstra  
following 13 seasons as coach and athletic director at alma mater 
St. Dominic High School in Oyster Bay, N.Y. He also was an 
assistant at the Merchant Marine Academy.

<HEADLINE> Astros Get Everett for $2.4 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Astros avoided a salary arbitration  
hearing with outfielder Carl Everett by agreeing Monday to a $2.4 
million, one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Everett, 27, was among the team's biggest surprises last season,  
helping the Astros win the NL Central by hitting .296 with 15 home 
runs and 76 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	He made $1,075,000 last year and had asked for $2.9 million in  
arbitration. The Astros had offered $1.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Everett set career highs in nearly every offensive category  
despite splitting time for much of the season with highly touted 
rookie Richard Hidalgo. Everett was acquired from the New York Mets 
after the 1997 season for reliever John Hudek. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston has two players remaining in arbitration: infielder  
Ricky Gutierrez and closer Billy Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-eight players overall are still in arbitration. The first  
hearing is scheduled for Friday.

<HEADLINE> Eaton Buying Aeroquip-Vickers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Seeking a more dominant position in the  
business of industrial hydraulics, Eaton Corp. has agreed to buy 
Aeroquip-Vickers Inc. for about $1.7 billion, or $58 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	In its largest acquisition ever, Eaton is paying a 65 percent  
premium for Aeroquip-Vickers, whose stock closed Friday at $35.25. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange,  
Aeroquip-Vickers stock shot up $20.75 a share, to $56, while Eaton 
fell $2.81 1/4 a share to $66.18 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Aeroquip-Vickers, based Maumee, Ohio, includes Aeroquip Corp.,  
which sold $1.1 billion worth of hoses and couplings last year, and 
Vickers Inc., which had $1.1 billion in industrial hydraulics 
sales. It has 15,000 employees and 50 plants in 15 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Darryl F. Allen, chairman of Aeroquip-Vickers, said the combined  
company would be a stronger competitor in the hydraulics and hose 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear that to successfully compete, a firm must supply  
complete product lines and global platforms,'' he said. ``At $2.2 
billion (in annual sales) Aeroquip-Vickers is too small to realize 
the full advantage of its strengths. Adding Aeroquip-Vickers to 
Eaton, however, creates an impressive force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton, based in Cleveland, has 49,500 employees in 25 countries  
and 1998 sales of $6.6 billion. Its products include truck 
transmissions, electrical controls and engine components. 
</P>
<P>
	The takeover will help Eaton compete against industrial  
hydraulics leader Parker Hannifin Corp. of Cleveland, said Kent 
Mortensen, vice president of Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. Inc. in 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are still No. 2, but they're a much more formidable  
competitor with a broader product line,'' Mortensen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton chairman Stephen R. Hardis acknowledged that the premium  
was high, but added, ``We thought their stock was undervalued.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardis said the takeover will yield annual savings of $120  
million within five years, but said it was too early to say whether 
the acquisition will lead to layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Directors of both companies have approved the deal, which is  
subject to a vote by Aeroquip-Vickers stockholders. The deal should 
be completed in April, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Wards To Emerge From Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Montgomery Ward &AMP; Co. Inc. reached an agreement  
with a committee of creditors that should let the struggling 
retailer emerge from bankruptcy proceedings by midyear. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the plan announced Monday, GE Capital, a major  
creditor, will acquire Wards' profitable direct marketing arm, The 
Signature Group. Wards will then place a yet-to-be-determined sum 
into a fund to settle court-approved claims by creditors other than 
GE Capital, which will end up with a stake in the retailer in 
exchange for its claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under the proposed plan, Wards will have the opportunity to  
rebuild, Signature will accelerate its growth outside of the Wards 
customer base, and creditors will see an immediate recovery,'' said 
Edward Stewart, executive vice president of GE Capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Wards has been operating under court protection from creditors  
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since July 1997. That 
section of the bankruptcy law allows for a company to continue 
operations and attempt to reorganize its finances under court 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	Wards has struggled in recent years, losing business to discount  
chains, including Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart, that attract 
consumers with their wide range of merchandise at affordable 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The 127-year-old privately owned retailer announced Jan. 15 that  
it would close 39 stores and cut about 4,000 jobs as part of a 
restructuring plan aimed at boosting profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs represent about 9 percent of the company's work  
force of 45,000. Ward's will have 252 stores after the closings. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, it began to implement a new design that completely  
revamped the inside of its stores to make it easier for shoppers to 
move from department to department.

<HEADLINE> Judge To Rule on Internet Porn Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A judge who temporarily blocked a federal  
law aimed at shielding children from online pornography was 
expected to decide Monday whether to issue a more permanent delay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Child Online Protection Act, the second major effort by  
Congress to protect children on the Internet, is scheduled to go 
into effect at midnight unless U.S. District Judge Lowell A. Reed 
issued a preliminary injunction, which would pave the way for a 
full trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The law would require commercial Web sites to collect a credit  
card number or some other access code as proof of age before 
allowing Internet users to view online material deemed ``harmful to 
minors.'' Violators could be fined $150,000 a day and get up to six 
months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	As he waited for a ruling Monday, the owner of a chain of gay-  
and lesbian-themed bookstores that does some of its business online 
made plans to take down the company's Web site if the law was 
permitted to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Laurila, founder and owner of A Different Light, which  
has bookstores in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, said he 
feared prosecution or civil lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not ready to go to jail. I have stores to run,'' said  
Laurila, whose Web site offers 21,000 titles, many with sexually 
explicit themes. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the measure is a sensible way to keep Internet  
pornography away from children. Unlike the Communications Decency 
Act of 1996, which the Supreme Court struck down, the new law 
applies only to commercial Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	In a six-day hearing before Judge Reed late last month, the  
Justice Department argued that the law would act as a ``brown paper 
wrapper'' protecting children from pornographic material. The 
government also maintained that requiring Web sites to install 
certain checkpoints in front of pornographic material would be easy 
and inexpensive and would not hurt their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union filed the suit on behalf of  
17 clients. The group argued the law, signed by President Clinton 
in October, violates the First Amendment's free speech guarantee 
and could be used to unfairly prosecute gays and lesbians, AIDS 
activists or doctors distributing gynecological information. The 
ACLU also says checkpoints could be costly and would deter people 
from visiting affected Web sites, putting some out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	It also believes that a bill aimed mainly at pornographic Web  
sites might inadvertently snare mainstream sites.

<HEADLINE> Sadie Delany Remembered As Pioneer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Sadie Delany, a slave's daughter who  
overcame challenges of race, gender and age and became a 
best-selling author at age 104, came home Monday to be buried near 
her sister and writing partner. 
</P>
<P>
	About 275 people filled a small stone chapel Monday to celebrate  
the life of Sarah L. ``Sadie'' Delany. She and her sister, Dr. 
Annie Elizabeth ``Bessie'' Delany, were centenarian authors who 
wrote ``Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years'' with 
journalist Amy Hill Hearth. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1993 book, which chronicled what life was like for blacks  
before the civil rights movement, became a top seller, inspired a 
Broadway play and has been used as a college text. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Delany, 109, died last week at her home in Mount Vernon,  
N.Y., a New York City suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Delany's great-grand niece told mourners Monday that like so  
many strangers, she came to know a side of her relative by reading 
the book. Until then, Brandi Delany said, she thought Aunt Sadie 
was just a retired home economics teacher, a ``sweet aunt who acted 
far younger than her age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the book showed that her Aunt Sadie was a pioneer, far  
ahead of her time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to know that Aunt Sadie has gone to be reunited with  
her father, mother and nine brothers and sisters,'' Brandi Delany 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nephew Henry B. Delany V of Detroit said Ms. Delany was generous  
in what counted: ``Time, love and kindness. She gave a lot of 
those.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Having Our Say'' relates the sisters' observations of a  
century of black American history as they lived it, first as young 
girls in the South, later as career women in New York's Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
	There were matter-of-fact references to the degradation the  
sisters witnessed: the post-slavery years, lynchings, ``Jim Crow'' 
segregation laws. Bessie was nearly lynched once, as a young woman, 
after a run-in with a white person at a railroad station. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also triumphs -- their pride in the 1960s civil rights  
movement and their success in the working world when most women 
stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never let prejudice stop me from what I wanted to do in this  
life,'' Sadie once said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters, who described themselves as ``best friends from day  
one,'' and their eight brothers and sisters grew up on the campus 
of St. Augustine's College, where Monday's funeral took place. 
</P>
<P>
	Their father, freed from slavery as a child, became a vice  
principal of the school. All 10 of his children went on to attend 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters, neither of whom ever married, moved to New York  
after they graduated from St. Augustine's. Sadie Delany earned a 
master's degree in education from Columbia University and became 
the first black domestic-science teacher in New York City's public 
schools. Bessie Delany became a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
	After their first success as authors, the women followed with  
``The Delany Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom.'' Then after her 
sister's death, Sadie Delany wrote a third book: ``On My Own at 
107: Reflections on Life Without Bessie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the burial, the Rev. Thomas Logan Jr. said he had asked  
someone to show him where on campus Ms. Delany was born. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he thought it was appropriate ``that we would take soil  
from the land where her house was built'' and place it on her 
casket, which he did as he chanted ``earth to earth, ashes to 
ashes, dust to dust.''

<HEADLINE> Is Your PC a Model T? Soup It Up! </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Five years ago, your CPU stood tall as the biggest, baddest dude  
on the block. But now, all the Pentium IIs kick silicon in its face 
as they race along the digital shore. 
</P>
<P>
	And never mind your CPU's declining power. The muscle in your  
wallet couldn't lift a gnat, and those sexy new systems are $2,000 
and up -- way, way up. 
</P>
<P>
	What to do? The same thing kids with jalopies did in the '50s:  
Soup it up yourself. 
</P>
<P>
	With some effort, and a relatively small amount of cash, you can  
put the zoom back into your PC. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider the major components of a typical multimedia PC: CPU;  
motherboard (that big, flat, green thing that houses all the other 
boards); video card; floppy, hard and CD-ROM drives; sound card; 
and memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Chances are, you're probably happy with everything but the  
processor speed. It's not unlike having an otherwise nice car 
powered by an in-line six. So, swap engines. 
</P>
<P>
	First thing to select is the motherboard. I went shopping online  
at a major computer retailer and found a Diamond Micronics C400 
motherboard for $136.95. It will handle Intel Celeron CPUs in the 
233-333 megahertz range, and Pentium IIs from 233 to 450 megahertz. 
</P>
<P>
	It supports ISA, PCI and Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) bus,  
has five PCI slots (32 bits) and two 16-bit ISA slots. It supports 
IDE drives, pretty much the standard for drive management, and a 
wide range of memory speeds, and throws two USB (Universal Serial 
Bus) ports into the bargain. (USB is the current rage for hooking 
up peripherals; some peripherals even support it.) 
</P>
<P>
	There's more, too much to detail here.  
</P>
<P>
	Next comes the CPU. Be sure the new one will work with the new  
motherboard. Although the Celeron line offers great value, this 
particular motherboard won't handle a 400 megahertz Celeron, and, 
hey, you only live once, so let's go to a 400 megahertz Pentium II 
for $460.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices vary, but so far we're out about $600.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, can you make the switch yourself?  
</P>
<P>
	If you've been comfortable doing things like installing cards or  
adding memory, give it a shot. You'll have to remove the 
motherboard from your existing system, making sure to disconnect it 
from the power supply and all other devices first. And then you'll 
have to install the new motherboard and CPU, and reinstall all 
cards and drive connections. Budget four hours and think twice 
before acting once. Pay careful attention to understanding 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	If you don't want to open the machine cover, check local  
retailers. If you find one that installs, even for an additional 
charge, that's the worry-free way to go. 
</P>

	Lewinsky Finishes Deposition  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors and the White House legal  
team questioned Monica Lewinsky under oath today in a deposition 
for President Clinton's impeachment trial. The questioning, which 
lasted about five hours, was conducted privately at the Mayflower 
Hotel, but was videotaped for senators weighing the impeachment 
charges. Senators can view the tape as early as tomorrow, and 
excerpts could end up being shown as part of the trial. Or senators 
could vote to bring Ms. Lewinsky to the floor for live testimony 
about her relationship with Clinton and attempts to conceal it. 

</P>
<P>
	Republicans Taking Hit in Polls  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic strategists are crowing about  
current polls that show almost six out of 10 people disapprove of 
how Senate Republicans are handling the impeachment trial. 
Two-thirds of the public approves of the way Clinton is doing his 
job, according to several polls. Some polls also show Democrats are 
getting better marks on handling top issues. A Pew poll taken in 
mid January gave Democrats a marked advantage on who has the best 
ideas on education, HMO reform and Social Security. Democrats had 
an edge in the traditionally strong Republican area of tax cuts. 

</P>
<P>
	Two Killed in Ford Plant Explosion  
</P>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- An explosion and fire rocked a generating  
station for a huge Ford Motor Co. plant today, killing at least two 
people and injuring at least 23, some critically. Two workers also 
were unaccounted for, Ford said in a statement. The cause of the 
explosion is being investigated. Dearborn police cordoned off the 
area around the plant and said they were being cautious because 
they feared there could be a second explosion, an officer said. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Sends Budget to Congress  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton sent Congress a $1.77  
trillion spending plan today for 2000, opening what's sure to be a 
bitter struggle with the Republican-led Congress. Clinton's budget 
projects a record $117 billion surplus that would be used to 
bolster Social Security and shower billions in new spending on 
programs from child care to the Pentagon. The GOP prefers using 
part of the surpluses for across-the-board tax cuts. 

</P>
<P>
	Planned Kosovo Talks' Fate Unclear  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.S. and European envoys failed  
today to persuade Kosovo's rebels to attend peace talks described 
as the ``last chance'' for the combatants to resolve their 
differences. U.S. envoy Christopher Hill said he expected an answer 
from the Kosovo Liberation Army by Wednesday. Meanwhile, the 
government in Belgrade announced that the Serbian parliament will 
decide Thursday whether the Serbs will show up for Saturday's 
conference in France. NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana 
described the conference as ``the last chance to reach peace in 
Kosovo,'' adding that foreign ``ground troops would need to be 
deployed in order to enforce any agreement.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu, Rivals Hassle Over Words  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's new  
campaign slogan -- ``a strong leader for a strong people'' -- 
prompted an outcry today from political rivals who contended the 
message evoked memories of Nazi Germany. Netanyahu countered that 
his challengers have used the same kind of language in their own 
campaigns and could be accused of conducting ``Hitler-style 
propaganda.'' The argument led to an appeal to all sides to keep 
the Nazi slaughter of 6 million Jews out of Israeli politics.

	Stocks Higher; Dow Up 18.79  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were higher this afternoon as both  
blue chips and broad indexes were supported by stronger technology 
shares. Just before the close, the Dow industrials were up 18.79 at 
9,377.62. On the NYSE, losers led gainers 1,606-1,379. The Nasdaq 
was up 16.75 at 2,522.64.

	IOC Approves Ethics Committee  
</P>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The IOC, wracked by its biggest  
ethics scandal, now has its first ethics commission and code of 
conduct. The two measures were adopted today by the IOC executive 
board during a special meeting. The five-member panel would include 
three officials from outside the International Olympic Committee. 
It will eventually replace the commission formed to investigate 
allegations of misconduct stemming from Salt Lake City's winning 
bid for 2002.

	Elway: 90 Percent Chance I'm Gone  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway says there's  
``a 90 percent chance I'm going to quit,'' but ``the last thing I 
want to do is shut the door.'' Elway has admitted the opportunity 
for an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl title is appealing. 
The 38-year-old quarterback yesterday completed 18 of 29 passes for 
336 yards, and threw for one touchdown and ran for another in his 
fifth Super Bowl appearance.

<HEADLINE> Charge Dropped in Wash. Baby Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ANGELES, Wash. (AP) -- Prosecutors today dropped a  
second-degree murder charge against a pediatrician accused of 
killing a 3-day-old baby in a hospital emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge against Dr. Eugene Turner was dismissed without  
prejudice, which means it could be filed again. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner, 62, was charged in the death of Conor Shamus McInnerney,  
who was rushed to Olympic Memorial Hospital on Jan. 12, 1998, when 
he stopped breathing. Conor's parents, Martin and Michelle 
McInnerney, filed a $1.5 million damage claim against Olympic 
Memorial in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner said the baby was brain-dead when he put his hand over  
the child's nose and mouth to stop reflexive or ``agonal'' 
breathing after efforts at resuscitation failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts lined up on both sides of the issue, and Turner received  
an outpouring of community support. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to dismiss the charge was made by Jim Townsend, a  
deputy prosecutor from Snohomish County tapped to hear the case 
when former Clallam County prosecutor Jim Bruneau lost his 
re-election bid last fall. The Turner case had been an issue in the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial was to have been heard by an outside judge as well.  
Michael Rickert of Skagit County Superior Court was presiding in 
Clallam County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	In March the state Medical Quality Assurance Commission accused  
Turner of unprofessional conduct, allowing him to keep his medical 
license but ordering that another doctor be present any time he 
attempted a resuscitation. He voluntarily surrendered his hospital 
privileges but continued to operate his Peninsula Children's 
Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	His case before the commission is still pending. After today's  
action, Turner said some of the evidence that came forth will help 
in resolving the matter there.

<HEADLINE>  Women's Super-G Postponed in Vail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Snow and wind forced postponement Monday of  
the women's super-G, the first scheduled event of the World Alpine 
Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow began falling in the Vail Valley at sunrise and, with only  
intermittent breaks, continued into the afternoon. With only a 
couple hours of dependable light remaining, the race jury decided 
to postpone the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury, responsible only to itself in determining whether a  
race be run, was concerned as much with the six inches of snow that 
had accumulated alongside the racing line as with the inch or so 
that built up on the course between the waves of course workers 
working to scrape it away. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the right decision,'' said Svein Mundal of Norway,  
the International Ski Federation (FIS) technical delegate for the 
race. ``There was poor visibility and a lot of snow made it hard to 
hold a good line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In flat lighting conditions as was the case Monday, workers  
scatter pine boughs over a race course to help racers see. But, 
Mundal noted, ``The pin boughs were disappearing under the snow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury met later Monday and decided to reschedule the race for  
Wednesday, a day set aside on the two-week program for downhill 
training for men and women. The men's super-G is scheduled Tuesday 
at Beaver Creek, about 10 miles west of Vail. 
</P>
<P>
	Gian-Franco Kasper, head of FIS, which is putting on the  
biennial competition, said Monday morning that variable wind and 
not snow most concerned the jury. But then the steady snowfall 
began to defeat worker efforts to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
	Megan Ganong of Olympic Valley, Calif., one of the forerunners  
for the race, was sent down the course to give the jury a racer's 
view of the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``You couldn't see at all at the top,'' Ganong said. ``I was  
surprised because there was a lot more (new) snow on the course 
than I thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was a brief break in the cloud cover in the early  
afternoon, drawing a roar from the packed grandstands surrounding 
the finish area. But the break was shortlived and another bank of 
clouds moved in, dooming the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``This happens all the time,'' said Caroline Lalive of Steamboat  
Springs, one of the four Americans in the 43-racer starting field. 
``It's a hurry-up-and-wait game. If it doesn't happen today, it'll 
happen tomorrow. It's no big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The snow followed a week of spring-like weather, in which the  
world's best racers trained while basking in sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
	Regine Cavagnoud of France, one of the gold-medal favorites,  
applauded the decision to postpone ``because the conditions were 
too changing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a hard decision to start the race when conditions are not  
fair,'' she said. ``Today we had rain, wind, snow, sun; in these 
conditions it was impossible to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sara-Maude Boucher of Canada was disappointed ``because I was  
ready to race today. But it's OK because I'm just back from Europe 
and one more day of rest is good for me. It's part of skiing, so 
you can't get in a bad mood because of that.''

<HEADLINE> Colombians Bury Last of Quake Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARMENIA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombian morgue workers buried the  
last unclaimed bodies of earthquake victims Monday and authorities 
began the monumental task of rebuilding -- a week after an 
earthquake flattened most of this city and killed nearly 1,000 
people across the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers pulled 29 corpses in black plastic body bags -- the only  
unidentified victims among the hundreds of dead -- from a 
refrigerated truck, transferred them to coffins, and buried them in 
a mass grave in Armenia's only cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, medical workers took teeth and blood samples from the  
bodies for use in future DNA identifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombian rescuers ended their search for survivors, saying it  
was unlikely anyone else would be found alive, according to Ariel 
Ospina, the head of Red Cross operations here. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities prepared for the long recovery ahead in Colombia's  
coffee country, where the magnitude-6 quake on Jan. 25 was 
centered. Some official estimates say it could be 10-15 years 
before the region recovers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, we begin the task of material reconstruction and mental  
recuperation,'' said Gov. Henry Gomez of Quindio state, of which 
Armenia is the capital. ``We should generate jobs and get things 
back to normal to chase away the uncertainty about the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet about 200,000 people are homeless in the region and depend  
on government handouts. Emergency food will last only a week more, 
and after that, people will have to fend for themselves, says the 
government's Solidarity Network aid organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Four thousand people are injured, and the government needs to  
rebuild 35,000 houses either destroyed by the quake or rendered too 
dangerous to leave standing. 
</P>
<P>
	If past experience is any guide, the recovery will take a long  
time. In the southern state of Cauca, people who lost their homes 
in a June 1994 earthquake are still waiting for the government to 
fulfill promises to give them land to build on. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how long she planned to live under a crude lean-to of  
plastic sheeting in front of her house, 45-year-old Gilma Geraldo 
burst into tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even have the courage to think about that,'' she said.  
``It will be months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, workers brought in heavy machinery to begin  
demolishing 18 buildings in danger of toppling. Another 65 were on 
the list for demolition, said Gustavo Canal, director of the 
government highway agency INVIAS. 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Nohra de Pastrana, who is heading the national relief  
effort, called on people and companies to send equipment and tools 
to smaller towns that don't have resources to knock down damaged 
buildings and clear thousands of tons of debris. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has earmarked $300 million to begin rebuilding  
and is waiting for international credit authorizations for $100 
million more. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and soldiers remained on alert after last week's rioting  
and looting in Armenia, the hardest-hit city which is about 60 
percent destroyed. While the violence has calmed, authorities said 
it could flare up again. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still criminal gangs trying to take advantage of the  
tragedy,'' reconstruction coordinator Luis Carlos Villegas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Downtown blocks were cordoned off to prevent looting. Military  
police controlled pedestrian traffic, and long lines of shopkeepers 
and workers formed, eager to get a peek at their shops and stalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Omar Castro, who said he had about $300 worth of candy and  
cigarettes at his market stall, said, ``I'm going to take away 
whatever I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some signs of normalcy sprang up.  
</P>
<P>
	A downtown insurance company was open for business for the first  
time since the earthquake hit. Manager Claudia Velez Botero said 
about a dozen earthquake-related claims had come in, mainly for 
destroyed houses and cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a regular business day,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Top 3 Unchanged in Women's Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tennessee, Purdue and Louisiana Tech remained the top three  
teams today in The Associated Press women's basketball poll, which 
had two new teams at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana State and Florida International joined the poll for  
the first time this season. LSU's inclusion gave the Southeastern 
Conference five teams in the Top 25, more than any other league. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee (19-1) received 40 of 41 first-place votes and 1,024  
points from a national media panel to lead the poll for the fourth 
straight week and fifth time overall this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lady Vols, eyeing a fourth straight national championship,  
ran their winning streak to 18 with victories over two ranked 
teams: Georgia and Alabama. Their only loss this season was to 
Purdue, which received the other first-place vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue (19-1) had 981 points, while Louisiana Tech (17-2), which  
has lost only to Tennessee and Purdue, had 947. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia lost to Mississippi State in addition to Tennessee and  
fell four places to eighth. The teams ranked four through seven 
each moved up one spot: Connecticut, Colorado State, Notre Dame and 
UCLA. 
</P>

North Carolina, Virginia Tech and Iowa State, followed by Virginia, 
Clemson, Penn State, Auburn and Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama, Kansas, UC Santa Barbara, LSU and Florida International  
claimed the final five spots. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU (15-5) has won three of its last four, the latest a 63-61

<HEADLINE>  Women's Super-G Postponed in Vail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Snow and wind forced postponement Monday of  
the women's super-G, the first scheduled event of the World Alpine 
Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow began falling in the Vail Valley at sunrise and, with only  
intermittent breaks, continued into the afternoon. With only a 
couple hours of dependable light remaining, the race jury decided 
to postpone the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury, responsible only to itself in determining whether a  
race be run, was concerned as much with the six inches of snow that 
had accumulated alongside the racing line as with the inch or so 
that built up on the course between the waves of course workers 
working to scrape it away. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the right decision,'' said Svein Mundal of Norway,  
the International Ski Federation (FIS) technical delegate for the 
race. ``There was poor visibility and a lot of snow made it hard to 
hold a good line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In flat lighting conditions as was the case Monday, workers  
scatter pine boughs over a race course to help racers see. But, 
Mundal noted, ``The pin boughs were disappearing under the snow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury met later Monday and decided to reschedule the race for  
Wednesday, a day set aside on the two-week program for downhill 
training for men and women. The men's super-G is scheduled Tuesday 
at Beaver Creek, about 10 miles west of Vail. 
</P>
<P>
	Gian-Franco Kasper, head of FIS, which is putting on the  
biennial competition, said Monday morning that variable wind and 
not snow most concerned the jury. But then the steady snowfall 
began to defeat worker efforts to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
	Megan Ganong of Olympic Valley, Calif., one of the forerunners  
for the race, was sent down the course to give the jury a racer's 
view of the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``You couldn't see at all at the top,'' Ganong said. ``I was  
surprised because there was a lot more (new) snow on the course 
than I thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was a brief break in the cloud cover in the early  
afternoon, drawing a roar from the packed grandstands surrounding 
the finish area. But the break was shortlived and another bank of 
clouds moved in, dooming the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``This happens all the time,'' said Caroline Lalive of Steamboat  
Springs, one of the four Americans in the 43-racer starting field. 
``It's a hurry-up-and-wait game. If it doesn't happen today, it'll 
happen tomorrow. It's no big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The snow followed a week of spring-like weather, in which the  
world's best racers trained while basking in sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
	Regine Cavagnoud of France, one of the gold-medal favorites,  
applauded the decision to postpone ``because the conditions were 
too changing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a hard decision to start the race when conditions are not  
fair,'' she said. ``Today we had rain, wind, snow, sun; in these 
conditions it was impossible to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sara-Maude Boucher of Canada was disappointed ``because I was  
ready to race today. But it's OK because I'm just back from Europe 
and one more day of rest is good for me. It's part of skiing, so 
you can't get in a bad mood because of that.''

<HEADLINE> British Soccer Coach in Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- England's national soccer coach intends to resist  
calls to quit following his reported comment that the disabled are 
paying for ``the sins of an earlier life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Football Association, the governing body of English soccer,  
is expected to decide Glenn Hoddle's future on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoddle, whose remark was published in the Times of London on  
Saturday, says his words were ``misinterpreted'' and he is 
considering legal action against the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Tony Blair thinks it would be difficult for  
Hoddle to stay, and the team's corporate sponsor is among those 
criticizing the coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he said what he is reported to have said in the way he is  
reported to have said it then I think that was very wrong,'' Blair 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoddle insists his comment was taken out of context, but he has  
yet to precisely spell out what he said about the disabled during 
the disputed interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to resign over this because at the end of the  
day I didn't say those things,'' he told Independent Television 
News. 
</P>
<P>
	``It couldn't be further from the truth from what I believe  
about the handicapped and the disabled. The work that I've done 
with them over 25-26 years is there for everyone to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoddle told Sky News he was ``dreadfully sorry'' for what had  
been written. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been taken out of my hands and I wish I had never taken  
this (reporter) into my confidence,'' he said. ``But at the end of 
the day I made the mistake and I want to put the record straight 
and say that these people are not being punished for their sins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flap comes 10 days before England plays World Cup champion  
France in an exhibition game at Wembley Stadium. Hoddle is to 
announce his lineup Thursday but may be fired or asked to resign 
before then. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a considerable need for urgency,'' said David Davies,  
acting chief executive of the FA. ``There is also a need for 
considerable thought to be given on this matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davies said Hoddle's fate will be decided by the actual FA  
chairman and senior members of the international committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Lazenby, marketing director of the insurance company  
Nationwide, which last week signed a $13 million sponsorship of the 
England team, called Hoddle irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Glenn Hoddle has to understand that as a personality he can't  
escape the fact that he has a responsibility to ensure that his 
personal views shouldn't be confused with those of the England 
team, the FA or its sponsors,'' Lazenby said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nationwide will not allow its good reputation to be tarnished  
in any way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Hoddle leaves this week, two possible successors have been  
mentioned -- former national coach Terry Venables and FA coaching 
director Howard Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoddle had been criticized even before this dispute. His player  
personnel decisions were questioned in the media and he has been 
blamed for England's poor showing during qualifying for the 2000 
European Championship. England is in third place in its group 
behind Poland and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoddle's strong Christian beliefs prompted ridicule in some  
newspapers. He was mocked for enlisting a faith healer before the 
World Cup to help players recover from injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The faith healer, Eileen Drewery, said on TV that Hoddle has  
been treated ``worse than Saddam Hussein'' regarding the contested 
remark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am so distressed to think that has gone out the wrong way  
and I know the man is so compassionate and cares so much,'' said 
Drewery, whose husband is disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	``He puts himself out and raises money and has offered so much  
to invalids in the way of help. Nobody really knows him and they're 
trying to portray him as if he doesn't care about people.''

<HEADLINE> U.S., British Planes Pound Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- A defiant Iraq has rejected a new  
initiative on ending its deadlock with the United Nations, while 
U.S. and British jets pounded Iraqi installations with intense 
bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi President Saddam Hussein met with senior government and  
ruling Baath Party officials to discuss the U.N. Security Council 
proposal and decided ``this measure is not of our concern,'' the 
official Iraqi News Agency said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the Security Council decided to create panels to  
assess Iraqi disarmament, humanitarian needs and the fate of 
missing Kuwaitis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iraqi News Agency quoted a government spokesman as saying  
that Baghdad was not consulted before the council agreed to form 
the panels in a first, modest step to break a diplomatic logjam 
over Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	The three panels will take ``several months, which means nothing  
but procrastination and maintaining the unjust blockade on Iraq,'' 
INA quoted a statement issued after the leadership's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq wants the Security Council to condemn U.S. and British  
aggression, including the mid-December airstrikes and the recent 
conflict over the ``no-fly'' zones, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also called on the council to lift economic  
sanctions ``immediately and unconditionally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. sanctions -- which limit the sale of oil and bar other  
financial transactions -- were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of 
Kuwait, which sparked the 1991 Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	The Security Council has said they will not be lifted until Iraq  
has complied with resolutions that require it to eliminate its 
weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. and British airstrikes from Dec. 16-19 were aimed at  
punishing Iraq for failing to cooperate with U.N. weapons 
inspectors. Afterward, Iraq said it would not allow the inspectors 
back in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has also begun challenging the no-fly zones set up by the  
United States and its allies after the Gulf War to protect Iraqi 
Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south. 
</P>
<P>
	In southern Iraq, six U.S. and two British planes fired on two  
military sites in response to ``Iraqi provocations,'' according to 
a statement released by the U.S. Central Command at Macdill Air 
Force Base in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time since the December airstrikes that British  
planes were involved in attacks, the British Defense Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no damage to the allied planes, which returned to  
unidentified land bases and carriers, according to the statement. 
Damage to the Iraqi sites was being assessed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the north, an Air Force F-16CJ Fighting Falcon launched a  
high-speed anti-radiation missile, called HARM, at a radar system 
north of the city of Mosul, 250 miles north of Baghdad, said a 
statement from the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Sunday, the INA said that Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed  
al-Sahhaf sent a letter to the Security Council complaining of U.S. 
missiles that struck the southern city of Basra on Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq says at least 11 people were killed and 59 people were  
wounded in missile strikes in and around Basra, 230 miles south of 
the capital, Baghdad. U.S. officials acknowledge that one missile 
went astray. 
</P>
<P>
	``American and British aircraft, based in Saudi Arabia and  
Kuwait ... targeted many sites, including residential districts in 
Basra itself and surrounding villages, causing the death and injury 
of many people,'' the letter said, INA reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, meanwhile, continued diplomatic efforts to  
create a united front against Iraq, with a visit to Kuwait by 
Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk.

<HEADLINE> Fed Issues Banks Credit Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the latest fallout from the near-collapse  
of high-flying investment fund Long-Term Capital Management, the 
Federal Reserve on Monday issued guidelines to bankers and bank 
examiners aimed at reducing banks' credit risks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's action followed the release last week of an  
international central bankers' report that found a group of major 
U.S. and European banks had failed to adequately oversee their 
loans to and trading activities with Long-Term Capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, released by the Basel Committee on Banking  
Supervision, cited what it said were lapses in judgment by the 
banks in their dealings with Long-Term Capital and other hedge 
funds. It also said such investment funds are very difficult to 
regulate and that lenders should be far more cautious. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall some of the nation's biggest banks and brokerage firms  
spent $3.6 billion to bail out Long-Term Capital, a high-risk hedge 
fund for wealthy investors that had nearly borrowed itself into 
extinction. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York helped arrange the 
private rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	After Long-Term Capital's managers bet big on interest-rate  
swings and lost, the fund's meltdown threatened to disrupt world 
financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	A presidential working group is looking at possible restrictions  
on bank loans to high-risk hedge funds in the aftermath of 
Long-Term Capital's near-collapse, a Fed official recently told a 
Senate committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In issuing the guidelines, the Fed noted that the losses from  
the hedge fund debacle showed that ``basic credit risk-management 
policies, procedures and internal controls were insufficient at 
some (banks) to address the risks of new, fast-growing or evolving 
(financial) products and activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banks must devote sufficient resources and attention to ensuring  
``the integrity and adequacy'' of their risk-management procedures, 
the central bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar guidelines were released last month by the office of the  
U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates nationally 
chartered banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve oversees the foreign and holding-company  
banks that invested in Long-Term Capital, including Citigroup, 
Chase Manhattan, Germany's Deutsche Bank and Britain's Barclays 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this year, several of the banks and investment firms --  
including Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Morgan Stanley 
Dean Witter &AMP; Co. and Bear Stearns -- formed a new group to develop 
risk standards for financial institutions extending credit in 
volatile global markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said their move was supported by Arthur Levitt,  
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission; Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah Miller, general counsel of the American Bankers  
Association's securities division, said Monday the Fed ``came up 
with some guidance that will be very helpful to the industry as it 
develops its own best practices.''

<HEADLINE> Rodman, Strickland Still Available </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With opening night in the NBA just a few days away, the  
seven-time rebounding champion and last season's assists leader are 
still available on the free agent market. 
</P>
<P>
	For Dennis Rodman, it appears his next team will be the Orlando  
Magic or Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	For Rod Strickland, it's a choice between taking $27 million  
from Washington, holding out or hoping for a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, Strickland, Kevin Johnson, Jim Jackson, Sherman Douglas,  
Dominique Wilkins and Scott Burrell are the top free agents still 
on the market, although all of them have narrowed their options to 
a few teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's first choice seems to be Orlando, where he would be  
reunited with his former coach, Chuck Daly. The Magic played Monday 
night in Miami, where Rodman spent the past week attending Super 
Bowl festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando owner Rich DeVos is wary of bringing in a player with  
such a checkered reputation, so Rodman could end up being available 
to the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say we're interested or we're not interested,'' Lakers  
general manager Jerry West said Monday. ``But there would be an 
awful lot to talk about it internally before we'd do something like 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaquille O'Neal has endorsed the possibility of bringing in  
Rodman, who would become the only true power forward on the Lakers' 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not want to go against my big man,'' coach Del Harris  
said. ``I have the highest regard for the abilities of the guy who 
could win the rebounding title seven years in a row and who has 
been on two different championship teams as many times as he has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the stalemate between the Washington Wizards and  
Strickland showed no signs of ending. Washington has offered 
Strickland a five-year contract with three years guaranteed for $27 
million. Strickland's agent, David Falk, is said to be demanding 
$55 million guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
	With no other team able to offer Strickland more than $1.75  
million for one year, his options are limited. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are optimistic about it,'' Wizards coach Bernie Bickerstaff  
said. ``I've had a very cordial conversation with Rod, and I think 
he would like to be here and we would like to have him. I guess it 
gets to being about business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland could be involved in a sign-and-trade deal sending  
him to Houston, Detroit or Orlando. Wizards GM Wes Unseld has set 
Friday as the deadline for the 32-year-old Strickland to decide 
whether to take the $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's not done by the time we open up the season, then it's  
not going to get done,'' Unseld said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets and Pistons also have interest in Johnson, the  
11-year veteran who spent almost his entire career with the Phoenix 
Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento also could be the eventual destination for Johnson,  
who has backed off his statements of two years ago saying he would 
like to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's on his own timetable,' said his representative, Kevin  
Hiestand. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas, who played last season for the New Jersey Nets, is  
waiting to see how the Strickland situation unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
	If Strickland is traded by the Wizards, Douglas would sign in  
Washington. If Strickland stays, Douglas probably would accept the 
next-most lucrative offer from the Los Angeles Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who played for the Warriors, 76ers, Nets and Mavericks  
over the past two seasons, is drawing interest from teams needing a 
scorer. It's still possible that he'll be involved in a 
sign-and-trade deal sending him from Golden State to a contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the Jackson question is answered, it should give Wilkins,  
the nine-time All-Star and former scoring champ, an idea of where 
he can sign. Aside from several of the top contending teams, the 
Toronto Raptors and Orlando Magic have expressed interest in the 
39-year-old Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
	Burrell, who played last season for the Chicago Bulls, might end  
up taking a one-year offer from the New Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	Other veterans still available include Chris Morris, Stanley  
Roberts, Oliver Miller and Brian Shaw.

<HEADLINE> Detroit's Murphy Leaves With Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Just moments after tying the NHL  
record for games by a defenseman, Larry Murphy of the Detroit Red 
Wings was knocked unconscious and forced to leave a game against 
the New Jersey Devils on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy, who was playing in his 1,446th game, was knocked to the  
ice by Devils forward Krzysztof Oliwa. Both players slid across the 
ice into the side boards and Murphy was hurt when his head was 
slammed into the boards by Oliwa's hip. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy laid motionless on his back for about three or four  
minutes and a stretcher was brought quickly on to the ice. However, 
the 19-year veteran first moved his arms and then his legs and he 
eventually sat up. The stretcher was removed and Murphy left the 
ice, supported by players and medical personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings later said Murphy was ``fine'' but he would not  
return to the game for precautionary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit masseur Bob Huddleston slipped while walking across the  
ice to help Murphy and hit the back of his head on the ice, opening 
a cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit also lost defenseman Todd Gill in the second period with  
a bruised forearm. Forward Mathieu Dandenault has played defense 
and he switched to the back line to give the Red Wings five 
defensemen for the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy is now tied with the late Tim Horton for most career  
games by a defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy, who has played in 154 consecutive regular-season games,  
has missed only two since the start of the 1992-93 season and just 
25 in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit's next game is on Wednesday against the New York  
Islanders.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A man died of a heart attack after his  
girlfriend made a frantic run to her neighborhood police station 
because the city's 911 system crashed for an hour, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The emergency call system failed when a generator test cut off  
power at the call center and a backup system didn't kick in Sunday. 
Technicians shut off electricity at the main emergency call center 
in the city's Brooklyn borough as part of the routine test of 
emergency generators. 
</P>
<P>
	The generators didn't work, and employees couldn't restart the  
system, said Matt Higgins, a spokesman for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	John Audy, 41, of East Wallingford, Vt., was visiting his  
girlfriend in the Queens borough for the weekend when he suffered a 
heart attack at her house during the 911 outage. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was sitting on the couch. His eyes rolled up,'' his  
girlfriend, Susan Ungvary, 39, told The New York Times. ``I was 
holding him, talking to him and calling 911. I was calling 911, and 
I was getting a busy signal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ungvary, after at least three futile 911 calls, ran two  
blocks to her nearest police station for help, she said. Two 
officers and an ambulance responded. Audy died soon after at a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials were reviewing the case to determine whether the  
911 outage played a role in the death. 
</P>
<P>
	A backup system which is supposed to transfer emergency calls to  
police headquarters in Manhattan as soon as the 911 center is off 
line took an hour to work, said Deputy Chief Patrick Devlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``It did not work as planned,'' he told reporters. ``It's  
supposed to take less than a minute for that to occur. Instead it 
took about an hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Radio and television stations broadcast alternate emergency  
numbers, and by 11:35 a.m., the system kicked in and 911 calls were 
being answered ``at least on a sporadic basis,'' Giuliani said. The 
system was running normally by 4:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	On an average Sunday morning, about 500 calls come in to 911,  
``a very low volume,'' Devlin said. On a busy day, as many as 
30,000 calls can come in over 24 hours, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The 500 calls usually include about 100 reports of medical  
emergencies, Giuliani said, adding that workers responded to 75 
medical emergencies in the hour the system was down. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commissioner Howard Safir said it wasn't clear why the  
backup didn't work. ``It took an hour, and we'll have to find out 
from Bell Atlantic why,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Bonomo, a Bell Atlantic spokesman, said the system worked  
well but officials at the 911 center tried to fix the problems 
there before deciding to forward calls to police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls can't be forwarded automatically, he said, explaining that  
it takes a few minutes for workers to reprogram lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not a flip of a light switch, so to speak, it does take  
some time,'' he said. ``It's something that we have to wait for the 
go-ahead to get done.''

<HEADLINE> Roy Named NHL Player of the Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Colorado Avalanche goaltender Patrick Roy was  
named the NHL's player of the month for January after a seven-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy, who was coming off a knee injury that forced him to miss  
eight games, posted a 7-0-0 record and a goals-against average of 
1.71. He had shutouts against St. Louis and San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	After a slow start to the season, Colorado (25-19-4) now has a  
nine-point lead atop the Northwest Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy beat Philadelphia Flyers goalie John Vanbiesbrouck (5-1-2,  
four shutouts, 1.42 GAA); Ottawa Senators goalie Ron Tugnutt 
(6-0-2, one shutout, 1.01 GAA); and Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr 
(eight goals, 18 assists in 13 games) for the honor.

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Talks Failing To Take Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.S. and European envoys failed  
Monday to win a commitment from Kosovo's rebels to attend peace 
talks described as the ``last chance'' for the combatants to 
resolve their differences. 
</P>
<P>
	In another sign the talks are far from a done deal, President  
Slobodan Milosevic's government in Belgrade announced that the 
hard-line Serbian parliament will decide Thursday whether the Serbs 
will show up for Saturday's conference in Rambouillet, France. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard-liners loyal to Milosevic and ultranationalists led by  
Vojislav Seselj hold a majority in the legislature, which last year 
resoundingly rejected foreign mediation of the Kosovo conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Seselj repeated his opposition to the conference Monday despite  
threats from NATO to negotiate peace or face allied airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Yugoslav Premier Vuk Draskovic said, however, that ``I  
believe our response must be `Yes.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole world wants us to go, and to say `No' would mean  
working to our own detriment,'' Draskovic said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Kosovo capital of Pristina, the representative of the  
Kosovo Liberation Army, Adem Demaci, met for more than an hour with 
American and European envoys. Still, the rebels would not commit to 
attending the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. envoy Christopher Hill said Demaci promised an answer by  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the United States and five major European powers  
summoned the warring sides to the conference table by Saturday to 
negotiate an end to the 11-month conflict. The solution was based 
on a U.S. formula that would grant Kosovo expanded autonomy but not 
independence for a three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, the parties could review the status of Kosovo, a  
province in Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. Ethnic Albanians 
make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people, and the majority 
want independence. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright briefed  
President Clinton on Monday on the outlook for a negotiated 
settlement. She has already begun discussing with members of 
Congress the potential use of thousands of U.S. ground troops to 
keep any Kosovo peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	In Germany, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana described the  
conference as ``the last chance to reach peace in Kosovo,'' saying 
in his strongest statement yet that foreign ``ground troops would 
need to be deployed in order to enforce any agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Klaus Naumann, head of NATO's military committee, said if  
ground troops are necessary to guarantee security in Kosovo, ``We 
have to accept the idea of a time span of years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has authorized Solana to launch military action in  
Yugoslavia if the diplomatic initiative fails to produce 
negotiations in a week and a settlement by Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading moderate ethnic Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova,  
has agreed to attend the conference. However, without the 
participation of the armed factions -- the KLA and the Serb 
government -- any conference would be doomed to failure. 
</P>
<P>
	With the key parties playing for time, international envoys  
nonetheless insisted the peace process remained on track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never like to use the words 'optimism' and 'Balkans' in the  
same sentence, but I believe we have a very good process here,'' 
Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with Associated Press Television News, Hill said  
during talks with the rebels last week, the KLA set no 
preconditions for participation in the conference but worried about 
security arrangements during the three-year interim period and 
``what comes after three years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans and Europeans have opposed independence for  
Kosovo, fearing it could destabilize the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no reports of fresh fighting in the separatist  
province Monday. However, there are ominous signs that the conflict 
is spreading to Kosovo's capital. Two small bombs exploded Sunday 
night in ethnic Albanian-run cafes in Pristina -- the fourth such 
attacks in three days. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting between ethnic Albanian separatists and Serb security  
forces in Kosovo has left at least 2,000 people dead and displaced 
more than 300,000 from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia backs the new international initiative to end the  
fighting in Kosovo, but it strongly opposes any use of military 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	``No strikes -- missile or otherwise -- will speed up the  
settlement of the problem,'' Russia's Foreign Ministry Igor Ivanov 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a strongly worded statement later Monday, the Yugoslav  
government said NATO has no ``right to use force against sovereign 
and independent countries.''

	Explosion Rocks Michigan Ford Plant  
</P>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- An explosion and fire rocked a generating  
station for a huge Ford Motor Co. plant today, injuring an 
undetermined number of workers. WWJ radio in Detroit quoted an 
eyewitness who said workers were burned at the historic Ford Rouge 
plant in the Rouge River area. ``All we know is there's been an 
incident at the Number Three boiler at the power house at the Ford 
Rouge complex,'' Ford spokeswoman Francine MacBride said. ``Fire 
has been dispatched, but they haven't told us updates.'' The 
1,100-acre Rouge facility was once the world's largest auto plant. 
Henry Ford built the plant in 1918 because he dreamed of building a 
car from start to finish in one location.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky is being questioned under oath  
today by House prosecutors and the White House legal team for 
President Clinton's impeachment trial. The videotaped deposition, 
conducted privately at a hotel, could last as long as eight hours. 
Clinton's close friend Vernon Jordan, who helped Ms. Lewinsky find 
a job, will be deposed tomorrow and White House aide Sidney 
Blumenthal will be questioned Wednesday.

	Report Grades Gov't Agencies  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The future of Social Security may be in peril  
but in its day-to-day operations -- getting the correct checks in 
the mail on time -- its managers get top grades, a report released 
today said. In contrast, the Federal Aviation Administration which 
runs the air traffic control system, and the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, which patrols the nation's borders, get 
much lower ratings. The conclusions are part of the first 
government-rating survey by the Maxwell School of Citizenship and 
Public Affairs at Syracuse University. It analyzed and ranked 15 
federal agencies and all 50 states.

<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Supreme Court today upheld  
the state's death penalty law, rejecting an argument that blacks 
disproportionately receive the sentence. After two years of 
deliberation, the court ruled 6-1 that there was insufficient 
evidence to support the argument. The case centered on death row 
inmate Donald Loftin, a black man convicted of killing a gas 
station attendant during a 1992 robbery.

	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has  
reportedly offered a reward of $14,000 to any Iraqi who shoots down 
an enemy plane. Nabdh al-Shabab quoted a statement from the 
president's office, but the report could not be independently 
confirmed. U.S. and British forces have hammered Iraqi radar and 
air-defense sites in the northern and southern ``no-fly'' zones, 
which the allies set up after the 1991 Gulf War to protect Iraqi 
Kurds and Shiite Muslims from Saddam's forces.

	MOSCOW (AP) -- Boris Yeltsin celebrated his 68th birthday at a  
secluded government sanitarium today, visited by just a few 
dignitaries and largely ignored by the opposition, ordinary 
Russians and the press. Yeltsin has been abandoned by many other of 
his former allies, who have recently started calling for his 
resignation, saying that his frequent illnesses have eroded his 
ability to govern.

	Childbirth AIDS Treatment Works  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Researchers trying to reduce the rate of AIDS  
among the world's poor have found that giving mothers standard 
medicines for just a week cuts the risk they will pass on the virus 
during childbirth by more than one-third. In wealthy countries, 
infected mothers typically receive five months of the drug AZT, a 
treatment that can cost more than $1,000. Such therapy is 
impossible in places where even aspirin is unaffordable and 
prenatal care is unheard of. Doctors reported today that a far less 
intensive kind of treatment works reasonably well, even though not 
as effectively as the standard U.S. approach.

	German Unions Stage Warning Strikes  
</P>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Thousands of autoworkers laid down  
their tools in warning strikes today to press their demand for 6.5 
percent pay increases, while employers got backing for their calls 
for lower raises from a leading economist. Today's biggest 
demonstration was at Ford in Cologne, where about 11,000 workers 
laid down their tools temporarily. IG Metall planned warning 
strikes all week to increase pressure on employers, who have 
offered 2 percent pay increases. The contract affects some 3.4 
million workers in the metal-working and electrical industries, 
including the country's big automakers.

</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- After winning his second consecutive NFL title and  
Super Bowl MVP, Denver Bronco quarterback John Elway said today 
there is ``a 90 percent chance I'm going to quit.'' Elway, who led 
the Broncos to a 34-19 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, said he 
will consult his family, coach Mike Shanahan and Broncos owner Pat 
Bowlen about his future. Elway's 90 percent estimate is a reduction 
of the 99.9 percent guarantee he gave in June that 1998 would be 
his final season.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Terrorism Challenge Heard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Judges sparred with lawyers Monday over  
whether an anti-terrorism law can bar humanitarian and peaceful 
political aid to foreign groups designated terrorist organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals hearing involved appeals  
by both a humanitarian group and the government following lower 
court rulings in a lawsuit involving aid by Americans to groups 
affiliated with Kurds in Turkey and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Eelam in Sri Lanka. 
</P>
<P>
	In Turkey, the Kurdistan Workers Party claims to seek human  
rights and self-determination. In Sri Lanka, the Tigers claim 
similar goals for the Tamil minority. Both have been designated 
terrorist groups by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney David Cole came under criticism from judges when he  
argued for the right of American groups to send medicine, books and 
other humanitarian aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``This violates protection against guilt by association,'' said  
Cole, an attorney from the New York-based Center for Constitutional 
Rights, representing the Los Angeles-based Humanitarian Law Project 
and affiliated aid organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Judge Alex Kozinski bristled at the argument. ``You send  
them cash they can use to build bombs to blow up buses,'' Kozinski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the 1996 Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act,  
Cole said, it would be a crime even to send children's books to the 
groups in question. 
</P>
<P>
	Although questioning was less severe when Deputy Attorney  
General Douglas Letter argued his case, the judges also expressed 
concern about potential First Amendment violations if Americans are 
forbidden to send such things as pamphlets with medical 
instructions on how to heal a broken bone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that all training is prohibited from these foreign  
terrorist organizations,'' Letter said. He classified medical 
instructions as training. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing was sought after a U.S. district court granted in  
part a motion for a preliminary injunction barring the government 
from criminally prosecuting individuals and organizations under the 
anti-terrorism law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Humanitarian Law Project and seven other plaintiffs claimed  
in a March 1998 lawsuit against top federal officials that the 1996 
act violates First Amendment rights.

<HEADLINE> Lycos To Offer Access to MP3 Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- In a move that could hamper the music industry's  
efforts to thwart Internet bootleggers, the popular Web site Lycos 
said Monday it is starting a new search service that offers easy 
access to a half-million high quality recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	The search service looks up titles on the Internet that use a  
technology called MP3, a method of encoding music that allows 
computer users to transfer an entire album from a Web site in about 
two hours, and listen it on a Walkman-like player. 
</P>
<P>
	All the Web surfer has to do is type in the name of an artist to  
find links to MP3 files. 
</P>
<P>
	The proliferation of MP3 files on the Web is a growing headache  
for the recording industry, as many of the songs are illegal copies 
made by those who are selling or giving them away online. 
</P>
<P>
	The Recording Industry Association of America released a  
statement Monday evening pledging to work with Lycos to fight 
copyright infringement. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have committed to work with us to develop procedures to  
eliminate infringing sites from their directory,'' the statement 
read, adding that federal law requires Lycos to ``take appropriate 
action whenever they become aware of an infringing musical 
recording.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Lycos representative said the company had no way to determine  
the copyright status of any site that its search engines discover, 
but would cooperate with the recording industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have agreed to work together on this and we will do what we  
are required to do,'' said spokesman Brian Payea, adding that the 
company wouldn't go out of its way to find offending links. ``If 
somebody brings us information we can act, but we aren't going to 
launch our own investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Illustrating the high demand for digital music, Lycos said the  
letters ``MP3'' are among the five most frequent search phrases 
requested on the Lycos.com site and on hotbot.com, another search 
engine operated by the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos' new service differs from traditional searching in that it  
looks only for MP3 files and the database of those files is updated 
every hour to take in new titles and eliminate defunct Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos developed the MP3 search service in conjunction with Fast  
Search &AMP; Transfer, a Web search technology company based in Oslo, 
Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	MP3 does have legitimate uses. Some budding musicians use it to  
market their songs directly to consumers, bypassing agents, record 
companies and distributors by putting audio files on their own Web 
sites. Some record companies and established artists offer free 
samples online to drum up interest in their music. 
</P>
<P>
	But bootleggers also use MP3, and they have flooded the Internet  
with illegally distributed music, much of it copied directly from 
CDs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has become associated with piracy because it's a simple and  
free way to distribute music,'' said Nicholas DiGiacomo, a vice 
president of Scient Corporation, a consulting firm that has worked 
with the Recording Industry Association of America. ``You look out 
there and there is a generation of people that think wrongly that 
music is free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the recording industry announced plans to try to  
stem the flow of pirated music online with a program it calls the 
Secure Digital Music Initiative. A consortium of recording and 
computer companies is trying to figure out how to create a music 
security system this year. 
</P>
<P>
	There are already some early incarnations of secure distribution  
systems. For example, A2B Music, a division of AT&AMP;T Corp., provides 
music online in a way that prevents people who download it from 
posting it elsewhere on the Internet and freely distributing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``In most cases, the content owners say, 'you, the person who  
downloaded this can play it, but you can't pass it on to others,'' 
said Howard Singer, A2B's chief technical officer. 
</P>
<P>
	But for Mark Leccese, a 41-year-old self-described Boston  
``Webhead'' and amateur musician, MP3 music hasn't kept him out of 
the record store. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he tries out unfamiliar music online, he has still  
amassed a collection of about 500 CDs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I download stuff that I've heard about but I haven't really  
heard. I've been sort of using it as a sampler,'' he said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks China Spying Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has ordered a formal  
assessment of possible damage to U.S. national security after a 
congressional panel concluded that America's interests were harmed 
by China's military espionage, an administration official said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take it very seriously,'' National Security Council  
spokesman David Leavy said. ``And we're going to conduct a formal 
damage assessment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the administration had not embraced the committee's  
conclusion that U.S. interests were harmed. Instead, he said, 
``We're reviewing the information that was gathered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We take this issue very seriously and we are organizing an  
interagency team including nuclear weapons and counterintelligence 
experts to conduct a formal damage assessment, which will be 
reviewed by a panel of independent experts,'' Leavy said. He said 
the panel would report its findings to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's action came in response to a study conducted by a  
special House committee investigating military and commercial deals 
with China. The panel, headed by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., 
concluded late last year that China has been pursuing U.S. military 
information aggressively for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's investigation began with an inquiry into the  
administration's satellite export dealings with China but looked 
beyond those transactions to Republican and Democratic 
administrations over the last two decades. In releasing the report, 
Cox had said that, ``Based on unclassified information, we have 
found that nation security harm did occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox said transfers from the United States to China were not  
limited to satellite and missile technology, ``but cover militarily 
significant technology.'' The committee, five Republicans and four 
Democrats, adopted the report without dissent. 
</P>
<P>
	China has dismissed the allegations as ``groundless and  
irresponsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration generally accepted the panel's  
recommendations, Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president agreed with the broad conclusions and  
recommendations of the (Cox) report and accepted in the bipartisan 
fashion in which it was offered to move forward on a comprehensive 
approach to maintain effective export controls and protection to 
U.S. exports worldwide,'' Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House committee made more than three dozen recommendations  
for legislation and executive action to remedy the problem. Leavy 
said, ``In this regard, we support and agree with the majority of 
the committee's recommendations.'' Many of them already are being 
implemented, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kansas Falls Out of Top 25 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Connecticut's run as the No. 1 team in The Associated Press  
college basketball poll reached 10 weeks Monday, while Kansas was 
not in the Top 25 for the first time in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies (19-0), the nation's only unbeaten Division I team,  
were again the runaway choice, receiving 52 first-place votes and 
1,756 points from the national media panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (21-1) was No. 2 for the eighth straight week, getting the  
other 19 No. 1 votes and 1,720 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the Top 25 received a shakeup, with Kansas, which  
had been ranked for every poll since Jan. 29, 1991, dropping out 
along with Texas Christian and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The three newcomers were No. 20 Utah, which was ranked 10th in  
the preseason poll and for the first weeks of the regular season; 
No. 22 College of Charleston, which is ranked for the second time 
in school history; and No. 24 Missouri, which is back in the Top 25 
after a 3 1/2-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati moved up two spots to No. 3, while Stanford, which  
lost at Arizona on Thursday, dropped one place to fourth. Kentucky 
and Auburn each moved up one place to fifth and sixth, while 
Maryland, which lost by 13 points at Wake Forest, dropped from 
fourth to seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State and St. John's held on to Nos. 8 and 9, while  
Arizona moved back into the top 10 after the win over Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin was at No. 11 and followed by North Carolina, UCLA,  
Iowa, Ohio State, Syracuse, New Mexico, Purdue and Minnesota, which 
were tied for 18th, and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	The last five ranked teams were Indiana, Arkansas, College of  
Charleston, Missouri and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas (14-6) had lost three of four before beating Colorado at  
home on Saturday. The Jayhawks' run of 145 consecutive poll 
appearances was the third longest current streak behind the 156 of 
North Carolina and 154 of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a long time. I'm proud of that,'' Kansas coach Roy  
Williams said. ``But I truly don't think it will affect this team. 
I really don't. We play dumb on the court sometimes. But they're 
not dumb kids. And they realize that doesn't have anything to do 
with the way we play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to affect me whatsoever and I'd be shocked if  
they let it affect them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, at 66 consecutive polls, moved into third place  
followed by New Mexico at 50, and Duke and Stanford, both at 49. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah (16-4) moved into the Top 25, having not lost since the  
Texas game when they dropped to 5-4 and out of the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	College of Charleston (18-2) is ranked for just the second time  
in school history. The Cougars were in the Top 25 the last five 
weeks of the 1996-97 season and got as high as No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Both their losses were to Southeastern Conference teams --  
Georgia and South Carolina -- and their current 15-game winning 
streak started with a victory over North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri (15-4) was last ranked for the first six weeks of the  
1995-96 season and the Tigers came in having won three straight 
after consecutive losses to Kansas and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Christian (15-6) dropped from No. 24 after consecutive  
Western Athletic Conference losses to Tulsa and Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida (15-4) fell out from No. 25 after just one week in the  
poll, beating Alabama and then losing to Mississippi State.

<HEADLINE> Elway Deciding Whether To Drive Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- While the last thing John Elway needed was another  
car, the latest addition to his garage is one he'd never refuse -- 
it goes with the Super Bowl MVP award. 
</P>
<P>
	But he still isn't saying whether he'll drive off into  
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway recently sold his seven auto dealerships for $82 million,  
remains the front man for 17 dealerships and owns a stable of cars. 
NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue joked about that as he introduced 
Elway at a news conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be that a car was an incentive to win,'' Tagliabue  
said. ``Now, it's clear that not even a dealership is incentive to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway won the MVP trophy for leading the Denver Broncos to a  
34-19 victory over the Atlanta Falcons in the Super Bowl on Sunday. 
He also got a choice of a Ford Mustang or Expedition. He took the 
latter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our staff met last night to try to come up with something that  
would give John an incentive to play another season,'' Tagliabue 
said. ``The best they could come up with was the idea that you have 
a chance to be the first player in NFL history to be the MVP in two 
different centuries. We decided not to offer that to you because it 
might emphasize your age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old quarterback completed 18 of 29 passes for 336  
yards, and threw for one touchdown and ran for another in his fifth 
and possibly final trip to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really never thought I would be standing up here the morning  
after a Super Bowl as the MVP,'' said Elway, who clearly had his 
best performance in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
	``After you lose three in a row, you're just hoping your team  
can win. So this is a bonus. It's really one of the great thrills 
of my career, and I've had many of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After last year's Super Bowl victory, Elway agonized for four  
months about retirement. He expects to make a quicker decision 
about playing next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Although believed to be leaning toward retirement, Elway  
admitted the opportunity for an unprecedented third straight Super 
Bowl title is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be great to come back and three-peat,'' he said.  
``But also, it would be nice to walk away at the level that I'm 
playing right now. I don't want to walk away too late, but I also 
know that if I play like I played last night that I can play a 
little bit longer. There will be a bunch of things that go into the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm just cherishing the moment, cherishing the win  
and everything that has happened to us this year. At 38 years old 
and in the twilight of my career, I have a tendency to focus on the 
now and not tomorrow. Once the dust settles, I'll weigh those 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before making his decision, Elway said he will talk to his wife  
and four children, his father and mother, coach Mike Shanahan and 
Broncos owner Pat Bowlen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said all week and I said this year that it's a 90 percent  
chance I'm going to quit,'' he said. ``But the last thing I want to 
do is shut the door. I don't want to say that I'm done, then get 
into March or April and say that I can play one more year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His 90 percent estimate is a reduction of the 99.9 percent  
guarantee he gave last June that 1998 would be his final season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are physical considerations,'' said Elway, who  
uncharacteristically missed all or parts of six games this season 
with hamstring, back and rib injuries. ``Can I compete for an 
entire 16-game schedule? Can I spend the time working on what we do 
offensively in Denver from a mental standpoint? It was a long haul 
for me this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And one well worth it.

<HEADLINE> Depositions Begin With Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors are questioning Monica  
Lewinsky under oath as they enter the final phase of their attempt 
to turn the tide and prove that President Clinton should be removed 
from office. 
</P>
<P>
	With that attempt likely to fail, the senators sitting in  
judgment of the president were scrambling for a way they themselves 
will be judged kindly by history after they acquit Clinton of 
articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors and White House lawyers each had four hours  
today to question Ms. Lewinsky about her affair with Clinton and 
charges that he committed perjury and obstructed justice in trying 
to conceal their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	The deposition of the former White House intern was taking place  
at Washington's Mayflower Hotel, presided over by one Democratic 
and one Republican senator and videotaped for viewing by other 
senators. 
</P>
<P>
	The process will be repeated Tuesday when Clinton's close friend  
Vernon Jordan, who helped Ms. Lewinsky find a job, will be deposed; 
and on Wednesday, when White House aide Sidney Blumenthal will be 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want anybody to think there's some big bombshell out  
there,'' Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., one of the 13 House trial 
managers, said of his expectations from the Lewinsky testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	McCollum, interviewed on ``Fox News Sunday,'' said the  
prosecutors hoped to nail down ``beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
president committed a crime'' by trying to get Ms. Lewinsky to 
conceal gifts he had given her. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers argue that Ms. Lewinsky has testified under  
oath to a grand jury, FBI agents and Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr's investigators more than 20 times and has said consistently 
that she was never told to lie or offered a job to cover up the 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring some startling new revelation from the depositions,  
Senate Republicans and Democrats have agreed that the final vote in 
the trial should come Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a two-thirds majority of 67 to convict the president  
and remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she did not know if either the  
perjury or obstruction of justice charge against Clinton would get 
even a simple majority vote. She said many senators felt the 
perjury allegation is particularly weak. 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, Collins, a moderate, is leading an effort to  
approve a ``finding of fact'' that would put the Senate on record 
as saying that Clinton, while not committing offenses that should 
lead to his removal, lied under oath. This ``increases the 
accountability of our decisions to our constituents and to future 
generations,'' she said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It does not find him guilty, it finds some facts,'' Sen. Pete  
Domenici, R-N.M., another leading proponent of the idea, said on 
ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But senators from both parties expressed concern about the  
Senate overstepping its constitutional bounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a mistake and without authority for the Senate to  
act to find the president guilty of criminal conduct. Our role is 
to remove him from office, if he's guilty as charged by the 
House,'' Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said on CBS' ``Face the 
Nation.'' Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told NBC: ``This finding of 
fact is impeachment lite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, was floating a plan to end the trial  
after a vote to condemn the president for wrongdoing. But there 
also was strong support for concluding the trial with an up-or-down 
vote on conviction and then moving to a censure resolution . 
</P>
<P>
	After the trial, there should be a ``strong message that though  
he may not be removed from office that we want history to record 
that there was agreement about the wrongness of some of the 
actions,'' Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., said on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is to resume Thursday, after senators have had a  
chance to review the three depositions. Only then will they decide 
whether any of those witnesses will be called for live testimony in 
the Senate chamber. Democrats are adamantly opposed to that, and 
some Republicans also have said that shouldn't be necessary unless 
new information comes out of the depositions that could change the 
course of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	A trial manager, Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., told NBC he hoped  
that would occur, and that the prosecutors could expand the witness 
list to include Clinton secretary Betty Currie, who was left off 
the previous list when senators balked at having more than three 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Several senators bristled at a New York Times report that Starr  
has concluded he has the legal authority to indict Clinton for 
perjury and obstruction of justice while the president is still in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that the timing was extremely unfortunate and that  
it was inappropriate to come out while the Senate is concluding the 
president's trial,'' Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly today denied Starr's office was  
the source of the story. ``We have no interest in interposing 
ourselves in the Senate's business,'' he said on ABC's ``Good 
Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the same program, former appellate Judge Robert Bork, a Starr  
adviser, said he does not believe a president can be indicted 
``because the president is the one officer of government whose 
disability would incapacitate an entire branch. I don't think the 
founders intended a 12-man jury could replace an entire House, 
Senate and chief justice and the elaborate mechanism set up for 
impeachment.''

 *Jeanne-Marie Darre    	
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French pianist Jeanne-Marie Darre, once hailed by  
U.S. music critics as the ``grande dame'' of piano, died Jan. 26. 
She was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Darre, renowned for the purity of her lyrical style,  
studied piano with her mother before attending the Paris 
Conservatory. There, she studied under Isidore Philipp and 
Marguerite Long. 
</P>
<P>
	She made her first recordings at age 16 in Britain. At her first  
professional concert at age 21, she performed Camille Saint-Saens' 
five piano concertos: a demanding psychological and physical feat 
that no other performer has attempted since. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Darre's stamina was unparalleled -- offstage, she was an  
accomplished gymnast and dancer of the waltz and the tango. 
</P>
<P>
	She made her debut in the United States in 1962 at Carnegie Hall  
with Charles Munch directing the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Critics 
hailed her as ``the grande dame of piano.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A respected professor at the Paris Conservatory from 1958 to her  
retirement in 1975, she was also a knight of Arts and Letters and a 
member of the Legion of Honor, France's top awards for excellence 
in one's field.

 *Mirra Komarovsky    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mirra Komarovsky, a sociologist and expert on  
education, family and gender, died Saturday. She was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Komarovsky was credited with initiating the modern analysis  
of gender roles with her 1953 book ``Women in the Modern World: 
Their Education and Their Dilemmas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970, Komarovsky retired after 32 years on the Barnard  
College faculty. She returned to the school in 1978 as chairwoman 
of its women's studies program. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, she received the Distinguished Career Award of the  
American Sociological Association, of which she had been made the 
first female president in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Her other books include ``The Unemployed Man and His Family''  
(1940) and ``Women in College: Shaping New Feminine Identities'' 
(1985).

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T, Time Warner Strike Phone Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. has struck a deal to offer telephone  
service over Time Warner Inc.'s cable systems in 33 states, greatly 
escalating the long-distance phone company's move into local 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes as AT&AMP;T is close to completing its purchase of  
Time Warner's biggest rival in the cable TV industry, 
Tele-Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T had been widely reported to be talking with Time Warner  
about the possibility of offering phone service over its cable 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	In the deal announced today, AT&AMP;T and Time Warner expect to  
begin offering the new service in one or two cities by the end of 
1999 and begin broader commercial operations in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said today's deal, its acquisition of TCI and arrangements  
with other cable TV companies will give it the potential to supply 
local phone service to 40 percent of U.S. households, or 35 million 
homes, over the next four to five years. AT&AMP;T's acquisition of TCI 
is expected to be completed this spring. AT&AMP;T is talking with other 
cable operators about deals, but declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers will pay about 20 percent less for the venture's  
package of long-distance and local phone service than what other 
vendors could potentially offer, AT&AMP;T chief executive C. Michael 
Armstrong told industry analysts this morning. In addition to phone 
service, the new venture will offer interactive digital television 
and high-speed Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be the low-cost provider compared to any other way to  
deliver these services and we will be putting together more bundles 
on top of what we're announcing today,'' Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T shares, the nation's most widely held, were up as much as 3  
percent in early trading. The stock was up $1.81 1/4 at $92.56 1/4 in 
midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T will own slightly more than three-quarters of the joint  
venture and Time Warner the rest. AT&AMP;T estimates it will spend $600 
million on costs resulting from the venture in the first two years. 
In addition, it will spend between $300 and $500 to equip each home 
to handle telephone services over cable lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner will get monthly fees ranging from $1.50 to $6 per  
home over six years. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement is expected to have annual sales of $4 billion  
after three years. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has been spending furiously to break into the $110 billion  
local phone market at a time when its share of the long-distance 
business is slipping. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its planned acquisition of TCI, the nation's  
second-largest cable company, AT&AMP;T spent $11.3 billion last year on 
Teleport Communications, a smaller local phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T hopes consumers will be enticed by the convenience of  
receiving phone service channeled through the same cable TV 
circuits that deliver hundreds of channels, Internet access and 
online banking.

<HEADLINE> Budget Offers Selective Tax Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton proposed $36.2 billion in  
tax breaks Monday targeted to specific groups ranging from 
stay-at-home parents to the steel industry. Businesses and smokers 
would bear the brunt of his proposed tax hikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of the broader tax cuts that Republicans favor -- topped  
by a 10 percent income tax rate reduction using part of the budget 
surplus -- Clinton's $1.77 trillion budget for fiscal 2000 envisions 
more than three dozen bite-sized tax breaks tailored to specific 
social needs, from education to health insurance to the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means  
Committee, called the tax provisions a ``kitchen-sink approach to 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It represents a throwback to the days when government tried to  
solve problems by raising taxes and throwing money at problems,'' 
Archer said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers defended the  
approach, saying the measures ``are targeted at moments in people's 
lives when they have the greatest need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tax breaks would be offset by plans to close 16 corporate  
loopholes, raising $7.3 billion, and dozens of proposals to boost 
existing taxes or enact new ones on specific businesses. Combined 
with a 55-cent cigarette tax increase, total tax hikes would amount 
to $82 billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Republican grumbling, some of the credits are likely to  
win approval in Congress. Among the popular items: 
</P>
<P>
	-- A $1,000 tax credit to defray the costs of caring for a  
disabled or chronically ill relative, phased out for taxpayers who 
file jointly with $110,000 or more in adjusted gross income, and 
$75,000 for those filing singly. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Another $1,000 credit for disabled workers to offset the extra  
costs they sometimes face in holding a job, such as special 
transportation. Again, that would be phased out for joint filers 
earning over $110,000, $75,000 for singles. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A credit aimed at encouraging small employers to provide  
health insurance for workers not covered now. The maximum credit 
for businesses, good for two years, would be $200 for individual 
workers and $500 for a worker and family. 
</P>
<P>
	--For stay-at-home parents with an infant under age 1, a credit  
of $250 -- capped at $500 for two or more babies. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also proposes several education tax incentives,  
including bond tax measures aimed at raising $25 billion over two 
years for school construction. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's more: $292 million in tax breaks for a steel  
industry struggling against imports; credits of up to $4,000 for 
consumers who buy electric or other highly fuel-efficient cars; and 
credits instead of interest for buyers of bonds used to finance the 
purchase of open space such as parks. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the ledger, businesses would face more than  
70 targeted tax increases. But their outcome is unclear -- Congress 
rejected many of the same proposals last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is particularly keen on its plans to close  
corporate loopholes. To cite one example, Clinton wants to force 
companies to pay taxes on ``forward'' sales of corporate stock in 
which a payment is deferred. 
</P>
<P>
	An example of the numerous corporate tax hikes: a proposal to  
prevent the deduction of punitive damages paid in a court case.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Trade Lowell to Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Highly regarded third baseman Mike Lowell was  
traded by the New York Yankees to the Florida Marlins on Monday for 
three minor league pitchers, two of them former first-round draft 
picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell, 24, hit .304 last season at Triple-A Columbus with 26  
homers and 99 RBIs in 126 games. He was selected the Yankees' minor 
league player of the year in 1997. He was 4-for-15 (.267) with New 
York last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell became expendable when the Yankees, under prodding from  
manager Joe Torre, re-signed World Series MVP Scott Brosius to a 
$15.75 million, three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	New York gets left-hander Eddie Yarnall and right-handers Mark  
Johnson and Todd Noel. 
</P>
<P>
	Yarnall, 23, was the New York Mets' third-round draft pick in  
1996 and went to Florida last May as part of the Mike Piazza trade. 
He was a combined 13-5 with a 3.76 ERA and 114 strikeouts in 131 
2-3 innings last season at Double-A Binghamton and Portland, and 
Triple-A Charlotte. He was picked for the 1997 Florida State League 
all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 23, was selected by Houston with the 19th pick overall  
in the 1996 amateur draft and was acquired by Florida in the Moises 
Alou deal. He was 5-14 with a 4.62 ERA last season at Double-A 
Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	Noel, 20, was taken by the Chicago Cubs with the 17th pick of  
the 1996 draft and was acquired by the Marlins last summer for 
Felix Heredia. He was a combined 8-8 with a 4.41 ERA at Class-A 
Rockford and Kane County.

<HEADLINE> How Budget Will Impact You </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton wants to come to the aid of  
stay-at-home parents with a bouncy little tax credit in baby's 
first year. When the kid goes off to class -- perhaps in a trailer 
at one of the nation's many crowded schools -- the budget awaits 
with money for more buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	For the child slipping into adulthood, Clinton aims to raise a  
federal grant for low-income undergraduates by $125, ensure 
everyone can find something called a One-Stop Career Center and 
polish up last year's big effort to make college available to all. 
</P>
<P>
	On it goes, for the poor, the middle class, the middle aged and  
the old. 
</P>
<P>
	For the not-quite elderly, there's a plan to let them buy  
Medicare coverage when they are younger than today's minimum age of 
65. For the chronically ill, there's a $1,000 tax credit to help 
with the often enormous costs of tending one's health. Living in a 
nursing home? Clinton would toughen their inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	Smokers would help pay for it all. After seeing prices rise 30  
percent recently because of a settlement between the tobacco 
industry and states, smokers face 55 cents a pack more in taxes if 
Clinton gets his way. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's budget reflects flush times and an impulse to do  
something for someone at almost every stage of life. It's an 
impulse more easily committed to paper than written into law -- 
Republicans have their own ideas, heavier on tax cuts. And this 
president has seen many of his past proposals fail on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, Republicans want to take some of the projected  
budget surplus and cut everyone's income taxes by up to 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the goodies, Clinton's spending plan reflects a  
reluctance to go all out now that the nation is reversing decades 
of deficits. In this year before an election year, massive 
cash-in-your-pocket proposals are missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the president's offering a chunk of diaper change and  
more: 
</P>
<P>
	--A $250 tax credit for a child under age 1, when a parent stays  
home. You can double your tax credit pleasure with twins. But you 
can't triple it with triplets -- the maximum is $500. As well, 
parents who must pay child care expenses to work would get a larger 
credit than now. 
</P>
<P>
	--For the military, an across-the-board pay increase of 4.4  
percent and better retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	--$22 billion in school construction and modernization bonds, to  
take a bite out of school overcrowding. Clinton also wants money to 
start up 2,200 charter public schools, which operate under fewer 
regulations and, he believes, are more innovative. 
</P>
<P>
	--A $125 increase in the maximum Pell grant, to $3,250.  
Post-college, Clinton would let taxpayers deduct interest on their 
student loans for the life of the loan. Now, the deduction can only 
be taken for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	--A $1,000 tax credit for the chronically ill or those who look  
after them. 
</P>
<P>
	--A $1,000 tax credit for disabled workers to help with the extra  
costs they may face because of their work, such as special 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	--A proposal to let people buy Medicare coverage when they are as  
young as 62. If workers lose their company plan because their 
employer moves, goes out of business or cuts back their hours, they 
could buy into Medicare as young as 55. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from the tobacco tax, the budget comes with costs that are  
less apparent to the individual but may be just as real. It goes 
after a broad range of accounting practices used in tax shelters 
and proposes scores of tax increases on businesses. Some of those 
could raise prices for consumers or make workers lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	One proposed tax increase on the life insurance industry, for  
example, would cost a hefty $4 billion over five years.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Lawyer To Seek Mistrial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A lawyer defending the tobacco industry in the  
first class-action lawsuit by smokers to reach trial asked for a 
mistrial Monday, citing a state anti-tobacco spot that ran during 
the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	After questioning jurors about the ad, the judge denied the  
motion. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-second message, which aired only in Florida, featured  
excerpts from testimony before Congress by tobacco executives, who 
downplayed the dangers of smoking. Canned laughter punctuated the 
advertisement, which was paid for with money from the state's $13 
billion settlement with tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Heim, an attorney for Philip Morris Inc., told Circuit  
Judge Robert Kaye that in addition to the airing at halftime 
Sunday, a local television station had a story about the spot late 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a line that gets crossed somewhere,'' said Heim, who  
added that he feared the jury was tainted. ``The issue is whether 
we have crossed that line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heim's motion was criticized as ``hypocritical beyond belief,''  
by Stanley Rosenblatt, the lawyer representing an estimated 
half-million Floridians who say smoking made them sick. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you accept their argument, no case could ever go to trial  
because there will always be something,'' Rosenblatt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heim expressed concerns about the jury's integrity on Jan. 20,  
after President Clinton State of the Union speech in which he 
announced plans to sue cigarette makers for the costs of caring for 
sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	As he did at that time, Kaye asked jurors if they had seen or  
read anything about tobacco that might influence their 
deliberations. Those who had seen the beginning of the commercial 
said they avoided viewing it all, and assured the judge they were 
still impartial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult to avoid everything that's out there,''  
said one juror, who told Kaye he went to the kitchen for a snack 
when he realized the nature of the Super Bowl spot. ``But I do my 
best to block it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pleased with the panel's responses, Kaye denied the mistrial  
motion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really do think that they do appreciate and understand the  
seriousness of their duty,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Charge Dropped in Wash. Baby Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ANGELES, Wash. (AP) -- Prosecutors on Monday withdrew a  
second-degree murder charge against a veteran pediatrician accused 
of blocking an infant's breathing after the 3-day-old boy was 
declared brain dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to drop charges against Dr. Eugene Turner came just  
as his trial was to begin and prompted a burst of cheers and 
applause from his supporters in the crowded courtroom. Turner, 62, 
could hardly speak through his tears. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner always believed ``he did everything he could to save the  
life of Conor McInnerney on Jan. 12 of last year,'' said defense 
attorney Jeff Robinson. ``And he was right, and we think the 
decision today bears that out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no evidence the baby's death was caused by ``any  
criminal or even negligent act by any other human being,'' said the 
motion for dismissal filed by prosecutor Jim Townsend and approved 
by a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The baby's parents, Martin and Michelle McInnerney, will file a  
negligence lawsuit against Turner, said their lawyer, Matthew 
Knopp. They have not decided whether to sue the hospital. The 
McInnerneys were not in court. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple ``are going to be haunted forever by the image of  
what Dr. Turner did while he was alone with Conor that night,'' 
Knopp said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They believe that justice requires that they file a civil  
action in order to ... make sure this type of thing doesn't happen 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The charge can be refiled if new evidence surfaces, but such a  
decision would have to be made fairly quickly -- within the next two 
weeks, said Snohomish County Prosecutor Jim Krider. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner was accused of stopping Conor's breathing with his hand  
on Jan. 12, 1998. The infant was declared dead twice after he 
stopped breathing at home and was brought to the Olympic Memorial 
Hospital emergency room by ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner said the breathing he stopped was reflexive ``agonal  
breathing'' that is a sign of imminent death -- and said the infant 
was already brain dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts and hospital staff -- and the boy's parents --  
disagreed. But a trial would not resolve that disagreement, 
prosecutors concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Townsend said he considered lesser charges of first- or  
second-degree manslaughter, his motion says. But he concluded a 
court could not make that charge stick either. 
</P>
<P>
	``The expert testimony on this issue is not consistent,'' he  
wrote, concluding the available evidence would not support a 
conviction ``of any criminal act'' in the baby's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner still faces a May hearing before the state Medical  
Quality Assurance Commission for alleged unprofessional conduct in 
the baby's death. The panel allowed Turner to keep his medical 
license until his case is heard, but ordered another doctor be 
present any time he attempted a resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner voluntarily surrendered his hospital privileges but  
continued to operate his Peninsula Children's Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he believes evidence gathered for the trial will help  
before the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can have some evidence to bring forth to the state  
board to indicate that things were maybe not as bad as they 
originally thought they were,'' Turner said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Finish Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stock prices closed marginally lower today  
while the dollar fell against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 34.07 points,  
or 0.23 percent, to end at 14,465.18. On Friday, the average closed 
up 156.93 points, or 1.09 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.48 yen in late trading, down 0.50 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
116.43 yen Friday. During the day, it ranged from 115.40 yen to 
116.01 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices opened higher following  
Friday's gains on Wall Street where the Dow Jones industrial 
average finished up 77.50 points, or 0.8 percent, to 9,358.83. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Nikkei average drifted lower during the day as some  
Japanese companies sold shares they hold in other companies to 
cement business relationships. Companies have begun to sell such 
holdings in efforts to use their capital more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
	``Buyers are being cautious. This isn't a market where investors  
are going to keep sending shares higher and higher,'' said Kaoru 
Ichikawa, a trader at Kokusai Securities. ``The economic 
fundamentals aren't good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A reported government proposal to keep companies from dumping  
stocks helped support share prices, but many investors remained on 
the sidelines to await details of the plan, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai newspaper reported Saturday that the ruling  
Liberal Democratic Party is considering making Japan Securities 
Finance Co. and two other firms buy stocks from companies that 
unwind cross-shareholdings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unclear what will happen to stocks after Japan  
Securities Finance buys them,'' said Masatoshi Sato, manager of 
investment information at Kankaku Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	About 310.78 million shares changed hands on the first section  
of the Tokyo Stock exchange, with declines outnumbering advances 
582 to 546, while 177 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 5.89 points, or 0.52 percent, to 1,119.37. The 
TOPIX rose 15.04, or 1.35 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, Japanese exporters and overseas funds  
bought back the yen to lock in profits following the U.S. 
currency's rise to near 116.50 yen in New York on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar surged Friday after the Commerce Department said the  
U.S. economy grew at an astounding 5.6 percent annual rate during 
the final quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was traded at 131.14 yen at midafternoon, down from  
132.45 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro hit an intraday low today of 131.08 yen -- its weakest  
level since its inception on Jan. 1 -- further weighing down the 
dollar in Tokyo, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond rose to 2.035 percent from Friday's finish of 1.990 
percent, driving its price down to 98.15 yen from 98.49 yen.

<HEADLINE> GOP Senators Seen Favoring Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican senators on Sunday said some of  
their colleagues may vote against removing President Clinton from 
office. House prosecutors, meanwhile, prepared to question Monica 
Lewinsky in a last-ditch effort to strengthen their case. 
</P>
<P>
	As Lewinsky waited at the Mayflower Hotel for her deposition  
Monday, cracks appeared in the unified Republican front on the 
perjury and obstruction charges against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sense right now in just listening to members talk is that  
there are Republicans who either are not going to vote for perjury 
or the obstruction of justice'' charge, Sen. Tim Hutchinson, 
R-Ark., said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson declined to estimate how many might vote to acquit,  
but he indicated that getting even 50 votes for conviction in a 
chamber controlled by 55 Republican senators is in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would get much closer to getting a majority in the  
obstruction (charge) than on the perjury charge'' and the case now 
stands, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors have shifted their focus to the obstruction  
charge on the assumption that even among Republicans who believe 
that Clinton lied under oath, there is questionable support for the 
notion that the untruths were serious enough to warrant the 
president's removal, according to a knowledgeable official who 
demanded anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, two of the three witnesses prosecutors will  
question this week -- presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White 
House aide Sidney Blumenthal -- go to the obstruction question, 
rather than the perjury charge. 
</P>
<P>
	And sources close to the committee have said that Rep. Ed Bryant  
of Tennessee, who will question Ms. Lewinsky, wants to elicit 
information on Clinton's efforts to conceal their affair from Paula 
Jones' lawyers and Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	But even as senators widely believe they don't have the 67 votes  
needed to remove him from office, Clinton's battles are far from 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr is considering seeking the president's indictment before  
Clinton's term expires. A legal source, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said Sunday that Starr's view ``for some time'' has been 
that a sitting president is indictable. 
</P>
<P>
	Bipartisanship showed a glimmer of life again as the White House  
and senators of both parties expressed dismay at a report about 
Starr's thinking in The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is just no end to what this man is willing to do to  
continue to pursue the president,'' said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's unfortunate because it gets in the way or our  
focus on what our constitutional obligation is,'' said Sen. Mike 
DeWine, R-Ohio, on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's most immediate concern is the final chapters of  
the Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators on the Sunday talk shows showed other signs of cracks  
in the GOP's unity that muscled through Republican plans last week 
to continue the trial and call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' how many Republicans would  
vote to convict Clinton on the perjury charge, Sen. Richard Shelby, 
R-Ala. replied: ``Not as many as a lot of people believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't polled anybody, but I hear a lot of people say that  
is the weakest'' of the two charges. He added that the charge would 
draw ``perhaps'' fewer than 50 votes for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of senators who believe that the president  
lied under oath but that his wrongdoing in that area does not 
constitute perjury because of the legal definition of perjury,'' 
said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, also appearing on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	One prospective presidential candidate issued a stern warning  
from conservative circles to Republicans up for re-election next 
year who vote against the articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senators who vote to acquit just naturally will end up facing  
primary challengers,'' conservative activist Gary Bauer said on 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with conviction apparently beyond reach, senators continued  
to search for ways stop Clinton from walking away unpunished from 
the second impeachment trial in history. 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican proposal to pass a ``finding of fact'' that would  
state that Clinton lied under oath and impeded justice crossed 
party lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Budget Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., appearing on ABC's  
``This Week,'' pushed for the plan as a way to ``make the record 
clear for history and posterity that we have indeed not let this go 
attended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal drew support from one of Clinton's biggest  
supporters on policy and harshest critics of the president's 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``I for one would be hard-pressed to vote against it,'' Sen.  
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	But other Republicans and Democrats still objected to the  
political cover such a proposal would grant to senators who vote to 
acquit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to either convict the president and kick him out of  
office or we ought to acquit him,'' Shelby said. ``This looks to me 
like somebody is trying to get around the Constitution, trying to 
have it both ways.''

<HEADLINE> Fed Issues Banks Credit Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the latest fallout from the near-collapse  
of high-flying investment fund Long-Term Capital Management, the 
Federal Reserve on Monday issued guidelines to bankers and bank 
examiners aimed at reducing banks' credit risks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's action followed the release last week of an  
international central bankers' report that found a group of major 
U.S. and European banks had failed to adequately oversee their 
loans to and trading activities with Long-Term Capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, released by the Basel Committee on Banking  
Supervision, cited what it said were lapses in judgment by the 
banks in their dealings with Long-Term Capital and other hedge 
funds. It also said such investment funds are very difficult to 
regulate and that lenders should be far more cautious. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall some of the nation's biggest banks and brokerage firms  
spent $3.6 billion to bail out Long-Term Capital, a high-risk hedge 
fund for wealthy investors that had nearly borrowed itself into 
extinction. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York helped arrange the 
private rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	After Long-Term Capital's managers bet big on interest-rate  
swings and lost, the fund's meltdown threatened to disrupt world 
financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	A presidential working group is looking at possible restrictions  
on bank loans to high-risk hedge funds in the aftermath of 
Long-Term Capital's near-collapse, a Fed official recently told a 
Senate committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In issuing the guidelines, the Fed noted that the losses from  
the hedge fund debacle showed that ``basic credit risk-management 
policies, procedures and internal controls were insufficient at 
some (banks) to address the risks of new, fast-growing or evolving 
(financial) products and activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banks must devote sufficient resources and attention to ensuring  
``the integrity and adequacy'' of their risk-management procedures, 
the central bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar guidelines were released last month by the office of the  
U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates nationally 
chartered banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve oversees the foreign and holding-company  
banks that invested in Long-Term Capital, including Citigroup, 
Chase Manhattan, Germany's Deutsche Bank and Britain's Barclays 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this year, several of the banks and investment firms --  
including Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Morgan Stanley 
Dean Witter &AMP; Co. and Bear Stearns -- formed a new group to develop 
risk standards for financial institutions extending credit in 
volatile global markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said their move was supported by Arthur Levitt,  
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission; Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah Miller, general counsel of the American Bankers  
Association's securities division, said Monday the Fed ``came up 
with some guidance that will be very helpful to the industry as it 
develops its own best practices.''

<HEADLINE> PBS Showcases Black Artists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Diminishing the accomplishments of 20th  
century black American artists would be impossible. Pick any field, 
find giants old and new. Music: Holiday, Marsalis. Literature: 
Hughes, Walker. Film: Micheaux, Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	But understanding the real depth of their achievements, and the  
pain and the pride they carried as they made their way in an often 
hostile society, is something only another artist can make us see 
and understand. 
</P>
<P>
	The thoughtful and moving new PBS documentary ``I'll Make Me a  
World: A Century of African-American Arts,'' had just such a 
creator. It was the final project of filmmaker Henry Hampton, who 
died last November from complications following lung cancer 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-hour film, which airs 9-11 p.m. EST Monday, Tuesday and  
Wednesday on public television stations, is a fitting cap to his 
rich legacy, which includes the acclaimed documentaries ``Eyes on 
the Prize'' and ``The Great Depression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll Make Me a World,'' narrated by actress-singer Vanessa L.  
Williams and co-produced by Hampton's Blackside Inc. and New York 
station Thirteen-WNET, does not attempt to sketch every black 
artist and artwork. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we were discussing how to tell this story it was put on  
the table that we could do ... sort of a flip-card approach to the 
whole century,'' said Sam Pollard, the film's co-executive 
producer. ``You know: There was Bert Williams, and there was Louis 
Armstrong, and there was Duke Ellington and there was (sculptor) 
Augusta Savage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But it wouldn't be storytelling,'' Pollard told reporters  
recently. And that, he said, was considered key to making a 
compelling film. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that we would maybe catch some flak for not doing Duke  
(Ellington), maybe catch some flak for not doing Billie (Holiday) 
... (but) we felt that if we found the right characters and we 
could tell really good, solid stories, it would bring to the fore 
people who had never had an opportunity to be seen by the general 
television public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So here's a chance to discover how the white abomination of  
performing in black face was turned around and made more positive 
by singer-dancer Bert Williams, who gave black face some measure of 
dignity on the stage in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	And to discover Savage, who lost a scholarship because her white  
co-recipients refused to travel to Paris with her. Undaunted, she 
went on to open an arts school in Harlem in the 1930s and become an 
acclaimed sculptor. 
</P>
<P>
	And to discover Oscar Micheaux, a failed farmer who turned his  
creative energy and entrepreneurial skills to writing, filming, 
distributing and promoting movies for the black audience. He 
focused a lens on how black Americans really lived, and depicted 
blacks with dignity and a realism that was absent in Hollywood's 
stereotypical portrayals of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that the public television audience, which has a large  
white viewership, will latch onto this series and see that, again, 
they need to understand that there's another part of American 
history that people don't see enough about, read enough about, or 
hear enough about,'' Pollard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program doesn't sacrifice subtlety for scope. For example,  
it addresses the black artists' challenge that is unknown to white 
counterparts -- creating work that reflects not merely an 
individual, but a greater community. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I get something in the Modern Art Museum, it's not to  
make me famous. It's that a black woman has now something in the 
Modern Art Museum,'' sculptor Elizabeth Catlett says in the film. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have rebelled at the idea of tailoring their art to public  
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We younger Negro artists now intend to express our individual  
dark-skinned selves without fear or shame,'' poet Langston Hughes 
wrote in 1926. ``If white people are pleased, we are glad. If they 
are not, it doesn't matter. We know we are beautiful. And ugly, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	``If colored people are pleased we are glad. If they are not,  
their displeasure doesn't matter either. We build our temples for 
tomorrow, strong as we know how. ....'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film opens with ``Lift Every Voice,'' which tells of  
vaudeville partners Williams and George Walker and their struggle 
to break through the stereotypes of the minstrel tradition early in 
the century. The beginning strains of jazz are heard in New 
Orleans, and the first dance fad hits America: the cakewalk, 
adapted from a step performed by slaves to mock the mincing steps 
of their plantation masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without Fear or Shame,'' the second hour, carries us from  
World War I through the Jazz Age and into the Depression. Taking 
part in the Harlem Renaissance are artists including novelists 
Dorothy West, Zora Neale Hurston and Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
	Blues singers Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey bring their Southern  
style of singing to the North as black artists once again change 
the rhythm of American life. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tuesday's segment, ``Bright Like a Sun'' and ``The Dream  
Keepers,'' the film moves through the 1940s and the '50s, 
celebrating the dynamic and controversial Paul Robeson, the 
breakthrough bebop of jazzmen Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker, 
and the impact of disintegrating racial barriers on the arts. 
</P>
<P>
	The careers of playwright Lorraine Hansberry, novelist James  
Baldwin and ballet dancers Delores Browne and Raven Wilkinson are 
detailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's concluding chapters are ``Not a Rhyme Time'' and  
``The Freedom You Will Take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former examines black artists' inroads in Hollywood, on  
Broadway and in popular music, with the soulful Motown sound 
dominating pop music. Gwendolyn Brooks explores new poetry forms 
and the Pulitzer Prize goes to Alice Walker (``The Color Purple''). 
</P>
<P>
	The final hour of ``Make Me a World'' (a title taken from a 1927  
James Weldon Johnson poem) examines contemporary culture and the 
transforming influence of black artists. Filmmakers Spike Lee and 
Julia Dash, dancer Judith Jamison and rapper Rakim are among those 
profiled. 
</P>
<P>
	The issues they face, it seems, are not so different from their  
cultural predecessors. White usurpation of black art is seen again 
and again through the years. And there is the special role the 
black artist plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always felt that you have to try to get the truth and let  
the chips fall where they may,'' Lee told reporters recently. ``We 
got a lot of criticism for 'School Daze.' People felt I was airing 
dirty laundry with stuff we did with that film. But I think you 
have to be an artist ....'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>

	Elsewhere in television ....

	CARTOON WITH A MESSAGE: Cable's Disney Channel kicks off its  
Black History Month celebration with the premiere of the short 
animated feature, ``John Henry.'' Narrated by actor Denzel 
Washington and with music by B.B. King, the film tells of a black 
man journeying cross-country who discovers men of all races who 
have joined together to build a railroad. It shows at 7 p.m. EST

<HEADLINE> EU Complains of Anti-Dumping Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Amid growing pressure on Washington to impose  
anti-dumping duties on steel imports, the World Trade Organization 
Monday agreed to investigate U.S. anti-dumping laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint over the 1916 Anti-Dumping Act was brought by the  
European Union and will mean a dispute settlement panel looking at 
the case, one of many disputes currently unresolved between the two 
largest members of the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. regrets and is disappointed that the EU has taken the  
step of requesting a panel,'' said trade ambassador Rita Hayes 
after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumping refers to the selling of large quantities of goods at a  
lower price than is economic in an attempt to corner the market. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. steel producers have contended that large quantities of  
their product are being illegally dumped in the United States at 
prices dramatically below production costs. Formal complaints are 
pending against Japan, Russia and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO also determined Monday that imports of motor vehicles  
and rules on patented medicines in Canada will also be considered 
by panels. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian trade rules will be considered by another panel after  
the European Union and Japan both complained that Canadian trade 
rules discriminate against imported vehicles from countries other 
than the United States and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	They also claim that foreign manufacturers are given incentives  
to use a larger proportion of Canadian components and materials. 
Canada has held negotiations with Japan and the European Union, but 
they failed to come to an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	A third panel will look at the Canadian rules on patenting  
pharmaceutical products. 
</P>
<P>
	The panels will have six months to report back to the WTO and  
the decision is subject to appeal. Despite the deadline, recent 
differences over bananas and hormone-treated beef have shown that 
some trade disputes can drag on for years even after a WTO ruling.

<HEADLINE> Cirrhosis Cure in Rats Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Scientists wiped out liver cirrhosis in rats by  
injecting their muscles with a human gene, raising early hopes for 
a new treatment for people. 
</P>
<P>
	The gene made the rats pump out high quantities of a protein  
that promotes liver regeneration while reducing cell death. That 
cleared up serious cirrhosis in the animals, researchers reported. 
</P>
<P>
	A liver expert called the work exciting and said such treatment  
might someday be able to prevent cirrhosis in people at risk for 
it, and possibly reverse the damage in patients who already have 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Cirrhosis devastates the liver with widespread scar tissue. It's  
caused most often by alcohol abuse, but chronic viral hepatitis and 
other diseases can also create it. Severe cases cause liver failure 
and can require a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	About 25,000 Americans die from cirrhosis every year, according  
to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney 
Diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	The new work is reported in the February issue of the journal  
Nature Medicine by Dr. Jiro Fujimoto of the Hyogo College of 
Medicine in Nishinomiya, Japan, and others. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no guarantee the treatment would work in people. The  
researchers are studying it in dogs and hope to get permission for 
human testing, Fujimoto said. 
</P>
<P>
	The treatment was based on a protein called hepatocyte growth  
factor, or HGF. Previous work has shown HGF can promote liver 
regeneration and suppress cell death, while blocking a second 
protein that encourages scar formation. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers created cirrhosis in the rats by injecting them  
with a drug. Once serious cirrhosis was established, they injected 
some of the rats weekly with the gene for human HGF, enclosed in 
fatty bubbles. 
</P>
<P>
	Treated rats showed human HGF in their blood, indicating that  
the gene had settled down to work and ordered muscle cells to make 
the protein. The animals started making more rat HGF too. 
</P>
<P>
	All 13 untreated rats in the experiment died of cirrhosis within  
45 days. But the nine animals that got the highest dose of the HGF 
gene were spared, and free of cirrhosis when removed from the study 
after 50 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. George Michalopoulos of the University of Pittsburgh, who  
did not participate in the study, said he was excited because it is 
the strongest evidence yet that HGF might be able to treat chronic 
liver damage. He said he had never seen such extensive cirrhosis 
reversed in animals before.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Fight Shaping Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican leaders and President Clinton agree  
that Social Security has the biggest claim on the first string of 
government surpluses the nation has seen in five decades. 
</P>
<P>
	But deciding exactly how to use that windfall to buttress the  
retirement program is shaping up as one of the year's top political 
fights. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Monday that he believes agreement on Social  
Security is possible this year, ``If we work together across 
partisan lines and make some tough but fully achievable choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, however, have been critical of the specifics of  
Clinton's plan, outlined in the fiscal year 2000 budget he sent to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend to see that the surpluses that belong to Social  
Security are not spent and not used for anything else. However, we 
don't agree with the president's approach,'' said Senate Budget 
Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposal, first announced in his State of the Union  
speech, would use 62 percent of the government surpluses expected 
over the next 15 years to beef up Social Security's cash reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	That's more than $2.7 trillion by the latest projections, and  
could push the cash shortage now expected in 2032 back by more than 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican congressional leaders have agreed to set that money  
aside for now. But the bipartisan accord on Social Security ends 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	The president wants the government to invest a quarter of the  
$2.7 trillion in cash into the stock market to try to increase the 
money's value. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans strenuously object, saying that if the government  
becomes a Wall Street player, politics would inevitably corrupt 
free enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	With the rest of the money, Clinton would use a complicated  
accounting strategy to simultaneously pay down the national debt 
and obligate more of the country's future resources to Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say the president's fancy bookkeeping just compounds  
debts already owed to Social Security by the rest of the 
government, without saying how they will ultimately be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is calling for negotiations to come up with a plan  
everyone can agree on. But both Democrats and Republicans have thus 
far avoided any discussion of the most difficult choices that may 
be needed -- whether to raise taxes or to cut retiree benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	One possible area of compromise: Clinton's proposal to use an  
additional 12 percent of the surplus to start new 401(k)-style 
investment accounts for most American workers. Essentially, the 
government would help subsidize people's own retirement savings, 
giving more money to low-income workers. 
</P>
<P>
	That would do nothing to fix Social Security, but could provide  
a cushion for future retirees if benefit cuts are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans would eventually like to see some of the Social  
Security taxes now deducted from workers' paychecks diverted into 
such accounts. That way, they say, the retirement program could 
benefit from stock-market investments controlled by individuals, 
not controlled by the government.

<HEADLINE> Tribe Confident Vizquel Will Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Omar Vizquel's threats are not being taken  
lightly by the Indians. They know he might hold out of spring 
training camp, and they know he may ask to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
	They also know they're not going to tear up his contract.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've sort of been painted as that we either have to trade  
him, which we are not going to do, or we're going to renegotiate 
his contract, which we're not going to do,'' Cleveland general 
manager John Hart said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vizquel, Cleveland's wondrous six-time Gold Glove shortstop, is  
unhappy with a current deal which will pay him $3 million per 
season through 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	After seeing some of his peers cash in for huge deals this  
winter, Vizquel said last month he'd consider asking the Indians to 
ship him elsewhere. He also said he may not report to the team's 
camp in Winter Haven, Fla., if the club doesn't renegotiate his 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Hart met with Vizquel and his agent, Adam Katz, to  
work on ways of improving the shortstop's salary without redoing 
his contract. A personal services contract and increases in 
Vizquel's incentive clauses were among the areas discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some internal things we're still looking at,'' Hart  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart is optimistic that Vizquel will be in Florida on Feb. 22,  
the reporting date for Cleveland's position players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm optimistic that Omar is going to show up ready to go,''  
said Hart. ``You never know what's going to happen. But I'm not 
losing sleep over this. I just believe in Omar the person, and I 
think Omar will be there. If I were a betting man, I'd bet on Omar 
being right on time, ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a strange off-season for Hart. First, he strengthened  
the Indians' bullpen by adding Jerry Spradlin and Ricardo Rincon. 
Then, Hart gave the Indians an All-Star at every position by 
signing free agent second baseman Roberto Alomar, a player he has 
coveted for years. 
</P>
<P>
	All the pieces were coming together nicely, and then the popular  
Vizquel shocked Indians fans with his uncharacteristic demands. 
Hart, though, thinks everything will work out for all parties 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is the toughest thing we have to deal with, than I'm  
OK,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians started their winter press tour Monday with a  
luncheon at Jacobs Field attended by Cleveland manager Mike 
Hargrove, pitching coach Phil Regan and players Jim Thome, Sandy 
Alomar, Richie Sexson and Steve Karsay. 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed whenever Hargrove or any of the Indians began  
discussing a topic, whether it was the Yankees or Mark McGwire or 
the weather, it wasn't long before the conversation's focus came 
back to Vizquel. 
</P>
<P>
	And why not?  
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's pitching rotation is essentially in place, and  
except for naming a starting pitcher, Hargrove could go ahead and 
fill out his lineup card for the Indians' regular-season opener on 
April 6 at Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Vizquel isn't a happy camper, and his attitude becomes a  
problem, it could disrupt the team's chemistry and spread like a 
virus throughout the Indians' clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand his feelings,'' said Sandy Alomar. ``He's a great  
player. A lot of players at his position are making a lot more 
money than he is. But these players are free agents signing now. 
The market changes. This is a very difficult situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar said he has not spoken with Vizquel about the contract  
issue, and that he wouldn't unless he sees someone being counter 
productive to the Indians' team goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way I'll get involved is if he comes to spring  
training and he doesn't work hard at it and he's kind of like 
cheating the rest of the team,'' he said. ``Because we're a team 
here and we're trying to accomplish one thing, to win the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he doesn't work like that, then I'll have something to say  
at that point. Whether the Indians want to redo his contract or 
not, that's not my problem. But make sure they keep the doors open 
if they do, because there will be a lot of guys going in that door, 
believe me.''

<HEADLINE> Income and Spending Rise Strongly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' personal income surged 0.5 percent  
in December, the best gain in 10 months, and they spent every bit 
of it and more. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in personal income, the most since February,  
followed 0.4 percent gains in October and November, the Commerce 
Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal spending surged 0.8 percent, the biggest increase in  
seven months, bolstered by last-minute holiday shopping and a 
continuing rebound in auto sales after summer strikes at General 
Motors. That followed a modest 0.2 percent increase in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the department said construction spending surged 1.7  
percent in December, the largest gain in six months, helped by 
unseasonably mild weather for much of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, an index compiled by the National Association of  
Purchasing Management showed manufacturing declined for the eighth 
consecutive month in January, but at a slower rate than during the 
previous seven months. 
</P>
<P>
	Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the organization's survey committee,  
found ``signs of encouragement.'' These included marked increases 
in both production and new orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Americans spent more than they earned in December, their  
personal savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income 
-- went negative for the second time this year. It was zero in 
September, minus 0.1 percent in October, positive 0.1 percent in 
November and minus 0.1 percent again in December. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Americans saved just 0.5 percent of their income,  
the least since 1933, compared with 2.1 percent in 1997 and 2.9 
percent in 1996. But, the figure is not as grim as it appears. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1933, the lack of savings reflected the huge drop in income  
Americans experienced during the depths of the Great Depression. In 
1998, the low savings rate came because prosperous Americans spent 
a portion of their stock-market gains and tapped their home equity 
during a wave of refinancing spurred by the lowest mortgage rates 
since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Income in 1998 rose a healthy 5 percent, the fourth consecutive  
year at or above that level, but still the smallest rise since 
1993. That included a 6.7 percent increase in wages and salaries -- 
the most-watched component of income -- and a 23.6 percent plunge in 
farm owners' income, reflecting the worldwide economic slump's 
impact on commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending jumped 5.7 percent, the largest gain since 1994. It was  
propelled by a 7.5 percent increase for big-ticket durable goods, 
as low interest rates fueled car sales and record home sales 
encouraged strong sales of furniture and appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, wages and salaries rose 0.5 percent. Service  
industries showed a brisk 0.7 percent gain and manufacturing, a 
more subdued 0.2 percent rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending during the month was led by a 4.2 percent surge for  
durable goods, items expected to last three or more years. It was 
the largest gain in 5 1/2 years. Spending on services rose 0.4 percent 
and on nondurable goods, 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction spending, for the year, rose 6.3 percent to $657  
billion, following a 5.9 percent rise in 1997. The categories with 
the biggest gains included single-family homes, 13.9 percent; 
apartments, 8 percent; offices, 16.4 percent, and hotels and 
motels, 12.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Those increases offset drops of 0.6 percent in government  
construction, 1.5 percent in shopping centers and other commercial 
buildings, and 3.7 percent in industrial construction. 
</P>
<P>
	In December alone, housing construction rose 1.6 percent;  
commercial, 1.4 percent, and government, 3.7 percent. There were 
substantial increases for construction of single-family homes, 
offices, and highways and streets, but drops for hotels and motels 
and industrial buildings.

                           *Vernon Berg 3d    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Vernon Berg 3d, an artist who also was one of  
the first Naval officers to stand up to the military after he was 
discharged for being homosexual, died Wednesday of complications 
from AIDS. He was 47. 
</P>
<P>
	Berg was given an ``other than honorable'' discharge from the  
Navy as an ensign in 1976 after an investigation revealed he was in 
a gay relationship. He sued, and the armed forces later adopted a 
policy of generally granting honorable discharges to homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, a federal appeals court ruled Berg and another officer  
were unfairly discharged, but didn't reinstate them. His discharge 
was upgraded to honorable as a result of the legal action. 
</P>
<P>
	Berg, a graduate of the Naval Academy at Annapolis, went on to  
become a prolific artist who documented life with AIDS in 
sculptures, paintings, photographs and cartoonlike drawings.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dr. Richard Harold Freyberg, a leading  
rheumatologist who helped organize the Arthritis Foundation, died 
Jan. 23 at his Florida home. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	While serving as director of the division of rheumatic diseases  
at Manhattan's Hospital for Special Surgery, Freyberg also was 
chief of the arthritis clinic at New York Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1948 meeting with colleagues and Floyd Odium, an industrialist  
afflicted with rheumatoid arthritis, led to the founding of the 
Arthritis Foundation, which was launched with a $500,000 
fund-raiser led by Bob Hope. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation moved to Atlanta in 1977 and today operates with  
a $110 million budget and 700,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
	Freyberg co-wrote ``The History of Rheumatology,'' published in  
1985.

</P>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Mills E. Godwin Jr., an influential  
two-term Virginia governor who played a crucial early role in the 
state's fierce resistance to school desegregation, died Saturday. 
He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Godwin, elected for his first term as governor as a Democrat in  
1965 and as a Republican in 1973, went to the House of Delegates in 
1948, moved to the Virginia Senate four years later, and remained 
there until his 1961 election as lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, Godwin was a principal architect of Virginia's  
so-called ``massive resistance'' policy to school integration. At 
one point, he declared there would be ``no compromise on our 
principle of total segregation in Virginia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state abandoned massive resistance in 1959. Godwin later  
said that Virginia needed time to ``adjust to what inevitably had 
to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Godwin's first term as governor was highlighted by the creation  
of Virginia's system of two-year community colleges and 
implementation of the state sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Upset by the liberal drift of the national Democratic party, he  
was persuaded to join the GOP and ran for another term in 1973 as a 
Republican.

<P>
                            *Huntz Hall    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Huntz Hall, star of dozens of ``Bowery Boys''  
and ``Dead End Kids'' films in the 1930s through the 1950s, died 
Saturday. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall was one of a group of young actors who came to Hollywood to  
make a film version of the Sidney Kingsley play ``Dead End'' in 
1937, two years after he starred in the drama on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	The juvenile delinquent characters spawned a popular phenomenon  
that stretched over two decades. At first, the actors portrayed the 
characters as victims of society, but as the series of films 
evolved over the years, more comic situations were introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Dead End Kids, the group made several films for Warner  
Bros., including ``Angels with Dirty Faces,'' ``They Made Me a 
Criminal'' and ``Crime School'' with stars like James Cagney, 
Humphrey Bogart and John Garfield. Leo Gorcey was the leader of the 
gang and Hall played his sidekick. 
</P>
<P>
	The actors moved to Universal and changed their name to The East  
Side Kids in the 1940s. After World War II, Hall and Gorcey made 49 
``B'' films as the Bowery Boys. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the reference book ``Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video  
Guide'' lists more than 85 titles in the various series: the Dead 
End Kids, the Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys, the East Side 
Kids and the Bowery Boys. Among the films: ``Kid Dynamite,'' 
``Trouble Makers,'' ``Bowery to Baghdad'' and ``The Bowery Boys 
Meet the Monsters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall also appeared in other films, including ``A Walk in the  
Sun'' in 1945, ``Gentle Giant'' in 1967, ``Herbie Rides Again'' in 
1974 and ``The Escape Artist'' in 1982. He played the role of 
producer Jesse Lasky in Ken Russell's ``Valentino'' in 1977.

</P>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Dr. William E. Hunt, a retired  
neurosurgeon at Ohio State University who devised a widely used 
system for the clinical evaluation of brain aneurysms, died Tuesday 
of heart problems. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt was best known for the Hunt-Hess classification for  
weakened blood vessels in the brain, called intracranial aneurysms. 
Named also after a resident who worked with him, Dr. Robert Hess, 
it is the most widely used classification of aneurysms. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1973 to 1988 he was the principal investigator and director  
of the national Spinal Cord Injury Research Center based at Ohio 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	He was on the American Board of Neurological Surgery, and was a  
faculty member at Ohio State University for 37 years, retiring as a 
professor emeritus of surgery in 1991. Hunt was the chairman of its 
division of neurological surgery from 1964 to 1989.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mirra Komarovsky, a sociologist and expert on  
education, family and gender, died Saturday. She was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Komarovsky was credited with initiating the modern analysis  
of gender roles with her 1953 book ``Women in the Modern World: 
Their Education and Their Dilemmas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970, Komarovsky retired after 32 years on the Barnard  
College faculty. She returned to the school in 1978 as chairwoman 
of its women's studies program. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, she received the Distinguished Career Award of the  
American Sociological Association, of which she had been made the 
first female president in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Her other books include ``The Unemployed Man and His Family''  
(1940) and ``Women in College: Shaping New Feminine Identities'' 
(1985).

</P>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Leonard C. Lewin, whose Vietnam-era  
satire on the dangers of peace resurfaced three decades later to 
fuel the conspiracy theories of paramilitary groups, died Thursday. 
He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1967 satire, ``Report From Iron Mountain,'' was the supposed  
report of a top-secret study group that concluded world peace would 
be catastrophic to society. 
</P>
<P>
	Debate immediately raged about whether it was real, and the  
parody hit The New York Times' best-seller list in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1972, Lewin confessed that he had concocted the report.  
</P>
<P>
	``Report from Iron Mountain'' went out of print in 1980, but a  
few years ago Lewin discovered that a white supremacist group in 
Arkansas was offering copies of the book as a genuine government 
report.

                            *Mason Walsh    	
</P>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Mason Walsh, former publisher of The  
Arizona Republic and The Phoenix Gazette, died Saturday due to 
complications from pneumonia. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh was publisher of the two newspapers from 1978 until his  
retirement in 1980. He began work in 1966 at the papers' corporate 
parent, Phoenix Newspapers Inc., as general manager and became 
assistant publisher in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh was a reporter, city editor and news editor for the Dallas  
Dispatch-Journal from 1935-42 and served as editor of the Austin 
Times-Herald in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Depression, Walsh also played violin, cello and viola  
in movie and vaudeville theaters, on radio and with the Dallas 
Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a stint in the public relations and personnel  
departments with North American Aviation in Dallas, Walsh resumed 
his journalism career in 1945 as city editor of the Dallas 
Times-Herald. He served as managing editor there from 1952-60. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1960-66, Wash was managing editor of The Phoenix Gazette,  
an afternoon newspaper that shut down in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh was national president of the Associated Press Managing  
Editors Association in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Anne; sons Tim and Kevin, chief of  
bureau of the AP in Miami; a daughter, Peggy Walsh, former chief of 
bureau of the AP in San Francisco; and two grandchildren.

                          *Mario Zacchini    	
</P>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Mario Zacchini, the ``human cannonball'' who  
entertained circus-goers for decades, died Thursday of kidney 
failure. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Zacchini was the oldest living member of a Tampa circus family,  
the last remaining brother of seven -- five of whom were known as 
human cannonballs. 
</P>
<P>
	In their heyday in the 1920s, '30s and '40s, the Zacchini  
brothers wowed crowds as they catapulted out of cannons at speeds 
up to 90 mph, flying over Ferris wheels at world fairs, circuses 
and carnivals in the United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Their father, Ildebrando, who started as a circus clown,  
suggested the human cannonball act in Italy. The brothers built a 
cannon and work began. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1929, while in Denmark traveling with the Zacchini Brothers  
Circus, John Ringling hired one brother to work in Florida. Within 
a few years, the others joined him. In 1939, the family moved to 
Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight years ago, the family was inducted into Ringling Brothers  
and Barnum &AMP; Bailey's Circus Ring of Fame in Sarasota.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Apologizes to Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In their first face-to-face meeting, White  
House lawyers offered Monica Lewinsky an apology Monday ``on behalf 
of the president'' for the difficulties the impeachment 
investigation has caused her. They turned down the chance to ask 
any questions during sworn testimony forced by House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The deposition of the former White House intern took place  
behind closed doors in the Mayflower Hotel's presidential suite, 
but was videotaped for senators weighing the impeachment charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., spent about four hours posing questions  
on behalf of the House prosecution team that fought to persuade the 
Senate to summon Ms. Lewinsky. Her testimony closely tracked her 
earlier account to a federal grand jury, according to sources 
familiar with the testimony who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources were not associated with the House prosecution team  
and worked outside the White House. Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers declined 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	By not questioning Ms. Lewinsky, the Clinton lawyers passed up  
an opportunity to challenge her statements. 
</P>
<P>
	One source said Ms. Lewinsky reaffirmed that:  
</P>
<P>
	--When she asked Clinton what to do about subpoenaed gifts from  
him on Dec. 28, 1997, his response was something like ``let me 
think about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers had argued to the Senate that on other  
occasions, Ms. Lewinsky said Clinton had no reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	--In a middle-of-the-night conversation on Dec. 17, 1997, Clinton  
told her she was on the witness list in Paula Jones' sexual 
harassment lawsuit, suggested she could file an affidavit and 
mentioned their previously arranged cover stories to explain why 
she was coming to see the president. Ms. Lewinsky filed a false 
affidavit denying an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant would not discuss the substance of the questioning, which  
lasted far less than the eight hours set aside by the Senate, but 
he said he ``felt it was a productive session.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On several occasions, Ms. Lewinsky asked Bryant to be more  
specific in his questions, several sources said. Six senators, 
three Republicans and three Democrats, sat in on the session, with 
two at a time acting as referees. 
</P>
<P>
	The videotape was to be made available to the rest of the Senate  
beginning at 8 a.m. EST Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential friend Vernon Jordan will be questioned on Tuesday  
and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal on Wednesday in depositions 
in a private room at the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point in Monday's session, private presidential attorney  
Nicole Seligman read a statement that apologized to Ms. Lewinsky 
``on behalf of the president for all the trouble the investigation 
and impeachment trial had caused her,'' one of the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seligman and the two other Clinton attorneys who attended the  
session posed no questions of the former intern, according to 
several sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's team had planned not to ask questions if the  
lawyers felt the prosecutors had broken no new ground, said several 
Democratic sources familiar with the preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	Away from the session, presidential lawyers were more  
aggressive, filing a new complaint with a federal judge against 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in connection with a weekend 
story in The New York Times that reported Starr had concluded a 
grand jury could indict Clinton before he left office. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kendall, a private lawyer representing Clinton, said he  
was asking a federal court to require Starr to show why he and his 
staff ``should not be held in contempt for improper violations of 
grand jury secrecy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said in a statement that he was ``deeply troubled'' by the  
news story and announced he was ``launching an internal 
investigation to determine whether anyone in this office improperly 
disclosed the information to the Times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After senators view the tape -- available for their viewing at  
four Capitol sites -- excerpts could end up being shown as part of 
the trial, which will resume Thursday. Or senators could vote to 
bring Ms. Lewinsky to the floor for live testimony about her 
relationship with Clinton and attempts to conceal it, a less likely 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's recollection of Clinton's actions and words are  
crucial to the Senate's consideration of several matters: her 
affidavit in the Paula Jones civil lawsuit falsely denying a sexual 
affair with Clinton, the job search after she appeared on the Jones 
witness list and the retrieval of presidential gifts by Clinton's 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources familiar with Bryant's questions said he covered a wide  
range of issues that have been of interest to House prosecutors, 
including the former intern's conversations with the president 
around the time she was emerging as a witness in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky answered calmly, at times clarifying the dates of  
specific conversations and events but tracking her grand jury 
testimony closely, those sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House team promised in advance to shun intimate questions  
about the sexual affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Mayflower Hotel, Lewinsky lawyer Plato Cacheris  
declined to comment on any aspect of the questioning. Asked whether 
she was being compelled to remain in Washington, he replied, 
``Nope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chances were slim for any bombshells at Monday's session  
since Ms. Lewinsky would risk her immunity deal with Starr by 
saying anything that was inconsistent with her grand jury 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	If senators decide that viewing the videotapes provides all the  
information they need, they can proceed to closing arguments in the 
perjury and-obstruction case and meet the goal of ending the trial 
by Friday, Feb. 12, or sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	In previous votes on procedural matters, Democrats have  
demonstrated more than enough strength to block conviction and 
removal of the president by the required two-thirds vote.

<HEADLINE> Jet Stops To Dump Rowdy Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- A chartered jet made an unscheduled stop in  
Virginia after several English and Irish passengers became rowdy on 
their flight from London to Montego Bay in Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents and Norfolk International Airport police questioned  
the dozen passengers -- six couples -- following Sunday's incident, 
but none were charged, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip resumed 2 1/2 hours later without them.  
</P>
<P>
	After the 12 were checked by customs and immigration, ``they  
were permitted to make their own arrangements to leave,'' said 
Patty Schlosser, an FBI spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing 767, chartered by Airtours and carrying 338 people,  
landed here about 12:35 p.m. Efforts to contact Airtours in London 
on Sunday night were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	``About 12 passengers consumed quite a fair amount of alcohol  
and became somewhat unruly'' while the flight was some 560 miles 
off the East Coast, said airport manager Wayne Shank. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the disruption included shouting, and one passenger  
threw a drink on another traveler. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chief flight attendant attempted to settle them down with  
no success, so the captain decided to divert the aircraft to 
Norfolk,'' Shank said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group had calmed down by the time the plane landed, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the fact that the pilot put the airplane on the ground  
and allowed local police aboard was in and of itself a sobering 
experience,'' Shank said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shank said no charges were filed after authorities concluded  
that whatever problems the passengers caused, they had not directly 
interfered with the flight crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they had actually interfered with the crew, that could have  
been a pretty serious federal charge,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Crash Kills Members of Tejano Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZAPATA, Texas (AP) -- Fans and friends of the popular Texas group  
Intocable on Monday mourned the deaths of two performers and the 
group's road manager in a weekend automobile crash in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``We claimed them as part of our community,'' said Amy Salinas,  
secretary for Zapata County Sheriff Sigifredo Gonzalez. ``We're 
deeply hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tejano group hailed from the small south Texas town of  
Zapata and had four platinum albums and popularized their Norteno 
style. 
</P>
<P>
	Killed instantly in Sunday's crash were Jose Angel ``Pepe''  
Farias, 23, the band's on-stage master of ceremonies and a 
percussionist, and Silvestre Rodriguez Jr., 28, who played bass and 
sang. 
</P>
<P>
	Road manager Jose Angel Gonzalez died in an ambulance on the way  
to hospital, said Jesus Garcia Flores, regional commander of the 
Federal Highway Police. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to be missed terribly,'' said Frank Zuniga, a  
Corpus Christi-based producer and agent. ``These guys were packing 
it in wherever they went.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crash happened on a stretch of highway between the border  
city of Reynosa and Monterrey, the capital of the northern Nuevo 
Leon state. 
</P>
<P>
	Intocable joined the Tejano music scene in 1994 and quickly rose  
to the forefront with a combination of emotive vocals, creative 
arrangements and a basic accordion style that helped fuel Tejano 
music's current Norteno craze. 
</P>
<P>
	The band has produced a record a year since 1994 -- ``Fuego  
Eterno,'' ``Otro Mundo,'' ``Llevame Contigo'' and ``Intocable IV'' 
-- and each has sold more than 1 million albums. They played before 
enthusiastic crowds throughout Mexico and the border region, 
including Las Vegas and California.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the yen early Tuesday as  
the Japanese currency continued to strengthen against the euro. 
Tokyo share prices fell in light trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.06 yen in early trading, down 0.42 yen  
from late Monday in Tokyo and marginally lower than its level of 
115.08 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average shed 75.61 points, or 0.52 percent, to  
14,389.57 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Monday, the 
average closed down 34.07 points, or 0.23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar was little changed from its New  
York level on the back of a further sign of U.S. economic strength. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro's weakness against the Japanese currency contributed to  
the yen's relative strength against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was traded at 130.16 yen, down from 131.14 yen late  
Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the euro's slide was based on the market's  
deepening conviction that the European Central Bank is going to 
have to cut interest rates to stimulate euro-zone economies. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Central Bank is scheduled to meet Thursday but  
traders are looking beyond that meeting to a possible rate cut 
sometime in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, stocks started moderately lower amid  
worries about rising long-term interest rates as well the yen's 
strength earlier in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharply surging interest rates hurt the stock market because  
their net effect on corporate activity is seen to be strongly 
negative, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	A higher yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad and  
thus less competitive, eating into earnings of export-led 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section lost 3.25 points, or 0.29 percent. The TOPIX closed 
down 5.89 points, or 0.52 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 2.050  
percent from 2.035 percent, driving its price down to 98.03 yen 
from 98.15 yen.

<HEADLINE> Controversial Doctor Gets Ark. Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- An eye surgeon criticized in his failed  
U.S. Senate campaign for saying that women rarely get pregnant from 
rape was named Arkansas' new health director on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Huckabee praised his appointee to the state's top  
medical post as ``a decent, honorable person who will not embarrass 
our state but who will serve our state with distinction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Fay Boozman, a Christian conservative and former state  
senator, said last year that fear-induced hormonal changes could 
block a rape victim's ability to conceive. He said he would support 
a ban on abortion that made exceptions for rape and incest because 
such pregnancies rarely occur. 
</P>
<P>
	After an outcry from women's groups and some doctors, the  
Republican apologized but stood by his assertion, saying it was not 
based on science but on his own observations as a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	When Boozman made his remark, polls showed him cutting into  
Blanche Lincoln's lead in the Senate race. Afterward, his campaign 
lost momentum and Lincoln, a Democrat, won with 56 percent of the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people will let Fay Boozman do his job ... his record will  
speak far more loudly than the ways in which some of his 
off-the-cuff comments were misconstrued by people,'' Huckabee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boozman was in Washington and did not return calls seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Boozman was also defended by Dr. Joycelyn Elders, the  
controversial former surgeon general who had Boozman as one of her 
students during her pediatric residency at the University of 
Arkansas for Medical Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be careful what you say,'' but never have to  
apologize ``if you always say what you really believe and what you 
mean,'' said Elders, who resigned as surgeon general in 1994 after 
saying masturbation perhaps should be taught in schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a compassionate physician and he will do what he thinks  
is best to improve the health of the citizens of Arkansas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state Health Board initially rejected Boozman, instead  
giving Huckabee the names of an Arkansas doctor with expertise in 
public health and tuberculosis and a Texas doctor who had 
researched firearm deaths, sickle cell anemia and Medicaid policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Huckabee spokesman Rex Nelson said last month the governor did  
not believe those doctors could further his vision for public 
health. 
</P>
<P>
	Under state law, the board and the governor must agree on a  
candidate. With the board's decision last week to add Boozman's 
name to its list of satisfactory candidates, Huckabee's decision 
Monday makes Boozman's selection final. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Rep. Sue Madison, one of Boozman's critics, said she  
was disappointed Huckabee selected a candidate with little public 
health experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we don't have any citizens hurt by this,'' she said.  
``I hope Dr. Boozman will bear in mind the responsibility he has 
and not use personal opinion in this job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Boozman sponsored a law that he said was aimed at  
banning a certain type of late-term abortion, but a judge ruled it 
was unconstitutionally vague. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose Mimms, executive director of Arkansas Right to Life, said  
Boozman represented the views of more Arkansans than some previous 
health directors.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Attorney Says Deal Violated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Boxer Mike Tyson's attorney and Montgomery  
County's new top prosecutor sparred Monday, arguing about a plea 
agreement reached by the two sides in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's attorney, Paul Kemp, said Montgomery County State's  
Attorney Douglas Gansler violated the deal, but Gansler denied the 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, the former heavyweight boxing champion agreed to  
plead no contest to two assault charges stemming from an August 
traffic accident in the Washington suburb of Gaithersburg, Md. 
Under a no contest plea, the defendant neither protests the charges 
nor admits guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, prosecutors waived the right to recommend the manner  
or length of ``executed incarceration'' that Tyson should serve. 
</P>
<P>
	In separate interviews, Kemp and Gansler agreed that executed  
incarceration can mean home detention and time served in a facility 
other than jail. But Kemp argues that Gansler has specified how he 
thinks Tyson should be punished. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's asked for jail time,'' Kemp said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gansler has said publicly, including in conversations with  
reporters, that Tyson should get jail time for allegedly punching 
and kicking two men involved in a minor traffic accident with 
Tyson's wife, Monica. But on Monday he denied using the phrase 
``jail time'' in court or in a memorandum to District Court Judge 
Stephen Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's 100 percent, categorically wrong. We've honored the  
agreement,'' Gansler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are requesting jail time, the word `jail' is taboo,''  
said Gansler. ``The word jail does not appear in our memorandum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler has been on the job since Jan. 4. The agreement with  
Tyson was negotiated by his predecessor, Robert Dean. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an agreement that I would have reached,'' Gansler  
said, adding that it hamstrings prosecutors. ``You can ask for 
incarceration but you can't ask for jail. That's a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's sentencing hearing is set for Feb. 5 in Montgomery  
County District Court. He could receive up to 20 years 
imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson also is on probation in Indiana for a 1992 rape  
conviction. Authorities there say they will wait for the conclusion 
of this case to decide whether he has violated that probation, 
scheduled to end in March.

<HEADLINE> Lycos To Offer Access to MP3 Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Lycos' new Web site allowing users to search for  
any of a half-million online recordings may prove a boon to 
Internet-savvy music aficionados, but it also highlights the 
recording industry's problems with online bootleggers. 
</P>
<P>
	The proliferation of music in audio files on the Net is a  
growing corporate headache, as many of the songs are illegal copies 
made by those who are selling or giving them away online -- without 
the companies taking a cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos' new search engine looks up titles on the Internet that  
use a technology called MP3, a method of encoding music that allows 
computer users to download an entire album in about two hours and 
listen to it on a computer or a Walkman-like player. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has become associated with piracy because it's a simple and  
free way to distribute music,'' said Nicholas DiGiacomo, a vice 
president of Scient Corporation, a consulting firm that has worked 
with the Recording Industry Association of America. ``You look out 
there and there is a generation of people that think wrongly that 
music is free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday afternoon, hours after the new Lycos site was  
launched, the Recording Industry Association of America released a 
statement pledging to work with Lycos to fight copyright 
infringement. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have committed to work with us to develop procedures to  
eliminate infringing sites from their directory,'' the statement 
read, adding that federal law requires Lycos to ``take appropriate 
action whenever they become aware of an infringing musical 
recording.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Lycos representative said the company had no way to determine  
the copyright status of any music that its search engines discover, 
but would cooperate with the recording industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have agreed to work together on this and we will do what we  
are required to do,'' said spokesman Brian Payea, adding that the 
company wouldn't go out of its way to find offending links. ``If 
somebody brings us information we can act, but we aren't going to 
launch our own investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Illustrating the high demand for digital music, Lycos said the  
characters ``MP3'' are among the five most frequent search phrases 
requested on the company's search engines. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos' new service differs from traditional searching in that it  
looks only for MP3 files and the database of those files is updated 
every hour to take in new titles and eliminate defunct Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos developed the MP3 search service in conjunction with Fast  
Search &AMP; Transfer, a Web search technology company based in Oslo, 
Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	MP3 does have legitimate uses. Some budding musicians use it to  
market their songs directly to consumers, bypassing agents, record 
companies and distributors by putting audio files on their own Web 
sites. Some record companies and established artists offer free 
samples online to drum up interest in their music. 
</P>
<P>
	But bootleggers also use MP3, and they have flooded the Internet  
with illegally distributed music, much of it copied directly from 
CDs. 
</P>
<P>
	However, for Mark Leccese, a 41-year-old self-described Boston  
``Webhead'' and amateur musician, MP3 music hasn't kept him out of 
the record store. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he tries out unfamiliar music online, he has still  
amassed a collection of about 500 CDs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I download stuff that I've heard about but I haven't really  
heard. I've been sort of using it as a sampler,'' he said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Man Nabbed at Phoenix Open Charged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Investigators don't believe an armed man arrested  
after scuffling with a police officer during the final round of the 
Phoenix Open intended to threaten Tiger Woods or other PGA stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he just let poor sense get the best of him,''  
Scottsdale police Sgt. Doug Dirren said Monday. ``He got a little 
mouthy, was told to calm down and he didn't heed the officer's 
warnings,'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Maricopa County attorney's office would be asked to  
review charges of aggravated assault and disorderly conduct against 
Brian K. Murphy, 40, of Phoenix, Dirren said. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy was detained briefly in the Scottsdale city jail after he  
was cited Sunday, then was released on his own recognizance. In 
order to face the charges, he must be indicted or be formally 
charged by county prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill FitzGerald, a spokesman for the county attorney's office,  
said the process could take several days, because cases involving 
jailed defendants must be resolved before others. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy did not return messages left on the answering machine at  
his listed telephone number, and FitzGerald was unable to say 
whether Murphy had retained an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	The assault count stems from an altercation between officer Rob  
Rucker, part of a police detail assigned to shadow Woods, and 
Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
	According to witnesses, Murphy had followed the final threesome  
for several holes and kept yelling Woods' name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the fan to be quiet, and he said, `I've got a gun,  
too,' and squared off on me,'' Rucker told The Arizona Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	After the two began grappling, they fell over a rope around the  
tee, and Murphy pulled Rucker's jacket over his head. Another 
officer and a spectator joined in, and pinned the burly Murphy to 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers found a loaded semiautomatic handgun in a backpack,  
Dirren said. Murphy later produced a permit, issued through the 
state Department of Public Safety, that allows him to carry a 
concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Dirren said Murphy was released because, although the assault  
charge is a felony, authorities considered it a minor incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all honesty, these charges didn't warrant him being held  
before a judge,'' Dirren said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Woods, a 23-year-old sensation who finished third on his  
second trip to the tournament, was noncommittal on whether he would 
return to the TPC of Scottsdale. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might come to the point where it might be like a high  
school, where you have to have metal detectors in order to go in,'' 
Woods said. ``Especially when you have this many people doing the 
things they're doing out there.''

<HEADLINE>  Cyprus Sentences Two Israelis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) -- Two Israelis found with radio scanners,  
maps and sophisticated equipment near an army commando training 
camp were sentenced today to three years in prison -- half the 
maximum allowed under Cypriot law. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has strained relations with Israel, whose growing  
military cooperation with Turkey has become a source of serious 
concern to Cyprus, more than one-third of which is occupied by 
Turkish troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israelis, arrested Nov. 6 at a fishing village on the  
southern coast of Cyprus, pleaded guilty last week to approaching a 
prohibited military area. Today, they also received concurrent jail 
terms of six months for possessing wireless scanning equipment 
without a license. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, Udi Hargov and Igal Damary pleaded guilty to the  
lesser charges after the prosecution dropped charges of conspiracy 
and espionage in an apparent plea bargain deal. Conspiracy and 
espionage carried maximum 10-year jail penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israelis arrested at the village of Zigi were found to have  
radio scanners, a laptop computer, cellular phones and eight maps 
of the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The village is near military installations, including an army  
commando training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers reported that the Israelis had made calls to a number  
in Tel Aviv that was believed to be Israel's Mossad spy agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year sentence was half the maximum allowed under  
Cypriot law. 
</P>
<P>
	George Aresti, head of the three-member judicial panel of the  
Larnaca Assize Court, said that although the spying charge had been 
withdrawn, the court could not ignore that the two approached the 
military area ``at a time when a very serious military operation 
was under way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were reports at the time that the operation involved the  
delivery of tanks and other military equipment for the Cypriot 
army. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey has maintained troops in northern Cyprus since 1974, when  
it invaded in support of Turkish Cypriots after a failed coup by 
Greek Cypriots who sought union with Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense had claimed that the Israelis were here in  
connection with an Israeli anti-terrorist operation that was not 
aimed at Cyprus. But the court said no evidence was produced to 
back up the claim. 
</P>
<P>
	After reducing the charges last week, Attorney-General Alecos  
Markides told a news conference that Cyprus had not been pressured 
to drop the spying and conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Markides acknowledged, however, that his Israeli counterpart,  
Elyakim Rubinstein, had come to see him twice about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial began Jan. 20.

<HEADLINE>  Brazil-IMF Talks Calm Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's currency strengthened and  
markets calmed down Monday as a top official of the International 
Monetary Fund flew here to discuss ways to fix the nation's 
battered economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Fischer, the IMF's chief economist, is to meet with  
Finance Minister Pedro Malan on Tuesday in Brasilia, the capital. 
The talks could expedite release of the second installment of a 
$41.5 billion aid package. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Brazil received $9 billion from the IMF and used it  
to bolster its sagging currency reserves, now at $36 billion -- down 
from $74 billion last July. A second parcel might help restore the 
confidence of skittish investors. 
</P>
<P>
	But first the two sides must agree on how to stabilize the real,  
which has plunged since the government devalued the currency on 
Jan. 13 and then let it float freely. 
</P>
<P>
	The real closed stronger Monday at 1.91 to the dollar at midday,  
up from 2.06 at Friday's close. The currency has lost 39 percent of 
its value since the devaluations began. 
</P>
<P>
	The panic that gripped markets on Friday also subsided, after  
rumors that the government would freeze bank deposits sent 
Brazilians scurrying to withdraw their savings. Such a freeze was 
imposed in the early 1990s, leaving many unable to pay their bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan went on television and gave his ``word of honor'' that  
savings wouldn't be touched. ``There is no possibility whatever 
that the government would commit any such violence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When those rumors proved not to be true Monday, the Sao Paulo  
Stock Exchange, Latin America's largest, rose substantially, 
closing up 8.80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	President Fernando Henrique Cardoso attributed Friday's panic to  
speculators in the futures market who profit when the real falls. 
Currency dealers on Friday confirmed that some banks were pushing 
the real down. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brazilians and the IMF have diverged on the best way to  
control inflation in the new era of the free-floating real. After 
reaching 2,700 percent in 1993, inflation plunged to near zero last 
year but now threatens to return. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF favors a sharp rise in interest rates to restrict the  
amount of money in circulation and avert speculation. The problem 
is that high interest rates will worsen the recession and the 
government's own spending deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Sunday at the World Economic Forum in Davos,  
Switzerland, Fischer said that the real has depreciated far beyond 
where it should, but said the country still needs a credible 
monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank on Monday raised its lending rate for banks for  
the fourth straight day. The new rate is 39 percent, up from 37 
percent on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's close to the ceiling of 41 percent set last month.  
Central Bank President Francisco Lopes said a special meeting could 
be convened to raise the limit. 
</P>
<P>
	An IMF team arrived in Brasilia over the weekend to review the  
terms of the aid package. Published reports said the 
Washington-based fund would likely urge Brazil to make deeper cuts 
in spending to reduce its budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the government shaved 5.8 billion reals, or about  
$2.9 billion, off the budget -- surpassing the target of 5 billion 
reals, or $2.5 billion. For 1999, Brazil has pledged to reduce its 
deficit by 28 billion reals, now worth about $14 billion.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sends Budget to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton sent Congress a $1.77  
trillion spending plan today for 2000, beginning a new century with 
record budget surpluses that he would use to shore up Social 
Security and shower billions in new spending on initiatives from 
child care to the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	The release of Clinton's budget is the opening shot in what's  
sure to be a bitter struggle with the Republican-controlled 
Congress over tax cuts and other government priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	While agreeing with Clinton's goal of strengthening Social  
Security, the GOP prefers using the bulk of the remaining federal 
surpluses for across-the-board tax cuts. Republicans accused 
Clinton of reverting to spendthrift liberal ways. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, proclaiming his budget marks a ``new era of  
opportunity,'' proposes increasing spending by 2.3 percent for the 
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Even with the $39 billion increase 
over the current year, Clinton's budget projects a record $117 
billion surplus, thanks to the booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton forecasts $2.41 trillion in surpluses over the next  
decade, laying out a vision of plenty the country has not known in 
70 years, before the Great Depression, World War II and the Cold 
War put the United States into the rut of chronic deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year for the first time in three decades, we turned red  
ink to black,'' Clinton said at a budget kickoff pep rally at the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a rare opportunity that comes along once in a blue  
moon to any group of Americans,'' Clinton said, urging Congress to 
use the coming windfalls to pay down the national debt as part of 
his plan to shore up Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans seek a 10 percent cut in income tax rates, returning  
$600 billion or more to taxpayers over the next decade. That, they 
say, is critical to keep the Democrats from creating new spending 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big government has been reborn and reinvented in this  
budget,'' complained Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete 
Domenici, R-N.M. ``It's clear that the president has initiated 
scores of new programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican Leader Dick Armey of Texas said, ``Out of $4  
trillion in projected surpluses over the next 15 years, the 
president can't find one penny for tax cuts. Instead, he wants to 
use that money to increase spending by $1 trillion -- more than the 
Great Society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposals require approval by Congress, and it's  
unclear how eager the two sides will be to reach compromise given 
the impeachment battle and a looming presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to the GOP call for hundreds of billions in  
across-the-board tax cuts, attacked by Democrats as a sop to the 
wealthy, Clinton's budget offers targeted tax relief of $36.2 
billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	This includes a $1,000 tax credit to help people handle  
long-term health care costs, and a $250 credit for stay-at-home 
parents caring for infants below age 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget also includes several proposals that  
Republicans have rejected in past years -- including a 
55-cent-a-pack increase in cigarette taxes. The president would 
raise $53.4 billion over five years from that, and from a new 
controversial claim on part of the $246 billion tobacco settlement 
states won. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Clinton's budget proposes increasing taxes by $82  
billion in the next five years. Many of the proposals to limit tax 
benefits for corporations and wealthy investors also have been 
rejected by Congress in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Eager to show Clinton hard at work despite his impeachment  
travails, the White House kept up a steady stream of announcements 
about budget details, beginning before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	As first outlined in his State of the Union speech, Clinton  
wants to use 62 percent of the $4.85 trillion in projected 
surpluses over the next 15 years to shore up Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans agree that much of the surplus should be set aside  
for the retirement of 76 million baby boomers, although they 
disagree with the president on how to do this. 
</P>
<P>
	But the big fight will be over what to do with the rest of the  
projected surplus. Clinton wants to devote the rest to support 
Medicare, provide additional spending for the military and domestic 
programs and set up new retirement accounts to funnel $36 billion 
annually into individuals' savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's 2000 budget projects the government will collect $1.88  
trillion in revenues, up 4.3 percent from the current year. The 
$117 billion surplus for 2000 follows a projected $79 billion 
surplus this year and an actual $69 billion surplus in 1998, the 
first year the government had finished in the black in 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The $2.41 trillion in total surpluses the administration  
envisions is about $160 billion below the amount forecast by the 
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The administration 
foresees growth of 2 percent or above in the next five years with 
no recession in sight, even though the current expansion is already 
the longest in peacetime history. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists caution the budget surpluses could vanish if the  
economy starts to turn sour. 
</P>
<P>
	Among highlights of Clinton's plan:  
</P>
<P>
	--Billions more for the Pentagon over the next five years  
although spending would actually go down in 2000. For the entire 
period, Clinton proposes billions in new weapons purchases and the 
largest pay raise for the military in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	--$5 billion to build and renovate schools and hire teachers.  
Clinton would tie part of that for the first time to requirements 
that states upgrade the academic quality of their weakest schools. 
</P>
<P>
	--$5.3 billion for health care initiatives over the next five  
years, including expanding access to Medicare to people below the 
65-year eligibility age.

<HEADLINE>  Cyprus Sentences Two Israelis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) -- Two Israelis found with radio scanners,  
maps and sophisticated equipment near an army commando training 
camp were sentenced today to three years in prison -- half the 
maximum allowed under Cypriot law. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has strained relations with Israel, whose growing  
military cooperation with Turkey has become a source of serious 
concern to Cyprus, more than one-third of which is occupied by 
Turkish troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israelis, arrested Nov. 6 at a fishing village on the  
southern coast of Cyprus, pleaded guilty last week to approaching a 
prohibited military area. Today, they also received concurrent jail 
terms of six months for possessing wireless scanning equipment 
without a license. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, Udi Hargov and Igal Damary pleaded guilty to the  
lesser charges after the prosecution dropped charges of conspiracy 
and espionage in an apparent plea bargain deal. Conspiracy and 
espionage carried maximum 10-year jail penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israelis arrested at the village of Zigi were found to have  
radio scanners, a laptop computer, cellular phones and eight maps 
of the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The village is near military installations, including an army  
commando training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers reported that the Israelis had made calls to a number  
in Tel Aviv that was believed to be Israel's Mossad spy agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year sentence was half the maximum allowed under  
Cypriot law. 
</P>
<P>
	George Aresti, head of the three-member judicial panel of the  
Larnaca Assize Court, said that although the spying charge had been 
withdrawn, the court could not ignore that the two approached the 
military area ``at a time when a very serious military operation 
was under way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were reports at the time that the operation involved the  
delivery of tanks and other military equipment for the Cypriot 
army. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey has maintained troops in northern Cyprus since 1974, when  
it invaded in support of Turkish Cypriots after a failed coup by 
Greek Cypriots who sought union with Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense had claimed that the Israelis were here in  
connection with an Israeli anti-terrorist operation that was not 
aimed at Cyprus. But the court said no evidence was produced to 
back up the claim. 
</P>
<P>
	After reducing the charges last week, Attorney-General Alecos  
Markides told a news conference that Cyprus had not been pressured 
to drop the spying and conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Markides acknowledged, however, that his Israeli counterpart,  
Elyakim Rubinstein, had come to see him twice about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial began Jan. 20.

<HEADLINE> Right Whales Found Nearly Extinct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) -- The dwindling number of right whales  
spotted off the coasts of Georgia and Florida is further evidence 
that the most endangered of the big whales is on the brink of 
disaster, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two mothers and their calves have been spotted this winter  
off the coasts of Georgia and north Florida. Normally, several 
mother-calf pairs and single whales have been seen by January. More 
than two dozen visited the area last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very scary,'' said Chris Slay of the New England  
Aquarium, a researcher who tracks whales for the National Marine 
Fisheries Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The slow, shallow-diving whales indigenous to the North Atlantic  
Ocean became known as the ``right'' whale to kill during whaling 
times because they were easy to harpoon and floated a long time 
after death. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers say the El Nino-La Nina weather cycle of last year  
could be partly to blame, disturbing the deep ocean currents and 
making it more difficult for the whales to find food and each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say no right whales have been killed by ships during the  
past two migrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide, their numbers have dwindled to between 350 to 400.  
Researchers say the 1999-2000 mating season could be critical for 
the species' future.

<HEADLINE> Hornets Cut Rapper Master P </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The millionaire rapper who thought he had  
enough of a game to start a second career in the NBA has been 
waived by the Charlotte Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	Master P, also known as Percy Miller, was one of two players  
waived Monday by the Hornets. The team also waived guard Melvin 
Watson, a rookie from South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller felt that if Los Angeles Lakers' star Shaquille O'Neal  
could play basketball and rap, he could rap and play basketball. 
But he averaged just one point and one assist in Charlotte's two 
preseason losses to the Atlanta Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	An all-state performer in Louisiana, Miller's collegiate career  
at Houston was brief. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, he was with the CBA's Fort Wayne Fury. He was  
invited to the Hornets' camp after Tyree Davis, father of Hornets 
rookie Ricky Davis, talked to Charlotte general manager Bob Bass 
and the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being waived, Miller won't lack for a source of income.  
</P>
<P>
	He started his own record company, No Limit, and has turned it  
into a multifaceted, music-production sports agency business, 
grossing $56 million in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 10 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks were higher at midday, after  
European stocks surged on takeover activity, and Wall Street got a 
boost from strong domestic economic reports. But the broad market 
was lower. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up up 10.29 at 9,369.12. The Dow opened stronger, gave back some 
gains but then proceeded higher a second time. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators opened higher but retreated in late  
morning, with the Nasdaq composite down 4.78 at 2,501.11, and the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index down 7.65 at 1,271.99. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices opened higher after strong gains in Europe, where  
the British, German and French key indexes were all more than 2 
percent higher in midday trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In merger news, Societe Generale is acquiring Paribas for $17.13  
billion in stock to create a French banking powerhouse and the 
world's fourth-largest bank. And 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, French insurer AXA-UAP agreed to buy British insurer  
Guardian Royal Exchange through its Sun Life &AMP; Provincial Holdings 
subsidiary for $5.67 billion in cash and stock. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, Rohm &AMP; Haas agreed to buy salt processor  
Morton International in a transaction worth $4.9 billion. Morton's 
shares were up 9 11/16 at 35 9/16, while Rohm &AMP; Haas's were up 1/8 at 
31 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Socks in New York were also supportd by a report from the  
Commerce Department this moring that Americans' personal income 
surged 0.5 percent in December, the best gain in 10 months, and 
that personal spending surged 0.8 percent, the biggest increase in 
seven months. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m., the National Association of Purchasing Management  
reported another strong piece of news, that its index measuring 
manufacturing activity rose to 49.5 percent in January from 45.3 
percent in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Although any reading under 50 percent is a sign of contraction  
in the industrial sector, the increase was bigger than economists 
had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM data represented ``a very strong rebound in absolute  
terms,'' said Anthony Karydakis, senior financial economist at 
First Chicago Capital Markets, Inc. Combined with last week's 
report on strong gains in durable-goods orders, and a strong report 
from the Philadelphia area on manufacturing activity, ``shows a 
manufacturing sector making a comeback,'' Karydakis said.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky, Jordan Testimony Differed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Vernon Jordan testifies Tuesday in  
President Clinton's impeachment trial, the president's longtime 
friend will face a barrage of questions about conflicts between his 
testimony and Monica Lewinsky's. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the conflicts emerged after Jordan testified to a grand  
jury for his fifth and final time June 9. 
</P>
<P>
	According to grand jury testimony released by Congress, Ms.  
Lewinsky said she showed Jordan some gifts she'd received from the 
president; Jordan didn't recall being shown any. 
</P>
<P>
	The former White House intern said she thought Jordan was  
instructing her to destroy drafts of notes she'd written to the 
president. He denied ever telling her to destroy documents. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had no reason to doubt her denial of having had a  
sexual relationship with Clinton. While she didn't flatly 
contradict Jordan's account, she did say she told him about 
sexually explicit phone calls she had with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``By putting Jordan on their list of top three, House managers  
are signaling that they have some question about the correctness of 
Jordan's earlier testimony and they want to revisit it,'' said St. 
Johns University law professor John Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
	The differences are important because Jordan arranged a job for  
the former White House intern at the same time she was preparing 
the false affidavit denying having sexual relations with Clinton. 
The two actions are joined in the impeachment article accusing 
Clinton of obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said he remembered skimming the affidavit but not  
discussing it with Ms. Lewinsky. And through his lawyer, he said he 
does not recall any reference to sexually explicit phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky said she told Clinton's friend she was concerned  
about some of the language in her affidavit because it could lead 
to Paula Jones' lawyers asking her if she'd ever been alone with 
the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's problem is that Ms. Lewinsky's recollection is filled  
with specific detail. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the sexually explicit phone calls, she said the topic  
arose after she told Jordan she was worried someone might have 
eavesdropped on her conversations with Clinton, and Jordan asked 
her why. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same conversation, the former White House intern said,  
she showed Jordan some gifts Clinton had given her. 
</P>
<P>
	When prosecutors questioned Jordan, he said he'd never had  
breakfast with Ms. Lewinsky. She said otherwise, describing details 
of the menu. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's grand jury testimony ended in June, nearly two months  
before Ms. Lewinsky started cooperating with prosecutor Kenneth 
Starr. Prosecutors had an outline of what she would testify to from 
a 10-page written offer she had given them in February. Ms. 
Lewinsky's offer linked Jordan to conversations regarding the 
gifts, the destroyed notes to the president and reviewing the 
affidavit. She testified twice before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jordan hasn't testified since Lewinsky testified, and one  
question that doesn't seem unreasonable is whether Jordan's 
testimony is as solid as it looked when he was the only witness 
talking,'' Barrett said.

<HEADLINE> British Soccer Coach in Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- England's national soccer coach intends to resist  
calls to quit following his reported comment that the disabled are 
paying for ``the sins of an earlier life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Football Association, the governing body of English soccer,  
is expected to decide Glenn Hoddle's future on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoddle, whose remark was published in the Times of London on  
Saturday, says his words were ``misinterpreted'' and he is 
considering legal action against the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Tony Blair thinks it would be difficult for  
Hoddle to stay, and the team's corporate sponsor is among those 
criticizing the coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he said what he is reported to have said in the way he is  
reported to have said it then I think that was very wrong,'' Blair 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoddle insists his comment was taken out of context, but he has  
yet to precisely spell out what he said about the disabled during 
the disputed interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to resign over this because at the end of the  
day I didn't say those things,'' he told Independent Television 
News. 
</P>
<P>
	``It couldn't be further from the truth from what I believe  
about the handicapped and the disabled. The work that I've done 
with them over 25-26 years is there for everyone to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoddle told Sky News he was ``dreadfully sorry'' for what had  
been written. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been taken out of my hands and I wish I had never taken  
this (reporter) into my confidence,'' he said. ``But at the end of 
the day I made the mistake and I want to put the record straight 
and say that these people are not being punished for their sins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flap comes 10 days before England plays World Cup champion  
France in an exhibition game at Wembley Stadium. Hoddle is to 
announce his lineup Thursday but may be fired or asked to resign 
before then. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a considerable need for urgency,'' said David Davies,  
acting chief executive of the FA. ``There is also a need for 
considerable thought to be given on this matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davies said Hoddle's fate will be decided by the actual FA  
chairman and senior members of the international committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Lazenby, marketing director of the insurance company  
Nationwide, which last week signed a $13 million sponsorship of the 
England team, called Hoddle irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Glenn Hoddle has to understand that as a personality he can't  
escape the fact that he has a responsibility to ensure that his 
personal views shouldn't be confused with those of the England 
team, the FA or its sponsors,'' Lazenby said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nationwide will not allow its good reputation to be tarnished  
in any way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Hoddle leaves this week, two possible successors have been  
mentioned -- former national coach Terry Venables and FA coaching 
director Howard Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoddle had been criticized even before this dispute. His player  
personnel decisions were questioned in the media and he has been 
blamed for England's poor showing during qualifying for the 2000 
European Championship. England is in third place in its group 
behind Poland and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoddle's strong Christian beliefs prompted ridicule in some  
newspapers. He was mocked for enlisting a faith healer before the 
World Cup to help players recover from injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The faith healer, Eileen Drewery, said on TV that Hoddle has  
been treated ``worse than Saddam Hussein'' regarding the contested 
remark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am so distressed to think that has gone out the wrong way  
and I know the man is so compassionate and cares so much,'' said 
Drewery, whose husband is disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	``He puts himself out and raises money and has offered so much  
to invalids in the way of help. Nobody really knows him and they're

<HEADLINE> Microsoft in Battle Over Words </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Through weeks of trial, Microsoft has  
steadfastly denied charges that it illegally bundled its Internet 
browser into newer versions of Windows to smother a software rival. 
</P>
<P>
	In its bedrock courtroom defense, Microsoft maintains that it  
can't be guilty of ``tying'' those products because its browser is 
a component of Windows, not a separate software program. 
</P>
<P>
	But this week Microsoft must square that defense with the words  
of some of its own lawyers, who apparently considered it patently 
obvious that its Internet Explorer browser and its dominant Windows 
operating system are distinct products. 
</P>
<P>
	In paperwork for an obscure U.S. patent awarded in August 1998 --  
months after the government launched its antitrust case -- Microsoft 
lawyers wrote: ``It should be understood by those skilled in the 
art that a Web browser, such as Netscape Navigator or Internet 
Explorer, ... is separate from the operating system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer David Boies, leading the Justice Department case against  
Microsoft, noted Monday that the filing came from the company's 
patent lawyers, who aren't involved in formulating its antitrust 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it shows is that when people are off doing their work,  
not related to this lawsuit, they know they are separate 
products,'' said Boies, who began questioning Microsoft executive 
Jim Allchin on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Mark Murray said patent lawyers were referring  
to alternate versions of Microsoft's browser designed to run on 
rival operating systems, such as on Macintosh or Unix computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The patent filing, involving online banking, also describes  
software programs asking the operating system to retrieve data from 
a particular Internet address -- a technique Microsoft says is 
consistent with its notion of an Internet-savvy Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who has read the document would understand it supports  
our case,'' Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin, a senior vice president and top computer scientist, has  
rejected charges that that Microsoft included its browser within 
Windows to try to ``crush'' rival Netscape Communications Corp., 
whose own browser earned tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``This (patent filing) certainly doesn't help them because  
they've come up with this fictional argument that the browser and 
the operating system are separate products,'' said Microsoft critic 
Mike Pettit, head of the Washington-based Project to Promote 
Competition and Innovation in the Digital Age. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that under federal ``tying'' laws,  
Microsoft's design forces consumers who use Windows also to use its 
browser, discouraging them from using Netscape's popular rival 
software. Roughly 90 percent of the world's computers use Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Under harsh questioning late Monday by Boies, Allchin  
acknowledged that he would ``agree with qualifications'' that 
Microsoft bundled its browser into newer versions of Windows as a 
response to the competitive threat posed by Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure that was discussed, but the original intent was to  
unify browsing,'' said Allchin, who wrote a controversial December 
1996 e-mail in which he urged the company, ``We must leverage 
Windows more. We should think first about an integrated solution -- 
that is our strength.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin also acknowledged that many benefits for consumers from  
Windows 98, with the browser already installed, also are available 
by manually combining Microsoft's browser with older copies of 
Windows 95, which originally didn't include Internet software. 
</P>
<P>
	``But what that approach does is, it allows Netscape and others  
to compete,'' Boies said outside court. ``You don't have to tie the 
two together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By day's end, Microsoft lawyer John Warden pressed the judge  
unsuccessfully to let him speak with Allchin overnight about his 
testimony. The judge previously prohibited the practice, saying he 
worried about Microsoft ``woodshedding a witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boies said he became aware of Microsoft's patent application  
over the weekend and likely will confront Allchin with the document 
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Fight Shaping Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican leaders and President Clinton agree  
that Social Security has the biggest claim on the first string of 
government surpluses the nation has seen in five decades. 
</P>
<P>
	But deciding exactly how to use that windfall to buttress the  
retirement program is shaping up as one of the year's top political 
fights. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Monday that he believes agreement on Social  
Security is possible this year, ``If we work together across 
partisan lines and make some tough but fully achievable choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, however, have been critical of the specifics of  
Clinton's plan, outlined in the fiscal year 2000 budget he sent to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend to see that the surpluses that belong to Social  
Security are not spent and not used for anything else. However, we 
don't agree with the president's approach,'' said Senate Budget 
Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposal, first announced in his State of the Union  
speech, would use 62 percent of the government surpluses expected 
over the next 15 years to beef up Social Security's cash reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	That's more than $2.7 trillion by the latest projections, and  
could push the cash shortage now expected in 2032 back by more than 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican congressional leaders have agreed to set that money  
aside for now. But the bipartisan accord on Social Security ends 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	The president wants the government to invest a quarter of the  
$2.7 trillion in cash into the stock market to try to increase the 
money's value. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans strenuously object, saying that if the government  
becomes a Wall Street player, politics would inevitably corrupt 
free enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	With the rest of the money, Clinton would use a complicated  
accounting strategy to simultaneously pay down the national debt 
and obligate more of the country's future resources to Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say the president's fancy bookkeeping just compounds  
debts already owed to Social Security by the rest of the 
government, without saying how they will ultimately be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is calling for negotiations to come up with a plan  
everyone can agree on. But both Democrats and Republicans have thus 
far avoided any discussion of the most difficult choices that may 
be needed -- whether to raise taxes or to cut retiree benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	One possible area of compromise: Clinton's proposal to use an  
additional 12 percent of the surplus to start new 401(k)-style 
investment accounts for most American workers. Essentially, the 
government would help subsidize people's own retirement savings, 
giving more money to low-income workers. 
</P>
<P>
	That would do nothing to fix Social Security, but could provide  
a cushion for future retirees if benefit cuts are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans would eventually like to see some of the Social  
Security taxes now deducted from workers' paychecks diverted into 
such accounts. That way, they say, the retirement program could 
benefit from stock-market investments controlled by individuals, 
not controlled by the government.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed mixed Monday, with  
share prices falling in Tokyo and Taipei but rising in Hong Kong 
and Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 34.07  
points, or 0.23 percent, to end at 14,465.18. On Friday, the 
average closed up 156.93 points, or 1.09 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices opened higher following gains on Wall Street  
Friday, where the Dow Jones industrial average finished up 77.50 
points, or 0.8 percent, to 9,358.83. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Nikkei average drifted lower during the day on a selling  
of cross-shareholdings, or shares that Japanese companies 
traditionally hold in other companies to cement business 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, companies have begun to sell off such holdings in  
efforts to use their capital more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
	A reported government proposal to keep companies from dumping  
stocks helped support share prices, but many investors remained on 
the sidelines to await details of the plan, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 115.48 in late trading,  
down 0.50 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New 
York level of 116.43 yen Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taipei, share prices closed sharply lower because of concerns  
over Taiwan's economy, with the key index falling to a 32-month 
low. 
</P>
<P>
	The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 135.53 points,  
or 2.2 percent, to 5,862.79. It was the index's lowest close since 
May 28, 1996, when it finished at 5859.54. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taiwan government signaled last week that the island's  
economy is unlikely to pick up during the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong closed higher for the second straight  
session in thin trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 92.65 points, or 0.9 percent, closing at 9,599.55. 
On Friday, the index had gained 145.94 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said share prices rose on selective buying of blue-chip  
stocks on the back of Friday's gains on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading remained thin as many investors stayed on the sidelines  
to await results of bank earnings, which are scheduled to be 
released over the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong banks are expected to show poor earnings because of  
bad loans to mainland Chinese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian market closed higher, with the key index rising  
to a record high on speculation that Australian interest rates 
could be cut later in the week by the Reserve Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The All Ordinaries Index closed at 2,923.7, up 29.9 points, or 1  
percent, and above the previous record high of 2,897.3 set Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was closed in Malaysia for a holiday.  
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher on the back  
of low domestic interest interest rates. The NZSE-40 Capital Index 
rose 29.92 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,209.45. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed mixed, with poor economic  
performance last year putting a damper on positive sentiment stoked 
by the central bank's decision to push domestic interest rates 
lower. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index of 30 selected companies 
rose 15.84 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,969.99. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed higher after the central bank said it  
will continue to lower interest rates. The Korea Composite Stock 
Price Index rose 10.24 points, or 1.8 percent, to 581.67. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly lower. The Straits Times  
Index fell 1.5 percent, or 21.27 points, to 1,406.87. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share closed slightly lower on foreign selling  
pressure in the banking sector on concern over problem loans. The 
SET Index fell 4.16 points, or 1.1 percent, to 358.84. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed lower. The Composite Index  
fell 2.820 points, or 0.68 percent, to 409.112.

<HEADLINE> HMO Growth Helps Aetma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Driven by strong growth in its managed  
care business, Aetna's fourth-quarter earnings rose excluding 
one-time gains, as the nation's largest health maintenance 
organization beat Wall Street estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Before unusual gains, but including Year 2000 compliance costs,  
Aetna earned $154.2 million, or 98 cents per share in the fourth 
quarter. Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected Aetna 
to earn 96 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	When gains related to the sale of Aetna's individual life  
insurance business are included, Aetna's fourth-quarter 1998 net 
income totaled $202.5 million, down 24 percent from earnings of 
$273.9 million in the same quarter in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of  
Aetna slipped 3 percent, or $2.62 1/2, to $87.50. 
</P>
<P>
	Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $5.70 billion, up 19  
percent from $4.79 billion in the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna's Aetna-U.S. Healthcare's total managed care enrollment  
rose 18.7 percent to 13.2 million, including a 35.7 percent gain in 
HMO members. Aetna picked up 1.5 million HMO members with its 
purchase of NYLCare last July. In December, Aetna announced it was 
buying Prudential's health care business, which has about 2.7 
million HMO members. That deal, if completed, would make Aetna the 
nation's largest HMO. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna's health costs in caring for Medicare members increased  
moderately in the fourth quarter, as the insurer pent 92.6 cents of 
every premium dollar on health services in the fourth quarter, 
compared to 91.7 a year ago. Health costs in Aetna's commercial 
business remained stable in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	By adding members and controlling health spending, Aetna-U.S.  
Healthcare's earnings rose 40 percent in the fourth quarter to 
$122.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Aetna's net income totaled $848.1 million, or  
$5.41 per common share, compared to $901.1 million or $5.60 per 
common share in 1997. The 1998 figures reflect $134.9 million in 
capital gains on the sale of Aetna's interest in Travelers 
insurance company and $64 million on the sale of Aetna's individual 
life business. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 earnings reflect a net gain of $131.3 million, related  
to the sale of Aetna's interest in Travelers Property Casualty 
Corp.

<HEADLINE> Right Whales Found Nearly Extinct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) -- The dwindling number of right whales  
spotted off the coasts of Georgia and Florida is further evidence 
that the most endangered of the big whales is on the brink of 
disaster, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two mothers and their calves have been spotted this winter  
off the coasts of Georgia and north Florida. Normally, several 
mother-calf pairs and single whales have been seen by January. More 
than two dozen visited the area last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very scary,'' said Chris Slay of the New England  
Aquarium, a researcher who tracks whales for the National Marine 
Fisheries Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The slow, shallow-diving whales indigenous to the North Atlantic  
Ocean became known as the ``right'' whale to kill during whaling 
times because they were easy to harpoon and floated a long time 
after death. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers say the El Nino-La Nina weather cycle of last year  
could be partly to blame, disturbing the deep ocean currents and 
making it more difficult for the whales to find food and each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say no right whales have been killed by ships during the  
past two migrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide, their numbers have dwindled to between 350 to 400.  
Researchers say the 1999-2000 mating season could be critical for 
the species' future.

<HEADLINE> Defense Budget Has Troop Pay Raise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration's 2000 budget  
includes the largest pay raise for military members in nearly two 
decades and nearly $3 billion for continued U.S. participation in 
Bosnia peacekeeping and enforcement of ``no-fly'' zones over Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	It also urges Congress to authorize two new rounds of military  
base closings -- in 2001 and 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed Pentagon budget is $261 billion, not including $13  
billion for the Energy Department's nuclear weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
	That compares with the $264 billion to be spent by the Defense  
Department in the current year, which includes $4.5 billion in 
extra money Congress appropriated to improve overall military 
preparedness and to pay for Bosnia and Iraq operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in the budget request is an across-the-board pay raise  
for military members of 4.4 percent in 2000, followed by five 
consecutive increases of 3.9 percent a year. That will cost $14 
billion beyond what the administration previously had budgeted for 
pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is roughly in line with Republican calls for increased  
spending to modernize the military's weaponry, improve troop living 
conditions and invest in a defense against missile attack. The 
Senate Armed Services Committee already has proposed pay increases 
bigger than Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen has promoted the plan as  
providing a sustained increase in military spending -- the first 
since the mid-1980s. But actual year-to-year increases do not begin 
until 2001, according to the six-year plan sent to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon documents show spending as measured in outlays, or  
actual dollars spent in the budget year, going from $261 billion 
next year to $269 billion in 2001 and reaching $318 billion four 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has said it is increasing defense spending by  
$12 billion in 2000 and by $112 billion through 2005. The $12 
billion, however, represents the difference between what the 
administration had said a year ago it would spend in 2000 and what 
it now proposes to spend. Much of the $12 billion is actually 
savings from lower-than-expected inflation, not new money. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the $112 billion in increased spending through 2005, $84  
billion would come from projected surpluses in the overall federal 
budget. The remaining $28 billion is savings on previously budgeted 
programs, reflecting lower inflation and other adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Cohen said the plan addresses pressing concerns  
about inadequate recruiting and insufficient money for weapons 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although U.S. forces continue to accomplish their missions  
splendidly, there are warning signs of potential problems,'' he 
said, citing recent shortfalls in recruiting and keeping troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the key proposals:  
</P>
<P>
	--$4.25 billion for missile defense in 2000, including $1.3  
billion to develop a system for defending all 50 states against 
attack by a limited number of long-range ballistic missiles. 
Investment in missile defense through 2005 would total $6.6 billion 
in anticipation of possibly deploying it by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	--The number of active-duty troops would hold steady in 2000 at  
1.39 million. 
</P>
<P>
	--$1.8 billion for continuing participation in Bosnia  
peackeeping, and $1.1 billion for no-fly zone enforcement in Iraq.

	Depositions Begin With Lewinsky  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors and White House lawyers each  
have four hours today to question Monica Lewinsky about her affair 
with President Clinton and charges that he committed perjury and 
obstructed justice in trying to conceal it. The deposition was 
taking place at Washington's Mayflower Hotel, presided over by one 
Democratic and one Republican senator and videotaped for viewing by 
other senators. The process will be repeated tomorrow when 
Clinton's friend Vernon Jordan, who helped Ms. Lewinsky find a job, 
will be deposed; and on Wednesday, when White House aide Sidney 
Blumenthal will be questioned.

	Clinton Offers $1.77 Trillion Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is sending Congress a $1.77  
trillion spending plan for 2000, beginning a new century with 
record budget surpluses he wants to save for Social Security. He 
also proposes sizable new sums for the military, education, the 
environment and public health. The budget forecasts $2.41 trillion 
in surpluses over the next decade, laying out a vision of a budget 
landscape the country has not known in 70 years, before the Great 
Depression, World War II and the Cold War put the United States 
into a rut of chronic deficits. All of Clinton's proposals require 
approval by Congress, and it is unclear how both sides will be 
eager to reach compromises in view of the contentious impeachment 
battle and with a presidential campaign looming.

	India, Pakistan Move on Nuke Issue  
</P>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India has made a conditional offer to  
sign a nuclear test ban treaty, while its rival Pakistan today 
demonstrated a renewed willingness to stop nuclear tests. U.S. and 
Indian officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said today 
that India agreed to sign the treaty provided that economic 
sanctions imposed last year after it held nuclear tests were 
lifted. Pakistan, meanwhile, promised a tough new law to guarantee 
that sensitive nuclear technology doesn't become available to the 
highest bidder and said it was prepared to adhere to the global 
nuclear test ban treaty.

	U.S., British Planes Pound Iraq  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq has rejected an initiative on ending  
its deadlock with the United Nations, while U.S. and British jets 
bombed Iraqi installations. President Saddam Hussein met with 
senior government officials to discuss the U.N. Security Council 
proposal and decided ``this measure is not of our concern,'' the 
official Iraqi News Agency said yesterday. On Saturday, the council 
decided to create panels to assess Iraqi disarmament, humanitarian

	Kosovo Rebels May Oppose Talks  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ethnic Albanian rebels are hinting  
at opposition to international peace talks on Kosovo this week, 
saying negotiations ``organized in a rush'' cannot resolve the 
conflict. Meanwhile, violence erupted again yesterday, despite 
international demands to halt the fighting. Police sources, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, said three Serb policemen 
returning from the funeral of a slain officer were wounded late 
yesterday when ethnic Albanian rebels fired a grenade at their van 
in the village of Istinic, 45 miles southwest of Kosovo's capital, 
Pristina.

	2nd-Straight Super Bowl Win for Broncos  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- It was the perfect ending for Broncos quarterback  
John Elway -- a 34-19 victory over the Atlanta Falcons and the Super 
Bowl MVP award. But he's not saying whether he will retire. With 
yesterday's win, the Broncos became the first AFC team to win 
consecutive league crowns since the Steelers won the 1979 and '80 
Super Bowls. No team has won three in a row, nor has any 
quarterback. Elway, who has been in the NFL for 16 seasons, says 
that ``will go into the thinking and throw a kink into the thinking 
on what I decide to do next year.''

	Top 3 Unchanged in Women's Poll  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tennessee, Purdue and Louisiana Tech remained  
the top three teams today in The Associated Press women's 
basketball poll, which had two new teams at the bottom. Louisiana 
State and Florida International joined the poll for the first time 
this season. LSU's inclusion gave the Southeastern Conference five 
teams in the Top 25, more than any other league.

<HEADLINE> Victims AIDS-Tainted Medicine Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Bobby Kelly died in his father's arms,  
unable to bounce back again from the AIDS virus he contracted from 
medication meant to stop internal bleeding caused by his 
hemophilia. 
</P>
<P>
	Newly graduated from Seton Hall University, Bobby was just 22  
when he succumbed to an AIDS-related infection in October 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, Elaine and Robert Kelly buried their oldest  
son, Dennis, a 35-year-old warehouse manager with a wife and 
5-year-old boy, killed by AIDS contracted from tainted clotting 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our lives are destroyed now,'' Mrs. Kelly said last week.  
``They could never give us enough money to make up for the loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Kellys and other hemophiliacs and their families do want  
financial compensation -- enough to persuade blood product makers to 
ensure that there's never another catastrophe like the one that 
left half the country's 16,000 hemophiliacs HIV-infected in the 
early 1980s and gradually killed most of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemophilia is a painful, usually hereditary disorder in which  
sporadic bleeding episodes destroy joints and damage organs. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims and relatives claim the four drug companies that sold  
freeze-dried clotting proteins -- derived from the blood of 
thousands of paid donors from prisons and U.S. and Haitian slums -- 
delayed taking expensive steps to purify that blood in order to 
keep their profits high. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies have denied that, triggering years of court  
battles. Many families sought justice, but faced such difficult 
legal hurdles that they dropped their lawsuits and accepted a 
$100,000 settlement offer, releasing the four drug companies from 
any future claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, 5,836 of the 6,136 eligible patients or their  
families had been paid as of December, with the rest delayed by red 
tape, said Guy Esnouf, spokesman for the four manufacturers: Alpha 
Therapeutics of Los Angeles; Armour Pharmaceutical of Collegeville, 
Pa.; Baxter International of Deerfield, Ill., and Bayer Inc. of 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people had been injured by our products and we wanted to  
provide some financial relief without them having to sue,'' Esnouf 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in New Jersey, the quest for justice drags on as the  
manufacturers try to get the courts to declare unconstitutional a 
1996 law erasing their first line of defense: the two-year statute 
of limitations for filing product liability claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturers argue that the law is unconstitutional because  
it narrowly targets them, not allowing lawsuits against hospitals 
or other nonprofit agencies that handled blood-clotting products. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Douglas Wolfson in New Brunswick, who  
oversees all hemophilia-AIDS litigation in the state, ruled the law 
constitutional in September 1997 when the issue was first raised in 
a victim's trial. The companies have appealed the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel confident that the legislation will be upheld,'' said  
Elena Bostick, executive director of the Hemophilia Association of 
New Jersey, which lobbied for the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, about 200 lawsuits are still pending, including two  
dozen in New Jersey that should benefit from the May 1996 ``revival 
law,'' and 60 in New York State, which enacted a copycat law in 
December 1997 that the industry plans to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	While the companies also are appealing one $2 million jury  
verdict against them, most victims whose cases came to trial 
couldn't win because they did not sue within two years of learning 
they were infected with HIV -- something many wanted to keep secret. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't tell anybody because we were so afraid for'' the  
boys, recalled Mrs. Kelly. ``We found out the same day that they 
were both infected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Vogel, who learned clotting products infected him with HIV  
in 1985, said that suing the manufacturers is ``the only way 
they're going to learn a lesson, from a big monetary loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the 42-year-old freelance photographer has so far remained  
healthy, the infection cost him his first marriage and a chance for 
children. He fears the slightest sign of illness might be the onset 
of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost like (the manufacturers) didn't learn anything  
from the '80s,'' he said. ``We don't want this to happen again.''

<HEADLINE> Johnny Depp Fends Off Paparazzi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Johnny Depp was back to his bad-boy ways when he  
chased off photographers with a piece of wood outside a trendy 
restaurant, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police held the actor for almost four hours after the fracas  
Sunday at Mirabelle, where he had dined with French actress Vanessa 
Paradis, newspapers reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's newspapers carried photos of Depp clutching the wood,  
being questioned by police and being taken into custody. The Sun 
tabloid reported that Depp ``flipped out'' and started screaming 
obscenities when photographers tried to take his picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Depp's agent said he would release a statement about the  
incident. 
</P>

	Depp's most recent film is ``Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.''

	BOSTON (AP) -- Jack Nicklaus left the hospital Monday with a new  
ceramic hip and hopes of playing golf again and dancing at his 
son's wedding next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The 59-year-old golf great was doing fine after surgery  
Wednesday, Dr. Benjamin Bierbaum said. Nicklaus will be on crutches 
for six weeks and plans to follow the strict instructions of both 
his doctors and wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife told me the one thing I'm going to do is dance at my  
son's wedding,'' he said. ``Other than that, I'm going to do 
nothing for six weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus will miss the Masters in April for the first time in 40  
years and possibly the U.S. Open in June, but doctors have said he 
should be able to play competitively again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any illusions, at the age of 59 or 60, of coming  
back and competing with the Tiger Woodses and David Duvals,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Fans Celebrate Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- No championship, no matter to loyal Falcons fans.  
</P>
<P>
	For these traditionally dispirited rooters, seeing Atlanta in  
its first Super Bowl was satisfaction enough Monday afternoon as 
thousands turned out to welcome the team home from a 34-19 loss to 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	On a raw, mucky day, fans ditched work and cut class to  
celebrate the team's astonishing season, if not a victory against 
the Broncos. There were, literally, no fair weather fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Perched on fire trucks, the team rolled down Peachtree Street in  
downtown Atlanta, many players filming the crowd for posterity, 
savoring the end of a season that amazed football watchers 
nationwide because of the team's dismal history. 
</P>
<P>
	Several fans said Atlanta's chances to win were killed by  
turnovers and inexperience. Others simply noted that the better 
team won. But one loss, even at the Super Bowl, wouldn't alter 
their affections. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a party, man,'' fan Delman Collier said. ``They were  
going against the world champions, after all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta mayor Bill Campbell said the city would mount a plaque  
at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport commemorating the 
Falcons' winning the 1998 NFC championship. Next year, the city 
hopes to celebrate a Falcons' Super Bowl victory at their home, the 
Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is only a temporary sign,'' Campbell said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jane Bates, a fifth grade teacher from Alpharetta, skipped  
school and donned her homemade ``Dirty Bird'' costume: a cardboard 
beak and red and black feathers glued to cardboard wings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were out of their league,'' said H.C. Turner of Atlanta.  
``I'm just glad they made it this far. They made it to the party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the parade, the players assembled on a stage at a small  
park, where an estimated 5,000 fans gathered to hear from the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The loudest cheers went to coach Dan Reeves, running back Jamal  
Anderson, cornerback Ray Buchanan and safety Eugene Robinson, 
arrested on a sex charge Saturday night in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the things they said we couldn't do, we did,'' Reeves  
said. The Falcons' two victories during this postseason matched the 
total for the last 32 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	And when Atlanta plays host to the 2000 Super Bowl, Reeves has  
set a new goal for his team: 
</P>
<P>
	``There's never been a team that has played in the host city,  
the home team,'' Reeves said. ``That's our goal next year. We want 
to be the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves also made good on his promise to dance the Dirty Bird in  
downtown Atlanta after the Falcons' improbable win over Minnesota 
to advance to the Super Bowl. He did the flapping dance twice, the 
first time on a fire truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Chris Chandler, rattled into three interceptions by  
the Broncos' defense, was booed loudly. So was Gov. Roy Barnes and 
Campbell. This was a day for football players, not politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want the Falcons, we want the Falcons,'' went the cheer.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so proud of them,'' said Cecelia Hamrick, a Decatur grade  
school teacher who brought her daughter to the parade and relied on 
a substitute to cover her class. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Atlanta Falcons were in the Super Bowl, and I probably  
won't live long enough to see it again.''

<HEADLINE> Broncos Given Victory Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Thousands of fans, some with their faces and heads  
painted blue and orange, some holding infants swaddled in mini-John 
Elway uniforms, gathered under cloudy skies Monday to celebrate the 
Broncos' second straight Super Bowl victory and plead with Elway to 
play one more season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will come back because he wants to be the only quarterback  
to three-peat,'' said Cindy Unrein Chengery, a season ticket holder 
like her parents before her. 
</P>
<P>
	But, hugging a reporter, she added, ``It's not just Elway  
anymore. We have a whole team now ... Terrell Davis, Bill 
Romanowski, Rod Smith...'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't call them the donkeys anymore,'' said Fran Cronin, a  
Denver native who has been a fan all her life and watched the 
Broncos lose four Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Elway's teammates had said they expect him to retire,  
but that was before Sunday night's 34-19 victory over the Atlanta 
Falcons. Elway was named the game's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to the crowd at a downtown rally that followed a  
victory parade, Elway gave the fans a spark of hope that he could 
be back for more, but no guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
	``That three-peat does sound interesting,'' Elway said after  
doing a little dance to a Billy Idol song when he was introduced. 
``But we'll talk about that, but right now we're going to enjoy 
this win we had last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Coach Mike Shanahan, who usually avoids putting any public  
pressure on his quarterback, urged Elway to stay, saying ``One more 
time for Elway,'' and starting a crowd chant of ``One More Year, 
One More Year!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway would say nothing more about his plans.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to say that after 14 years I thought it could get  
better, 15 it was great, and after 16 to win two in a row, it's 
been unbelievable,'' he said. ``And we all up here owe you a bunch 
because without you it's not all possible. So we up here thank you. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought last year was great, this year was even better,''  
the quarterback said. ``As I said two weeks ago, I love you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos initially said they wanted only a rally because nine  
players needed to get to Honolulu for the Pro Bowl by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But fans and Mayor Wellington Webb convinced the team to change  
its position, saying the Broncos should show some gratitude to the 
city that voted last November to give them a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos traveled down Broadway on fire trucks and in buses,  
starting in the downtown area and continuing about a mile to Civic 
Center Park for the rally. Police and a spokesman for the mayor 
estimated the crowd size at 375,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of them were small children, some doing their best  
imitation of running back Davis, whose jersey they wore, as they 
zigged and zagged to get away from their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	So many thousands of people crowded into the 16th Street Mall  
that shuttle buses had to stop running. The city took on an almost 
medieval air with hawkers selling every kind of Broncos 
paraphernalia, and others offering to paint fans' faces blue and 
orange for $3. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the crowd sat for several hours or more -- with a strong  
north wind dropping the wind chill into the 20s -- to hear their 
heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to say that this year I think is a little bit  
more special than last year,'' Davis told the crowd. ``I think the 
road to getting back here was a little tougher. But my teammates 
and I we got together ... and we got another one baby, thanks a 
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans began gathering at Civic Center before the sun rose.  
</P>
<P>
	Laurie Franti, who moved to Denver from Buffalo, was sporting a  
No. 84 Broncos jersey in honor of her favorite player, Shannon 
Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like him because of his mouth,'' she said. ``He can talk his  
way down the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franti's son, Jake, a fifth grader, skipped school to attend the  
rally. He was hoping to catch a glimpse of his favorite player, Ed 
McCaffrey. 
</P>
<P>
	Dymple Palmer had painted the Broncos mascot, Thunder, on her  
fingernails. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't believe we would win two in a row,'' she said. ``Now  
we're true believers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many in crowd wore Styrofoam horse heads modeled after Thunder  
that were going for $40. In a playoff game, tight end Sharpe rushed 
over and nuzzled the horse after scoring a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The parade route was much shorter than last year, when 650,000  
people turned out to celebrate the end of Denver's 37 years in 
football's wilderness. That rally was held several days after the 
Super Bowl on a sunny day when temperatures hit 60. 
</P>
<P>
	The team had gone to the Super Bowl four times, losing by large  
margins in all of them, and after its first victory drew nearly 
twice as many to its parade as had gathered to see Pope John Paul 
II celebrate mass in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fans, their hearts broken so often, took to calling them  
the ``Donkeys.'' Some media representatives referred to them as 
``Elway and the 10 dwarfs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway was the quarterback in the last three losses. Last year,  
he became the oldest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, in a 31-24 
victory over Green Bay, at age 37, in his 15th season.

	Numerous ambulances were called to the Ford Rouge plant in the  
Rouge River area just after 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby Oakwood Hospital received 12 to 14 people, some with  
``Priority One'' injuries, which is the most severe injury 
designation, spokeswoman Jennifer George told WDIV television. She 
also said the hospital was expecting six to eight more people. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Michigan Hospital spokeswoman Carol Craig said its  
medical helicopter was heading to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a head count yet. We are expecting some patients  
for our burns unit,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen ambulances lined the streets around the burning  
building, as heavy gray smoke billowed from the windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we know is there's been an incident at the Number Three  
boiler at the power house at the Ford Rouge complex,'' Ford 
spokeswoman Francine MacBride said. ``Fire has been dispatched, but 
they haven't told us updates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The power house generates electricity for the entire complex.  
</P>
<P>
	Dearborn police cordoned off the area around the plant and said  
they were being cautious because they feared there could be a 
second explosion, an officer who wouldn't give his name said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,100-acre Rouge facility was once the world's largest auto  
plant. Henry Ford built the plant in 1918 because he dreamed of 
building a car from start to finish in one location. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak in the 1940s, 85,000 people worked at the plant in  
Dearborn, about 7 miles west of Detroit. About 8,000 people work at 
the six Ford factories still in operation at the Rouge, and Ford 
builds the Mustang there. 
</P>
<P>
	The complex has acres of vacant space, but remains Ford's  
largest concentration of employees and factories, and houses 
several suppliers as well.

<HEADLINE> Plush Home Central to Minister Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- The Rev. Henry J. Lyons was listed as a  
married man on documents when he was seeking to buy a waterfront 
home, but that was replaced with ``a single man'' when he learned 
his wife would have to sign the mortgage papers, a lawyer testified 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, president of the National Baptist Convention USA, is on  
trial with his alleged mistress, Bernice Edwards, on racketeering 
charges. They are accused of swindling more than $4 million from 
corporations seeking to do business with the black church group. 
</P>
<P>
	Real estate lawyer Seymour Gordon, who worked with the pair to  
buy the $700,000 home, said he told Lyons at the closing that 
mortgages for primary residences require a spouse's signature, and 
one of his loan documents indicated he was married. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons then told him he was not married, Gordon said, so he had  
his secretary cross out the phrase and replace it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked the gentleman, he told me, and I changed it,'' Gordon  
testified. ``There were other documents that showed him as a single 
man, so it all made sense to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' wife, Deborah Lyons, set fires inside the home after  
finding a deed in his briefcase showing he owned it with Ms. 
Edwards, she told deputies after being arrested for arson. 
</P>
<P>
	She was sentenced to five years probation, and prosecutors began  
investigating Lyons' finances. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Ms. Edwards are accused of duping corporations that were  
seeking to market funeral plots, life insurance and credit cards to 
the convention's touted 8.5 million members. They allegedly used 
the money to buy expensive homes, diamond jewelry and luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have called the 8.5 million membership number a  
hoax, and said there may be as few as 1 million members of the 
church organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' lawyers have said he is simply being held accountable for  
failing to raise enough money for the group.

<HEADLINE> Tech Titans Speak at World Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- The heads of high-tech titans  
Microsoft and Dell said today that distributors and dealers face a 
stiff challenge from trade over the Internet but that traditional 
business shouldn't feel too threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft chairman Bill Gates told the World Economic Forum that  
he saw the biggest potential for small companies to trade worldwide 
because they ``are able to offer their unique services through the 
Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Dell, chief executive of the world's biggest direct  
seller of personal computers, Dell Computer Corp., called the 
Internet ``a turbocharger for our success in our business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The companies which use a series of distributors or dealers  
are challenged by this,'' Dell told industry and political 
heavyweights at this annual economic gathering. 
</P>
<P>
	But Scott McNealy, chief executive of leading computer systems  
maker Sun Microsystems Inc., said companies should focus on their 
products rather than Internet-based business itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a hard time with the concept of a virtual corporation  
because it might lead to virtual profits,'' McNealy said. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. government report last week said 52,000 Americans log on  
to the Internet for the first time every day. Companies across the 
economy are exploring sales and marketing on the Internet of 
products from flowers to plane tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cost of comparison shopping has gone to zero -- that is a  
huge, huge win,'' said McNealy. 
</P>
<P>
	The process ``sets up some winners and losers,'' he added. ``I'd  
rather bet on Ford long-term than the dealer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On-line commerce will make recognized brand names even more  
valuable, McNealy claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Martin, international president of the retail giant Wal-Mart  
Stores Inc., said Internet business is ``at the threshold'' of 
takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``I don't think that traditional business should be  
threatened by what's taking place,'' Martin said. ``We've 
established the brand, we've established the trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates said ``operating in a very digital way'' would be a key to  
global success in future. 
</P>
<P>
	McNealy said he primarily sees electronic commerce creating new  
opportunities -- not edging out existing business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly it's easy to get on line, but that doesn't mean that  
everyone who does it is going to do as well as companies which 
excel in that medium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters later, McNealy said the millennium bug  
could still create problems for the computer industry because Asia 
is ``disastrously behind'' in preparing for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Other regions are in ``pretty reasonable shape'' in stocking up  
on bug-free components, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates said the bug, ``although it's a terrible distraction, a  
terrible cost, and there will be some disruption,'' had helped push 
companies toward using more standardized software. 
</P>
<P>
	Some programs, especially older ones, may fail when the date  
changes to 2000. Because they were written to recognize only the 
last two digits of a year, they could read the digits ``00'' as 
1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder also was to speak at the  
forum, a day after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak called for a 
rethinking of the free-market approach and U.N. chief Kofi Annan 
urged business leaders to accept largely ignored U.N. labor and 
other human rights conventions.

<HEADLINE> How Clinton's Budget Would Be Spent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	President Clinton's budget by agency and issues:  
</P>
<P>
                             *DEFENSE   	
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: The Pentagon would get $261 billion in new spending in  
2000, including the largest pay raise for military members in 
nearly two decades -- 4.4 percent in 2000, followed by five 
consecutive increases of 3.9 percent. Nearly $3 billion would go 
for Bosnia peacekeeping and enforcement of no-fly zones over Iraq. 
Clinton wants $4.25 billion for missile defense in 2000. He asks 
Congress for two new rounds of base closings -- in 2001 and 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	The request for $261 billion is actually lower than the $264  
billion the Pentagon received this year, as measured in outlays, or 
actual dollars spent in the budget year. But Clinton proposes the 
budget increase to $269 billion in 2001 and reach $318 billion four 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has said it is increasing defense spending by  
$12 billion in 2000 and by $112 billion through 2005. The $12 
billion, however, represents the difference between what the 
administration had said a year ago it would spend in 2000 and what 
it now proposes. Much of the $12 billion is savings from low 
inflation, not new money. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP: Republican proposals are roughly in line with Clinton's,  
calling for increased spending to modernize weaponry, improve troop 
living conditions and invest in missile defense. But the Senate 
Armed Services Committee already has proposed pay increases bigger 
than Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
	LAST YEAR: Congress approved $264 billion for the Defense  
Department in the current year, including $4.5 billion in extra 
money to improve overall preparedness and pay for Bosnia and Iraq 
operations. 

</P>
<P>
                          *SOCIAL SECURITY   	
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: The budget calls for spending 62 percent of government  
surpluses expected over the next 15 years -- a projected $2.76 
trillion -- to help bolster Social Security's cash reserves. Without 
help, the retirement program is expected to run short of cash in 
2032, during baby boomers' old age. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants the government to invest about $700 billion of the  
cash in the stock market to try to increase its value -- the first 
time Social Security reserve money has been invested privately. 
With the rest, Clinton would use a complicated accounting strategy 
to simultaneously pay down the national debt and obligate more of 
the country's future resources to Social Security. Administration 
officials say the plan would keep Social Security from financial 
crisis until 2055. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has also proposed using an additional 12 percent of  
government surpluses over the next 15 years -- or $536 billion -- to 
subsidize new 401(k)-style retirement savings accounts for most 
working Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP: Republican leaders have agreed to set aside 62 percent of  
expected government surpluses while lawmakers discuss Social 
Security's future, but they disagree with the specifics of 
Clinton's plan. They are strongly opposed to having the government 
invest in the stock market, saying free enterprise would inevitably 
be corrupted by politics. They also have accused the president of 
using funny bookkeeping that would compound debts already owed to 
Social Security by the rest of the government without saying how 
they will ultimately be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	LAST YEAR: Clinton had asked lawmakers to hold off spending  
government surpluses during a year of town-hall meetings on Social 
Security's future. 

</P>
<P>
                              *TAXES   	
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: From families with young children to the beleaguered  
steel industry, the budget proposes tax credits and other tax 
relief totaling $36.2 billion over five years. Among those aimed at 
the middle class: a credit of up to $500 for stay-at-home parents 
caring for infants under age 1 and a $1,000 credit for people 
providing long-term care for and/or disabled people. Disabled 
workers could take a $1,000 credit for costs associated with their 
jobs, employers would be encouraged to provide health insurance and 
the steel industry would get $300 million in breaks to combat 
foreign dumping. There are also credits for purchase of certain 
fuel-efficient cars, corporate investment in poor areas and 
preservation of open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration proposes $82 billion in new or increased  
taxes, led by a 55-cents-a-pack cigarette tax that would $34.5 
billion over five years. Sixteen corporate tax loopholes would be 
closed, raising $7.1 billion. In total, the package envisions 79 
new or increased taxes, mostly on business. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP: Republicans are pushing a broad across-the-board income tax  
rate cut of at least 10 percent, as well as relief from the 
``marriage penalty'' that hits millions of two-earner couples and 
elimination of the estate tax on inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
	LAST YEAR: The president proposed $24.2 billion in tax relief  
and $106.5 billion in new revenue, again led by tobacco taxes that 
never materialized. 

</P>
<P>
                            *CHILD CARE   	
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Head Start, child care and foster care programs and  
would get increased spending. The budget calls for $6.3 billion 
over five years to expand the tax credit for expenses to families 
earning up to $59,000 a year and to families in which one parent 
stays home to care for children. It seeks $7.5 billion over five 
years to offer more child care subsidies to working poor families. 
For Head Start, Clinton wants a $607 million boost to $5.3 billion, 
in order to serve an additional 42,000 children. The budget seeks 
to help children in foster care who turn 18 by letting them keep 
their public health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP: Head start has found considerable support among  
Republicans, as well as Democrats, in Congress. GOP leaders have 
preferred across-the-board tax cuts to more child care spending. 
</P>
<P>
	LAST YEAR: Clinton proposed a $22 billion child care program,  
which went nowhere in Congress, though there was GOP interest in 
aiding stay-at-home parents. After some skirmishes, Congress 
approved bipartisan legislation renewing the Head Start program, 
though its budget must be approved annually. 
</P>
<P>
                         *HEALTH INSURANCE   	
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: The budget tries to get health insurance to people who  
work for small business, those with disabilities returning to work 
and legal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	It asks for $44 million in tax credits to encourage small  
businesses to join coalitions to offer health insurance to workers. 
It seeks $2 billion over five years to help people with 
disabilities keep Medicare and Medicaid when they return to work 
and a new $1,000 tax credit to pay for needed adaptive technology 
and other special expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget allows $1.1 billion over five years for states to  
offer Medicaid and the new children's health insurance program to 
many immigrants, including children, pregnant women and those with 
disabilities. Immigrants would be eligible even if they arrived in 
the country after enactment of the 1996 welfare bill. The money 
would also restore disability and food stamp eligibility for these 
immigrants. States would be able to extend Medicaid for three years 
to foster children who turn 18. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP: Republicans also want to encourage small businesses to join  
in health insurance purchasing groups. And bipartisan legislation 
to aid people with disabilities who want to return to work is 
pending in the Senate. But the GOP has been cool to restoration of 
benefits for immigrants, saying people should not come to the 
United States expecting public aid. 
</P>
<P>
	LAST YEAR: The House approved legislation aiding people with  
disabilities, though it did not include the centerpiece -- letting 
them keep health benefits. It died in the Senate. Some food stamp 
benefits were restored for legal immigrants. 

</P>
<P>
                          *TRANSPORTATION   	
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: The administration wants to spend $45.5 billion on  
transportation, an increase of about 8.6 percent. Once again, 
there's more money for highway and aviation safety and more to 
reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. There's also 
spending aimed at triggering economic growth, including about $180 
million in loan guarantees for U.S. shipyards. 
</P>
<P>
	A big gainer is the Office of the Transportation Secretary,  
where the budget would jump from $89 million to $132 million. Two 
big losers are the Maritime Administration, whose budget would fall 
from $204 million to $111 million, and the Surface Transportation 
Board, whose $15 million would be cut to $1 million. The Coast 
Guard, which is overseen by the transportation secretary, would get 
$4.297 billion, up about 6.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP: Republicans are also talking about similarly isolating  
money for aviation improvements. But there could be a fight over an 
administration proposal to raise the Passenger Facility Charge, an 
airline ticket tax that is used for airport construction. 
</P>
<P>
	LAST YEAR: The administration and the GOP found themselves in  
agreement on transportation. Not only did they join to approve the 
nation's largest highway spending bill, $203 billion, but they 
agreed that all money collected by the gas tax would be spent on 
road, bridge and mass transit improvements. 
</P>
<P>
                         *MEDICAL RESEARCH   	
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: The National Institutes of Health would get a $320  
million boost to its $15.6 billion budget. That's a 2 percent 
increase for NIH, the nation's biggest financer of medical 
research. It includes an additional $35 million for AIDS-related 
research, totaling $1.8 billion, and a new $50 million National 
Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration, the nation's top consumer  
protection agency, would get a massive 17 percent increase, or an 
additional $190 million. It would be the agency's first raise after 
six years of flat-lined budgets that have left it millions in the 
hole. The money is to help the FDA approve new medical therapies 
faster, better inspect drug and food manufacturing plants to ensure 
their products are clean and safe, and better track side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA also would get doubled funding, to $68 million, to  
ensure that stores enforce the law that customers must be 21 to 
purchase tobacco. But the increase also includes $17 million in 
proposed fees charged to the makers of foods and medical devices, 
which those industries have successfully opposed in past years. 
</P>
<P>
	Health agencies also will receive $230 million, an increase of  
$71 million, to prepare a response to potential biological 
terrorism. The money will go toward research on smallpox and 
anthrax vaccines, a stockpile of drug treatments and to support 25 
``local response teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would receive an  
extra $213 million, bringing its budget to $2.6 billion. That 
includes a 19 percent increase for CDC to track and prevent 
emerging infectious diseases, like the threat of a new flu 
pandemic. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP: For the NIH, Republicans have outspent Clinton for several  
years as part of their goal to double its funding by 2003, and the 
GOP is expected to pass a much larger increase again this year. The 
FDA has never fared as well, as Republicans oppose its attempts to 
regulate tobacco. However, some Republican leaders have signaled 
support for some increased funds to speed up new products. 
</P>
<P>
	LAST YEAR: Congress passed a 14 percent increase, giving the NIH  
$15.6 billion to spend in 1999. That was above Clinton's request 
for a 9 percent increase. Congress left the FDA's budget flat after 
rejecting attempts to impose user fees on the food and medical 
devices industries, and approved small increases for the CDC. 

</P>
<P>
                            *EDUCATION   	
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Education spending would be $31.8 billion in 2000,  
increasing last year's estimated $28.6 billion. The increases would 
go to about $34.9 billion in 2001, continuing along those lines 
through 2004. Clinton called for $1.4 billion for the second year 
of funding for the so-called 100,000 new teachers initiative and 
for $22 billion in bonds for school construction and modernization. 
The White House lost a similar construction plan last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The president proposes tripling an after-school and summer  
program aimed at ending social promotion and boosting teacher 
training. But he also proposes budget cuts to a program negotiated 
in last year's renewal of the higher education laws. He sparred 
with Republicans over subsidizing private banks' lending to 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP: Republicans say they're disappointed that the president did  
not fund local education blocks grants designed to give states and 
district local flexibility and did not increase special education 
funding significantly. The GOP is looking at its own school 
construction proposals and wants to see results before doling out 
another round of funds for new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	LAST YEAR: Congress approved a $33.11 billion plan for education 	
programs, a 12.6 percent increase in which favored projects won 
big. Charter schools got a hefty 25 percent boost to $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
                             *TOBACCO 	
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: The government would raise $8 billion by imposing a new  
55-cent-a-pack cigarette tax and by tacking on a 5-cent tax that 
wasn't supposed to kick in until 2002. Even without new 
legislation, the 24-cent cigarette tax is set to jump by 10 cents 
per pack next year. Under Clinton's plan, the tax would rise to 94 
cents per pack in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Over five years, these new tobacco taxes would raise an  
additional $34.5 billion -- a substantial chunk of the total $82 
billion in new taxes and fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning in 2001, Clinton also counts on $18.9 billion over  
four years by recouping money gained by the states under 
settlements with tobacco companies. Many of these state lawsuits 
sought reimbursement for the costs of treating sick smokers in 
Medicaid. Because the federal government pays 57 percent of 
Medicaid, the Clinton budget assumes that the federal government 
will be able to recoup its share of the settlement money. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP: Republicans oppose all new taxes, including cigarette  
taxes. As for recouping of state tobacco money, Republicans and 
Democrats in Congress are backing legislation to bar the federal 
government from seizing these dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	LAST YEAR: Clinton proposed new cigarette taxes as part of his  
comprehensive tobacco legislation, which died in Congress. 

</P>
<P>
                           *AGRICULTURE   	
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: The Agriculture Department would get $55.2 billion in  
2000 to fund a range of programs from food stamps to food aid and 
rural water programs. One major omission from the budget, however, 
is money to reform crop insurance for farmers. Both Republicans and 
Democrats have expressed interest in revamping the program this 
year so that farmers are more protected and not as reliant on 
emergency aid programs, like the $7 billion deal passed last year 
to help farmers. Clinton talked of revamping the program in his 
State of the Union address but in the end was unable to find the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has also proposed $72 million, or a 24 percent increase,  
to boost food safety efforts within the USDA and Food and Drug 
Administration, including money for increased inspections and 
better research. Nearly $22 billion would fund the food stamp 
program, a $300,000 increase over the current level. The 
administration has proposed restoring food stamp eligibility to 
15,000 legal immigrants who entered the United States before Aug. 
22, 1996, and have reached the age of 65. A pilot project that 
would provide school breakfasts to all children regardless of 
income is funded with $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP: Republican leaders are mostly unhappy with Clinton's lack  
of a plan to reform crop insurance. They are also likely to be 
fiercely opposed to a proposal that would require meat and poultry 
companies to pay ``user fees'' for government inspection services. 
That plan has been rejected six years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	LAST YEAR: The current year's budget is actually about $8.2 	
billion higher than Clinton's 2000 proposal, mainly because of 
large aid packages last year for U.S. farmers and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
                     *MEDICARE AND LONG-TERM CARE 	
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: The president wants 15 percent of government surpluses  
expected over the next 15 years -- a projected $686 billion -- to 
bolster Medicare. With that cash infusion, the health insurance 
program for the elderly and disabled, now expected to run short of 
money in 2008, could hold on until 2020. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also wants to further curb Medicare payments to  
hospitals and other health care providers and spend $4 million more 
in 2000 to fight fraud. But the program's yearly costs are still 
expected to rise by more than $60 billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Clinton is proposing a new $1000-a-year tax credit  
to help families pay for long-term care for elderly or disabled 
relatives -- something not covered by Medicare. The administration 
estimates 2 million Americans would benefit, at a cost to the 
government of $5.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has also reintroduced a proposal to let some people as  
young as age 55 buy Medicare coverage from the government, saying 
it would help about 300,000 older Americans now lacking adequate 
health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP: Republicans leaders, who want some of the budget surplus  
for income tax cuts, have not said whether their plans would leave 
money for Medicare. Before making any decisions about the program, 
they say they will await recommendations from a bipartisan advisory 
commission due to report March 1. Most GOP lawmakers don't like the 
idea of opening the already overburdened Medicare program up to 
younger Americans. But many support tax credits for long-term care 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	LAST YEAR: After trimming billions from Medicare payments in  
1997, lawmakers were besieged by complaints from health care 
providers who say they're stretched too thin. Congress mostly stood 
its ground, but further spending curbs proposed by Clinton this 
year are sure to be controversial. 

</P>
<P>
                   *ENVIRONMENT &AMP; NATURAL RESOURCES   	
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: The administration wants increases for most  
environmental programs, especially a series of new initiatives to 
protect America's natural heritage lands, combat urban sprawl by 
preserving open space, and ``common sense'' programs to address 
climate change. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget proposed a $1 billion ``land legacy initiative'' that  
includes $900 million, about half funneled through states, to buy 
land so it can't be developed. 
</P>
<P>
	To help cities combat sprawl, the budget proposes new ``Better  
America Bonds'' -- financed by $700 million in federal tax credits -- 
to be used by communities to set aside ``green spaces'' and promote 
better urban planning. It's part of a $1.2 billion ``livability'' 
initiative aimed at preserving open space while reducing traffic 
congestion and air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget calls for a $730 million increase in spending on  
research to address addresses global warming, including sharp 
increases in energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. In 
addition, the administration proposes a $200 million ``clean air 
partnership fund'' for early investment in climate change programs. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would calls for earmarking $100 million Pacific salmon  
recovery program; a 40 percent boost, to $181 million, for the 
Endangered Species Act; and $312 million, a 35 percent increase, in 
spending on the Florida Everglades. Spending by the Environmental 
Protection Agency would total $7.4 billion, a 7 percent boost over 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP: Congress rejected many of the same climate initiative last  
year, accusing the administration of trying to implement the Kyoto 
climate treaty without Senate ratification. The $200 million 
``clean air fund'' will be viewed by some Republicans as trying to 
impose the climate agreement. While much of the proposed $900 
million in spending for new land purchases may get a warm welcome 
in Congress, there likely will be arguments over where the money 
should be spend. Some Republicans favor using the money to improve 
existing parks, not to buy new land. 
</P>
<P>
	LAST YEAR: The administration won more money for energy  
efficiency programs and as part of a last-minute budget agreement 
and got an additional $200 million for climate change technology. 
Federal land purchases for conservation were about $320 million, a 
third of what the administration is proposing for fiscal 2000. Last 
year, after declining budgets, the EPA's funding was increased by 
$300 million to $6.9 billion. 

</P>
<P>
                        *TELECOMMUNICATIONS   	
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Commercial TV stations -- for the first time -- would be  
required to pay a fee on their existing analog TV channels that 
would raise at least $200 million annually under legislation being 
proposed in the budget. Proceeds from the so-called lease fee would 
help federal, state and local governments upgrade communications 
systems used by fire, police, emergency rescue and other public 
safety agencies. Broadcasters in the past have managed to kill 
legislative efforts to impose any new fees on stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters have been given a second TV channel to convert to  
higher-quality digital television. When the switch is complete in 
2006, broadcasters are required to return their analog channels 
back to the government. When a broadcaster does that, it will no 
longer be required to pay the fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the administration proposed giving the Federal  
Communications Commission around $230 million for fiscal year 2000. 
The agency's current budget is $192 million. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP: Republicans in Congress, with a few exceptions, have  
opposed imposing new fees on broadcasters. On the bankruptcy issue, 
Republicans generally oppose such a measure. Republicans for the 
most part oppose increasing the FCC's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	LAST YEAR: The administration and the FCC did get a bankruptcy  
provision into a massive year-end spending bill, but the language 
was taken out. 

</P>
<P>
                         *VETERANS AFFAIRS   	
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: The Department of Veterans Affairs would get $44  
billion in spending in 2000, a $200 million increase in a 
hold-the-line budget that's essentially been frozen since 1997's 
budget-balancing plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget includes $18.1 billion for medical care, including a  
fresh $50 million to help homeless veterans, $250 million to combat 
hepatitis C, $106 million for long-term care programs for 
American's aging veteran's population of 26 million and $56 million 
to pay for a nationwide smoking cessation program for veterans who 
began smoking while in the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposed legislation also would authorize the VA to cover the  
cost of veterans seeking emergency care outside of VA hospitals and 
clinics because there's no local VA facility, but at no extra 
overall cost. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP: Republicans believe the administration's budget is based on  
faulty assumptions, including that the VA administration will be 
able to shave $1.1 billion in costs through management 
efficiencies. Critics also question the VA's ability to collect up 
to $750 million from insurance and co-payment programs to off set 
veterans' medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
	LAST YEAR: Congress approved more than $43 billion.

<HEADLINE> Depositions Begin With Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors are questioning Monica  
Lewinsky under oath as they enter the final phase of their attempt 
to turn the tide and prove that President Clinton should be removed 
from office. 
</P>
<P>
	With that attempt likely to fail, the senators sitting in  
judgment of the president were scrambling for a way they themselves 
will be judged kindly by history after they acquit Clinton of 
articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors and White House lawyers each had four hours  
today to question Ms. Lewinsky about her affair with Clinton and 
charges that he committed perjury and obstructed justice in trying 
to conceal their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	The deposition of the former White House intern was taking place  
at Washington's Mayflower Hotel, presided over by one Democratic 
and one Republican senator and videotaped for viewing by other 
senators. 
</P>
<P>
	The process will be repeated Tuesday when Clinton's close friend  
Vernon Jordan, who helped Ms. Lewinsky find a job, will be deposed; 
and on Wednesday, when White House aide Sidney Blumenthal will be 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want anybody to think there's some big bombshell out  
there,'' Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., one of the 13 House trial 
managers, said of his expectations from the Lewinsky testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	McCollum, interviewed on ``Fox News Sunday,'' said the  
prosecutors hoped to nail down ``beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
president committed a crime'' by trying to get Ms. Lewinsky to 
conceal gifts he had given her. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers argue that Ms. Lewinsky has testified under  
oath to a grand jury, FBI agents and Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr's investigators more than 20 times and has said consistently 
that she was never told to lie or offered a job to cover up the 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring some startling new revelation from the depositions,  
Senate Republicans and Democrats have agreed that the final vote in 
the trial should come Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a two-thirds majority of 67 to convict the president  
and remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she did not know if either the  
perjury or obstruction of justice charge against Clinton would get 
even a simple majority vote. She said many senators felt the 
perjury allegation is particularly weak. 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, Collins, a moderate, is leading an effort to  
approve a ``finding of fact'' that would put the Senate on record 
as saying that Clinton, while not committing offenses that should 
lead to his removal, lied under oath. This ``increases the 
accountability of our decisions to our constituents and to future 
generations,'' she said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It does not find him guilty, it finds some facts,'' Sen. Pete  
Domenici, R-N.M., another leading proponent of the idea, said on 
ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But senators from both parties expressed concern about the  
Senate overstepping its constitutional bounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a mistake and without authority for the Senate to  
act to find the president guilty of criminal conduct. Our role is 
to remove him from office, if he's guilty as charged by the 
House,'' Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said on CBS' ``Face the 
Nation.'' Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told NBC: ``This finding of 
fact is impeachment lite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, was floating a plan to end the trial  
after a vote to condemn the president for wrongdoing. But there 
also was strong support for concluding the trial with an up-or-down 
vote on conviction and then moving to a censure resolution . 
</P>
<P>
	After the trial, there should be a ``strong message that though  
he may not be removed from office that we want history to record 
that there was agreement about the wrongness of some of the 
actions,'' Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., said on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is to resume Thursday, after senators have had a  
chance to review the three depositions. Only then will they decide 
whether any of those witnesses will be called for live testimony in 
the Senate chamber. Democrats are adamantly opposed to that, and 
some Republicans also have said that shouldn't be necessary unless 
new information comes out of the depositions that could change the 
course of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	A trial manager, Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., told NBC he hoped  
that would occur, and that the prosecutors could expand the witness 
list to include Clinton secretary Betty Currie, who was left off 
the previous list when senators balked at having more than three 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Several senators bristled at a New York Times report that Starr  
has concluded he has the legal authority to indict Clinton for 
perjury and obstruction of justice while the president is still in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that the timing was extremely unfortunate and that  
it was inappropriate to come out while the Senate is concluding the 
president's trial,'' Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly today denied Starr's office was  
the source of the story. ``We have no interest in interposing 
ourselves in the Senate's business,'' he said on ABC's ``Good 
Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the same program, former appellate Judge Robert Bork, a Starr  
adviser, said he does not believe a president can be indicted 
``because the president is the one officer of government whose 
disability would incapacitate an entire branch. I don't think the 
founders intended a 12-man jury could replace an entire House, 
Senate and chief justice and the elaborate mechanism set up for 
impeachment.''

<HEADLINE>  Shanahan Shows Mettle in TD Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The play that broke the Atlanta Falcons wasn't even  
part of Denver's Super Bowl package. In fact, it hadn't been in the 
Broncos' game plan for nearly two months. 
</P>
<P>
	But the thinking leading up to John Elway's 80-yard touchdown  
pass to Rod Smith captures the essence of coach Mike Shanahan's 
offensive acumen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a run off the same formation,'' Shanahan said after the  
Broncos' 34-19 romp sealed their second consecutive title Sunday 
night. ``We saw Rod getting past the safety, so we went to the pass 
call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The TD, one play after Morten Andersen missed a 26-yard field  
goal, gave Denver a 17-3 lead with 4:54 left in the first half and 
forced Atlanta out of its game plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't run that play in six or seven weeks,'' Shanahan  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Walsh was dubbed ``The Genius'' while winning three Super  
Bowls with San Francisco in the 1980s. Shanahan is known as ``The 
Mastermind.'' Now Shanahan is approaching some territory Walsh and 
few others occupy. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan already is one of just five coaches to win back-to-back  
Super Bowls, and the first from the AFC since Pittsburgh's Chuck 
Noll won in 1979 and 1980. One more, and he'll join Walsh, Noll and 
Washington's Joe Gibbs as the only ones to win as many as three. 
</P>
<P>
	And if Shanahan can make it three in a row -- well, that's  
uncharted territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're always week-to-week in this profession,'' he said.  
``I'm just going to enjoy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos owner Pat Bowlen isn't shy in calling this year the  
``greatest season in Bronco history,'' pointing to Denver's 17-2 
record and Super Bowl win. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan, though, wasn't ready to start comparing titles.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm kind of numb right now,'' he said. ``To be with the  
players all year -- have the type of offseason we had, go through 
some adversity, then play at the level we did in the playoffs -- 
it's incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After winning last year's crown in San Diego, the Broncos hadn't  
even showered before Shanahan challenged them to come back ready to 
defend their title. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos not only progressed virtually unscathed, they came  
back even better. They won their first 13 games, lost two, then won 
the final four to lift the trophy once again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we better? I really don't know,'' Shanahan said. ``It's so  
hard to judge. Over the past two years, everybody believed. The 
more pressure we had on this football team, the more they stepped 
up. That's what wins championships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not even the potential of an ugly family feud could distract the  
Broncos this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta coach Dan Reeves, who spent 12 years coaching the  
Broncos, let slip two weeks ago that his wounds haven't healed 
completely from his firing in Denver in 1992. One of the 
protagonists, he said, was Shanahan. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves said Shanahan and quarterback John Elway conspired to run  
their own game plan and blamed Shanahan for not telling him about 
Elway's unhappiness with the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan reacted with dismay at first, then calmed back down and  
said he would take the high road. The issue died quickly in Miami, 
and the two exchanged a very brief handshake after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just said, `Congratulations.' I said the same thing to  
him,'' Shanahan said.

<HEADLINE> Wards To Emerge From Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Struggling retailer Montgomery Ward &AMP; Co. Inc.  
should be able to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings by midyear 
according to an agreement it has made with its creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan announced Monday, GE Capital, a major creditor,  
will acquire Wards' profitable direct marketing arm, The Signature 
Group. Wards will then place a yet-to-be-determined sum into a fund 
to settle court-approved claims by creditors other than GE Capital. 
Those creditors will end up with a stake in Wards in exchange for 
their claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Wards has been operating with court protection from creditors  
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since last July. That 
section of the bankruptcy law allows for a company to continue 
operations and attempt to reorganize its finances under court 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	The 127-year-old privately owned retailer announced Jan. 15 it  
would close 39 stores and cut about 4,000 jobs as part of a 
restructuring plan aimed at boosting profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs represent about 9 percent of the company's work  
force of 45,000. Wards will have 252 stores after the closings. 
</P>
<P>
	Wards has struggled in recent years from competition with chains  
such as Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart that attract consumers with 
their wide range of merchandise at affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, the company began revamping the inside of its stores  
to make it easier for shoppers to move from department to 
department.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Taking Hit in Polls Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are taking a hit in the polls by  
pursuing the impeachment of a popular president, but a lot could 
happen to change the numbers before the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	President Bush's poll numbers were soaring just after the  
Persian Gulf War, recalled William Kristol, who was Vice President 
Quayle's chief of staff and is now editor of the conservative 
Weekly Standard magazine. But the public's enthusiasm for Bush 
faded by the 1992 elections and few remembered which Democrats 
voted against the war with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't deny that the American people don't want President  
Clinton removed and most Republicans will vote to remove him,'' 
Kristol said. ``But if there were real anger and animosity at the 
Republican Party, wouldn't they be doing worse in the presidential 
polls?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, considered a potential Republican  
presidential candidate, has led Vice President Al Gore in most 
early head-to-head polling. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic strategists are crowing about current polls that show  
almost six out of 10 people disapprove of how Senate Republicans 
are handling the impeachment trial. Two-thirds of the public 
approves of the way Clinton is doing his job, according to several 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps more troubling for Republicans is that some polls show  
Democrats are getting better marks on handling top issues. A Pew 
poll of 1,200 taken in mid January gave Democrats a marked 
advantage on who has the best ideas on everything from education to 
HMO reform to Social Security. Democrats had a strong edge in the 
traditionally strong Republican area of tax cuts for the middle 
class and a narrow edge on the global economy. Republicans had the 
edge on handling the issue of morality, the poll showed. 
</P>
<P>
	While the president has been talking about ``kitchen table''  
issues like education, health care and Social Security in the State 
of the Union address and intermittent news conferences, Republican 
leaders are having to answer TV interviewers' questions about the 
ongoing impeachment drama. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican spokesman Mike Collins says Republicans are moving  
ahead on other issues, even if the media is focusing only on the 
impeachment efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agenda is moving forward even as the trial goes forward,''  
Collins said, citing a GOP push for a 10 percent tax cut and the 
party's plans to safeguard Social Security, improve the nation's 
schools and shore up national defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart Roy, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial  
Committee, said it was impossible to know if the impeachment trial 
will have an impact on the 2000 elections. He doubted that 
Republicans who voted their conscience would be penalized. But Rep. 
Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and one of the House 
impeachment managers, warned in a letter to donors: ``As visibility 
increases for many Republicans due to the impeachment process, the 
likelihood for opposition in the next election increases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham was unopposed in 1998.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans definitely have their work cut out for them after  
the impeachment trial, said Thomas Mann, director of governmental 
studies at the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have taken a tremendous hit,'' Mann said. ``A substantial  
amount of the public thinks less well of them than since the 
scandal hit. That includes independent voters and even some 
Republican voters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, added that Republicans'  
``hatred for Bill Clinton is stronger than their instinct for 
survival.''

        Civilian employment in the executive branch under President

	WHEELING, W.Va. (AP) -- A 32-year-old man pleaded guilty Monday  
to having sex with a 14-year-old girl he met in an Internet chat 
room.

<P>
	Scott Russell of Rockville, Md., pleaded guilty to four  
misdemeanor sex charges. He faces up to a year in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the girl and Russell met online, and she went  
with him willingly to a Wheeling motel in August. Her parents

<HEADLINE> Archaeologists Dig at Miami Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A developer agreed to give archaeologists another  
month to complete their excavation of a downtown site they believe 
contains prehistoric ruins. 
</P>
<P>
	In an agreement reached Sunday, Michael Baumann promised to  
allow archaeologists to continue their excavation without 
interference through Feb. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	With the reprieve, Baumann averted the possibility of a legal  
fight that could have delayed construction of a $100 million 
residential-commercial complex. 
</P>
<P>
	During a routine survey of the 2.2-acre site last summer,  
archaeologists discovered a circle made up of dozens of holes 
carved into stone. The spot is believed to have been a settlement 
of the Tequesta Indians, a group that disappeared hundreds of years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The circle, which is 38 feet in diameter, consists of stone  
carvings and post holes. Some of the formations resemble the shapes 
of sea animals. Some of the archaeologists familiar with the circle 
speculate the structure could have been used to measure time or 
keep track of the seasons, like Stonehenge. 
</P>
<P>
	A parking garage planned for the development would be built on  
top of the archaeological dig. 
</P>
<P>
	Baumann received a city permit Thursday to begin laying the  
foundation for his project and had told archaeologists to leave by 
today. City officials said they had no legal means to block or 
delay construction. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the agreement Sunday, the archaeologists will be  
allowed to remain on the site until the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've bought some time,'' said Becky Roper Matkov, executive  
director of Dade Heritage Trust, which is fighting to preserve the 
ruins. ``I hope we can apply political pressure'' to force the city 
to take a stronger hand to try to save the site, she said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 23 in Early Trading / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened higher. The Dow Jones  
industrial average is ahead 23 points in today's early going. 
Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange hold a 6-5 lead over 
decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 17 points and the S&AMP;P 500 Index  
is up a point. 
</P>
<P>
	With January now in the books, the Dow managed a small,  
two-percent increase for the month. 
</P>
<P>
	The S&AMP;P 500 was up four percent.  
</P>
<P>
	And if you're a believer in Wall Street lore, the market should  
be headed higher now for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a phenomenon known as the January effect -- if stocks rise  
in the first month of the year, they tend to advance for the full 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, it remains to be seen whether the theory holds true  
in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	But the outlook is fairly positive today.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas stocks are higher, with merger news helping fuel the  
gains in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices are lower, on news of strong increases in both  
personal income and spending in December.

<HEADLINE>  Super Bowl Celebration Turns Violent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Police marched in riot gear and tossed tear gas at  
fans who celebrated the Broncos' Super Bowl victory by turning over 
cars and benches, lighting bonfires and breaking windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like following the path of a tornado,'' said Andrew  
Hudson, a spokesman for Mayor Wellington Webb. ``It was just a 
really ugly scene by a lot of obnoxious people who were drunk ... 
we are lucky no one got killed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were 20 arrests in Denver and damage was estimated at  
$160,000, Hudson said. He added that windows at historic Brown 
Palace were broken and trash Dumpsters were set on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also reported problems with revelers in other cities  
statewide. In some instances, youngsters wore surgical masks, gas 
masks and bandanas to ward off tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
	It was far quieter today, with fans milling around Civic Center  
Park awaiting the arrival of the team. The Broncos arrived at 
Denver International Airport just after noon, two hours before 
their victory parade and rally. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday night, bars in downtown Denver emptied after the game  
and fans started bonfires and set off firecrackers. When the 
estimated crowd of 1,000 would not disperse in Larimer Square, 
police threw tear gas canisters at taunting youths and pounded 
their shields with clubs. Some youths threw bottles at the 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans scurried away in the smoke, some collapsing on the street.  
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't give us any time,'' said John Giomin of Denver.  
``This really hurts. I've never been gassed before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police had predicted problems from rowdy fans, based on trouble  
that erupted in 1998, when the Broncos won their first Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, they blocked access to downtown and banned parking  
along some streets. 
</P>
<P>
	In Greeley, police also used tear gas to break up a crowd,  
calling the revelry much worse than a year ago. Near the University 
of Northern Colorado, fans pelted police officers with rocks and 
bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	In Boulder, several hundred fans danced and cheered around a  
small bonfire. 
</P>
<P>
	Fort Collins police used tear gas to break up a crowd in the old  
town area. Some fans threw rocks and bottles at officers, while 
others climbed light poles. 
</P>
<P>
	In Grand Junction, authorities used fire hoses, pepper spray and  
dogs to control several hundred fans along a main street. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing to see some of that, that we can't  
celebrate without taking it to the extreme,'' said Webb. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bill Owens said: ``Colorado has so much to be proud of  
tonight ... it would be a shame to mar it with any more violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In several spots downtown, officers on horseback kept crowds in  
check. Around downtown, people waved special newspaper editions, 
climbed poles and waved Bronco pennants. 
</P>
<P>
	Downtown bars were havens of orange and blue. After the 34-19  
victory over the Atlanta Falcons, many fans took their drinks and 
celebrations outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year about 30,000 people gathered downtown after the  
Broncos beat Green in the Super Bowl. There were more than 25 
arrests and 50 people were overcome by tear gas after vandals 
smashed shop windows, overturned cars and set fires in Larimer 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most law-abiding people found the people that were doing that  
pretty disgusting,'' Hudson said of the latest disturbances. ``It's 
idiotic. It's that kind of behavior that is going to get people 
hurt and get people arrested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday night, police say they warned the crowd before tossing  
tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Sherwood, 29, who moved to Denver two years ago from  
Burlington, Iowa, said he and his friends were caught off guard by 
the police response. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came down right after the game,'' he said. ``I walked up  
next to a policeman. He said, `Do you think you are safe?' Then 
they tear-gassed us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Latit McKnight, of Denver, called the police actions  
``unnecessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People have to celebrate,'' he said. ``This was (quarterback  
John) Elway's last game!''

<HEADLINE> Barclays Announces Retail Restructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Shares in Barclays PLC rose Monday after the bank  
said it will restructure its retail banking unit, shedding hundreds 
of jobs and rebranding itself with a new advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Barclays will reduce the number of divisions in its retail  
business to two from around 20. The bank, which employs 60,000 
staff worldwide, didn't specify how many jobs it will eliminate, 
but said people will be laid off over the course of 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Barclays rose 4 percent following the announcement.  
</P>
<P>
	There was speculation the shakeup could coincide with the  
appointment of a new chief executive to replace Martin Taylor, who 
resigned unexpectedly last November amid falling profits and 
criticism of the performance of the bank's investment arm, Barclays 
Capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts believe Barclays could fall prey to a takeover  
bid, or launch a bid of its own to position itself in the rapidly 
consolidating European banking market.

<HEADLINE> Manufacturing Declines in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Manufacturing activity continued to decline in  
January, but at a slower rate than in the last seven months, as 
global economic turmoil failed to crimp production and new orders. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management reported today  
its monthly index of business activity rose to 49.5 percent last 
month from 45.3 in December -- its lowest level since May 1991. The 
increase was bigger than economists had forecast, but any reading 
under 50 percent is a sign of contraction in the industrial sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``The manufacturing sector continued to contract in January,  
however, there are signs of encouragement as we finish up the 
eighth consecutive month of decline,'' said Norbert J. Ore, 
chairman of the organization's survey panel. ``Both production and 
new orders rose markedly possibly signaling that the manufacturing 
sector has bottomed out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While industrial activity has yet to snap its decline, the group  
said the overall economy continued to grow for a 93rd straight 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The private group's report is compiled from a survey of  
corporate purchasing executives nationwide. It is widely followed 
by economists because it is usually the first indicator of how the 
economy performed in the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the encouraging signs drawn from the report, analysts  
said that the economy still remains sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like manufacturing perked up a little bit in January,  
but the improvement in activity isn't broad based,'' said Dan Seto, 
an economist at Nikko Securities International Co. ``The 
manufacturing environment remains highly competitive and there are 
still indications of more downward pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the highlights of the report:  
</P>
<P>
	--Prices continued to fall in December, but the decline wasn't as  
steep as in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	--Manufacturing employment dropped at a slower rate last month.  
</P>
<P>
	--Exports continued to decline in December, although at a slower  
pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 20 industries in the manufacturing sector, six reported  
improved business conditions in January. Those with improvements 
were wood and wood products; chemicals; electronic components and 
equipment; transportation; metals and food. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overall picture as we begin 1999 is one of slower decline  
in manufacturing activity,'' Ore said.

<HEADLINE> Baker Hughes To Cut More Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Baker Hughes Inc., which slashed more than 4,000  
jobs last year, says it will lay off another 2,450 employees by the 
end of the first quarter in order to cut costs in the face of 
depressed energy prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The news came as the Houston-based oil services company  
announced Monday its fourth-quarter earnings had plunged to $6.1 
million, down from $114 million in the fourth quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baker Hughes continues to be impacted by the ongoing reduction  
in spending by our customers,'' said Max Lukens, the company's 
president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker Hughes had reduced its work force to 32,250 people by the  
end of 1998, from a peak of 36,500 employees in the second quarter 
of last year. The number of employees will be further reduced to 
29,800 by March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	With oil prices at their lowest point in more than a decade, oil  
service and oilfield equipment companies have been forced to cut 
back as drilling activity slows. The U.S. rig count, announced 
weekly by Baker Hughes, fell to an all-time low of 562 last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker Hughes' businesses include seismic imaging of fields,  
evaluation of underground formations, steerable drilling, oilfield 
and refining chemicals, drill bits, and other tools and services. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's fourth-quarter earnings included numerous special  
charges, including $23 million in severance expenses and $17 
million in costs related to Baker's merger last year with Western 
Atlas Inc.

<HEADLINE> U. of Iowa Upset by Nude Male Dance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- The absolute basics aren't always welcome  
at the University of Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials are trying to decide what to do about a male  
strip show that involved full frontal nudity in front of several 
hundred women in the student union. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have policies regarding nudity and material that is  
explicit,'' Ann Rhodes, vice president of university relations, 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Other campus performances have involved nudity, but Rhodes said  
those have been artistic performances ``where we try and make sure 
that the work as a whole is being evaluated, that nudity is not the 
focus of the event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The event Saturday at the Iowa Memorial Union was billed  
``Ladies Nite: African-American All-Male Revue Dance Show,'' and 
was sponsored by the Black Entrepreneurial Association. It featured 
five dancers from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came out in clothes and went down to G-strings,'' said  
freshman Felicia Penza. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, she said, they went one step further.  
</P>
<P>
	Organizer Derick Mitchell said he had tried to keep the dancers  
from going too far, ``but once they did it, what can you do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes said she'd never heard of the Black Entrepreneurial  
Association and didn't know whether it was recognized by the 
university, but said it and any student members might face 
sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Crash Kills Members of Tejano Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZAPATA, Texas (AP) -- A station wagon carrying the Tejano group  
Intocable skidded off a highway and crashed in Mexico, killing two 
performers and the group's road manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Six group members were injured in the accident late Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Fans and friends of the group, which hailed from the small south  
Texas town of Zapata, were still numb Monday from the news. 
Intocable had four platinum albums and popularized their Norteno 
style. 
</P>
<P>
	``We claimed them as part of our community,'' said Amy Salinas,  
secretary for Zapata County Sheriff Sigifredo Gonzalez. ``We're 
deeply hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Killed instantly in the crash were Jose Angel ``Pepe'' Farias,  
23, the band's on-stage master of ceremonies and a percussionist; 
and Silvestre Rodriguez Jr., 28, who played bass and sang. 
</P>
<P>
	Road manager Jose Angel Gonzalez died in an ambulance on the way  
to hospital, said Jesus Garcia Flores, regional commander of the 
Federal Highway Police. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to be missed terribly,'' said Frank Zuniga, a  
Corpus Christi-based producer and agent. ``These guys were packing 
it in wherever they went.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crash happened on a stretch of highway between the border  
city of Reynosa and Monterrey, the capital of the northern Nuevo 
Leon state. Their vehicle was speeding at the time of the crash, 
halfway between the towns of Los Ramones and General Bravo, Garcia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Intocable joined the Tejano music scene in 1994 and quickly rose  
to the forefront with a combination of emotive vocals, creative 
arrangements and a basic accordion style that helped fuel Tejano 
music's current Norteno craze. 
</P>
<P>
	The band has produced a record a year since 1994 -- ``Fuego  
Eterno,'' ``Otro Mundo,'' ``Llevame Contigo'' and ``Intocable IV'' 
-- and each has sold more than a million albums. The played before 
enthusiastic crowds throughout Mexico and the border region, 
including Las Vegas and California.

<HEADLINE> Pitt Has Tough Flight to Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The University of Pittsburgh men's basketball  
team had a rough Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It began with coach Ralph Willard resigning, effective at the  
end of the season. Later, the Panthers' flight to Washington was 
delayed when a man on board claimed to be a terrorist. 
</P>
<P>
	Police evacuated the US Airways plane bound for Reagan National  
Airport and arrested the man. No bomb turned up in a search of the 
plane or the luggage. 
</P>
<P>
	John Amoroso, 43, of Schenectady, N.Y., was charged with  
disorderly conduct and making terroristic threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the incident was reported at about 6 p.m. and the  
plane was returned to service shortly before 8 p.m. There were 53 
passengers on board. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers were headed to Washington for Tuesday's game  
against Georgetown. 
</P>

	Pitt (11-9) moved into the Top 25 early in the season after

<HEADLINE> Pepsi's Profit Falls 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- PepsiCo Inc.'s earnings fell 10 percent in the  
fourth quarter as operating profits tumbled in its worldwide soft 
drink business while its snack food operations managed a small 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had signaled what its results would be last week so  
the figures released after the stock market closed Monday were in 
line with Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo earned $361 million, or 24  
cents a share, in the three months ended Dec. 26 compared with $401 
million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the quarter rose 15 percent to $7.19 billion from  
$6.26 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide soft drink operating profits sank 33 percent due to a  
difficult pricing environment around the world, higher advertising 
and marketing expenses and a loss in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits in North America fell 27 percent despite a 10 percent  
increase in case sales and a 5 percent rise in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive Roger Enrico said ``we reignited  
volume momentum in Pepsi-Cola'' led by its new Pepsi One sugarless 
brand and growth in Mountain Dew and its Aquafina bottled water. 
</P>
<P>
	But the international soft drink business' operating loss  
widened to $279 million for the quarter from $19 million a year 
earlier. Sales revenue sank 12 percent due to the absence of a 
Japanese bottler sold in late 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Frito-Lay snack food division, worldwide profits edged up  
1 percent as North American profits rose 3 percent while 
international profits dropped 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tropicana division acquired last year earned $40 million on  
sales of $722 million for the period. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest results reflected a 19 cents per share gain from a  
tax case settlement. That was offset by charges of 17 cents a share 
for restructuring soft drink operations in Russia and Frito-Lay 
operations in North America and the costs of preparing to separate 
its bottling and concentrate operations in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, PepsiCo earnings fell to $1.99 billion, or $1.31 a  
share, from $2.14 billion, or $1.36 a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 7 percent for the year to $22.35 billion from  
$20.92 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, PepsiCo fell 87 1/2  
cents a share to $38.12 1/2 in advance of the earnings report.

<HEADLINE> IOC Panel Proposes Bans for Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- An IOC panel proposed Monday that  
athletes face life bans and fines of up to $1 million in serious 
cases of ``intentional doping.'' It also suggested selective bans 
for some first-time offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	But the plan ran into immediate opposition from FIFA, the world  
soccer federation, which called the proposal ``an honorable 
attempt'' that was ``bound to fail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a couple of stupidities in there,'' said Dr. Michel  
D'Hooghe, the head of FIFA's medical committee and a key player at 
the three-day drug summit opening Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA, the international swimming federation, also cast doubt on  
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not necessary that all federations use the same points''  
of a global doping policy, FINA secretary Gunnar Werner said. 
``Some may use some points, some may use all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The text, prepared by IOC vice president Keba Mbaye of Senegal,  
was an attempt to get all Olympic sports federations and national 
governments in line after years of disagreements over doping 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal calls for the stiffest penalties in cases of  
intentional doping, use of masking agents, tampering with samples 
and refusal to undergo tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletes found guilty of those offenses when they involve  
steroids or other major drugs would face fines of up to $1 million 
and a life ban. The same would apply in the case of a repeat 
offense involving stimulants. 
</P>
<P>
	A first intentional abuse of stimulants would result in a two-  
to eight-year ban, a ban on competing in most major events and a 
fine of up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC, already facing mounting pressure from a bribery  
scandal, hopes a new drug policy will lift the gloom over the 
Olympic movement. 
</P>
<P>
	But even before the conference started, disagreements were rife  
and another clash between the IOC and FIFA seemed inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	To try to find a compromise, Olympic drug chief Prince Alexandre  
de Merode had toned down the IOC's position that federations 
refusing to adopt a mandatory minimum two-year suspension for major 
drug abusers would face removal from the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA has always opposed such a policy, claiming it would never  
hold up in court. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC working group's proposal says the two-year sanction  
``may be reduced in certain circumstances.'' De Merode said this 
would open the way for an honorable compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so, said FIFA.  
</P>
<P>
	``We won't fall for that,'' D'Hooghe said.  
</P>
<P>
	The six-page proposal also remained unacceptable to FIFA on  
several other points. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Hooghe said FIFA would not accept a part of the plan that  
would kick a team out of a competition if one of its members was 
disqualified for doping. He said that, in that case, Argentina 
would have been thrown out of the 1994 World Cup after Diego 
Maradona tested positive for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Hooghe also objected to the IOC's proposed definition of  
doping, arguing it only covered health risks and did not address 
moral issues and the integrity of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	And he said million-dollar fines would be unworkable.  
</P>
<P>
	``Why not make it $100 million. It is utopia,'' he said, arguing  
no court would uphold such fines. 
</P>
<P>
	For FINA, the major flaw of the proposal remained placing the  
burden of proof on the sports federations instead of the athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The federation will have to prove everything,'' Werner said.

<HEADLINE> NASA Planning Plane Bound for Mars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To mark the 100th anniversary of the Wright  
Brothers first airplane flight NASA wants to duplicate the event -- 
sort of -- on Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASA budget for 2000 contains $50 million to begin  
development of a Mars airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	An animated video played at the budget briefing showed a small,  
pilotless plane parachuting toward the sandy surface, unfolding its 
wings and propeller, and puttering off. 
</P>
<P>
	In actuality, a lot about the plane remains to be determined,  
including actual design and means of propulsion and delivery to 
Mars, NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flying in Mars' atmosphere is like flying at 100,000 to 130,000  
feet altitude above Earth, he said, so much research needs to be 
done. A long-range jetliner flies at about 30,000 feet altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also an eight-minute time lag for radio messages  
between Earth and Mars, complicating the control of the plane, 
which would be unmanned. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal, is all goes well, is to make the flight in 2003, the  
100th anniversary of the Wright Brothers flight, though NASA's 
briefing papers admitted it could slip to 2005.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Plunge on Strong Economy / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices plunged Monday after an economic  
report showed that the U.S. manufacturing sector rebounded in 
January, raising concerns that the recent series of interest rate 
cuts may be over. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped 1 9/16  
point, or $15.63 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, rose to 5.18 percent from 5.08 percent 
late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	An index compiled by the National Association of Purchasing  
Management showed manufacturing declined for the eighth consecutive 
month in January, but at a slower rate than during the previous 
seven months. The recovery was larger than economists had forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	The sign of economic strength raised fears that the Fed may not  
move to lower interest rates any further and might even be forced 
to raise rates in order to slow down borrowing and economic growth. 
Higher interest rates hurt the value of bonds and other investments 
that pay a fixed rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were off between 1/8 point and 5/32 point, and intermediate 
maturities were down 3/8 point to 25/32 point, reported Bridge 
Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index fell 6.67 points  
to 1,316.18 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.51 percent as the  
discount rose 0.05 percentage point to 4.41 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.54 percent, as the discount rose 0.09 percentage 
point to 4.39 percent. One-year yields were 4.54 percent as the 
discount rose by 0.05 percentage point from late Friday to 4.35 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.00 percent from 4.81 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 125 5/8 from 126 1/32. The average 
yield to maturity rose to 5.11 percent from 5.09 percent.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Court Rejects Bias Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Supreme Court on Monday  
upheld the state's death penalty law, rejecting an argument that 
blacks disproportionately receive the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	After two years of deliberation, the court ruled 6-1 that there  
was insufficient evidence to support the argument. 
</P>
<P>
	The case centered on death row inmate Donald Loftin, a black man  
convicted of killing a gas station attendant during a 1992 robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Loftin's attorneys said an analysis of cases showed blacks had a  
higher risk of receiving the death penalty for comparable crimes 
than non-blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court appointed a retired judge to study the death  
penalty as applied to blacks and whites. He found a nearly equal 
percentage of blacks and whites accused of capital crimes received 
the death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 14 inmates on death row, six of whom are black. No one  
has been executed in New Jersey since the state's death penalty law 
was enacted in 1982.

<HEADLINE> IOC Luxuries Under Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Because of the bribery scandal, IOC  
members may be made to catch buses instead of chauffeur-driven cars 
at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates said a range  
of luxuries routinely provided to Olympic delegates is under review 
and have been discussed with Organizing Committee president and 
state government Olympics Minister Michael Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to review the level of assistance we're  
providing in those areas,'' Coates said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``For example, I can't understand why we need, for all of the  
100 IOC members, to provide them with a car to go to the venues 
each day -- a dedicated vehicle -- when we can just line the buses up 
outside the Regent (hotel).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The delegates and athletes are classed as VIPs and will be  
allowed to catch ferries to the site from near the host hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Special treatment of IOC delegates has come under the spotlight  
following the bribery scandal surrounding Salt Lake City's 
successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far as the Sports Commission that I'm involved with in  
SOCOG, we also will be reviewing the VIP lounges, the hospitality 
arrangements generally,'' Coates said. ``I think one of the 
problems with sport generally is it has lost its egalitarian 
nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Melbourne, a leader of the city's failed bid for the 1996  
Games said a secret fund had been set aside to help athletes travel 
to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, the Herald Sun newspaper said its investigations  
had uncovered the mystery money, totaling $13 million (U.S.). It 
was dubbed ``the X-factor'' and ``a secret weapon'' to give 
Melbourne's Games bid a winning edge. 
</P>
<P>
	Official records did not say where the money was to go, but it  
was not to be spent until long after Melbourne won the event, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bid team member John Ralph said the money was to have subsidized  
athletes' travel costs to the games because of Melbourne's distance 
from most of the competing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph told Channel 10 television that Melbourne's bid was  
continually audited and that all documents were kept. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was always a risk when you're dealing with these kinds  
of issues that they could end up on the front pages of 
newspapers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Melbourne, Athens, Greece, and Toronto lost the bid to Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Guinea-Bissau Clashes Spark Exodus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Thousands of people on Monday fled the  
capital of Guinea-Bissau, where fighting intensified between 
loyalist forces and rebels who threatened a ``final assault'' on 
the city. At least 15 people were reported killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting, which restarted over the weekend in the West  
African country, appeared to mark the disintegration of a November 
peace accord that had halted a five-month civil war in the former 
Portuguese colony. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. World Food Program spokesman Wagdi Othman said most of  
Bissau's population of 300,000 was fleeing the city toward the port 
and interior. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 15 people were killed in the new fighting, the  
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported. It said three shells hit the 
main hospital in Bissau, the capital, where about 150 wounded 
people had been taken. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's carnage, a catastrophic situation,'' Dr. Placido Cardoso  
told Lusa. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven people were killed and 30 wounded in a Roman Catholic  
mission outside Bissau where hundreds of people had taken refuge, 
Lusa said. It was not clear if artillery fire hit the mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid workers in Bissau reported that among the wounded were  
members of the regional defense force ECOMOG, the defense arm of 
the 16-member Economic Community of West African States. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 110 ECOMOG troops, mostly from Togo, in the country as  
part of the peace accord. Hundreds more were due to arrive this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	A French navy ship with 300 ECOMOG peacekeepers on board was  
unable to dock in Bissau due to the shelling, Lusa reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeeping force was to act as a buffer between the  
breakaway military faction and the mostly Senegalese troops 
supporting President Joao Bernardo Vieira. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the country's 6,000-strong army have joined the  
rebellion aimed at deposing Vieira. The insurgents say Vieira is 
corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the peace deal, the roughly 2,000 troops from neighboring  
Senegal were supposed to withdraw this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The peace pact called for the withdrawal of foreign troops, a  
peacekeeping ECOMOG deployment, a government of national unity and 
general elections in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The loyalist forces, which also include troops from the Republic  
of Guinea, are thought to be holed up around the presidential 
palace on the eastern side of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the rebels have won over the support of most of the  
country's population of 1.1 million, while Vieira is backed almost 
exclusively by the Senegalese and Guinean troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebellion, which broke out last June, was triggered by the  
dismissal of rebel leader Brig. Ansumane Mane as top military 
commander for allegedly running guns to separatist fighters in 
Senegal. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels, who seized the capital's main army garrison and  
airport, demanded Vieira step down. The president has ruled the 
small West African country since a 1980 coup and was directly 
elected five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	According to its per capital income, Guinea-Bissau is one of the  
15 poorest nations in the world.

<HEADLINE> Weakened AIDS Virus May Be Harmful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Using a weakened AIDS virus as a vaccine might  
actually cause the disease, a study in monkeys suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scientists have proposed using weakened HIV as a vaccine,  
and some animal studies have been encouraging. But in the new work, 
researchers found AIDS in some macaques that had been inoculated 
with a genetically crippled version of a virus called SIV, a cousin 
of HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press reported the conclusions of the work last  
July when results were presented at an AIDS meeting. The details 
are now presented in the February issue of the journal Nature 
Medicine by Dr. Ruth Reprecht of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute 
and collaborators. 
</P>
<P>
	One of 16 macaques vaccinated as adults developed AIDS, as did  
six of eight animals vaccinated as infants, researchers reported. 
Some other animals developed immune-system abnormalities.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Invited to Prayer Breakfast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A conservative Christian group is asking  
members of Congress to boycott this year's Congressional Prayer 
Breakfast because Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Traditional Values Coalition sent a letter to members of  
Congress on Monday asking them to stay away from the event 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how good the intentions of the breakfast's  
organizers are, the results of their decision to invite this 
international outlaw to this event has been disastrous,'' the Rev. 
Louis Sheldon, the group's chairman, said in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Republican organizing the breakfast said it was not  
meant to be a political event. Oklahoma Rep. Steve Largent has said 
he will not rescind the invitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Prayer Breakfast was designed not for political purposes  
but as an independent event with the goal of bringing about 
reconciliation all over the world,'' Largent said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Largent is chairman of this year's breakfast. Each year, that  
position rotates between Democrat and Republicans and between House 
members and senators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each year, thousands of invitations are sent out under the  
chairman's signature,'' Largent said. ``For the last three years, I 
am told Mr. Arafat has been an invitee. This year he accepted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat has not been invited to speak at the breakfast, and  
several Israeli government officials also have been invited, 
Largent said. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department said it had not yet received confirmation  
that Arafat would attend the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing concern for Israel, leaders of the Christian Coalition  
and the Traditional Values Coalition have asked breakfast 
organizers to cancel the invitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until Arafat repents the many murders of innocent people that  
he has encouraged or silently approved, there should not be a place 
for him at the Prayer Breakfast table or any other table of 
civilized people, for that matter,'' Sheldon's letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,500 politicians, diplomats and religious leaders attend  
the event each year.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Leader Tried Over Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- An opposition leader went on trial today for  
speaking in public without police permission, a rare act of civil 
disobedience that challenged Singapore's restrictions on speech and 
assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Chee Soon Juan, head of the 200-member Singapore Democratic  
Party, is accused of violating the Public Entertainments Act on 
Dec. 29, when he gave a speech to hundreds of people without 
obtaining a police permit. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Joshua B. Jeyaretnam, a fellow opposition leader who is  
defending Chee, argued that his client's political speech, held in 
Singapore's main business district, was not covered by the law and 
that the licensing process discriminates against the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Chee testified that his speech was ``a very serious talk to my  
fellow citizens about the transparency and accountability of the 
government. I do not in any way see that as entertainment of any 
kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also testified that members of the ruling party ``have  
routinely conducted public talks, especially during the period 
celebrating our national day'' without seeking permits. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Public Prosecutor Bala Reddy dismissed those arguments as  
inappropriate and said Chee and his party had been granted permits 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense is also arguing that the law, passed by a Parliament  
dominated for 40 years by one party, violates Singapore's 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	``The law ... contravenes the constitution, and therefore the  
whole thing is void,'' Jeyaretnam said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Superintendent Low Hui Hui testified that he warned Chee  
ahead of time not to speak, and told him afterward that he was 
under investigation. He acknowledged that the crowd was calm but 
said disorder ``could happen anytime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The same chance as Martians invading Singapore,'' Jeyaretnam  
retorted. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution said the crowd numbered 800, but foreign  
journalists at the scene estimated it at less then 300. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowdy crowds at political speeches are unheard of in tightly  
regulated Singapore. However, the government says restrictions on 
speeches about politics and religion are still required because the 
small island nation endured racial and religious violence in the 
1960s and '70s.

<HEADLINE>  IOC Leader Lash Back at Critics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- International Olympic Committee  
leaders are lashing back at their critics as they turn from one 
ethical crisis to another. 
</P>
<P>
	Still reeling from the worst corruption scandal in its 105-year  
history, the IOC is pressing ahead this week with a world summit on 
fighting performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have questioned whether the IOC has the ethical  
authority to lead the anti-doping fight while its own standards are 
under attack. 
</P>
<P>
	But IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and his deputies,  
concerned the drug conference is being overshadowed by the scandal, 
took pains Sunday to dispel that notion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This outfit is not in disarray,'' executive board member Kevan  
Gosper of Australia said. ``This outfit is managing itself through 
one of the most serious crises in its history. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it carries the authority on all matters relating to  
Olympic sports, and that includes the overseeing of this 
anti-doping conference. There is only one authority and one 
organization capable of doing it and that's us, and that's why 
we're doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's credibility remains at stake at the 2 1/2-day doping  
conference opening Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the main goals of the meeting is to approve the creation  
of an international agency to coordinate drug-testing programs 
worldwide. But there's likely to be controversy over the IOC's role 
in the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch on Sunday said he would oversee the agency and  
proposed that IOC medical commission chief Prince Alexandre de 
Merode run the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my personal opinion the man running this agency must be  
the president of the medical commission of the IOC, who has been 
doing a very good job for many years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	De Merode, a Belgian, has led the IOC medical commission since  
its inception 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have called for the world agency to be fully  
independent, saying the body would lack credibility if it's run by 
the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said it was still uncertain whether the world agency --  
funded largely by Olympic television rights fees -- would be based 
in Lausanne or elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the conference should also approve a precise  
definition of doping, a single medical code for all Olympic sports 
and a campaign to educate athletes about drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, he said he was ``astonished'' at the vitriol of the  
attacks against him in the world's media, including the ``rubbish 
that is said in some papers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So many silly things are coming,'' he said. ``Who can produce  
all this news?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch cited a Swedish report that he lives in a villa and  
flies by helicopter every day to IOC headquarters. In fact, 
Samaranch resides in a hotel suite in Lausanne and travels by car 
to his office. 
</P>
<P>
	He also recounted that a Japanese paper accused him of  
frolicking with geisha at a ``huge party'' at a hotel in Nagano at 
the close of the 1998 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``First of all, I was with my wife,'' Samaranch said. ``And  
second, I am 78 years old. I am not of the age to have parties with 
geisha girls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite calls from outside the IOC for his resignation,  
Samaranch reiterated he will stay as long as he has the support of 
the committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	``My obligation is to stay and to put all my efforts to get back  
the prestige that the IOC had during the last years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old Spaniard, who has led the IOC since 1980 and  
whose final term ends in 2001, will put his leadership to a vote of 
confidence at a special general assembly March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe some people they are very tired to see me as president  
after 18 years, mainly some people outside the IOC,'' Samaranch 
said. ``But I would like to repeat: I put my position to the IOC 
members. It is up to them. My position belongs to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch wouldn't predict the outcome of the vote but said, ``I  
can assure you I have received many telephone calls, many letters 
from IOC members. Until now, they all are supporting me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he was confident the general assembly would  
support the recommendations of the executive board to expel six 
members for alleged misconduct stemming from Salt Lake City's 
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine have either resigned or been expelled, three remain under  
investigation and one received a warning. Other members could be 
implicated as the investigation continues. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Investigators say the total of cash, services and gifts given  
to IOC members or relatives by Salt Lake bidders topped $1 million, 
USA Today reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources, said the  
investigators had found an additional $250,000 in IOC-directed 
expenses by Salt Lake officials, including numerous purchases from 
high-end jewelry and department stores in the Utah capital. 
</P>
<P>
	-- IOC members may have to ride buses instead of chauffeur-driven  
cars at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Australian Olympic Committee 
president John Coates said a range of luxuries routinely provided 
to Olympic delegates is under review and have been discussed with 
Sydney organizing committee president and state government Olympics 
Minister Michael Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to review the level of assistance we're  
providing in those areas,'' Coates said today. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Australians IOC members Kevan Gosper and Phil Coles are among  
those being investigated by the FBI in the Salt Lake scandal. The 
FBI reportedly is examining links between 60 past and present IOC 
members and students at the University of Utah to tell whether 
scholarships were given to try to lure votes. 
</P>
<P>
	-- An unexplained $13 million was earmarked as a ``secret  
weapon'' to aid Melbourne's 1996 Olympics bid, the Herald Sun in 
Melbourne reported. The newspaper said records do not say where the 
money was to go but it was not to be spent until after Melbourne 
won the event. The city lost to Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Critters Play Big Roles in Game Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Add a desperate lobster, a goggled mouse and two  
cute pups to the cast of critters that Super Bowl advertisers 
pressed into service in hopes of catching the eye of TV's biggest 
yearly audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrities, musical scores and the Internet also played a role  
in the ads on this year's telecast, which saw Denver trounce 
Atlanta 34-19 for its second consecutive National Football League 
championship title. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 30 advertisers paid an average of $1.6 million for  
each half-minute commercial slot on Sunday's telecast, according to 
executives at Fox Broadcasting Co. That was up 23 percent from last 
year's record $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors were expecting about 130 million people to tune in for  
at least part of the telecast, which usually delivers the biggest 
audience of the year for any single program. 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch Inc., the nation's biggest brewer and the Super  
Bowl's biggest advertiser, introduced new critters to go along with 
its familiar frogs and lizards. 
</P>
<P>
	A lobster headed for a restaurant's boiling pot grabbed a bottle  
of Budweiser and used it to keep the chef and others at bay while 
he crawled out the door in a Bud ad. 
</P>
<P>
	And a Dalmatian puppy passed over as the new firehouse dog has  
the last laugh on his sibling in another Bud ad when they pass two 
years later -- the rejected pup now rides on the beer wagon pulled 
by Clydesdale horses. 
</P>
<P>
	The mouse in goggles appeared in a Bud Light ad where a man  
sends him flying into the next apartment where it drives the pretty 
neighbor to the man's place with a six-pack. 
</P>
<P>
	The brewer, which ran nine commercials that consumed more than  
five of the 28 minutes in the telecast, ran two ads featuring Louie 
the Lizard and the Bud frogs he tried to electrocute in last year's 
Super Bowl telecast. 
</P>
<P>
	In one ad, Louie tells the frogs all three of them have been  
fired and is shocked the frogs can speak fluently. In the second 
ad, the frogs work Louie over. ``Slap the punk,'' one frog 
encourages the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch marketers say they expect to retire the frogs and  
lizard characters this year before their popularity wears thin. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrities were in several ads. Actress Halle Berry swam after  
the new M&AMP;Ms Crispy character in one ad, Jerry Seinfeld made a 
fictional cross-country drive for American Express, Jon Lovitz 
posed as the phone book author for Yellow Pages Publishers and Cuba 
Gooding Jr. unintentionally blew up a car in an ad for Pepsi One. 
</P>
<P>
	Frito-Lay Inc. featured former Miss USA Ali Landry for a second  
consecutive Super Bowl appearance for Doritos, this time setting 
off the library sprinkler system as she eats the new barbecue 
variety. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Wrestling Federation had its own stars Stone Cold  
Steve Austin, Sable and the Undertaker extol WWF entertainment as 
executives brawled on a ``typical day'' at its headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oldsmobile division of General Motors Corp. made its Super  
Bowl debut with an ad whose hip-hop musical track alone made it 
clear that Olds wants to reach a younger audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet is also becoming an increasingly common feature of  
Super Bowl advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Lingerie retailer Victoria's Secret showed off skimpily clad  
models to drum up interest in the first Internet telecast of its 
annual fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Internet jobs sites advertised this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Monster.com made its debut on the Super Bowl with an ad run  
twice that showed youngsters expressing absurd ambitions like 
wanting ``to claw my way up to middle management'' to ``be forced 
into early retirement.'' The job site's message: ``There's a better 
job out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller rival HotJobs.com's ad showed a security guard  
daydreaming at a computer terminal about being a mogul, a scientist 
or an actor and finding the job he really wanted -- a security guard 
at a better place. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple Computer Inc., whose 1984 commercial introducing the  
Macintosh is often cited for making the Super Bowl an ad showcase, 
appeared on the Super Bowl for the first time in 15 years. Its ad 
showed the talking computer Hal from ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' 
explaining that Macintosh was the only computer to operate 
perfectly as the year 2000 arrived and other computers 
malfunctioned.

<HEADLINE> Warner-Lambert CEO Retiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORRIS PLAINS, N.J. (AP) -- Melvin R. Goodes, Warner-Lambert's  
chairman and chief executive, plans to retire on May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodes, 64, has held the top spot at the pharmaceutical company  
since 1991. He will be succeeded by Lodewijk J.R. de Vink, 
Warner-Lambert's president and chief operating officer. No 
successor to de Vink will be named, the company said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The mandatory retirement age for senior executive management is  
65. A company spokeswoman said Goodes, 64, announced his retirement 
several months earlier than had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply put, I have my health and my work here is complete,''  
Goodes said in a statement. ``I look forward to the opportunity to 
share more time with my family and friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1991, when Goodes became chairman and chief executive  
officer, the company's market value was approximately $9 billion. 
Today it is almost $60 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodes helped Warner-Lambert become a major player in the  
prescription drug industry. In one of his biggest moves, he struck 
a deal with Pfizer Inc. in 1996 to sell the blockbuster 
cholesterol-reducing drug Lipitor. Lipitor posted $2.2 billion in 
sales last year, and some analysts expect it to become a $6 billion 
drug in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Warner-Lambert's best-known consumer products are  
Listerine mouthwash and Dentyne gum. 
</P>
<P>
	De Vink, 53, is a native of Holland and became an American  
citizen in 1991. He joined Warner-Lambert in 1988 as vice president 
and president of international operations following 20 years with 
Schering-Plough Corp.

<HEADLINE> Two French Banks To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French banks Societe Generale and Paribas announced  
today that they will merge, forming a banking giant in a move that 
further streamlines the French and European financial services 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The new group, to be called SG Paribas, will be the world's  
fourth-largest bank in terms of shareholder funds, at $23.9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall deal between Societe Generale, a banking group, and  
Paribas, an investment bank, will be worth $17.2 billion, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	SG Paribas will be a leader in international investment banking  
activities, ranking among the world's top five in eurobonds, 
derivatives, and international trade finance. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared to its main European partners, France has been slow to  
consolidate its banking sector. The merger comes amid moves to 
float part of the Credit Lyonnais bank. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the merger -- coupled with French insurer AXA Group  
making an offer today for rival British insurer Guardian Royal 
Exchange PLC -- fueled a rise in financial services' shares in 
France and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale has been on an aggressive shopping spree of  
late, acquiring Japan's Yamaichi International Capital Management 
Co., U.S. investment bank Cowen and Co. and a hefty stake in Asia 
Credit PCL in 1998 alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The new entity will have six main operating areas: retail  
banking, specialist financial services, asset management, 
investment banking, shareholdings and real estate. 
</P>
<P>
	In a public offer running Feb. 9-March 16, Societe Generale will  
offer five new Societe Generale shares for eight Paribas shares. 
Paribas said the offer represents a premium of around 17 percent 
for its shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger should see average earnings per share growth of 15  
percent a year, Paribas said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn welcomed the  
merger, which he said would help the country's financial sector 
become ``strong and dynamic'' at the heart of the euro zone. The 
euro is the new, unified European currency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our country must be able to count on companies (that) have the  
necessary means to develop nationally, in Europe and worldwide,'' 
the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Law Threatens Battle Reenactment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- This Revolutionary War town is planning  
a big bash for the 225th anniversary of the Battle of Lexington 
next year, but organizers say the state's new gun control law is 
threatening the event's authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the latest celebration slated to go gunless under the law  
passed last year. During Gov. Paul Cellucci's recent inauguration, 
the Lexington Minute Men attended -- yet went without their 
traditional muskets because of new weapon storage requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	In this historic town, up to a quarter of a million visitors are  
expected for the three-day anniversary extravaganza in April 2000, 
along with 1,000 to 1,500 re-enactors of the battle itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayward Gardner, chairman of Lexington Commission 2000, says the  
party may go up in smoke unless the state amends its new gun law to 
exempt antique weapons from storage and trigger-lock requirements 
and to free re-enactors from having to get licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Susan Fargo, D-Lincoln, and state Rep. Jay Kaufman,  
D-Lexington, are talking to Cellucci and legislative leaders about 
amendments that would exempt muskets manufactured during or before 
1899 from the trigger lock and storage requirements mandated by the 
state's assault weapons law passed last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Most gun lockers don't fit the extra-long length of antique  
muskets, and the orange trigger locks available for them would 
stand out against the tone of a Revolutionary War re-enactment, 
Fargo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the amendments, the proposed Patriots Day 2000 bash also  
may be canceled. State lawmakers also have been working to amend 
the law to allow veterans to carry guns at Veterans Day parades. 
</P>
<P>
	``These amendments will allow us to balance the need for  
responsible gun control legislation while not detracting from 
events which celebrate our historic and cultural identity,'' Fargo 
said.

<HEADLINE> How Budget Will Impact You </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton wants to come to the aid of  
stay-at-home parents with a bouncy little tax credit in baby's 
first year. When the kid goes off to class -- perhaps in a trailer 
at one of the nation's many crowded schools -- the budget awaits 
with money for more buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	For the child slipping into adulthood, Clinton aims to raise a  
federal grant for low-income undergraduates by $125, ensure 
everyone can find something called a One-Stop Career Center and 
polish up last year's big effort to make college available to all. 
</P>
<P>
	On it goes, for the poor, the middle class, the middle aged and  
the old. 
</P>
<P>
	For the not-quite elderly, there's a plan to let them buy  
Medicare coverage when they are younger than today's minimum age of 
65. For the chronically ill, there's a $1,000 tax credit to help 
with the often enormous costs of tending one's health. Living in a 
nursing home? Clinton would toughen their inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	Smokers would help pay for it all. After seeing prices rise 30  
percent recently because of a settlement between the tobacco 
industry and states, smokers face 55 cents a pack more in taxes if 
Clinton gets his way. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's budget reflects flush times and an impulse to do  
something for someone at almost every stage of life. It's an 
impulse more easily committed to paper than written into law -- 
Republicans have their own ideas, heavier on tax cuts. And this 
president has seen many of his past proposals fail on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, Republicans want to take some of the projected  
budget surplus and cut everyone's income taxes by up to 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the goodies, Clinton's spending plan reflects a  
reluctance to go all out now that the nation is reversing decades 
of deficits. In this year before an election year, massive 
cash-in-your-pocket proposals are missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the president's offering a chunk of diaper change and  
more: 
</P>
<P>
	--A $250 tax credit for a child under age 1, when a parent stays  
home. You can double your tax credit pleasure with twins. But you 
can't triple it with triplets -- the maximum is $500. As well, 
parents who must pay child care expenses to work would get a larger 
credit than now. 
</P>
<P>
	--For the military, an across-the-board pay increase of 4.4  
percent and better retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	--$22 billion in school construction and modernization bonds, to  
take a bite out of school overcrowding. Clinton also wants money to 
start up 2,200 charter public schools, which operate under fewer 
regulations and, he believes, are more innovative. 
</P>
<P>
	--A $125 increase in the maximum Pell grant, to $3,250.  
Post-college, Clinton would let taxpayers deduct interest on their 
student loans for the life of the loan. Now, the deduction can only 
be taken for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	--A $1,000 tax credit for the chronically ill or those who look  
after them. 
</P>
<P>
	--A $1,000 tax credit for disabled workers to help with the extra  
costs they may face because of their work, such as special 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	--A proposal to let people buy Medicare coverage when they are as  
young as 62. If workers lose their company plan because their 
employer moves, goes out of business or cuts back their hours, they 
could buy into Medicare as young as 55. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from the tobacco tax, the budget comes with costs that are  
less apparent to the individual but may be just as real. It goes 
after a broad range of accounting practices used in tax shelters 
and proposes scores of tax increases on businesses. Some of those 
could raise prices for consumers or make workers lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	One proposed tax increase on the life insurance industry, for  
example, would cost a hefty $4 billion over five years.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Security Rates Rise / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities rose in Monday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.5 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.400 percent, up from 4.305 percent last 
week. An additional $7.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.390 percent, up from 4.280 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since Dec. 28, when the  
bills sold for 4.520 percent. The six-month rate was the highest 
since Jan. 11, when the rate was 4.405. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.510 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,888.80 and 4.551 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,778.10. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 4.51 
percent last week from 4.49 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Kansas Falls Out of Top 25 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Connecticut's run as the No. 1 team in The Associated Press  
college basketball poll reached 10 weeks Monday, while Kansas was 
not in the Top 25 for the first time in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies were again the runaway choice, receiving 52  
first-place votes and 1,756 points from the national media panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the rankings were released, however, Connecticut --  
which had been the nation's only unbeaten Division I team at 19-0 -- 
lost to No. 16 Syracuse 59-42. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies were minus two injured players -- leading scorer  
Richard Hamilton and leading rebounder Jake Voskuhl. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (21-1) was No. 2 for the eighth straight week, getting the  
other 19 No. 1 votes and 1,720 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the Top 25 received a shakeup, with Kansas, which  
had been ranked for every poll since Jan. 29, 1991, dropping out 
along with Texas Christian and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The three newcomers were No. 20 Utah, which was ranked 10th in  
the preseason poll and for the first weeks of the regular season; 
No. 22 College of Charleston, which is ranked for the second time 
in school history; and No. 24 Missouri, which is back in the Top 25 
after a 3 1/2-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati moved up two spots to No. 3, while Stanford, which  
lost at Arizona on Thursday, dropped one place to fourth. Kentucky 
and Auburn each moved up one place to fifth and sixth, while 
Maryland, which lost by 13 points at Wake Forest, dropped from 
fourth to seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State and St. John's held on to Nos. 8 and 9, while  
Arizona moved back into the top 10 after the win over Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin was at No. 11 and followed by North Carolina, UCLA,  
Iowa, Ohio State, Syracuse, New Mexico, Purdue and Minnesota, which 
were tied for 18th, and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	The last five ranked teams were Indiana, Arkansas, College of  
Charleston, Missouri and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas (14-6) had lost three of four before beating Colorado at  
home on Saturday. The Jayhawks' run of 145 consecutive poll 
appearances was the third longest current streak behind the 156 of 
North Carolina and 154 of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a long time. I'm proud of that,'' Kansas coach Roy  
Williams said. ``But I truly don't think it will affect this team. 
I really don't. We play dumb on the court sometimes. But they're 
not dumb kids. And they realize that doesn't have anything to do 
with the way we play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to affect me whatsoever and I'd be shocked if  
they let it affect them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, at 66 consecutive polls, moved into third place  
followed by New Mexico at 50, and Duke and Stanford, both at 49. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah (16-4) moved into the Top 25, having not lost since the  
Texas game when they dropped to 5-4 and out of the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	College of Charleston (18-2) is ranked for just the second time  
in school history. The Cougars were in the Top 25 the last five 
weeks of the 1996-97 season and got as high as No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Both their losses were to Southeastern Conference teams --  
Georgia and South Carolina -- and their current 15-game winning 
streak started with a victory over North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri (15-4) was last ranked for the first six weeks of the  
1995-96 season and the Tigers came in having won three straight 
after consecutive losses to Kansas and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Christian (15-6) dropped from No. 24 after consecutive  
Western Athletic Conference losses to Tulsa and Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida (15-4) fell out from No. 25 after just one week in the  
poll, beating Alabama and then losing to Mississippi State.

<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Finnish telecommunications group Nokia  
has won a contract worth $130 million to expand a digital mobile 
phone network in the southeastern province of Jiangxi. 
</P>
<P>
	Deliveries for the Global System for Mobile communications  
network will begin immediately, the company said Monday. The 
expansion of the network could potentially increase the number of 
subscribers five-fold to about 1.5 million, Nokia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nokia views China as one of its most promising markets. Last  
year, it announced net sales in China worth 10.4 billion markkaa 
($2.1 billion), an increase of more than 60 percent from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Nokia is a world leader in digital mobile phone technology, and  
has supplied GSM equipment to 78 operators in 37 countries. It has 
sales in 130 countries, and employs 44,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Nokia announced a record pretax profit in 1998 of  
14.6 billion markkaa ($2.92 billion), up from 8.4 billion markkaa 
in 1997.

<HEADLINE>  Elway Faces Comeback Dilemma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Now this is a fine fix Denver quarterback John  
Elway has gotten himself into. 
</P>
<P>
	After beating Atlanta 34-19 Sunday, Elway moved into elite  
company, joining Bart Starr, Bob Griese, Terry Bradshaw, Joe 
Montana and Troy Aikman as the only quarterbacks to win consecutive 
Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has won three in a row.  
</P>
<P>
	And that is Elway's dilemma. There is tremendous temptation to  
go for the trifecta, uncharted territory that would put him in a 
class by himself. That would mean, at age 38, delaying his 
retirement for another year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have got to love those challenges,'' Elway said. ``We've  
got the team, we've got the nucleus here to do it. It definitely 
throws a kink into my thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly the Broncos want him back. And why not? He still seems  
on top of his game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love John to come back next season,'' coach Mike  
Shanahan said. ``He has meant a lot to this city to win Super Bowls 
in consecutive seasons. I want him back for a third.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway's solution was not to think about it right now, choosing  
instead to enjoy the glow of a victory he constructed with 336 
yards passing -- the third highest yardage total for any quarterback 
in Super Bowl history. 
</P>
<P>
	A large chunk of that total came on an 80-yard touchdown  
connection with Rod Smith on the first play from scrimmage after 
Atlanta's Morten Andersen missed a 26-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	That was one of 18 completions Elway had, hitting a half-dozen  
different Denver receivers and making him the unanimous choice for 
MVP. Most of the passing game came without tight end Shannon 
Sharpe, who left the game in the first quarter after twisting his 
left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	It hardly disturbed Elway, who has passed for more than 50,000  
yards and over 300 touchdowns in a 16-year career. He enjoyed the 
chance to air it out against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``The talk all week was about the running game,'' he said.  
``Nobody talked about passing. I went in knowing I'd have the 
opportunity to throw. I was looking forward to the opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway lit it up. He beat Atlanta every way imaginable -- short  
passes and long passes, slants and shotguns. Sometimes it seemed 
unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth quarter, he even barreled into the end zone on a  
3-yard keeper for a touchdown. There was a grin a mile wide on his 
face, like a kid in a sandlot, not an aging quarterback in the 
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	What was that all about?  
</P>
<P>
	``They had been hurt by quarterback draws all year so we were  
just hoping we got the right defense,'' Elway said. ``Sure enough 
we got the perfect defense. I was thinking I want to get in the end 
zone. I could see the goal line right there and Mark Schlereth fell 
on top of me. He said: `Hello, how are you?' I said: `I'm good.' He 
made me laugh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By then, the Broncos were having fun.  
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, the Super Bowl went down to the last play with Brett  
Favre driving Green Bay in a frantic effort to catch the Broncos. 
This time, Denver had enough breathing room to allow Elway to make 
a solitary exit from the field in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
	It was another emotional moment in a night full of them for  
Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I was crying,'' he said. ``I definitely got a  
little bit emotional out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He trotted off the field, his arms held high as the crowd of  
74,803 roared. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the kind of walk you kind of dream of as a kid,''  
Elway said. ``That walk, I will remember for the rest of my life.''

<HEADLINE> Nichols Wants Conviction Reversed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Terry Nichols' conviction in the Oklahoma City  
bombing should be overturned because a federal judge refused to 
allow an FBI whistleblower to testify, his attorney argued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols also asked for a reduced sentence, contending the judge  
used the wrong guidelines to impose a life term. 
</P>
<P>
	In a small courtroom crowded with bombing victims and relatives,  
prosecutor Sean Connelly countered by arguing that Nichols got a 
fair trial and a fair sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``He committed this nation's most deadly conspiracy. There was  
nothing unfair about that sentence,'' Connelly told a three-judge 
panel at the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Tigar, Nichols' lawyer, said U.S. District Judge Richard  
Matsch used guidelines for the charge of murder even though Nichols 
was convicted of the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter, 
along with conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the absence of a reversal, Tigar asked the panel ``to respect  
the jury's verdict'' and reduce Nichols' sentence of life without 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols was sentenced last year and ordered to pay $14.5 million  
in restitution. Timothy McVeigh was convicted of murder and 
conspiracy and sentenced to die for the April 1995 bombing, which 
killed 168 people. McVeigh is appealing his conviction and sentence 
to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Bobby Baldock asked Tigar whether it mattered which  
sentencing guideline was used, for involuntary manslaughter or 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``If death results, they are just as dead as if it was  
first-degree murder,'' Baldock told Tigar. 
</P>
<P>
	In asking for the conviction to be overturned, Tigar challenged  
Matsch's decision to deny FBI whistleblower Frederick Whitehurst an 
opportunity to testify about fertilizer crystals found on the truck 
used in the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigar told the appeals court Whitehurst was prepared to offer  
new research that brought into question prosecutors' claims that 
fertilizer crystals found on truck pieces could have survived a 
night in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigar said Whitehurst was threatened with losing his job if he  
continued to help Nichols' attorneys. Connelly said Whitehurst was 
not threatened and in fact offered to testify for Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, prosecutors said Nichols joined with McVeigh  
in helping get bomb materials -- including two tons of ammonium 
nitrate -- burglarizing an explosives quarry, robbing a firearms 
collector and renting storage sheds. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers expect a ruling within about three months.  
</P>
<P>
	Roy Sells, who lost his wife, Lee, in the bombing, said he has  
attended every court hearing since. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would really rather be doing something else. I'll be glad  
when it's all over,'' he said. ``On the last day of McVeigh's life, 
I'll be there, too. Then, I think I can get this behind me.''

<HEADLINE> Charge Dropped in Wash. Baby Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ANGELES, Wash. (AP) -- Prosecutors on Monday withdrew a  
second-degree murder charge against a veteran pediatrician accused 
of blocking an infant's breathing after the 3-day-old boy was 
declared brain dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to drop charges against Dr. Eugene Turner came just  
as his trial was to begin and prompted a burst of cheers and 
applause from his supporters in the crowded courtroom. Turner, 62, 
could hardly speak through his tears. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner always believed ``he did everything he could to save the  
life of Conor McInnerney on Jan. 12 of last year,'' said defense 
attorney Jeff Robinson. ``And he was right, and we think the 
decision today bears that out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no evidence the baby's death was caused by ``any  
criminal or even negligent act by any other human being,'' said the 
motion for dismissal filed by prosecutor Jim Townsend and approved 
by a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The baby's parents, Martin and Michelle McInnerney, will file a  
negligence lawsuit against Turner, said their lawyer, Matthew Koop. 
They have not decided whether to sue the hospital. The McInnerneys 
were not in court. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple ``are going to be haunted forever by the image of  
what Dr. Turner did while he was alone with Conor that night,'' 
Knopp said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They believe that justice requires that they file a civil  
action in order to ... make sure this type of thing doesn't happen 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The charge can be refiled if new evidence surfaces, but such a  
decision would have to be made fairly quickly -- within the next two 
weeks, said Snohomish County Prosecutor Jim Krider. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner was accused of stopping Conor's breathing with his hand  
on Jan. 12, 1998. The infant was declared dead twice after he 
stopped breathing at home and was brought to the Olympic Memorial 
Hospital emergency room by ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner said the breathing he stopped was reflexive ``agonal  
breathing'' that is a sign of imminent death -- and said the infant 
was already brain dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts and hospital staff -- and the boy's parents --  
disagreed. But a trial would not resolve that disagreement, 
prosecutors concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Townsend said he considered lesser charges of first- or  
second-degree manslaughter, his motion says. But he concluded a 
court could not make that charge stick either. 
</P>
<P>
	``The expert testimony on this issue is not consistent,'' he  
wrote, concluding the available evidence would not support a 
conviction ``of any criminal act'' in the baby's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner still faces a May hearing before the state Medical  
Quality Assurance Commission for alleged unprofessional conduct in 
the baby's death. The panel allowed Turner to keep his medical 
license until his case is heard, but ordered another doctor be 
present any time he attempted a resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner voluntarily surrendered his hospital privileges but  
continued to operate his Peninsula Children's Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he believes evidence gathered for the trial will help  
before the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can have some evidence to bring forth to the state  
board to indicate that things were maybe not as bad as they 
originally thought they were,'' Turner said.

<HEADLINE> Jupiter Explorer Develops Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The Galileo spacecraft halted all  
non-essential activities by going into a ``safe mode'' shortly 
after close approaches to the moon Europa and Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft was stable and information it sent suggested that  
observations of Europa were successfully stored in its tape 
recorder, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a safe mode, a spacecraft automatically tries to maintain  
contact with Earth while halting non-essential activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred about four hours after a flyby within 900  
miles of the surface of Europa and one hour after passing within 
360,000 miles of Jupiter's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	The encounter called for turns to point instruments at Europa  
and then turning back to a position pointing more directly toward 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Project team members were analyzing the problem. Preliminary  
analysis indicated that Galileo went into safe mode after software 
designed to watch out for faults detected that the spacecraft was 
taking too long to complete a turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Galileo was launched in 1989 and arrived at Jupiter on Dec. 7,  
1995. It completed its $1.5 billion primary mission and is halfway 
through an $30 million extended mission focusing on Europa and 
other moons. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's was the last of eight Europa encounters during the  
extended mission, which anticipates 14 different orbits around 
Jupiter.

<HEADLINE> IOC Runs Into More Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The IOC, scrambling to keep its  
drug summit from being overshadowed by the Olympic corruption 
scandals, ran into disputes Monday over key issues in the 
anti-doping fight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of what was billed as a watershed meeting in the war  
against performance-enhancing drugs, there were signs that the 
International Olympic Committee was in for a contentious meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Differences emerged over the structure of a proposed  
international drug agency, the definition of doping and the 
severity of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC executive board, meanwhile, met under tight secrecy to  
discuss the twin crises of corruption and drugs. Reporters were 
kept away from IOC headquarters during the meeting, an unusual 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	In action directly linked to the bribery scandal, the board  
started the IOC's first ethics commission and code of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Director general Francois Carrard said the ethics panel would  
police ``the general conduct of IOC members and their business 
practices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the five-member panel would include three officials from  
outside the International Olympic Committee. He said they would be 
``very serious independent personalities'' from different parts of 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	At the conference hall across town where the doping summit  
starts Tuesday, a major dispute was brewing over the proposed 
agency for coordinating the worldwide drug fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The creation of an Olympic Movement Anti-Doping Agency is a  
centerpiece of the 2 1/2-day conference. Among other things, the 
agency would be responsible for instituting random, 
out-of-competition drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
	But Olympic officials were divided over whether the agency  
should be run by IOC leaders or have a more independent status. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said Sunday he would  
oversee the agency as president or chairman. And he proposed that 
the IOC medical commission chairman, Prince Alexandre de Merode, 
should run the agency on a day-to-day basis. 
</P>
<P>
	De Merode, a Belgian, has led the IOC medical commission since  
its inception 30 years ago. Critics contend he has been ineffective 
in combating doping, which has escalated at an alarming rate in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	There were calls for the drug agency to be fully independent.  
Critics claim the body would lack credibility if it's run by the 
IOC, especially when the committee is reeling from the worst 
corruption crisis in its 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey, who is part of the U.S.  
delegation to the conference, is advocating a totally independent 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is pushing for true independence with random outside audits  
and verification,'' McCaffrey aide Bob Weiner said. ``Independent 
doesn't mean dependent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said no final decision had been made on the issue.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a matter for the world conference to decide,'' he  
said. ``The matter is entirely open. ... (The agency) has to be 
autonomous. But the question of who should be chairman or vice 
chairman remains open for the conference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were clear signs of opposition to Samaranch's proposal  
within the IOC. Vice presidents Dick Pound of Canada and Anita 
DeFrantz of the United States both expressed reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is one of the important issues -- to persuade everyone  
(the agency) is independent,'' said Pound, the IOC's chief 
coordinator of the project. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz said, ``The chairman of the medical commission should  
continue to do that, but the agency is something different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz, who in charge of an athletes' panel on doping, said  
her group prefers to call the agency ``international'' rather than 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the IOC should retain an important role in the agency  
because the IOC will be providing the primary source of funding for 
the project. The initial cost of setting up the agency is estimated 
at $25 million, with the money drawn from Olympic television 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cynics will say it's not independent, but someone has to fund  
it,'' DeFrantz said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the agency could be structured in similarly to the  
Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport, with a board of 
directors ``independent of the Olympic movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the structure of the doping agency and who would run it were  
not the only hot topics. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC working group called for the possibility of life bans and  
$1 million fines for athletes found guilty of serious cases of 
``intentional doping.'' Details of that proposal had been reported 
previously. 
</P>
<P>
	The world soccer federation, FIFA, said it opposed key points of  
the proposal on grounds that it is legally unworkable. FIFA also 
complained that the IOC's proposed definition of doping is flawed 
because it focuses on health rather than ethical issues. 
</P>
<P>
	With their credibility at stake, IOC leaders tried to focus  
attention on the drug issue rather than the bribery scandals 
surrounding the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics and other 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doping issue is more important in the great scheme of  
things than the behavior of a few of our members,'' said Pound, who 
heads the IOC corruption inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, however, will keep busy with the Salt Lake case. His  
commission will meet in Lausanne this week to continue its inquiry, 
which a report in USA Today said now accounts for payments, gifts 
and other benefits to IOC members totaling more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, nine members have either resigned or been expelled for  
receiving cash payments, medical care, scholarships and other 
benefits from Salt Lake bidders. Three others remain under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound's panel is now looking into other IOC members who could be  
implicated in the affair. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz said the timing of the doping conference was ideal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is exactly the right time to do this,'' she said.  
``This is the most important issue. What better time to seriously 
address it. We have the opportunity to do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The athletes want a a system that works,'' she said. ``The  
athletes are tired of being whispered about. They are tired of the 
finger pointing. Enough.''

<HEADLINE> Defense Budget Adds, Takes Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration proposes in its  
2000 budget the biggest pay raise for troops in almost two decades 
and an increase in spending on high-tech aircraft and other 
weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense budget submitted to Congress on Monday also seeks  
authority to close more military bases, a proposal almost certain 
to generate strong opposition from both Democratic and Republican 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	It also earmarks $1.8 billion for continued U.S. peacekeeping in  
Bosnia even as the administration considers deepening its military 
commitment in the Balkans by sending peacekeepers to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed Pentagon budget is $261 billion, not including $13  
billion for the Energy Department's nuclear weapons programs. That 
compares with the $264 billion projected to be spent by the Defense 
Department in the current budget year, which includes $4.5 billion 
in extra money Congress appropriated to improve overall military 
preparedness and to pay for the Bosnia and Iraq operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen said a key goal of the 2000  
defense budget is to improve conditions for the troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's getting harder to recruit and harder to retain quality  
people in this very strong economy,'' Cohen told a Pentagon news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget proposes a 4.4 percent military pay raise in 2000,  
but Senate Republicans already are pushing for a bigger increase. 
The Senate Armed Services Committee last week recommended a 4.8 
percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending plan is roughly in line with Republican calls for  
increased spending to modernize the military's weaponry, improve 
troop living conditions and invest in a national defense against 
missile attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,  
however, was critical of the budget total. Rep. Floyd Spence, 
R-S.C., called it a ``small step in the right direction'' but far 
short of what the service chiefs have told Congress they need to 
modernize the forces over the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president continues to play high-stakes poker with our  
military's future and with the nation's ability to protect its 
interests around the world,'' Spence said in a statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the $4 billion increase over 1999 in spending on weaponry,  
much of the gain would be for Air Force aircraft, including the 
F-22 fighter, and for Navy ships and submarines, including the new 
Virginia-class attack submarine. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the defense budget would provide a sustained increase  
in military spending -- the first since the end of the Cold War. But 
actual year-to-year increases do not begin until 2001, according to 
the six-year plan sent to Congress. Spending as measured in 
outlays, or actual dollars spent in the budget year, would go from 
$261 billion next year to $269 billion in 2001 and reach $318 
billion four years later. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration bills the 2000 spending plan as an increase  
of $12 billion, with a total increase of $112 billion through 2005. 
But the $12 billion represents the difference between what the 
administration had said a year ago it would spend in 2000 and what 
it now proposes to spend. Much of the $12 billion is actually 
savings from lower-than-expected inflation, not new money. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the $112 billion in increased spending through 2005, $84  
billion would come from projected surpluses in the overall federal 
budget. The remaining $28 billion would be savings on previously 
budgeted programs, reflecting lower inflation and other 
adjustments.

<HEADLINE>  Lawyers Gather to Question Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors and the White House legal  
team questioned Monica Lewinsky under oath today in a deposition 
for President Clinton's impeachment trial. The questioning, 
conducted privately at a hotel, continued into the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Clinton's lawyer renewed complaints in court that  
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr was violating grand jury secrecy 
laws on a separate matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., and presidential lawyers Cheryl Mills,  
Nicole Seligman and David Kendall were at the Mayflower Hotel for 
the videotaped deposition of the former intern. 
</P>
<P>
	The doors closed at 9 a.m. EST for the questioning that could  
last as long as eight hours. After a short midmorning break the 
deposition resumed and was continuing past noon. Dozens of 
reporters and camera crews were outside on a chilly, sunny day. 
Police closed off a side street running past one of the hotel's 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
	Before turning to the extraordinary question-and-answer session,  
Kendall announced he was taking legal action against Starr 
concerning a weekend story in The New York Times that the 
independent counsel had concluded that a grand jury could indict 
Clinton while he was still in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall said he was filing a motion in U.S. District Court  
asking that Starr be required to show why he and his staff ``should 
not be held in contempt for improper violations of grand jury 
secrecy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The story, coming at the time the Senate is trying to find a way  
to end Clinton's impeachment trial, drew criticism from senators 
from both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that the timing was extremely unfortunate and that  
it was inappropriate to come out while the Senate is concluding the 
president's trial,'' said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly today denied Starr's office was  
the source of the story. ``We have no interest in interposing 
ourselves in the Senate's business,'' he said on ABC's ``Good 
Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr, asked outside his home if he planned to seek an  
indictment of the president, said, ``It is premature for us to be 
commenting at all on this, so we're not going to comment. There's a 
process that is under way and that process should go forward, the 
process that's under way in the U.S. Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors are questioning Ms. Lewinsky, a former White  
House intern and employee, as they enter the final phase of their 
attempt to prove that Clinton should be removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	The House prosecutors and White House lawyers each had four  
hours today to question Ms. Lewinsky about her affair with Clinton 
and charges that he committed perjury and obstructed justice in 
trying to conceal their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Her deposition was taking place in private, presided over by one  
Democratic and one Republican senator and videotaped for viewing by 
other senators. 
</P>
<P>
	The process will be repeated Tuesday when Clinton's close friend  
Vernon Jordan, who helped Ms. Lewinsky find a job, will be deposed; 
and on Wednesday, when White House aide Sidney Blumenthal will be 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want anybody to think there's some big bombshell out  
there,'' Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., one of the 13 House trial 
managers, said of his expectations from the Lewinsky testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	McCollum, interviewed on ``Fox News Sunday,'' said the  
prosecutors hoped to nail down ``beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
president committed a crime'' by trying to get Ms. Lewinsky to 
conceal gifts he had given her. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers argue that Ms. Lewinsky has testified under  
oath to a grand jury, FBI agents and Starr's investigators more 
than 20 times and has said consistently that she was never told to 
lie or offered a job to cover up the affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring some startling new revelation from the depositions,  
Senate Republicans and Democrats have agreed that the final vote in 
the trial should come Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a two-thirds majority of 67 to convict the president  
and remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said she did not know if either the perjury or  
obstruction of justice charge against Clinton would get even a 
simple majority vote. She said many senators felt the perjury 
allegation is particularly weak. 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, Collins, a moderate, is leading an effort to  
approve a ``finding of fact'' that would put the Senate on record 
as saying that Clinton, while not committing offenses that should 
lead to his removal, lied under oath. This ``increases the 
accountability of our decisions to our constituents and to future 
generations,'' she said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But senators from both parties expressed concern about the  
Senate overstepping its constitutional bounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a mistake and without authority for the Senate to  
act to find the president guilty of criminal conduct. Our role is 
to remove him from office, if he's guilty as charged by the 
House,'' Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said on CBS' ``Face the 
Nation.'' Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told NBC: ``This finding of 
fact is impeachment lite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is to resume Thursday, after senators have had a  
chance to review the three depositions. Only then will they decide 
whether any of those witnesses will be called for live testimony in 
the Senate chamber. Democrats are adamantly opposed to that, and 
some Republicans also have said that shouldn't be necessary unless 
new information comes out of the depositions that could change the 
course of the trial.

<HEADLINE> Kansas Falls Out of Top 25 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Connecticut's run as the No. 1 team in The Associated Press  
college basketball poll reached 10 weeks Monday, while Kansas was 
not in the Top 25 for the first time in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies (19-0), the nation's only unbeaten Division I team,  
were again the runaway choice, receiving 52 first-place votes and 
1,756 points from the national media panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (21-1) was No. 2 for the eighth straight week, getting the  
other 19 No. 1 votes and 1,720 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the Top 25 received a shakeup, with Kansas, which  
had been ranked for every poll since Jan. 29, 1991, dropping out 
along with Texas Christian and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The three newcomers were No. 20 Utah, which was ranked 10th in  
the preseason poll and for the first weeks of the regular season; 
No. 22 College of Charleston, which is ranked for the second time 
in school history; and No. 24 Missouri, which is back in the Top 25 
after a 3 1/2-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati moved up two spots to No. 3, while Stanford, which  
lost at Arizona on Thursday, dropped one place to fourth. Kentucky 
and Auburn each moved up one place to fifth and sixth, while 
Maryland, which lost by 13 points at Wake Forest, dropped from 
fourth to seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State and St. John's held on to Nos. 8 and 9, while  
Arizona moved back into the top 10 after the win over Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin was at No. 11 and followed by North Carolina, UCLA,  
Iowa, Ohio State, Syracuse, New Mexico, Purdue and Minnesota, which 
were tied for 18th, and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	The last five ranked teams were Indiana, Arkansas, College of  
Charleston, Missouri and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas (14-6) had lost three of four before beating Colorado at  
home on Saturday. The Jayhawks' run of 145 consecutive poll 
appearances was the third longest current streak behind the 156 of 
North Carolina and 154 of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a long time. I'm proud of that,'' Kansas coach Roy  
Williams said. ``But I truly don't think it will affect this team. 
I really don't. We play dumb on the court sometimes. But they're 
not dumb kids. And they realize that doesn't have anything to do 
with the way we play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to affect me whatsoever and I'd be shocked if  
they let it affect them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, at 66 consecutive polls, moved into third place  
followed by New Mexico at 50, and Duke and Stanford, both at 49. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah (16-4) moved into the Top 25, having not lost since the  
Texas game when they dropped to 5-4 and out of the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	College of Charleston (18-2) is ranked for just the second time  
in school history. The Cougars were in the Top 25 the last five 
weeks of the 1996-97 season and got as high as No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Both their losses were to Southeastern Conference teams --  
Georgia and South Carolina -- and their current 15-game winning 
streak started with a victory over North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri (15-4) was last ranked for the first six weeks of the  
1995-96 season and the Tigers came in having won three straight 
after consecutive losses to Kansas and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Christian (15-6) dropped from No. 24 after consecutive  
Western Athletic Conference losses to Tulsa and Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida (15-4) fell out from No. 25 after just one week in the  
poll, beating Alabama and then losing to Mississippi State.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Attorney Says Deal Violated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Boxer Mike Tyson's attorney and Montgomery  
County's new top prosecutor sparred Monday, arguing about a plea 
agreement reached by the two sides in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's attorney, Paul Kemp, said Montgomery County State's  
Attorney Douglas Gansler violated the deal, but Gansler denied the 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, the former heavyweight boxing champion agreed to  
plead no contest to two assault charges stemming from an August 
traffic accident in the Washington suburb of Gaithersburg, Md. 
Under a no contest plea, the defendant neither protests the charges 
nor admits guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, prosecutors waived the right to recommend the manner  
or length of ``executed incarceration'' that Tyson should serve. 
</P>
<P>
	In separate interviews, Kemp and Gansler agreed that executed  
incarceration can mean home detention and time served in a facility 
other than jail. But Kemp argues that Gansler has specified how he 
thinks Tyson should be punished. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's asked for jail time,'' Kemp said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gansler has said publicly, including in conversations with  
reporters, that Tyson should get jail time for allegedly punching 
and kicking two men involved in a minor traffic accident with 
Tyson's wife, Monica. But on Monday he denied using the phrase 
``jail time'' in court or in a memorandum to District Court Judge 
Stephen Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's 100 percent, categorically wrong. We've honored the  
agreement,'' Gansler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are requesting jail time, the word `jail' is taboo,''  
said Gansler. ``The word jail does not appear in our memorandum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler has been on the job since Jan. 4. The agreement with  
Tyson was negotiated by his predecessor, Robert Dean. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an agreement that I would have reached,'' Gansler  
said, adding that it hamstrings prosecutors. ``You can ask for 
incarceration but you can't ask for jail. That's a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's sentencing hearing is set for Feb. 5 in Montgomery  
County District Court. He could receive up to 20 years 
imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson also is on probation in Indiana for a 1992 rape  
conviction. Authorities there say they will wait for the conclusion 
of this case to decide whether he has violated that probation, 
scheduled to end in March.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sends Budget to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ushering in the new millennium with the  
promise of huge federal surpluses, President Clinton proposed on 
Monday a $1.77 trillion budget for the year 2000 that would 
buttress Social Security and bestow billions on everything from 
troops to teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans who control Congress immediately vowed to rework  
much of it. Staking out this year's political battlefield, they 
insisted that hundreds of billions of the $2.41 trillion in 
surpluses Clinton envisions over the next decade should be returned 
to Americans in tax-rate cuts, not used for new spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basic fairness dictates that some of this overpayment should  
go back to the taxpayers,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert of 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to invent programs to spend the surplus on,''  
said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists caution that a deep, protracted recession could erase  
the projected black ink, which began abruptly last year with a 
surplus of $69 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton exulted that after three decades of unremitting  
deficits, the mountains of money give Washington ``a special 
obligation'' to address problems gnawing at the country. He would 
not only brace the government for the looming retirement of 76 
million baby boomers, but reduce the $5.6 trillion national debt 
built over decades of federal borrowing -- and spend money for 
scores of other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a rare opportunity that comes along once in a blue  
moon to any group of Americans,'' Clinton said as he outlined his 
plan at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The partisan positioning underlined how even in a time of budget  
plenty, the two parties are largely continuing familiar appeals to 
their political bases. Democrats are rallying behind Social 
Security and expanded domestic spending, while Republicans are 
raising their twin banners of tax cuts and smaller government. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton would spend $39 billion more, or 2 percent more, than is  
planned for fiscal year 1999, which runs through Sept. 30. But 
thanks to the humming economy, he anticipates $77 billion more in 
federal revenue, allowing this year's expected $79 billion surplus 
to swell to $117 billion in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	If those numbers seem surreal, so did the juxtaposition of the  
day's two chief events: As the president was releasing his budget, 
lawyers from his Senate impeachment trial were in a Mayflower Hotel 
room blocks away, questioning Monica Lewinsky about her affair with 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment fallout could leave both sides eager to build  
records of legislative achievement, or it could make them eager to 
draw political distinctions as the 2000 elections approach. Initial 
signs pointed to confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans agreed with Clinton that most of the surpluses  
should be set aside to trim the national debt and strengthen Social 
Security. But the two sides are already fighting over how to do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Republicans want to use most of the remaining  
surpluses -- nearly $800 billion over 10 years -- largely to cut 
income tax rates, Clinton prefers aiming that money at Medicare, 
new retirement investment accounts, and defense and domestic 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all my years in Congress, I've never seen such a  
kitchen-sink approach to government,'' mocked tax-cut advocate Rep. 
Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin shot back, saying that reducing  
the federal debt is ``a far better use of the surplus than 
consuming it now with a tax cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than broadly trimming tax rates, Clinton proposed $36.2  
billion in narrowly targeted tax cuts over the next five years. 
They include a new $1,000 tax credit to help people afford 
long-term care for elderly or disabled relatives, and a credit of 
up to $500 for stay-at-home parents of babies under age 1. 
</P>
<P>
	But because budget rules require many spending increases to be  
paid for, Clinton would also raise taxes by $82 billion through 
2004. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest chunk -- $34.5 billion -- would come from boosting the  
current 24-cents-a-pack cigarette tax to 94 cents next year. That 
would include a new 55-cent increase, and accelerate an already 
approved boost that hasn't yet taken effect. Congress showed little 
taste for higher tobacco taxes last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget also assumes the federal government will pocket  
$18.9 billion through 2004 from legal settlements the 50 states 
have reached with the tobacco industry. But opposition in Congress 
and from states makes the fate of that proposal questionable as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the rest of the tax increases would affect businesses  
and investors -- and have been rejected before by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton would raise user fees on scores of federal activities by  
$25.8 billion over the next five years. The meat, poultry and egg 
industries would have to reimburse the government for inspections. 
And health-care providers would pay a new $1 fee for filing 
reimbursement claims on paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Clinton proposed at least $129 billion in new  
initiatives, both in new spending and tax cuts. He would: 
</P>
<P>
	--Gradually boost Pentagon spending, including giving military  
personnel their biggest pay boost in two decades, 4.4 percent, 
while increasing the money for anti-missile defense and weapons 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	--Provide $1.4 billion, $200 million above 1999, to continue  
hiring more elementary school teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Expand tax credits for child care by $6.3 billion over five  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Give the National Institutes of Health a $320 million boost to  
its $15.6 billion budget, a 2 percent increase that congressional 
Republicans will probably increase.

<HEADLINE> 4-year-Old Dies in Ala. Storm Drain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Searchers have found the body of a  
4-year-old girl who fell into a storm drain full of surging 
floodwaters and was swept through a sewer system into a 
rain-swollen creek. 
</P>
<P>
	Jasmine Moore's body was found by searchers using boats Sunday  
on a small island in Valley Creek. High runoff from a heavy rain 
had swept her more than five miles down the creek that winds 
through southwest Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's gone. That's all. My baby's gone,'' said Laverne Steele,  
Jasmine's grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives said Jasmine fell into the storm drain Friday evening  
after arriving at her aunt's apartment in Birmingham. Shortly after 
getting out of the car, she was walking near the 8-inch-high curb 
and fell into the drain, which some residents said was not securely 
covered. 
</P>
<P>
	Water rushes down the sloped street into an opening along the  
curb about 2 feet wide and 8 inches high. Well-wishers left flowers 
and stuffed animals atop the drain Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people joined the search for the little girl,  
described by family members as an outgoing, talkative child who 
loved to sing and clap at church. 
</P>
<P>
	The only sign of the child until Sunday was her brown coat,  
which caught in a tree branch along the creek less than a mile from 
where she disappeared. Family members had clung to hope that she 
might be found alive. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff's department said rescuers in boats found the body  
about 200 yards below a train trestle as the flooding began to 
recede. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our prayers are with members of the family during the  
difficult time,'' Birmingham Fire and Rescue Chief Raymond Brooks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The city planned to review records of complaints about the loose  
drain covering, city spokeswoman Felyicia Jerald said. But based on 
an initial review, ``we don't believe that the lid was actually out 
of place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said there is a 6-inch space between the 200-pound lid and  
the edge of the drain, enough space for someone to slide into, 
especially in wet conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Steele listened Sunday to an answering machine message  
Jasmine had left Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just calling to leave you a message. I want to see where  
you at,'' the child said on the recording. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the last voice of her I have,'' Mrs. Steele said.

<HEADLINE>  Lewinsky Finishes Deposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors and the White House legal  
team questioned Monica Lewinsky under oath today in a deposition 
for President Clinton's impeachment trial that lasted about five 
hours. The questioning, conducted privately at a hotel, concluded 
at midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Clinton's lawyer renewed complaints in court that  
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr was violating grand jury secrecy 
laws on a separate matter. Starr said he was ``deeply troubled'' by 
a weekend news report about his office and promised an internal 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This office has no desire to inject itself into the  
constitutional process under way in the Senate,'' Starr said, 
reacting to a New York Times report Sunday that his office had 
concluded it could indict the president while he was in office even 
if the Senate did not remove him. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators who monitored the videotaped deposition of Ms. Lewinsky  
at a Washington hotel emerged shortly after it ended but were 
barred by Senate rules from discussing anything they observed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deposition started at 9:03 this morning it concluded at  
3:14 this afternoon. We took several breaks during the day. There 
was a one-hour break for lunch,'' Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, 
explained. He said senators in the trial could begin viewing the 
deposition at 8 a.m. EST on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., and lawyers for Clinton questioned Ms.  
Lewinsky in the presidential suite of the Mayflower Hotel. The 
questioning took far less time than the eight hours that had been 
allotted by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Before turning to the extraordinary question-and-answer session,  
presidential lawyer David Kendall announced he was taking legal 
action against Starr concerning the weekend story. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall said he was filing a motion in U.S. District Court  
asking that Starr be required to show why he and his staff ``should 
not be held in contempt for improper violations of grand jury 
secrecy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's statement did not address whether anyone had talked to  
the newspaper. He promised an internal investigation ``to determine 
whether anyone in this office improperly disclosed information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The story, coming as the Senate is trying to find a way to end  
Clinton's impeachment trial, renewed complaints of leaks from 
Starr's office that go back to the early days of the Lewinsky 
inquiry. A special court official already is investigating whether 
Starr's office was the source of 24 news stories that a judge said 
were improper leaks. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest story drew criticism from senators from both parties.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that the timing was extremely unfortunate and that  
it was inappropriate to come out while the Senate is concluding the 
president's trial,'' said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors questioned Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House  
intern and employee, as they entered the final phase of their 
attempt to prove that Clinton should be removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	The House prosecutors and White House lawyers each had four  
hours today to question Ms. Lewinsky about her affair with Clinton 
and charges that he committed perjury and obstructed justice in 
trying to conceal their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Her deposition took place in private, presided over by one  
Democratic and one Republican senator and videotaped for viewing by 
other senators. 
</P>
<P>
	The process will be repeated Tuesday when Clinton's close friend  
Vernon Jordan, who helped Ms. Lewinsky find a job, will be deposed; 
and on Wednesday, when White House aide Sidney Blumenthal will be 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want anybody to think there's some big bombshell out  
there,'' Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., one of the 13 House trial 
managers, said of his expectations from the Lewinsky testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers argue that Ms. Lewinsky has testified under  
oath to a grand jury, FBI agents and Starr's investigators more 
than 20 times and has said consistently that she was never told to 
lie or offered a job to cover up the affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring some startling new revelation from the depositions,  
Senate Republicans and Democrats have agreed that the final vote in 
the trial should come Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a two-thirds majority of 67 to convict the president  
and remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said she did not know if either the perjury or  
obstruction of justice charge against Clinton would get even a 
simple majority vote. She said many senators felt the perjury 
allegation is particularly weak. 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, Collins, a moderate, is leading an effort to  
approve a ``finding of fact'' that would put the Senate on record 
as saying that Clinton, while not committing offenses that should 
lead to his removal, lied under oath. This ``increases the 
accountability of our decisions to our constituents and to future 
generations,'' she said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is to resume Thursday, after senators have had a  
chance to review the three depositions. Only then will they decide 
whether any of those witnesses will be called for live testimony in 
the Senate chamber. Democrats are adamantly opposed to that, and 
some Republicans also have said that shouldn't be necessary unless 
new information comes out of the depositions that could change the 
course of the trial.

<P>
	A broad ribbon of wet weather crawled across the East on Monday,  
spreading rain from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The rain was produced by a large area of low pressure moving  
slowly toward the east. 
</P>
<P>
	Showers and heavy rain were scattered from Michigan and Lake  
Erie southward through Indiana, Ohio, western Pennsylvania, West 
Virginia, and sections of Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, the 
Carolinas, Georgia and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Thunderstorms also were possible, and heavy downpours were  
possible in the Carolinas and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The rain turned to freezing rain in parts of the Appalachians,  
from Pennsylvania into West Virginia, eastern Tennessee and western 
North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	A weekend ice storm in northwest Texas left 2,000 residents  
without power on Monday. Police officers and volunteers trekked 
through the snow to deliver food and firewood to many of those left 
in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
	In the West, a cold front pushing through the Rockies produced  
scattered, light snow flurries from Idaho and Montana southward 
into parts of Wyoming, Utah and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	As much as a foot of snow was forecast in Utah's Wasatch range.  
</P>
<P>
	Light snow was possible on the western Plains as the cold front  
moved out of the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong, gusty wind also blew through the region, with gusts to  
40 mph reported at Cut Bank and Livingston, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	West of the Rockies, light rain was scattered around western  
sections of Oregon and Washington, with occasional snow in the 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, isolated areas of freezing drizzle, sleet and light  
snow were scattered from the eastern Dakotas across Minnesota into 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	A driver who stopped to help a motorist whose vehicle rolled  
over on an icy road in Kaukauna, Wis., was struck and killed by a 
parked truck that was hit by another vehicle.

<P>
	KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukrainian Prime Minister Valeriy  
Pustovoitenko will lead a government delegation to Washington on 
Tuesday for talks with International Monetary Fund and World Bank 
officials about the resumption of a vital $2.2 billion loan, the 
government said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	During his two-day visit, Pustovoitenko is scheduled to meet  
with IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and World Bank 
President James Wolfensohn. 
</P>
<P>
	Meetings are also scheduled with U.S. government officials  
including Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and a group of 
American businessmen, according to the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine urgently needs foreign aid, and the government has  
warned it may have to default on its 1999 foreign debt payments if 
it fails to attract new loans this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Soviet republic is due to repay around $2 billion to  
foreign lenders this year, but the country's National Bank has only 
half that amount in its reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF approved a three-year aid package to Ukraine in  
September, but froze it two months later. The fund said the 
government had failed to take steps to improve chronically poor tax 
collection or speed up reforms in the energy and agricultural 
sectors.

<HEADLINE> India Hikes Price of Cooking Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India sharply raised the price of  
cooking gas Monday -- the second blow in a week for millions of poor 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was designed to reduce pressure on the treasury, but it  
will increase tensions within the ruling coalition before the 
government presents its budget for the fiscal year beginning April 
1. The hike was announced late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of a bottle of gas -- the most common fuel for domestic  
cooking -- went up by about 12 percent. The government said that 
would reduce its annual subsidy by $950 million, to $4 billion 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, India raised the price of rice, wheat, sugar and  
fertilizer which are sold in government stores at reduced prices to 
anyone presenting a ration card. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue Secretary Vijay Kelkar said it was the first time since  
1994 that the Public Distribution System raised its prices, even 
though the government was paying as much as 66 percent more to buy 
the products on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cut in subsidy will send the right signal to the market.  
There is no question of a rollback,'' he told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one party in the 19-member coalition has threatened to  
withdraw its support unless the government reconsidered the 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Mamata Banerjee, leader of the Calcutta-based Trinamul Congress,  
was quoted by The Asian Age daily as saying the price increase 
``has hit the kitchen of the common people, and I cannot tolerate 
any such decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	India says its deficit for this year will be higher than  
planned, mainly because of a shortfall in revenue due to a slowdown 
in industrial growth. Most of the government's income is derived 
from customs and excise taxes.

managers, said of his expectations from the Lewinsky testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers argue that Ms. Lewinsky has testified under  
oath to a grand jury, FBI agents and Starr's investigators more 
than 20 times and has said consistently that she was never told to 
lie or offered a job to cover up the affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring some startling new revelation from the depositions,  
Senate Republicans and Democrats have agreed that the final vote in 
the trial should come Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a two-thirds majority of 67 to convict the president  
and remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said she did not know if either the perjury or  
obstruction of justice charge against Clinton would get even a 
simple majority vote. She said many senators felt the perjury 
allegation is particularly weak. 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, Collins, a moderate, is leading an effort to  
approve a ``finding of fact'' that would put the Senate on record 
as saying that Clinton, while not committing offenses that should 
lead to his removal, lied under oath. This ``increases the 
accountability of our decisions to our constituents and to future 
generations,'' she said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is to resume Thursday, after senators have had a  
chance to review the three depositions. Only then will they decide 
whether any of those witnesses will be called for live testimony in 
the Senate chamber. Democrats are adamantly opposed to that, and 
some Republicans also have said that shouldn't be necessary unless 
new information comes out of the depositions that could change the 
course of the trial.

<HEADLINE> Childbirth AIDS Treatment Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Researchers trying to reduce the cost of  
preventing AIDS among the world's poor have found that giving 
mothers standard medicines for just a week cuts the risk they will 
pass on the virus during childbirth by more than one-third. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have known for about five years that the drug AZT during  
pregnancy blocks HIV-infected mothers from giving the virus to 
their babies. However, such information is of little use in places 
such as Africa and India, where most mother-to-child transmission 
of AIDS occurs. 
</P>
<P>
	In wealthy countries, infected mothers typically receive five  
months of AZT, a treatment that can cost more than $1,000. Such 
therapy is impossible in places where even aspirin is unaffordable 
and prenatal care is unheard of. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors reported Monday that a far less intensive kind of  
treatment works reasonably well, even though not as effectively as 
the standard U.S. approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if we start treating very late in pregnancy, we can make  
a difference,'' said one of the researchers, Dr. Joseph Saba of the 
United Nations AIDS program. He presented the results at the 6th 
Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. 
</P>
<P>
	If this or some similar approach is tried, it could have a major  
impact on the spread of AIDS during childbirth, which now accounts 
for nearly 600,000 HIV infections around the world each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors experimented with three different regimens of two  
standard drugs -- AZT and 3TC. A comparison group received dummy 
placeboes. 
</P>
<P>
	The study shows that to work at all, the medicine must be given  
when labor starts, and it must be given to both mother and child 
for a week following birth. This is to protect the child from 
exposure to AIDS-contaminated blood and secretions, as well as from 
virus in breast milk, which causes about one-third of all AIDS 
infections in the young. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that when women got dummy pills, 17 percent of  
their babies were infected. By comparison: 
</P>
<P>
	--The infection rate was the same if the mother got AZT during  
labor but it was not given to both mother and child for the week 
following. 
</P>
<P>
	--The infection rate fell to 11 percent if the two drugs were  
given when labor started and continued for one week after birth. 
</P>
<P>
	--It was 9 percent if treatment began 26 weeks before delivery  
and continued for a week afterward. Those results were similar to a 
study last year from Thailand, which gave AZT for 26 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a step toward producing something less complex, less  
costly and that has a better chance of working in the less 
developed world,'' said Dr. Constance Benson of the University of 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Although even small amounts of AZT and 3TC are too expensive in  
the developing world at standard prices, that should change. Glaxo 
Wellcome, which combines the two drugs in a single pill called 
Combivir, said that in view of the latest findings, it will lower 
the price of the medicine when used for preventing mother-to-child 
transmission. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies like this have troubled some ethicists, who argue that  
giving placeboes when an effective treatment exists would be 
unethical in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Saba contended that without an untreated comparison  
group, the latest findings would be impossible to interpret. 
</P>
<P>
	Added another researcher, Dr. Bius Okong of Uganda: ``From the  
ethical point of view, we say, `Ethical for whom?' People in 
sub-Saharan Africa do not have access to these drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Dr. Peter Lurie of the Washington-based Public Citizen  
Health Research Group contended that the positive findings do not 
mean the studies were justifiable. 
</P>
<P>
	``This absolutely does not exonerate them,'' he said. ``They  
would have been able to show the effectiveness of these regimens 
without any comparison group, let alone a placebo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the New England Journal of Medicine released a study  
it plans to publish in April showing that combining AZT with 
Caesarean delivery reduces the risk of passing the virus to about 2 
percent. However, researchers caution that Caesareans are too risky 
in the developing world to be useful in reducing AIDS.

<HEADLINE> HMO Growth Helps Aetna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Driven by strong growth in its managed  
care business, Aetna's fourth-quarter earnings rose excluding 
one-time gains, as the nation's largest health maintenance 
organization beat Wall Street estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Before unusual gains, but including Year 2000 compliance costs,  
Aetna earned $154.2 million, or 98 cents per share in the fourth 
quarter. Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected Aetna 
to earn 96 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	When gains related to the sale of Aetna's individual life  
insurance business are included, Aetna's fourth-quarter 1998 net 
income totaled $202.5 million, down 24 percent from earnings of 
$273.9 million in the same quarter in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of  
Aetna slipped 3 percent, or $2.62 1/2, to $87.50. 
</P>
<P>
	Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $5.70 billion, up 19  
percent from $4.79 billion in the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna's Aetna-U.S. Healthcare's total managed care enrollment  
rose 18.7 percent to 13.2 million, including a 35.7 percent gain in 
HMO members. Aetna picked up 1.5 million HMO members with its 
purchase of NYLCare last July. In December, Aetna announced it was 
buying Prudential's health care business, which has about 2.7 
million HMO members. That deal, if completed, would make Aetna the 
nation's largest HMO. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna's health costs in caring for Medicare members increased  
moderately in the fourth quarter, as the insurer pent 92.6 cents of 
every premium dollar on health services in the fourth quarter, 
compared to 91.7 a year ago. Health costs in Aetna's commercial 
business remained stable in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	By adding members and controlling health spending, Aetna-U.S.  
Healthcare's earnings rose 40 percent in the fourth quarter to 
$122.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Aetna's net income totaled $848.1 million, or  
$5.41 per common share, compared to $901.1 million or $5.60 per 
common share in 1997. The 1998 figures reflect $134.9 million in 
capital gains on the sale of Aetna's interest in Travelers 
insurance company and $64 million on the sale of Aetna's individual 
life business. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 earnings reflect a net gain of $131.3 million, related  
to the sale of Aetna's interest in Travelers Property Casualty 
Corp.

<HEADLINE> Iowa Farms Reach New Low / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The numbers of farms and farmers in Iowa  
have dropped to new lows, according to preliminary figures from the 
1997 agricultural census. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa numbers, released Monday by the U.S. Department of  
Agriculture, exaggerate a much smaller nationwide trend toward 
fewer farms. The number of farms in the United States fell less 
than 1 percent between 1992 and 1997 to 1.91 million in the latest 
survey. The number of farmers also declined by less than 1 percent 
to 961,560. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iowa, there were 90,792 farms and 56,256 people who listed  
farming as their main occupation. The number of farms is down 6 
percent from the last survey in 1992, when there were 96,543 farms 
in Iowa. The number of farmers fell 16 percent from 66,885. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the amount of land being farmed in the state declined  
by a much smaller amount -- less than 1 percent to 31.16 million 
acres. And the size of the average farm in Iowa actually increased 
during the five years from 325 acres to 343 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Willis Goudy, chairman of the sociology department at Iowa State  
University, said the latest census confirms what early surveys have 
shown: As farmers continue to leave the industry, their farms are 
taken over by others whose businesses grow in size. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly is not slowing,'' Goudy said.  
</P>
<P>
	Goudy said the census shows that the number of farms in Iowa  
peaked in 1900, when there were 228,622 farms in the state, with an 
average size of 151 acres. That number fell for several years after 
that before increasing again to about 220,000 in 1935. The number 
of farms in Iowa has fallen with every survey since then, Goudy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Jolly, an Iowa State economics professor, said the surveys  
show a continuation of the trend toward larger, more consolidated 
businesses that has been a factor in the United States since the 
1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	``To put another perspective on it, people are leaving an  
occupation that generates lower returns for one that generates 
higher returns,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the biggest decreases in the latest survey came in the  
beleaguered hog industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of farms in Iowa selling hogs dropped 46 percent  
between 1992 and 1997, from 34,058 to 18,370. The number of U.S. 
farms selling hogs also plummeted by the same percentage during 
that period, falling from 188,167 to 102,106. 
</P>
<P>
	But the number of hogs being produced in the state and the  
nation increased during that time. Iowa produced 27.5 million hogs 
in 1997, up 2.6 percent from 26.8 million in 1992, according to the 
survey. U.S. hog production jumped 28 percent during that same time 
from 111.3 million in 1992 to 142.6 million in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Those changes came before hog prices plummeted late last year  
with a glut of hogs going to market. 
</P>
<P>
	``The restructuring of the pork industry has been actively under  
way for the last decade or so and we're really starting to see the 
impacts of that,'' Jolly said. 
</P>
<P>
	He has estimated that thousands more hog farmers could be forced  
out of business by continuing low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary census figures released Monday will be finalized  
in March, but Goudy said traditionally there is little change 
between the two sets of data. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census of Agriculture, conducted periodically since 1840,  
collects as much information as possible about each U.S. farm and 
farmer. This year, the Agriculture Department conducted the census 
for the first time. Previously, the Census Bureau handled the 
survey.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises vs. Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the euro Monday on a  
further sign of American economic strength, but the U.S. currency 
fell vs. the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was boosted against the euro after the National  
Association of Purchasing Management reported that U.S. 
manufacturing activity declined in January, but at a much slower 
pace than economists had predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The report added to recent signs of optimism for the U.S.  
economy, which have helped the dollar fend off worries about the 
effects of economic turmoil in Brazil -- one of America's most 
important trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen also rose against the euro, which helped the Japanese  
currency strengthen against the dollar in turn. Traders have been 
worried that the European Central Bank may cut interest rates in 
coming months, which has contributed to the euro's decline against 
the yen and the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.1297, down  
from $1.1345 late Friday. The dollar also was quoted at 115.08 
Japanese yen, down from 116.43. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4215 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4147, and 1.5085 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5108. The British 
pound fell to $1.6415 from $1.6461. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth 1.7313 German 
marks, up from 1.7238; 5.8072 French francs, up from 5.7803; and 
1,715.27 Italian lire, up from 1,706.48.

<HEADLINE> Florida Stopped From Selling Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Gov. Jeb Bush on Monday terminated a  
contract that would have sold photos and other information on state 
drivers to a company that plans to use the data as part of an 
anti-fraud tool for retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush canceled the contract with Image Data Inc. hours after a  
judge issued a temporary injunction ordering the state to stop 
selling information state licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am personally not comfortable with the state mandating  
license photos for the purpose of identifying authorized drivers 
and then selling those photos for a profit for a completely 
different purpose,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Image Data described its service as an anti-fraud weapon to help  
retailers prevent fraudulent check cashing and credit-card charges. 
The system would provide retailers with information to assist them 
in identifying customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nashua, N.H.-based company has similar contracts with  
Colorado and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has set up a pilot program with 10 retailers in  
South Carolina. But last week, in response to public outcry, the 
state sued to have the photos and other information returned. An 
injunction hearing is scheduled this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorna Christie, a spokeswoman for Image Data, said identity  
fraud costs Florida $570 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Image Data paid Florida $140,000 for demographic information on  
the licenses, said Janet Dennis, a spokeswoman for the Florida 
Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Robinson Could Have Charges Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Atlanta Falcons safety Eugene Robinson, arrested  
for soliciting an undercover police officer for sex the night 
before the Super Bowl, could have charges dropped through a 
diversion program. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will proceed against him like almost all people in his  
situation who get arrested for solicitation,'' Don Ungurait, a 
spokesman for the State Attorney's office in Miami-Dade County, 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there are no priors, it is certainly in the realm of  
probability that he will get an opportunity to go to a diversion 
program. ... If he was offered that type of program and he 
completed it, then the charges would be dropped against him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 35, got nabbed with about 25 others in a police sting  
targeting solicitation on Biscayne Boulevard, a major street in 
Miami frequented by prostitutes. He was driving alone in a rented 
car when he allegedly offered an undercover officer $40 for oral 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really believe and strongly believe I will be found innocent  
in this deal,'' Robinson said after the Falcons' 34-19 loss to the 
Denver Broncos in the Super Bowl on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson will probably be arraigned within the next 30 days. If  
he is not offered pre-trial intervention, the player could face a 
maximum penalty of about 60 days if convicted, Ungurait said. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest occurred about 12 hours after a Christian athletes  
group selected him the winner of an award for high moral character. 
His wife and children were in Miami at a nearby hotel for the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who also played in two Super Bowls with Green Bay,  
leads the NFL for interceptions among active players with 53. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to one of the arresting officers and he said that  
Eugene was an extremely nice guy. ... He didn't try to use who he 
was or anything like that,'' said Miami police spokesman Delrish 
Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, nicknamed ``The Prophet'' because of his deep  
religious beliefs, said he apologized to his family, his teammates 
and the entire organization for causing such a shocking distraction 
the night before the Falcons appeared in the NFL title game for the 
first time in their 33-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson broke up the first pass of the game but was later  
burned on the game's biggest play -- an 80-yard TD pass to Rod 
Smith. In the third quarter, Robinson broke his left pinkie trying 
to tackle Terrell Davis, limiting his effectiveness the rest of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a lot of people are saying that I'm just another  
hypocritical Christian,'' Robinson said. ``I deserve that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falcons coach Dan Reeves allowed Robinson to start the game,  
even though the player didn't sleep at all the night before the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``My major concern was whether he was going to be ready to play,  
and he said he was. I thought he did a good job,'' Reeves said.

<HEADLINE> Joetta Clark To Run in Millrose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nothing seems to keep Joetta Clark from the  
Millrose Games, not even a horrifying auto accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than five months after incurring a concussion, ripped and  
torn discs in her back, torn stomach muscles and an eye injury when 
bashed by an 18-wheeler truck, the 36-year-old Clark will compete 
in her 21st Millrose meet Friday night at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thankful just to be alive,'' Clark said Monday, recalling  
how she was pinned in her car last Sept. 15 when the truck hit her 
on an entrance to the New Jersey Turnpike. 
</P>
<P>
	``My car was spinning around on the turnpike. When it stopped  
and I opened my eyes, I could see the truck was jackknifing. I 
thought he would continue to hit me, but he got off me. 
</P>
<P>
	``The truck had merged into my lane in a no-merge lane,'' Clark  
said. ``I was sent backwards, down the highway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps there was not another collision because Clark's car was  
rolling, stopping after about 75 yards, backed up against a 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	As Clark was in tears, hemmed into her vehicle, two other  
drivers came to her rescue -- Howard Marcus of Colts Neck, N.J., and 
Gerry DeHaven of Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	A short time later, DeHaven recognized the injured driver of the  
car. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Are you Joetta Clark?' Can I have your autograph?'  
'' she said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	The badly battered Clark was pulled from her mangled car --  
``they couldn't get me out at first,'' she said -- and taken by 
ambulance to St. Elizabeth's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're pinned in your car like that ... and you try to  
move your leg and you can't ... and you try to move your arm and 
you can't ...'' the emotional Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miraculously, Clark was hospitalized for only one day, then  
returned home to Somerset, N.J., where she was headed before the 
accident, to recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think I would ever be able to do anything,'' Clark  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly didn't think I would be able to run in Millrose.  
First, there was the matter of just being able to walk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark was bedridden for three weeks. Her strong physical  
condition, which may have prevented her from being injured worse, 
was beneficial during her recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in such good shape at the time of the accident,'' Clark  
said. ``My years of training and my attitude made rehab much 
easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She is still in rehabilitation, with a therapist administering  
to her arms and legs for strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I still have headaches from my left eye hitting the  
window,'' Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite her weakened condition, Clark ``set her sights'' on  
running in Millrose at the end of October. She didn't resume 
jogging until just before Thanksgiving. On Jan. 6, she visited her 
brother J.J. Clark, her coach and a track coach at Florida. He told 
her she would be recovered well enough to run Millrose. 
</P>
<P>
	With that reassurance, Clark, a three-time Olympian who competed  
in her first Millrose Games in 1978 when she was a high school 
sophomore, concentrated on preparing for the meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, ranked fourth in the world in the women's 800 meters,  
will try for her seventh Millrose title, against a field that 
includes No. 6 Meredith Valmon, Alisa Harvey, Michelle DiMuro-Ave 
and China's Zhang Jian. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is going well with the rehab and the mental pain,''  
Clark said. ``I shouldn't have done a lot of things, but I did them 
anyway. The rehab has been harder than training. But I'm a tough 
competitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, she is confident.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm running to win and to run well,'' Clark said. ``To run  
just to run at this part of my career would be embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to run with aggressiveness and I want to run to show  
how thankful I am to all the people who helped me. This will be a 
thank you to them. I don't want people to think I'm here just to 
run in my 21st Millrose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A victory would make it even more special.  
</P>
<P>
	``A win probably would be the highlight of my career,'' Clark  
said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Begins Talks With IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's currency strengthened and  
markets calmed down today as a top official of the International 
Monetary Fund flew here to discuss ways to fix the nation's 
battered economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Fischer, the IMF's chief economist, is to meet with  
Finance Minister Pedro Malan on Tuesday in Brasilia, the capital. 
The talks could expedite release of the second installment of a 
$41.5 billion aid package. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Brazil received $9 billion from the IMF and used it  
to bolster its sagging currency reserves, now at $36 billion -- down 
from $74 billion last July. A second parcel might help restore the 
confidence of skittish investors. 
</P>
<P>
	But first the two sides must agree on how to stabilize the real,  
which has plunged since the government devalued the currency on 
Jan. 13 and then let it float freely. 
</P>
<P>
	The real traded at 1.98 to the dollar at midday, up from 2.06 at  
Friday's close. The currency has lost 39 percent of its value since 
the devaluations began. 
</P>
<P>
	The panic that gripped markets on Friday also subsided, after  
rumors that the government would freeze bank deposits sent 
Brazilians scurrying to withdraw their savings. Such a freeze was 
imposed in the early 1990s, leaving many unable to pay their bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan went on television and gave his ``word of honor'' that  
savings wouldn't be touched. ``There is no possibility whatever 
that the government would commit any such violence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Fernando Henrique Cardoso attributed Friday's panic to  
speculators in the futures market who profit when the real falls. 
Currency dealers on Friday confirmed that some banks were pushing 
the real down. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brazilians and the IMF have diverged on the best way to  
control inflation in the new era of the free-floating real. After 
reaching 2,700 percent in 1993, inflation plunged to near zero last 
year but now threatens to return. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF favors a sharp rise in interest rates to restrict the  
amount of money in circulation and avert speculation. The problem 
is that high interest rates will worsen the recession and the 
government's own spending deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Sunday at the World Economic Forum in Davos,  
Switzerland, Fischer said that the real has depreciated far beyond 
where it should, but said the country still needs a credible 
monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank on Monday raised its lending rate for banks for  
the fourth straight day. The new rate is 39 percent, up from 37 
percent on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's close to the ceiling of 41 percent set last month.  
Central Bank President Francisco Lopes said a special meeting could 
be convened to raise the limit. 
</P>
<P>
	An IMF team arrived in Brasilia over the weekend to review the  
terms of the aid package. Published reports said the 
Washington-based fund would likely urge Brazil to make deeper cuts 
in spending to reduce its budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the government shaved 5.8 billion reals, or about  
$2.9 billion, off the budget -- surpassing the target of 5 billion 
reals, or $2.5 billion. For 1999, Brazil has pledged to reduce its 
deficit by 28 billion reals, now worth about $14 billion.

<HEADLINE> Two UConn Starters To Miss Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Forward Richard Hamilton, No. 1  
Connecticut's leading scorer, and center Jake Voskuhl, the Huskies' 
leading rebounder, were both unable to play against No. 16 Syracuse 
on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies, at 19-0 the only remaining unbeaten Division I  
team, had the same starting lineup for the past 36 games, losing 
just two. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, the reigning Big East player of the year, has a  
bruised right thigh and is listed as day-to-day. The 6-foot-6 
junior is averaging 22.1 points and 4.8 rebounds. He was injured 
during the second half of Saturday's 78-74 victory over No. 9 St. 
John's. 
</P>
<P>
	Voskuhl, a 6-11 junior, has a stress fracture in his left foot  
and is out indefinitely. Voskuhl, who is averaging 6.5 points and 
7.2 rebounds, had the same injury in high school and the latest 
fracture was revealed through a bone scan on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the second game Hamilton has missed in his career  
because of an injury and the first for Voskuhl. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies play at No. 4 Stanford on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Chandler Falls Apart in Big Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Chris Chandler chuckled when someone pointed out --  
prior to the Super Bowl -- that his quarterback rating was higher 
than John Elway's over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out to be a prophetic gesture.  
</P>
<P>
	Elway looked every bit like a seasoned Super Bowl veteran in  
Denver's 34-19 victory over Atlanta on Sunday night, throwing for 
336 yards and winning the MVP award unanimously. Chandler? He 
looked every bit like a big-game neophyte, throwing three 
backbreaking interceptions in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterwards, Chandler admitted that the first Super Bowl of his  
11-year career was an experience like no other. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game itself is (just) a football game,'' Chandler said.  
``All the things surrounding it are a little bit new to me. How 
much of an effect that had, I don't know, but it was definitely 
something that I'd never had to deal with before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler, who looked so poised in the NFC championship game,  
once again resembled the journeyman who bounced around to five 
teams in his first nine seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could have done things better,'' Chandler said. ``But they  
did a good job covering things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Chandler and his teammates were new at all this, so maybe  
it was understandable they froze against the savvy Broncos, who won 
their second straight championship in their sixth Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler, who had thrown only 13 interceptions all season, was  
picked off on three straight possessions in the second half, the 
first two coming when there was still a glimmer of hope for the 
Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	With Atlanta trailing 17-6, Chandler moved the Falcons to the  
Denver 41 with a 19-yard pass to Tony Martin and a 12-yard run of 
his own. But Chandler was sacked for a 6-yard loss, then misfired 
on a pass over the middle that was picked off by Darrius Johnson 
and returned 28 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's Jason Elam missed his second straight field goal,  
keeping Atlanta hanging on by its fingertips. Once again, the 
Falcons couldn't maintain their grip. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler's pass was deflected at the line by Keith Traylor and  
landed right in the hands of Darrien Gordon, who returned it 58 
yards to set up a touchdown run by Howard Griffith. The score was 
24-6, the game was getting out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things were there for the taking,'' Chandler said. ``It was  
just unlucky things that happened. A guy tips a ball. You never 
plan on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler had one final chance, moving the Falcons to the Denver  
21. But there was a breakdown with Martin. The receiver ran a 
deeper route than Chandler expected, and the pass sailed to Gordon 
for another interception. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler leaped in the air in disbelief as Gordon ran the other  
way with a 50-yard return, leading to another TD. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was 100 percent miscommunication between myself and Tony,''  
Chandler said. ``Tony felt like he could beat him top deep and I 
thought he was going to be going at a sharper, flatter angle. And 
the only guy who was ready was Gordon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler also had to deal with the loss of his center, Robbie  
Tobeck, who was knocked out of the game late in the second quarter 
with a sprained knee ligament. He was replaced by Adam Schreiber, a 
15-year veteran whose main duty this season was snapping on punts 
and kicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never want to lose one of your starters,'' Chandler said.  
``Whether that had a big impact -- until you see the film, you have 
no idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobeck, who hobbled out of the locker room on crutches, doesn't  
expect the injury to require surgery. That was little consolation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating,'' he said. ``The biggest game of your life,  
and you feel like you let your teammates down. But what can you 
do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Chandler, after a vagabond career, finally found  
a home with the Falcons, who acquired him for mere fourth- and 
sixth-round draft picks prior to the 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he's been a Pro Bowler twice and actually posted  
better ratings the last two seasons than Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler's stature vaulted even higher when he threw for 340  
yards against the heavily favored Minnesota Vikings in the 
conference title game. He directed a game-tying touchdown drive 
with less than a minute to go in regulation, then drove the Falcons 
into range for the winning field goal in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	But the traits that made Chandler look like Elway II deserted  
him in the biggest game of his life. And the real thing walked off 
the field with another Super Bowl victory and the MVP award.

<HEADLINE> Eaton Buying Aeroquip-Vickers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Industrial systems maker Eaton Corp. is buying  
hydraulic equipment maker Aeroquip-Vickers Inc. for about $1.7 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Monday would expand Eaton's existing business  
by giving it the global leader in industrial hydraulics, said 
Stephen R. Hardis, Eaton's chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton's offer of $58 per share was a hefty 65 percent premium  
over Aeroquip-Vickers' closing price of $35.25 a share on Friday on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Monday on the NYSE, Aeroquip-Vickers stock climbed  
$20.68 3/4 a share, or 58 percent, to $55.93 3/4, while Eaton slumped 
$1.62 1/2 a share to $68. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton makes powertrain, hydraulic and electric distribution  
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Aeroquip-Vickers, which is based in the Toledo suburb of Maumee,  
includes Aeroquip Corp. and Vickers Inc. It has 15,000 employees 
and 50 plants in 15 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland-based Eaton makes powertrain, hydraulic and electric  
distribution systems. It employs 49,500 peoples in 155 plants in 25 
countries and had 1998 sales of $6.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Darryl F. Allen, chairman of Aeroquip-Vickers, said the combined  
company would be a stronger competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear that to successfully compete, a firm must supply  
complete product lines and global platforms,'' he said. ``At $2.2 
billion (in annual sales) Aeroquip-Vickers is too small to realize 
the full advantage of its strengths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Directors of both companies have approved the deal, which is  
subject to a vote by Aeroquip-Vickers stockholders.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T, Time Warner Strike Phone Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. has struck a deal to offer telephone  
service over Time Warner Inc.'s cable systems in 33 states, greatly 
escalating the long-distance phone company's move into local 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes as AT&AMP;T is close to completing its purchase of  
Time Warner's biggest rival in the cable TV industry, 
Tele-Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T had been widely reported to be talking with Time Warner  
about the possibility of offering phone service over its cable 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	In the deal announced today, AT&AMP;T and Time Warner expect to  
begin offering the new service in one or two cities by the end of 
1999 and begin broader commercial operations in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said today's deal, its acquisition of TCI and arrangements  
with other cable TV companies will give it the potential to supply 
local phone service to 40 percent of U.S. households, or 35 million 
homes, over the next four to five years. AT&AMP;T's acquisition of TCI 
is expected to be completed this spring. AT&AMP;T is talking with other 
cable operators about deals, but declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers will pay about 20 percent less for the venture's  
package of long-distance and local phone service than what other 
vendors could potentially offer, AT&AMP;T chief executive C. Michael 
Armstrong told industry analysts this morning. In addition to phone 
service, the new venture will offer interactive digital television 
and high-speed Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be the low-cost provider compared to any other way to  
deliver these services and we will be putting together more bundles 
on top of what we're announcing today,'' Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T shares, the nation's most widely held, were up as much as 3  
percent in early trading. The stock was up $1.81 1/4 at $92.56 1/4 in 
midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T will own slightly more than three-quarters of the joint  
venture and Time Warner the rest. AT&AMP;T estimates it will spend $600 
million on costs resulting from the venture in the first two years. 
In addition, it will spend between $300 and $500 to equip each home 
to handle telephone services over cable lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner will get monthly fees ranging from $1.50 to $6 per  
home over six years. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement is expected to have annual sales of $4 billion  
after three years. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has been spending furiously to break into the $110 billion  
local phone market at a time when its share of the long-distance 
business is slipping. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its planned acquisition of TCI, the nation's  
second-largest cable company, AT&AMP;T spent $11.3 billion last year on 
Teleport Communications, a smaller local phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T hopes consumers will be enticed by the convenience of  
receiving phone service channeled through the same cable TV 
circuits that deliver hundreds of channels, Internet access and 
online banking.

<HEADLINE> Death Occurs During NYC 911 Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Susan Ungvary instinctively called 911 when her  
boyfriend collapsed in her home. She got one busy signal after 
another -- the system had completely shut down, but she didn't know 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Frightened and confused, Ms. Ungvary -- barefoot in the 23-degree  
cold Sunday -- ran three blocks to a police station for help. When 
police and paramedics arrived, they couldn't revive John Audy. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old plumber from Vermont, in New York to celebrate  
his girlfriend's birthday, was pronounced dead Sunday morning. 
Authorities said he died of an apparent heart attack, but the 
medical examiner said more tests are needed to determine the cause 
of death. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, authorities were investigating whether an hour-long  
malfunctioning of the city's 911 system contributed to Audy's 
death. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani conceded the city may never know the 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do know the 911 system should have been working,'' Giuliani  
said. ``And since we'll never know, it's a shame and a tragedy that 
it happened that way. We'll use it as a motivation ... so we never 
have to face a situation like that again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City officials said they had reviewed each of the 75 medical  
calls that had come in during the failure and identified no other 
cases where a seriously injured person was left stranded. 
</P>
<P>
	The system completely shut down between 10:35 a.m. and 11:40  
a.m. Audy collapsed around 10:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is ingrained in you that if you need help, you dial 911,''  
Ms. Ungvary said. ``Maybe it wouldn't have made a difference, but 
now I'll never know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technicians had shut off power to the 911 center in Brooklyn as  
part of a routine test of emergency generators. The test has been 
performed four times a year since January 1996, when the 
computerized 911 system went on line. 
</P>
<P>
	The backup system that was supposed to forward 911 calls to  
police headquarters failed for an hour, and callers could not get 
through to emergency operators. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday -- her 40th birthday -- Ms. Ungvary spent the day in  
mourning. 
</P>
<P>
	Audy collapsed right after she had gotten out of the shower.  
</P>
<P>
	There were no signs that Audy was in ill health. Ms. Ungvary  
said he had chronic back problems but was very active. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was holding him, talking to him and calling 911,'' she said.  
``I was calling 911, and I was getting a busy signal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commissioner Howard Safir said city officials believe a  
surge in electricity occurred when a regulator on one of the 
generators failed. That sent a spike of power to the 911 system, 
which caused the software to go down, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The system does not automatically forward 911 calls when the  
computer is down. A city official has to order the calls forwarded, 
then the phone company -- Bell Atlantic -- must spend a few minutes 
reprogramming the lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is inter-related here,'' Giuliani said. ``You have  
the building, you have the police department, you have the 
software, and you have Bell Atlantic. Everybody could do a better 
job 
</P>
<P>
	On an average Sunday morning, about 500 calls are made to 911  
during the time the system was down. On a busy day, as many as 
30,000 calls can be received in 24 hours, police said.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Denver Broncos proved to be the better team,  
yet Ray Buchanan refused to say he was wrong for guaranteeing 
Atlanta would win the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to apologize. I had confidence that this  
football team could win. There was no doubt in my mind. I'll never 
take that back,'' the Falcons cornerback said after Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were ready to play. We were prepared. We went out there and  
fought hard. ... I'm going to keep my head up no matter what.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan engaged in a week-long verbal battle with Denver's  
Shannon Sharpe, who agreed with Buchanan that the two of them were 
just having fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no hard feelings. I said it all along -- I don't  
take it personally,'' Sharpe said. ``It's like a heavyweight fight. 
He was getting his team ready to go and I was getting my team ready 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we ultimately knew that Sunday would be the tale of the  
tape. You had to come out here and play hard. Give the Falcons 
credit. They have a great football team. But today we were able to 
hold on to the football and not turn it over. We made the bigger 
plays when it counted.''

</P>
<P>
	 *RUN SUPPORT:* Howard Griffith scored his first rushing  
touchdown since 1996. Then he scored another one. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran fullback gave the Denver Broncos a surprising spark  
with a pair of 1-yard TD runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Griff doesn't get enough credit for the job he does,'' running  
back Terrell Davis said. ``He likes to run the ball, but he doesn't 
beg for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, the NFL most valuable player, carried 25 times for 102  
yards. But it was Griffith that the Broncos turned to when they 
were near the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
	His first touchdown gave Denver the lead for good, 7-3. He  
scored again for a 24-6 lead on the first play of the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of the game plan was going to Howard on the goal line,''  
coach Mike Shanahan said. ``We felt like Atlanta did a great job on 
the goal line keying on the primary ball carrier. We tried to mix 
things up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith almost had a third touchdown. John Elway barely  
overthrew him on a potential 37-yard scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith carried only four times during the regular season. On  
Sunday he had four carries for 9 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	And 12 points.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *UPSET KICKERS:* It was not the best day on the job for Morten  
Andersen and Jason Elam, two of the NFL's most reliable kickers. 
</P>
<P>
	Andersen kicked two field goals, but missed a 26-yarder. Jason  
Elam was 2-for-4, but was unhappy because the 38- and 48-yarders he 
missed were well within his range. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to him briefly after the game, and he was not pleased  
with his performance either,'' Andersen said. ``But I can't be too 
concerned with Jason. He has had a great year. I am just going to 
learn from this experience personally and next time we are here, 
maybe we will handle it differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ELWAY RECORDS:* John Elway set two Super Bowl career records.  
</P>
<P>
	His 23rd pass was his 146th in five championships games, moving  
him ahead of Jim Kelly, who threw 145 in four Super Bowl 
appearances for the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway also threw his eighth interception, breaking the career  
mark he shared with Kelly and Craig Morton, who was intercepted 
seven times in two Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway became the oldest player to score a touchdown in the title  
game on a 3-yard run in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	FIVE-TIME LOSER:@ Cornelius Bennett couldn't hide his  
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta linebacker was on the losing Super Bowl team for the  
fifth time, and he conceded it hurt more than most people could 
imagine. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never get used to this losing,'' said the 12th-year pro,  
who appeared in four title games with the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm upset, but then again I'm very elated that I've had a  
chance to play in five Super Bowls, regardless of the outcomes. 
Yeah, I'll be the answer to a trivia question and all that. But 
I've had a very blessed career.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SPARKPLUG:* Falcons return man Tim Dwight scored Atlanta's  
first touchdown on a 94-yard kickoff return early in the fourth 
quarter. He returned five kicks for 210 yards, setting a Super Bowl 
record by averaging 42 yards per return. 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized himself, though, for not scoring earlier to give  
the team a spark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I could trade that last return for the first return,  
because we had a chance to break that one, too. I just couldn't get 
it through,'' Dwight said.

<HEADLINE> Massachusetts Utilities To Combine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- New England's electric industry continued its  
steady march toward consolidation as New England Electric System 
announced Monday it will buy Eastern Utilities Associates for $634 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	NEES said it will acquire all outstanding shares of EUA for at  
least $31 per share in cash, a 5 percent premium above EUA's 
closing price on Jan. 29, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which comes less than two months after NEES announced  
it would be acquired by National Grid Group of Coventry, England, 
creates the largest transmission company in Massachusetts and Rhode 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	More deals may be waiting in the wings.  
</P>
<P>
	``National Grid wanted to use the NEES acquisition as a  
beachhead for future acquisitions in the Northeast,'' said Rick 
Sergel, NEES president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the latest in a flurry of mergers since the state's  
electric restructuring law took effect on March 1, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``New England is a pretty Balkanized electric market,'' said  
Kennedy Maize, editor of Electricity Daily. ``They're trying to get 
all these little guys and mush them together and be big guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring law encourages the breakup of electric  
companies into separate transmission and generation companies. 
Transmission, or poles-and-wires, companies such as NEES remain 
regulated, while companies that own power plants are supposed to 
compete for customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition has emerged for some large electricity users, but  
few residential customers have a choice of electric providers. 
</P>
<P>
	NEES officials said the EUA deal does not depend upon the merger  
with National Grid, the world's largest independent transmission 
company, but has its full support. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, NEES sold its power plants to a subsidiary of San  
Francisco-based PG&AMP;E Corp. Proceeds from that deal will finance, in 
part, the EUA acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	Westboro-based NEES, New England's second largest utility,  
serves 1.3 million customers through its regulated electric 
companies in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	EUA, headquartered in Boston, serves approximately 300,000  
customers in southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergel will continue as chairman and CEO. Donald G. Pardus,  
chairman and CEO of EUA, and John Stevens, chief operating officer, 
will retire when the deal is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	NEES has agreed to honor EUA's labor contracts, but the new  
company will have approximately 250 fewer positions. The combined 
organization will have 4,100 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.  
</P>
<P>
	NEES is the holding company for Massachusetts Electric Co.,  
Nantucket Electric Co., Narragansett Electric Co. and Granite State 
Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
	EUA's subsidiaries include Eastern Edison Co., Blackstone Valley  
Electric Co. and Newport Electric Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of NEES rose 6 1/4  
cents to close at $49. Shares of EUA slipped 93 3/4 cents, about 3 
percent, to close at $28.62 1/2.

<HEADLINE> What Would You Do With $117 Billion? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Dick Clark's ``$100,000 Pyramid''? Amateur.  
</P>
<P>
	Cash-swollen Powerball jackpots? Mere chump change.  
</P>
<P>
	Publishers Clearing House sweepstakes? Clear 'em out. Time to  
play in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't hundreds of millions of dollars we're talking. It's  
not billions, or even tens of billions. No, President Clinton's 
2000 budget estimates -- get this -- $117 billion in surpluses, and 
he has ideas on how he wants to use it. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure he does. What American wouldn't?  
</P>
<P>
	Tom Spillane certainly did.  
</P>
<P>
	``Give it to me,'' a helpful (if hopeful) Spillane, 30, a  
construction worker from Melrose, Mass., suggested Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ideas run the gamut. Americans interviewed by The Associated  
Press had suggestions as varied as their fingerprints -- from social 
security to tax cuts to funding homeless and battered-women 
programs to investing it in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could spend that money on schools, from elementary to the  
college level,'' said Myrla Garcia, 23, a law firm courier who 
works in downtown El Paso, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could give the veterans back some of their benefits,''  
said Wes Backman, of Wilston, N.D. ``It seems like every time we 
turn around, they're taking some away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a surplus, then it's my money that they're trying to  
spend,'' said Ron Caldwell, 57, of Ohio, visiting his sister in 
Charleston, W.Va. ``So I would give a tax cut to everyone and spend 
the rest on health care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's projected $117 billion surplus for 2000 follows a  
projected $79 billion surplus this year and an actual $69 billion 
surplus in 1998, the first year the government finished in the 
black in 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The president wants to use 62 percent of the projected surpluses  
over the next 15 years to shore up Social Security. The rest, he 
proposes, should go to support Medicare, provide additional 
spending for the military and domestic programs and set up new 
retirement accounts. Republicans concur on Social Security but also 
advocate aggressive tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Admittedly, $117 billion is not the easiest number to  
comprehend, so consider this. It could: 
</P>
<P>
	--buy a 1999 Lexus RX300 for every one of Los Angeles' 3.5  
million residents. 
</P>
<P>
	--send every American to the next Super Bowl with a $400 ticket --  
if there were a stadium that big. 
</P>
<P>
	--buy an $11.5 million, 13-room apartment on Manhattan's Fifth  
Avenue for each of the 10,000 citizens of Monessen, an industrial 
town in western Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	--supply a copy of Stephen King's new $28 horror novel, ``Bag of  
Bones,'' for everyone in both Asia and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Or put it another way: Last year's Powerball jackpot of $295.7  
million, the largest ever, was just 1/400th of the projected 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Some advocated the fiscally safe route.  
</P>
<P>
	``Pay off our debts,'' said Jim Mahood, 38, of Morgantown,  
W.Va., during a midmorning supermarket stop. ``If I was in debt as 
much as our government is and I had a few dollars in my pocket, I 
wouldn't be spending it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Funny how that works for the rest of us, isn't it?'' agreed  
his wife, Tanana, 38. ``I would store it up for all of us old Baby 
Boomers. Social Security is going to need an infusion real soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security seemed to resonate, among both aging Baby  
Boomers and younger Americans who want to make sure ``people can 
have to something to retire on after we've worked a zillion 
years,'' said Kris Shropshire, 21, a medical lab courier in 
Cheyenne, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fix the roads or help the elderly,'' said Steve Harper, 37,  
also of Morgantown. ``It's a shame. Old people have nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bundling bouquets of irises and tiger lilies in downtown Los  
Angeles, flower cart vendor Ann Chatta wasn't too optimistic. She 
said the government should hang on to its money for as long as it 
can. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to keep it away from us anyway,'' she said. ``I  
just hope there's some left in Social Security when I retire.''

<HEADLINE>  Brazil Begins Talks With IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's currency strengthened and  
markets calmed down today as a top official of the International 
Monetary Fund flew here to discuss ways to fix the nation's 
battered economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Fischer, the IMF's chief economist, is to meet with  
Finance Minister Pedro Malan on Tuesday in Brasilia, the capital. 
The talks could expedite release of the second installment of a 
$41.5 billion aid package. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Brazil received $9 billion from the IMF and used it  
to bolster its sagging currency reserves, now at $36 billion -- down 
from $74 billion last July. A second parcel might help restore the 
confidence of skittish investors. 
</P>
<P>
	But first the two sides must agree on how to stabilize the real,  
which has plunged since the government devalued the currency on 
Jan. 13 and then let it float freely. 
</P>
<P>
	The real traded at 1.98 to the dollar at midday, up from 2.06 at  
Friday's close. The currency has lost 39 percent of its value since 
the devaluations began. 
</P>
<P>
	The panic that gripped markets on Friday also subsided, after  
rumors that the government would freeze bank deposits sent 
Brazilians scurrying to withdraw their savings. Such a freeze was 
imposed in the early 1990s, leaving many unable to pay their bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan went on television and gave his ``word of honor'' that  
savings wouldn't be touched. ``There is no possibility whatever 
that the government would commit any such violence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Fernando Henrique Cardoso attributed Friday's panic to  
speculators in the futures market who profit when the real falls. 
Currency dealers on Friday confirmed that some banks were pushing 
the real down. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brazilians and the IMF have diverged on the best way to  
control inflation in the new era of the free-floating real. After 
reaching 2,700 percent in 1993, inflation plunged to near zero last 
year but now threatens to return. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF favors a sharp rise in interest rates to restrict the  
amount of money in circulation and avert speculation. The problem 
is that high interest rates will worsen the recession and the 
government's own spending deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Sunday at the World Economic Forum in Davos,  
Switzerland, Fischer said that the real has depreciated far beyond 
where it should, but said the country still needs a credible 
monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank on Monday raised its lending rate for banks for  
the fourth straight day. The new rate is 39 percent, up from 37 
percent on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's close to the ceiling of 41 percent set last month.  
Central Bank President Francisco Lopes said a special meeting could 
be convened to raise the limit. 
</P>
<P>
	An IMF team arrived in Brasilia over the weekend to review the  
terms of the aid package. Published reports said the 
Washington-based fund would likely urge Brazil to make deeper cuts 
in spending to reduce its budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the government shaved 5.8 billion reals, or about  
$2.9 billion, off the budget -- surpassing the target of 5 billion 
reals, or $2.5 billion. For 1999, Brazil has pledged to reduce its 
deficit by 28 billion reals, now worth about $14 billion.

<HEADLINE> Africa Panel Probes Rwanda Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Nearly five years after at least 500,000  
people died in Rwanda's genocide, the Organization of African Unity 
has sent in a panel to determine how the slaughter occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-member OAU commission will meet government officials  
and genocide survivors, who accuse their African brothers and the 
United Nations of not doing enough to prevent the Hutu 
government-organized slaughter of minority Tutsis and politically 
moderate Hutus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The object of our visit to Rwanda is to come and meet the  
people of Rwanda and try to find out events which led to the 
genocide,'' said Ketumile Masire, the former president of Botswana 
who heads the panel. He said commission members will also visit 
France, Belgium, the United States and Canada and submit their 
findings to African heads of state. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, under the auspices of the 53-member OAU, was  
formed last June at the insistence of Prime Minister Menes Zenawi 
of Ethiopia. 
</P>
<P>
	OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said the commission will  
investigate the role of foreign powers and individuals in 1994 and 
propose measures to respond to any future threats of genocide in 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutus, who make up 85 percent of the population, had ruled  
Rwanda since its independence from Belgium in 1962. The killings 
ended in July 1994 after Tutsi-led rebels seized power and formed a 
government that included both Hutus and Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
	Rwanda in particular accuses France of arming and training  
members of the Hutu armed forces even as it became evident that 
Hutus were drawing up target lists of Tutsis and moderate Hutus -- 
most of whom were later killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Although stationed in Rwanda to implement a 1993 peace agreement  
between the Hutu government and the rebel Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic 
Front, U.N. peacekeepers did not intervene when the killings began. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who was head of  
U.N. peacekeeping operations at the time, said the international 
community had no will to send troops into combat. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the OAU team went to Nyamata, outside the Rwandan  
capital, Kigali, where thousands of Tutsis were killed with 
grenades, machetes and guns after being herded into a church. 
Skulls and bones have been left there as a memorial to the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Other commission members are Gen. Toumani Toure, a former  
president of Mali; Mohamed Bedjaou, Algeria's ex-chairman of the 
International Court of Justice; Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, a former 
U.N. official and onetime presidential candidate in Liberia; Lisbet 
Palme, wife of the assassinated Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme; 
H. Bagwati, a former chairman of India's Supreme Court; and UNICEF 
deputy chief Stephen Lewis of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Toure and Bedjaou did not come to Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> One Killed in Ford Plant Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- An explosion and fire Monday at a power  
station for a huge Ford Motor Co. plant killed one worker and 
injured several others as crews battled the blaze for hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Three workers were unaccounted for, the company said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's awful,'' Chairman William Clay Ford Jr. said. ``Everyone  
who works at Ford is an extended member of the family. This is the 
worst day of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fire broke out about 1 p.m. at the coal-fired plant at Ford's  
huge Rouge River Complex. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant produces electricity for the entire complex. It  
generates enough power to serve a city the size of Boston, Ford 
spokesman Michael Vaughn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the fire began, thick smoke and flames were still  
visible from the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakwood Hospital treated 11 patients from the fire and  
transferred 10 others elsewhere because of the severity of their 
burns, said Dr. Gary Christopher, director of emergency services at 
Oakwood. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those treated at Oakwood, six to eight had severe burns over  
60 percent to 80 percent of their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Several of these gentlemen were thrown by the blast and  
suffered various head injuries,'' Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garden City Hospital received one patient, public relations  
director Terry Carroll said. University of Michigan Hospital 
spokeswoman Carol Craig said it was expecting five patients, some 
from Oakwood, for its burn unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the fire was being investigated.  
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Michigan Consolidated Gas Co. said gas was  
shut off at the complex, a standard procedure, and there was no 
evidence the explosion was gas-related. 
</P>
<P>
	The Michigan Department of Consumer and Industry Services also  
sent two inspectors to the site, spokeswoman Maura Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hourly workers on duty at the complex were sent home while  
second shift workers were told not to report to work. About 4,000 
employees were there at the time, said Ford spokesman Jim Vella. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,100-acre Rouge facility was once the world's largest auto  
plant. Henry Ford built the plant in 1918 because he dreamed of 
building a car from start to finish in one location. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak in the 1940s, 85,000 people worked at the plant in  
Dearborn, about seven miles west of Detroit. About 10,000 people 
work at the six Ford factories still in operation at the Rouge, 
where Ford builds Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
	The complex has acres of vacant space, but remains Ford's  
largest concentration of employees and factories and houses several 
suppliers as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The power house where the fire broke out was built in 1921 and  
is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<HEADLINE> PBS Showcases Black Artists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Diminishing the accomplishments of 20th  
century black American artists would be impossible. Pick any field, 
find giants old and new. Music: Holiday, Marsalis. Literature: 
Hughes, Walker. Film: Micheaux, Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	But understanding the real depth of their achievements, and the  
pain and the pride they carried as they made their way in an often 
hostile society, is something only another artist can make us see 
and understand. 
</P>
<P>
	The thoughtful and moving new PBS documentary ``I'll Make Me a  
World: A Century of African-American Arts,'' had just such a 
creator. It was the final project of filmmaker Henry Hampton, who 
died last November from complications following lung cancer 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-hour film, which airs 9-11 p.m. EST Monday, Tuesday and  
Wednesday on public television stations, is a fitting cap to his 
rich legacy, which includes the acclaimed documentaries ``Eyes on 
the Prize'' and ``The Great Depression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll Make Me a World,'' narrated by actress-singer Vanessa L.  
Williams and co-produced by Hampton's Blackside Inc. and New York 
station Thirteen-WNET, does not attempt to sketch every black 
artist and artwork. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we were discussing how to tell this story it was put on  
the table that we could do ... sort of a flip-card approach to the 
whole century,'' said Sam Pollard, the film's co-executive 
producer. ``You know: There was Bert Williams, and there was Louis 
Armstrong, and there was Duke Ellington and there was (sculptor) 
Augusta Savage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But it wouldn't be storytelling,'' Pollard told reporters  
recently. And that, he said, was considered key to making a 
compelling film. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that we would maybe catch some flak for not doing Duke  
(Ellington), maybe catch some flak for not doing Billie (Holiday) 
... (but) we felt that if we found the right characters and we 
could tell really good, solid stories, it would bring to the fore 
people who had never had an opportunity to be seen by the general 
television public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So here's a chance to discover how the white abomination of  
performing in black face was turned around and made more positive 
by singer-dancer Bert Williams, who gave black face some measure of 
dignity on the stage in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	And to discover Savage, who lost a scholarship because her white  
co-recipients refused to travel to Paris with her. Undaunted, she 
went on to open an arts school in Harlem in the 1930s and become an 
acclaimed sculptor. 
</P>
<P>
	And to discover Oscar Micheaux, a failed farmer who turned his  
creative energy and entrepreneurial skills to writing, filming, 
distributing and promoting movies for the black audience. He 
focused a lens on how black Americans really lived, and depicted 
blacks with dignity and a realism that was absent in Hollywood's 
stereotypical portrayals of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that the public television audience, which has a large  
white viewership, will latch onto this series and see that, again, 
they need to understand that there's another part of American 
history that people don't see enough about, read enough about, or 
hear enough about,'' Pollard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program doesn't sacrifice subtlety for scope. For example,  
it addresses the black artists' challenge that is unknown to white 
counterparts -- creating work that reflects not merely an 
individual, but a greater community. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I get something in the Modern Art Museum, it's not to  
make me famous. It's that a black woman has now something in the 
Modern Art Museum,'' sculptor Elizabeth Catlett says in the film. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have rebelled at the idea of tailoring their art to public  
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We younger Negro artists now intend to express our individual  
dark-skinned selves without fear or shame,'' poet Langston Hughes 
wrote in 1926. ``If white people are pleased, we are glad. If they 
are not, it doesn't matter. We know we are beautiful. And ugly, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	``If colored people are pleased we are glad. If they are not,  
their displeasure doesn't matter either. We build our temples for 
tomorrow, strong as we know how. ....'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film opens with ``Lift Every Voice,'' which tells of  
vaudeville partners Williams and George Walker and their struggle 
to break through the stereotypes of the minstrel tradition early in 
the century. The beginning strains of jazz are heard in New 
Orleans, and the first dance fad hits America: the cakewalk, 
adapted from a step performed by slaves to mock the mincing steps 
of their plantation masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without Fear or Shame,'' the second hour, carries us from  
World War I through the Jazz Age and into the Depression. Taking 
part in the Harlem Renaissance are artists including novelists 
Dorothy West, Zora Neale Hurston and Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
	Blues singers Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey bring their Southern  
style of singing to the North as black artists once again change 
the rhythm of American life. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tuesday's segment, ``Bright Like a Sun'' and ``The Dream  
Keepers,'' the film moves through the 1940s and the '50s, 
celebrating the dynamic and controversial Paul Robeson, the 
breakthrough bebop of jazzmen Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker, 
and the impact of disintegrating racial barriers on the arts. 
</P>
<P>
	The careers of playwright Lorraine Hansberry, novelist James  
Baldwin and ballet dancers Delores Browne and Raven Wilkinson are 
detailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's concluding chapters are ``Not a Rhyme Time'' and  
``The Freedom You Will Take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former examines black artists' inroads in Hollywood, on  
Broadway and in popular music, with the soulful Motown sound 
dominating pop music. Gwendolyn Brooks explores new poetry forms 
and the Pulitzer Prize goes to Alice Walker (``The Color Purple''). 
</P>
<P>
	The final hour of ``Make Me a World'' (a title taken from a 1927  
James Weldon Johnson poem) examines contemporary culture and the 
transforming influence of black artists. Filmmakers Spike Lee and 
Julia Dash, dancer Judith Jamison and rapper Rakim are among those 
profiled. 
</P>
<P>
	The issues they face, it seems, are not so different from their  
cultural predecessors. White usurpation of black art is seen again 
and again through the years. And there is the special role the 
black artist plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always felt that you have to try to get the truth and let  
the chips fall where they may,'' Lee told reporters recently. ``We 
got a lot of criticism for 'School Daze.' People felt I was airing 
dirty laundry with stuff we did with that film. But I think you 
have to be an artist ....'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

	CARTOON WITH A MESSAGE: Cable's Disney Channel kicks off its  
Black History Month celebration with the premiere of the short 
animated feature, ``John Henry.'' Narrated by actor Denzel 
Washington and with music by B.B. King, the film tells of a black

have joined together to build a railroad. It shows at 7 p.m. EST

<HEADLINE> Gannett Earnings Rise on Ad Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Gannett Co.'s earnings rose 12 percent in  
the fourth quarter of 1998, boosted by strong advertising demand at 
USA Today and its other newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannett reported Monday it earned $257.7 million, or 92 cents  
per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 27, up from $230.4 million, or 
80 cents per share, during the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 5.5 percent to $1.39 billion from $1.32 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Gannett is the nation's second-largest newspaper publisher in  
terms of daily papers, trailing only Community Newspaper Holdings 
Inc., which has expanded rapidly in recent years. Gannett publishes 
75 daily papers, compared to 96 now published by Community 
Newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannett's earnings were just above analysts' expectations of 91  
cents per share, but the company's stock closed down $1.68 3/4 at 
$64.12 1/2 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of Gannett's divisions -- newspapers, broadcasting and cable  
systems -- reported higher earnings for the quarter and for all of 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterly earnings gain in the newspaper division was aided  
by advertising growth, stronger earnings at its flagship USA Today 
and continued growth at The Detroit News after a strike that ended 
in February 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasting earnings in the quarter were boosted by strong  
political advertising at Gannett's 21 television stations. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Gannett's earnings rose 40 percent to $999.9  
million, or $3.50 per share, from $712.7 million, or $2.50 per 
share, in 1997. Revenue rose 8 percent to $5.12 billion from $4.73 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 results include a special gain of $183.6 million from  
the sale of a security-alarm business and radio stations in 
Chicago, Dallas and Houston. Excluding the gain, earnings were 
still up 15 percent for the year.

<HEADLINE> Anti-AIDS Treatment Order is Fought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Eight-week-old Felix Tyson tested negative  
for the virus that causes AIDS, even though his mother is HIV 
positive. Now his parents are battling state authorities who have 
ordered the infant to take a regimen of drugs to fight the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge has given the state custody of Felix Tyson, ordered him  
six weeks of AZT treatments and barred his mother from 
breast-feeding him. 
</P>
<P>
	But the boy's parents, Kathleen and David Tyson, do not believe  
HIV causes AIDS and say that AZT not only is ineffective, it is 
toxic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Breast-feeding is simply better,'' said David Tyson, 47. ``It  
enhances the immune system, even if the mom is HIV-positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tyson, 38, tested positive for HIV last year. An early test  
found Felix was not infected with HIV, but tests on newborns are 
often unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking AZT as a preventative measure, even among HIV-negative  
newborns, greatly reduces their risk of contracting the virus 
through breast milk, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the state has custody, Felix remains in the family home,  
where his parents have been feeding the boy infant formula and 
giving him the treatments every six hours, as ordered. The state 
monitors treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 9, the couple will attend a hearing at Lane County  
Juvenile Court, hoping to regain full custody of their son. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are prepared to present volumes of material we've developed  
over this issue, and we hope the judge will make a landmark 
decision,'' David Tyson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tysons are enlisting Dr. David Rasnick, the leader of the  
handful of researchers who reject the prevailing medical view that 
HIV can be transmitted through breast milk, or question that it is 
the cause of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Most doctors say Rasnick, a visiting scientist at the University  
of California at Berkeley, is misguided at best, dangerous at 
worst. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is currently no reasonable doubt that AIDS is caused by  
HIV,'' said Dr. Paul Lewis, director of the pediatric HIV clinic at 
Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland. ``It is a disservice 
to men, women and children to say otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said AIDS has become ``the most heavily researched disease  
in the history of medicine'' and breast-feeding has become a 
well-documented method of transmission of HIV from mother to child. 
</P>
<P>
	The risk, Lewis said, ``is no longer in question.''

<HEADLINE> Rohm-Haas Buying Salt Maker Morton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Salt maker Morton International Inc. is being  
acquired by chemical giant Rohm and Haas in a $4.6 billion deal 
that will create the world's second-largest specialty chemical 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will have annual revenues of $6.5 billion,  
executives said Monday. About 1,150 jobs will be cut, contributing 
to annual cost savings of about $200 million, said J. Lawrence 
Wilson, chairman and chief executive of Rohm and Haas. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies now employ a combined work force of 23,000.  
</P>
<P>
	The deal is the latest in a series of recent acquisitions by  
Rohm and Haas, a Philadelphia-based manufacturer of chemicals found 
in products including paints, semiconductors and shampoos, with $4 
billion in annual sales. Just last week, it completed a $460 
million acquisition of specialty chemical maker LeaRonal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rohm and Haas will pay $4.6 billion in cash and stock, and will  
assume $268 million of Morton's debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Morton is perhaps best known for its salt, packaged in cartons  
with drawings of the Morton Salt umbrella girl, accompanied by the 
familiar slogan, ``When it rains, it pours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morton's salt business, which will represent 12 percent of the  
combined company's revenues, will retain its headquarters in 
Chicago, its home base since 1848. Morton had total annual sales of 
$2.5 billion for the fiscal year that ended June 30, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Morton's name will be attached to the salt business forever  
and ever. The other parts of the business will be integrated ... in 
a way that makes the most sense,'' Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company makes a wide range of specialty chemicals, which  
include additives that enhance the performance or quality of end 
products. For example, Morton's sodium borohydride is a bleaching 
agent used in the newspaper industry to make newspages whiter. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal ``will extend Rohm and Haas' technology platform beyond  
its premier position in acrylic chemistry and electronic 
materials,'' Wilson said. ``Morton's technology will add 
significant expertise in urethanes, powder coatings, plastic 
automotive coatings and inorganic chemistry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Morton was ripe for a takeover and described the  
acquisition as a good fit in a consolidating industry. Morton's 
stock price had dipped over the past year, making it an attractive 
target, said Robert Bartels, an industry analyst with William Blair 
&AMP; Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of both companies rose following the announcement of the  
deal. Morton rose $9.75, or 38 percent, to $35.62 1/2, and Rohm and 
Haas shares rose 75 cents, or 2 percent, to $31.75. 
</P>
<P>
	The magnitude of the Morton deal could hasten the pace of  
mergers in the industry, said Allan Cohen, an analyst with First 
Analysis in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Clariant, the Switzerland-based worldwide leader,  
with about $7 billion in annual sales, announced and then called 
off a merger with Ciba Specialty Chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Morton deal is unlikely to revive that pairing, but Cohen  
said the industry should expect to see additional acquisitions, 
although they may be smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson will remain chairman and chief executive officer of Rohm  
and Haas. S. Jay Stewart, Morton's chairman and chief executive, 
will become a vice chairman and will join the board of directors.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Aviators Try To Save Bar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- When Kent Bolin finished his last  
overseas tour with the Marine Corps in 1996 he went straight from 
Casablanca, Morocco, to Trader Jon's, stopping only to change 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The ramshackle bar, crammed with military memorabilia, has been  
a beacon for aviators at Pensacola Naval Air Station and other 
bases ever since Martin ``Trader Jon'' Weissman opened it in the 
early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got in about 11 o'clock at night, caught a cab and came over  
to see Trader,'' recalled Bolin, a helicopter pilot. ``He hugged me 
and welcomed me, ordered a pizza for me. I hadn't had American 
pizza in about eight months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three years later, Bolin is helping lead an effort by Trader's  
customers to raise money and buy the bar so they can keep it going 
just the way they remember it. 
</P>
<P>
	``A military guy is on the road and he's in and out and gone and  
all over the world so much,'' said retired Navy Cmdr. Bob Stumpf, a 
former leader of the Blue Angels precision flying team. ``This is 
one thing you could always count on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alas, no longer.  
</P>
<P>
	The impish Weissman, 83, who wore mismatched socks and offered a  
ridiculously huge, but never collected, reward to anyone catching 
him in a matched pair, suffered a stroke in October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Partly paralyzed and unable to speak clearly, Weissman can no  
longer run the bar. His wife, Jackii, 76, tried to keep it going, 
but it was too much for her. She closed Trader's late last year and 
put it up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not wanting to get rid of Trader's,'' Jackii Weissman  
said. But selling it is the only option because the couple's 
financial need. ``If there's some way they can help I would 
appreciate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bolin, a flight simulation consultant since retiring as a major,  
shudders at the thought of Trader's being permanently closed, 
perhaps torn down to make way for an office building or 
condominium. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's my worst nightmare,'' Bolin said.  
</P>
<P>
	Stumpf, now a Federal Express pilot, is confident, however, that  
it can be saved by The Trader Jon's Preservation Squadron, a 
nonprofit corporation that he and Bolin are leading. 
</P>
<P>
	``The appraisal's in and it's very reachable for us,'' he said,  
estimating the price at $350,000 to $400,000. ``We figure what we 
have now is good for a good solid down payment to make a bid and go 
from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Additional money would have to be raised to repair and refurbish  
the building. The plan is to contract out management with a 
requirement the main floor remain as is. 
</P>
<P>
	That means the pictures of aviators, astronauts and celebrity  
customers such as comedian Bob Hope, actor John Wayne and England's 
Prince Andrew would stay on the brick walls. The wing, rudder, 
helicopter blade and other aircraft pieces, the crash helmets and 
flight suits, the countless airplane models and other memorabilia 
also would remain. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolin and Stumpf envision turning the attic into a  
restaurant-bar that future aviators could decorate with their 
memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's historic,'' Stumpf said. ``It's established itself as  
probably the best-known aviation bar in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state already has recognized that by placing a historic  
marker in front of the 1898 building, previously a ship chandlery 
and shoe repair shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Helping the Weissmans also is a fundamental part of the  
Preservation Squadron's effort, probably equal to maintaining the 
bar, Stumpf said. That's why the fund raising has focused on the 
grassroots level. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want the people who Trader built the place for to buy it,''  
Bolin said. ``We're starting with folks whose pictures are up in 
the place, the common man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trader Jon's is a part of aviation's tradition and heritage,  
Stumpf said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are tired of seeing their traditions go down the  
tubes,'' he said. ``It's part of your heritage on the very light 
side of life, where you can unwind a little bit and relax, and not 
have to worry about political correctness or whatever.''

	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's domestic sales of new cars, trucks and  
buses fell for the 22nd straight month in January, dropping 6.2 
percent from a year earlier to 241,511, producers said Monday. 
</P>
<P>

638, the Japan Automobile Dealers Association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of passenger cars dropped 0.9 percent to 178,880.  
</P>
<P>
	Of the country's top auto manufacturers, Mitsubishi Motors Corp.  
suffered the most, with sales dropping 21.6 percent to 19,508 
vehicles. Of the leading producers, only Toyota's sales increased, 
by 0.2 percent to 94,985.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Bulls waived forwards Roy Rogers and  
Rob Werdann on Monday before their second exhibition game against

<P>
	Werdann was a free agent who played most recently in the CBA.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls' roster now stands at 17. The recent signings of

<HEADLINE> Grant Long Returns to Atlanta Hawks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Power forward Grant Long signed today with the  
Atlanta Hawks, returning to the team where he played for two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of his contract were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Long, who signed before today's practice, is  
expected to be Alan Henderson's backup. Henderson signed a 
seven-year, $45 million deal last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawks general manager Pete Babcock said Sunday that the team  
took a major step forward late last week when it signed free-agent 
forward LaPhonso Ellis, ``but we felt we had to bring in a player 
to back up Alan, but also someone who would be a great fit for our 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-9 Long came to Atlanta from Miami with shooting guard  
Steve Smith in a trade Nov. 7, 1994. Long averaged 11.8 points and 
7.5 rebounds his first season and 13.1 points and 9.6 rebounds in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks then dealt him to Detroit with Stacey Augmon to clear  
salary cap room for center Dikembe Mutombo. Long averaged 3.5 
points and 3.8 rebounds last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can play the way you like to play here,'' Long said.  
``Lenny (Wilkins) is that kind of coach. The players respond to him 
because of that and now he's got a deep team that can win a 
title.''

<HEADLINE> Manufacturing Declines in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Manufacturing activity continued to decline in  
January, but at a slower rate than in the last seven months, as 
global economic turmoil failed to crimp production and new orders. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management reported today  
its monthly index of business activity rose to 49.5 percent last 
month from 45.3 in December -- its lowest level since May 1991. The 
increase was bigger than economists had forecast, but any reading 
under 50 percent is a sign of contraction in the industrial sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``The manufacturing sector continued to contract in January,  
however, there are signs of encouragement as we finish up the 
eighth consecutive month of decline,'' said Norbert J. Ore, 
chairman of the organization's survey panel. ``Both production and 
new orders rose markedly possibly signaling that the manufacturing 
sector has bottomed out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While industrial activity has yet to snap its decline, the group  
said the overall economy continued to grow for a 93rd straight 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The private group's report is compiled from a survey of  
corporate purchasing executives nationwide. It is widely followed 
by economists because it is usually the first indicator of how the 
economy performed in the previous month.

<HEADLINE> Denver Defense Stymies Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Denver Broncos' 15-point margin of victory is  
misleading, because the Atlanta Falcons came close. 
</P>
<P>
	Six times, in fact, they came close. Denver stopped half a dozen  
Atlanta drives inside the 30-yard line, and that was the difference 
in Sunday's Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what you've got to do -- you've got to keep them from  
scoring touchdowns,'' Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski said. ``We 
preach that, and we live it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Darrien Gordon stopped two scoring threats with interceptions.  
Keith Traylor's deflection set up one of the interceptions, and he 
stuffed Jamal Anderson on fourth-and-1. 
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest momentum swing in the Broncos' 34-19 victory  
came when Morten Andersen hooked a 26-yard field goal attempt wide 
right, ending his streak of 13 consecutive field goals made in 
postseason. On the next play, John Elway hit Rod Smith with an 
80-yard touchdown pass, giving Denver a 17-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``That takes the air out of your balloon,'' Atlanta receiver Tim  
Dwight said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons had a chance to close the gap in the third period,  
reaching the Broncos' 21-yard line, but Gordon intercepted a Chris 
Chandler pass deflected by Traylor and returned it 58 yards, 
setting up a touchdown to make the score 24-6. 
</P>
<P>
	If not for the tip, Chandler said, the pass might have gone for  
a touchdown to Terance Mathis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was going to be a big play,'' Chandler said. ``If he  
doesn't score, it's going to be close. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were things there for the taking. It was just unlucky  
things that happened. A tipped ball -- you never plan on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon intercepted Chandler again on the next possession after  
Atlanta reached the Denver 26. Gordon sparked a pass defense that 
ranked 26th in the NFL and was considered the Broncos' weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took a lot of criticism as a defense, particularly in the  
secondary,'' he said. ``The bottom line is that we don't give up a 
lot of points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We said at halftime, `Let's blow these guys out,''' Romanowski  
said. ``But they kept hanging around until we gave the ball back to 
our offense, and the offense kept doing great things. 
</P>
<P>
	``It comes down to the red zone, and we stopped them from  
getting touchdowns, and that gets frustrating for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first half, the Falcons ran more plays and had a  
three-minute advantage in time of possession. But they trailed 17-6 
at halftime because four scoring threats produced merely two field 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson was stopped on a fourth-and-1 sweep at the Denver 26,  
and two other times the Falcons drove inside the 15 before settling 
for three points. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta drove 55 yards to the 8 on the first possession of the  
game before Romanowski sacked Chandler on third-and-goal. Andersen 
then kicked a 32-yard field goal for the Falcons' only lead, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys were kind of ripping us apart early,'' Traylor  
said. ``It was nothing but jitters, and we knew that. Everybody was 
a little tight, and we had to calm down a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Denver went ahead 7-3, Atlanta came up with the game's  
first turnover when a pass bounced out of the hands of Shannon 
Sharpe and Ronnie Bradford intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
	The break was good for a first down at the Denver 35, but the  
Falcons failed to take advantage. Glenn Cadrez stopped Anderson for 
no gain on third-and-1, and Traylor stuffed Anderson for a 2-yard 
loss on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our stars are on offense, so they're going to get the  
attention,'' Romanowski said. ``As a defensive player, you realize 
that's life. But defense wins championships.''

<HEADLINE>  Brazil-IMF Talks Calm Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's currency strengthened and  
markets calmed down Monday as a top official of the International 
Monetary Fund flew here to discuss ways to fix the nation's 
battered economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Fischer, the IMF's chief economist, is to meet with  
Finance Minister Pedro Malan on Tuesday in Brasilia, the capital. 
The talks could expedite release of the second installment of a 
$41.5 billion aid package. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Brazil received $9 billion from the IMF and used it  
to bolster its sagging currency reserves, now at $36 billion -- down 
from $74 billion last July. A second parcel might help restore the 
confidence of skittish investors. 
</P>
<P>
	But first the two sides must agree on how to stabilize the real,  
which has plunged since the government devalued the currency on 
Jan. 13 and then let it float freely. 
</P>
<P>
	The real closed stronger Monday at 1.91 to the dollar, up from  
2.06 at Friday's close. The currency has lost 39 percent of its 
value since the devaluations began. 
</P>
<P>
	The panic that gripped markets on Friday also subsided, after  
rumors that the government would freeze bank deposits sent 
Brazilians scurrying to withdraw their savings. Such a freeze was 
imposed in the early 1990s, leaving many unable to pay their bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan went on television and gave his ``word of honor'' that  
savings wouldn't be touched. ``There is no possibility whatever 
that the government would commit any such violence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When those rumors proved not to be true Monday, the Sao Paulo  
Stock Exchange, Latin America's largest, rose substantially, 
closing up 8.80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	President Fernando Henrique Cardoso attributed Friday's panic to  
speculators in the futures market who profit when the real falls. 
Currency dealers on Friday confirmed that some banks were pushing 
the real down. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brazilians and the IMF have diverged on the best way to  
control inflation in the new era of the free-floating real. After 
reaching 2,700 percent in 1993, inflation plunged to near zero last 
year but now threatens to return. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF favors a sharp rise in interest rates to restrict the  
amount of money in circulation and avert speculation. The problem 
is that high interest rates will worsen the recession and the 
government's own spending deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Sunday at the World Economic Forum in Davos,  
Switzerland, Fischer said that the real has depreciated far beyond 
where it should, but said the country still needs a credible 
monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank on Monday raised its lending rate for banks for  
the fourth straight day. The new rate is 39 percent, up from 37 
percent on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's close to the ceiling of 41 percent set last month.  
Central Bank President Francisco Lopes said a special meeting could 
be convened to raise the limit. 
</P>
<P>
	An IMF team arrived in Brasilia over the weekend to review the  
terms of the aid package. Published reports said the 
Washington-based fund would likely urge Brazil to make deeper cuts 
in spending to reduce its budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the government shaved 5.8 billion reals, or about  
$2.9 billion, off the budget -- surpassing the target of 5 billion 
reals, or $2.5 billion. For 1999, Brazil has pledged to reduce its 
deficit by 28 billion reals, now worth about $14 billion.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Gather to Question Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors and the White House legal  
team questioned Monica Lewinsky under oath today in a deposition 
for President Clinton's impeachment trial. The questioning, 
conducted privately at a hotel, continued into the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Clinton's lawyer renewed complaints in court that  
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr was violating grand jury secrecy 
laws on a separate matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., and presidential lawyers Cheryl Mills,  
Nicole Seligman and David Kendall were at the Mayflower Hotel for 
the videotaped deposition of the former intern. 
</P>
<P>
	The doors closed at 9 a.m. EST for the questioning that could  
last as long as eight hours. After a short midmorning break the 
deposition resumed and was continuing past noon. Dozens of 
reporters and camera crews were outside on a chilly, sunny day. 
Police closed off a side street running past one of the hotel's 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
	Before turning to the extraordinary question-and-answer session,  
Kendall announced he was taking legal action against Starr 
concerning a weekend story in The New York Times that the 
independent counsel had concluded that a grand jury could indict 
Clinton while he was still in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall said he was filing a motion in U.S. District Court  
asking that Starr be required to show why he and his staff ``should 
not be held in contempt for improper violations of grand jury 
secrecy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The story, coming at the time the Senate is trying to find a way  
to end Clinton's impeachment trial, drew criticism from senators 
from both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that the timing was extremely unfortunate and that  
it was inappropriate to come out while the Senate is concluding the 
president's trial,'' said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly today denied Starr's office was  
the source of the story. ``We have no interest in interposing 
ourselves in the Senate's business,'' he said on ABC's ``Good 
Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr, asked outside his home if he planned to seek an  
indictment of the president, said, ``It is premature for us to be 
commenting at all on this, so we're not going to comment. There's a 
process that is under way and that process should go forward, the 
process that's under way in the U.S. Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors are questioning Ms. Lewinsky, a former White  
House intern and employee, as they enter the final phase of their 
attempt to prove that Clinton should be removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	The House prosecutors and White House lawyers each had four  
hours today to question Ms. Lewinsky about her affair with Clinton 
and charges that he committed perjury and obstructed justice in 
trying to conceal their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Her deposition was taking place in private, presided over by one  
Democratic and one Republican senator and videotaped for viewing by 
other senators. 
</P>
<P>
	The process will be repeated Tuesday when Clinton's close friend  
Vernon Jordan, who helped Ms. Lewinsky find a job, will be deposed; 
and on Wednesday, when White House aide Sidney Blumenthal will be 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want anybody to think there's some big bombshell out  
there,'' Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., one of the 13 House trial 
managers, said of his expectations from the Lewinsky testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	McCollum, interviewed on ``Fox News Sunday,'' said the  
prosecutors hoped to nail down ``beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
president committed a crime'' by trying to get Ms. Lewinsky to 
conceal gifts he had given her. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers argue that Ms. Lewinsky has testified under  
oath to a grand jury, FBI agents and Starr's investigators more 
than 20 times and has said consistently that she was never told to 
lie or offered a job to cover up the affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring some startling new revelation from the depositions,  
Senate Republicans and Democrats have agreed that the final vote in 
the trial should come Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a two-thirds majority of 67 to convict the president  
and remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said she did not know if either the perjury or  
obstruction of justice charge against Clinton would get even a 
simple majority vote. She said many senators felt the perjury 
allegation is particularly weak. 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, Collins, a moderate, is leading an effort to  
approve a ``finding of fact'' that would put the Senate on record 
as saying that Clinton, while not committing offenses that should 
lead to his removal, lied under oath. This ``increases the 
accountability of our decisions to our constituents and to future 
generations,'' she said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But senators from both parties expressed concern about the  
Senate overstepping its constitutional bounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a mistake and without authority for the Senate to  
act to find the president guilty of criminal conduct. Our role is 
to remove him from office, if he's guilty as charged by the 
House,'' Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said on CBS' ``Face the 
Nation.'' Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told NBC: ``This finding of 
fact is impeachment lite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is to resume Thursday, after senators have had a  
chance to review the three depositions. Only then will they decide 
whether any of those witnesses will be called for live testimony in 
the Senate chamber. Democrats are adamantly opposed to that, and 
some Republicans also have said that shouldn't be necessary unless 
new information comes out of the depositions that could change the 
course of the trial.

<HEADLINE> Rep. King Claims He Was Threatened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- GOP Rep. Peter King of New York has written  
some constituents that ``threats were made against me by the 
Republican leadership'' in connection with his vote on an 
impeachment-related roll call in the House last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret that Congressional Republicans were so blinded by  
their opposition to President Clinton that they voted to impeach 
him rather than stand by the traditional principles of their 
party,'' the independent-minded New York lawmaker wrote recently. 
``I also regret that threats were made against me by the Republican 
leadership in an attempt to keep me from voting my conscience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press obtained a copy of one letter, dated two  
weeks ago and written to a correspondent who had evidently 
contacted King to express his support for the congressman's vote 
against impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	King volunteered that he believed that House Speaker Dennis  
Hastert, R-Ill., had played no role in the threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he indicated that Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the GOP  
whip, had sought to retaliate. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview, King said his claim of threats rested  
on the publication late last year of a story in which an unnamed 
GOP leadership aide was quoted as saying the next two years would 
be difficult for the congressman if he bucked the party on a key 
procedural vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next day a congressman who is a representative of the  
leadership came to me and said they were expecting me to vote with 
the party,'' King said in the interview. ``I said I wouldn't, it 
was a matter of conscience and if there was ever any thought there 
was a chance, it ended'' with the published comment by the unnamed 
leadership aide. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one ever took the threat back,'' he said. ``They had three  
or four days after that to say it was inaccurate. So as far as I 
was concerned they were sending a threat and I was sending it back 
to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King said that he subsequently heard that DeLay had sought a few  
weeks later to deny him a subcommittee chairmanship he was in line 
for. He said he had been told that DeLay tried to change seniority 
rules to allow Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, to jump ahead and claim the 
subcommittee post. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm concerned (it was) a direct shot from DeLay,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Scanlon, a spokesman for DeLay, said, ``Pete King has a  
reputation as making things up, and this is no different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``It's not worth it to approach Pete King on anything,  
whether it be a procedural vote on impeachment or a vote on a tax 
bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scanlon did not deny, however, that DeLay had interceded on  
behalf of Paul, a fellow Texan. 
</P>
<P>
	The roll call vote at issue concerned a Democratic proposal to  
permit a House vote on censure as an alternative to impeachment of 
President Clinton. Republicans used their majority muscle to deny 
Democrats a censure vote, but on a key procedural vote, King sided 
with the Democrats.

<HEADLINE> 4,000 Brazilian Ford Workers Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Some 4,000 workers at the Brazilian  
subsidiary of Ford Motor Company walked off their jobs Monday, 
preventing the carmaker from resuming production, which has been 
stalled for more than one month. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike was intended to pressure Ford to reconsider its  
dismissal of nearly 3,000 workers who were laid off shortly before 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	For almost two weeks in early January, laid-off workers showed  
up inside the plants, quietly protesting the job cuts. On Jan. 17, 
Ford shut down its plant, saying it would resume production on 
Feb.1. 
</P>
<P>
	Production at Ford has been stopped since Dec. 21, when year-end  
vacations began. It was supposed to resume Jan. 4, but because of 
the daily presence of the laid off workers inside the factory, the 
company refused to activate the assembly lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Metalworkers Union of Sao Bernardo do Campo, the Sao Paulo  
industrial suburb where the Ford Plant is located, has turned down 
the company's offer to pay each worker two months' severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford was not available for immediate comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The union wants Ford to consider alternatives such as a shorter  
work week, a cut in pay and a voluntary retirement plan. 
</P>
<P>
	He said workers would decide on Tuesday morning whether or not  
they would continue on strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said the job cuts were necessary due to reduced demand.  
Brazil's auto industry has seen sales plummet since the first 
effects of financial turmoil in Asia reached the country. Brazil's 
escalating financial troubles are unlikely to prompt any reversal.

<HEADLINE> Nomura May Sell Brokerage Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nomura Securities Co., Japan's largest brokerage,  
said Monday it is considering selling its stake in the thriving 
Kokusai Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has yet to decide details such as when and how much  
to sell in Kokusai, a Nomura spokeswoman said. The brokerage is now 
owned 34 percent by Nomura Securities and its group companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been considering selling Kokusai and other group  
shareholdings for about one year,'' the spokeswoman said, speaking 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Local media, including the nationwide Asahi newspaper, said over  
the weekend that Nomura is talking with several major financial 
institutions about abandoning its stake in Kokusai. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is seen as part of Nomura's restructuring steps to help  
improve the parent company's financial position, which has suffered 
from massive trading losses overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomura reported 207.2 billion yen ($1.80 billion) in losses for  
the first half of fiscal 1998. Nomura has also announced to 
eliminate 2,000 jobs out of its current 13,000-strong workforce by 
2001 to cope with the recession at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Backed by its robust growth, Kokusai's stock has made it one of  
the highest priced in the securities sector on the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange's first section. Kokusai has registered three consecutive 
years of growth in pretax profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Kokusai's stocks closed at 990 yen ($8.60) per share at the end  
of Monday's morning trading, down 12 yen (10 cents), or 0.01 
percent, from Friday's finish. Nomura's stocks ended at 982 yen 
($8.50) per share, down 32 yen (28 cents), or 0.03 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Johnny Depp was back to his bad-boy ways when he  
chased off photographers with a piece of wood outside a trendy 
restaurant, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police held the actor for almost four hours after the fracas  
Sunday at Mirabelle, where he had dined with French actress Vanessa 
Paradis, newspapers reported.

<P>
	Monday's newspapers carried photos of Depp clutching the wood,  
being questioned by police and being taken into custody. The Sun 
tabloid reported that Depp ``flipped out'' and started screaming 
obscenities when photographers tried to take his picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Johnny Depp is a person who guards his privacy. He had asked  
photographers to abstain from photographing him. Unfortunately, 
they persisted and intentionally provoked him,'' Depp's publicist 
Leslee Dart said in a statement.

He's in London working on ``Sleepy Hollow.''

<HEADLINE>  Two French Banks To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Societe Generale is buying Paribas for $17.07  
billion in stock to combine two French banking powerhouses and 
better compete in a European market that has a new common currency 
and fewer barriers to financial trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Monday will create Europe's second-largest  
bank and came at a time when French banks have been criticized for 
being slow to react to the industry consolidation across the 
continent. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks in Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and Spain have all recently  
announced major combinations. 
</P>
<P>
	``France was behind its European neighbors in terms of  
consolidation, so it was clear that one day or another French banks 
would have to merge,'' said Yves Burger, a banking analyst at 
Standard and Poor's in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the alliance could speed up banking consolidation  
in France. 
</P>
<P>
	Banque National de Paris, for example, will likely feel pressure  
now to find a partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``BNP basically has its back against the wall, because it's now  
about half the size of the new group,'' said Philippe Ricarte, a 
banking analyst at KBC Securities France. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined Societe Generale, a banking group, and Paribas, an  
investment bank, will be called SG Paribas. Societe Generale is 
ranked 11th in the world in terms of assets and Paribas is 25th, 
according to BankWatch Inc., a New York-based bank credit 
evaluator. In terms of assets, the new SG Paribas would rank second 
in Europe only to UBS AG, the Swiss bank formed last year by the 
merger of Swiss Bank Corp. and Union Bank of Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	SG Paribas will be a leader in international investment banking  
activities, ranking among the world's leaders in underwriting 
European bonds, financing trade and dealing in complex investments 
known as derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is positive,'' said Mark Hoge, a bank analyst with Credit  
Suisse First Boston in London. ``Many people were looking for 
something to happen to Paribas for some time. And regardless what 
Paribas was saying to the market, there was a pretty strong 
conviction it wouldn't survive over the long term on its own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn welcomed the  
merger, which he said would help the country's financial sector 
become ``strong and dynamic'' at the heart of the euro zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro -- the new single currency for 11 European nations --  
made its debut at the start of 1999. With a common currency and a 
move to dismantle international trade barriers, banking competition 
has become even fiercer. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprise merger also came as the French government is  
preparing to sell part of Credit Lyonnais. Both Paribas and Societe 
Generale have in the past expressed an interest in buying a stake 
in Credit Lyonnais and both have had their eyes on expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale has been on an aggressive shopping spree of  
late, acquiring Japan's Yamaichi International Capital Management 
Co., U.S. investment bank Cowen &AMP; Co. and a hefty stake in Asia 
Credit in 1998 alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Paribas Chairman Andre Levy-Lang, who will head the new group,  
said last month that Paribas was poised for fresh acquisitions and 
asset sales. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the merger -- coupled with French insurer AXA Group  
making an offer Monday for rival British insurer Guardian Royal 
Exchange -- bolstered stocks of financial service companies in 
France and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	In a public offer running Feb. 9-March 16, Societe Generale will  
offer five new Societe Generale shares for eight Paribas shares. 
Paribas said the offer represents a premium of around 17 percent 
for its shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock swap was valued by the companies at 15.1 billion  
euros, or $17.07 billion at current exchange rates.

<HEADLINE> One Killed in Ford Plant Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- An explosion and fire rocked a generating  
station for a huge Ford Motor Co. plant today, killing at least one 
person and injuring at least 16, some severely. 
</P>
<P>
	Three workers also were unaccounted for after the blast at the  
coal-fired plant, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that some people are unaccounted for doesn't  
necessarily mean the worst,'' Ford Chairman William Clay Ford told 
reporters outside the historic Ford Rouge plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awful. Everyone who works at Ford is an extended member  
of the family,'' he said. ``This is the worst day of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen ambulances lined the streets around the burning  
building at the plant, as heavy gray smoke billowed from the 
windows after the 1 p.m. blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakwood Hospitals received 21 patients, six to eight with severe  
burns, said Dr. Gary Christopher, director of emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Several of these gentlemen were thrown by the blast and  
suffered various head injuries,'' Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten others were transferred to other hospitals because of the  
severity of their burns, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garden City Hospital received one patient and was told to expect  
more, public relations director Terry Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Michigan Hospital spokeswoman Carol Craig said it  
was expecting five patients, some from Oakwood, for its burn unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said at least one person was killed, correcting an  
early statement that two had died. It said 16 were injured. Company 
spokeswoman Francine MacBride said she couldn't explain the 
difference between the company's injury total and the hospitals' 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Three workers were unaccounted for, Ford spokesman Nick Sharkey  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the explosion was under investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Ford went to Oakwood Hospital after visiting the plant.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge tragedy,'' he said, visibly shaken.  
``Everybody's understandably upset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The power house generates electricity for the entire complex,  
producing enough electricity to serve a city the size of Boston. 
Workers said power went out after the explosion. Michigan 
Consolidated Gas Co. sent crews out to shut off gas at the complex, 
too, a standard procedure for fires. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no evidence it's a gas related explosion,'' utility  
spokeswoman Amy Messano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hourly workers on duty at the complex were sent home. Second  
shift workers were told not to report to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Dearborn police cordoned off the area around the plant, located  
in the Rouge River area, and said they were being cautious because 
they feared there could be a second explosion, an officer who 
wouldn't give his name said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,100-acre Rouge facility was once the world's largest auto  
plant. Henry Ford built the plant in 1918 because he dreamed of 
building a car from start to finish in one location. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak in the 1940s, 85,000 people worked at the plant in  
Dearborn, about seven miles west of Detroit. About 10,000 people 
work at the six Ford factories still in operation at the Rouge, 
where Ford builds Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
	The complex has acres of vacant space, but remains Ford's  
largest concentration of employees and factories and houses several 
suppliers as well.

<HEADLINE> Income and Spending Rise Strongly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' personal income surged 0.5 percent  
in December, the best gain in 10 months, and they spent every bit 
of it and more. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in personal income, the most since February,  
followed 0.4 percent gains in October and November, the Commerce 
Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal spending surged 0.8 percent, the biggest increase in  
seven months, bolstered by last-minute holiday shopping and a 
continuing rebound in auto sales after summer strikes at General 
Motors. That followed a modest 0.2 percent increase in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the department said construction spending surged 1.7  
percent in December, the largest gain in six months, helped by 
unseasonably mild weather for much of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Americans spent more than they earned, their personal  
savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income -- went 
negative for the second time this year. It was zero in September, 
minus 0.1 percent in October, positive 0.1 percent in November and 
minus 0.1 percent again in December. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Americans saved just 0.5 percent of their income,  
the least since 1933, compared with 2.1 percent in 1997 and 2.9 
percent in 1996. But, the figure is not as grim as it appears. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1933, the lack of savings reflected the huge drop in income  
Americans experienced during the depths of the Great Depression. In 
1998, the low savings rate came because prosperous Americans spent 
a portion of their stock-market gains and tapped their home equity 
during a wave of refinancing spurred by the lowest mortgage rates 
since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Income in 1998 rose a healthy 5 percent, the fourth consecutive  
year at or above that level, but still the smallest rise since 
1993. That included a 6.7 percent increase in wages and salaries -- 
the most-watched component of income -- and a 23.6 percent plunge in 
farm owners' income, reflecting the worldwide economic slump's 
impact on commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending jumped 5.7 percent, the largest gain since 1994. It was  
propelled by a 7.5 percent increase for big-ticket durable goods, 
as low interest rates fueled car sales and record home sales 
encouraged strong sales of furniture and appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, wages and salaries rose 0.5 percent. Service  
industries showed a brisk 0.7 percent gain and manufacturing, a 
more subdued 0.2 percent rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending during the month was led by a 4.2 percent surge for  
durable goods, items expected to last three or more years. It was 
the largest gain in 5 1/2 years. Spending on services rose 0.4 percent 
and on nondurable goods, 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction spending, for the year, rose 6.3 percent to $657  
billion, following a 5.9 percent rise in 1997. The categories with 
the biggest gains included single-family homes, 13.9 percent; 
apartments, 8 percent; offices, 16.4 percent, and hotels and 
motels, 12.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Those increases offset drops of 0.6 percent in government  
construction, 1.5 percent in shopping centers and other commercial 
buildings, and 3.7 percent in industrial construction. 
</P>
<P>
	In December alone, housing construction rose 1.6 percent;  
commercial, 1.4 percent, and government, 3.7 percent. There were 
substantial increases for construction of single-family homes, 
offices, and highways and streets, but drops for hotels and motels 
and industrial buildings.

<HEADLINE> Callaway Sues Rival Golf Company  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In a dispute between rival golf club manufacturers, Callaway  
Golf is suing Orlimar and claiming patent infringement and 
misleading advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Friday in San Diego, seeks an injunction and  
monetary damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The two California equipment companies have been at odds since  
last year, when Orlimar cut into Callaway's dominance in the 
fairway metals market. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlimar officials were traveling Monday and had not seen the  
lawsuit. President Ed Dolinar said he would have no comment until 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaway, based in Carlsbad, Calif., contends the patent  
infringement concerns an undercut that goes all the way around the 
cavity behind the back of its irons and is designed to move weight 
from the face of the club. 
</P>
<P>
	It has another patent in which the undercut goes only around the  
heel, toe and bottom of the iron. Callaway lawyer Steve McCracken 
says Orlimar's TriMetal irons infringe on this development. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had shown the irons in their booth in Las Vegas (in  
August) but they were not available,'' McCracken said. ``We were 
able to obtain one within the last two weeks, slice it open, 
analyze it and find the violation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other claim in the lawsuit alleges unfair competition.  
Callaway contends Orlimar has been running ads on its TriMetal 
driver that claim the 7.5 degree loft is a favorite on tour. 
</P>
<P>
	McCracken said according to the Darrell Survey, which keeps  
track of the clubs in a player's bag, there was only one 7.5 degree 
driver from Orlimar put in play on the four U.S. tours last year, 
and 11 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``By contrast, our 7.5 degree driver was put in play 1,576 times  
in 1998, and 52 times in the month of January,'' McCracken said. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaway protested Orlimar ads that stated more tour players  
were using the TriMetal -- founder Ely Callaway said the ad was 
based on information that was three months old. Callaway responded 
with the Steelhead and suggested that the Orlimar clubs had a 
``major design flaw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time in as many years Callaway has begun the  
new year -- when new products typically are introduced -- with a 
lawsuit. A year ago, it sued Spalding Sports because of its 
``System C'' and ``System T'' balls that were marketed as being the 
right ball for the Callaway or Taylor Made metal woods, the most 
popular in play at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	That lawsuit is finally set for trial in October.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have filed lawsuits against other people who infringe,  
whether they are small, Taiwanese knockoff artists or a big U.S. 
sporting goods company such as Spalding,'' McCracken said. ``That's 
just our ongoing plan to protect our rights.''

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Gives Back Gains  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures fell sharply Monday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange, giving back gains made late last week, as market 
participants awaited concrete signs world oil producers are 
prepared to make additional output cuts to ease a supply glut. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, coffee futures rose sharply, while wheat  
futures fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude jumped late Friday after Venezuela's new energy and mines  
minister, Ali Rodriguez, said his country was working with members 
of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other 
world oil producers on another round of concerted output cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	But prices retreated in technical selling tied in part to  
Rodriguez' comments that the world currently is pumping about 1.5 
million barrels a day over current demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil prices have hovered near 12-year lows for months despite  
producers' efforts to prop them with output cutbacks totaling more 
than 3 million barrels a day. Analysts have said at least an 
additional 1 million barrels daily must be taken off the market to 
have a lasting effect on prices and have noted that many producers 
still are exceeding quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas retreated amid forecasts for above-normal  
temperatures in major heating regions. 
</P>
<P>
	March crude fell 38 cents to $12.37 a barrel; March heating oil  
fell .92 cent to 32.50 cents a gallon; March unleaded gasoline fell 
1.08 cents to 37.27 cents a gallon; March natural gas fell 3.3 
cents to $1.744 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures rose sharply on the Board of Trade of the City of  
New York after preliminary estimates of earthquake damage to 
Colombian coffee-growing regions showed higher damage than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee prices have seesawed in the past week amid conflicting  
views about the severity of damage to warehouses, roads and coffee 
trees in key growing regions of Colombia, the world's 
second-largest grower behind Brazil and the largest supplier of the 
gourmet-quality beans favored by American consumers. The Quindio 
region of Colombia, accounting for about 8 percent of that 
country's production, reported nearly 50 percent of its warehouses 
were destroyed by last week's quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting coffee prices was a report released late Friday  
from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission that showed 
investors had fewer positions in the market than expected, implying 
buying demand will pick up in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	March arabica coffee rose 1.65 cents to $1.056 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures fell sharply Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade,  
weighed down by a lack of export demand and ample supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat tumbled after Egypt, the largest buyer of U.S. grain,  
again passed over American exporters this weekend in favor of 
French and Australian wheat, boosting concerns that U.S. wheat is 
still too expensive to compete on the open market. Market 
participants also were concerned about the potential for a bumper 
winter wheat crop. 
</P>
<P>
	March wheat fell 5 3/4 cents to $2.69 3/4 a bushel.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne and the late  
composer-educator William Schuman are among 14 people chosen this 
year for the American Classical Music Hall of Fame and Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The inductees, announced Monday, also include the music division  
of the Library of Congress. They are to be honored April 24 at a 
Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra concert. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second group of inductees since the Cincinnati-based  
hall opened in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Horne, music scholar H. Wiley Hitchcock, composer Milton  
Babbitt and baritone William Warfield -- the only living inductees -- 
plan to attend the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Horne, 65, has recorded such diverse material as the movie  
soundtrack to ``Carmen Jones'' and a duet album of hymns with 
Tennessee Ernie Ford.

<HEADLINE> Loss Caps Falcons Distracting Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A guaranteed victory. A dispute at the airport. A  
key player arrested the night before the biggest game of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	All in all, the Atlanta Falcons displayed just about every  
telling trait of a Super Bowl rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Denver Broncos maintained a championship persona all  
week, the Falcons showed signs of unraveling even before they got 
off the plane at Miami International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge disappointment,'' coach Dan Reeves said after the  
Falcons stumbled to a 34-19 loss to the Broncos on Sunday night. 
``You get to this game, you do it for one reason -- to win. Nobody 
in our locker room was satisfied with just getting here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons, playing in the first Super Bowl of their 33-year  
history, had managed to stay one step ahead of their sorry past all 
season. But it finally caught up with them in South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadway Ray Buchanan got things started by guaranteeing a  
victory -- Joe Namath-style -- during the off-week before the game. 
Nothing like a little bulletin-board material to fire up a team 
that already was the defending champion and determined to send John 
Elway into retirement with another Super Bowl triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	``The less you say, the less you have to take back,'' Reeves  
said. ``I'd rather let the game speak for itself. But I would never 
tell someone what they can and cannot say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan refused to back down. In fact, he kept up his war of  
words in the days leading up the game, the most memorable bit of 
verbosity coming when he proclaimed that Denver tight end Shannon 
Sharpe looked like a horse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to apologize,'' Buchanan said. ``I had the  
guarantee and the confidence that this football team could win. 
There was no doubt in my mind. I'll never take that back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, it really doesn't matter at this point. The Broncos built  
a 31-6 lead before the Falcons scored a couple of meaningless 
touchdowns to make the score a bit more respectable for the history 
books. 
</P>
<P>
	When the team arrived in Miami, receiver Terance Mathis raised a  
ruckus over Reeves' request that Pro Bowl players and 10-year 
veterans be allowed to depart the plane first. Mathis said the team 
concept should come first, not individual achievements. 
</P>
<P>
	For good measure, Mathis picked Super Bowl week to talk about a  
past drinking problem. 
</P>
<P>
	But Buchanan and Mathis became mere bit players in the Falcons'  
soap opera when Eugene Robinson decided to take a drive the night 
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the Pro Bowl safety -- known as the Prophet for his  
strong religious beliefs and Bible-thumping recitations -- was 
arrested for offering an undercover officer $40 for oral sex on 
Biscayne Boulevard, a major street frequented by prostitutes and 
drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was released from jail at 11 p.m. Saturday, but spent  
the entire night praying and being consoled by teammates. Without 
any sleep, he started the Super Bowl and was burned on the biggest 
play of the night -- an 80-yard touchdown pass to Rod Smith late in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	While maintaining his innocence, Robinson was contrite at an  
extraordinary post-game news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I want to do now is apologize first to my Lord, Jesus  
Christ, secondly to my wife and kids, and thirdly to my teammates 
and the entire Falcons organization for the distraction that I may 
have caused them,'' he said. ``I regret I was not maintaining the 
standards I have set for myself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will have to continue, trust me, to make amends with  
everyone that knows me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, Buchanan provided one of the most prophetic  
acts of the week when he showed up at media day with a dog collar 
around his neck, supposedly to signify the Falcons' role as 
underdog. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Super Bowl, they simply played like dogs.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Politician Apologizes for DUI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Republicans and Democrats stood and applauded for  
Colorado House Speaker Russell George after he confessed Monday 
that he had been arrested for drunken driving over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	George, 53, a lawyer and former municipal judge from the western  
Colorado town of Rifle, made the announcement shortly before the 
House adjourned for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican said he was stopped by a sheriff's deputy for an  
illegal lane change and then had his blood alcohol level tested. He 
hadn't received the results, but he said, ``I suspect it was 
high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George is due in court in three weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have always been a strong proponent of strong enforcement of  
drinking and driving laws, and I feel that way today,'' he said. 
``This is my error and my mistake, and I take personal 
responsibility for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After his speech, many lawmakers from both parties stood in line  
to express their sympathy and thank him for his candor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people's capacity for forgiveness is infinite for  
people who accept responsibility,'' said House Minority Leader Ken 
Gordon. ``I think he showed a lot of honor.''

<P>
        Highlights of the total government outlays from President Clinton's  
2000 budget, in billions of dollars. The outlays add up to more than 
the totals, because $161 billion in offsetting receipts for fiscal 
1998, $160 billion in 1999, and $171 billion in 2000 are not shown.

        Offsetting receipts are payments made by one agency to another  
and payments made by the public to the government for such business 
transactions as timber and oil leases, Medicare premiums and electric 
power. The chart also does not include outlays by several small government

<HEADLINE> Japanese Steel Exports Defended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan never intended to flood U.S. markets with  
steel exports, and its exports are now declining, Trade Minister 
Kaoru Yosano said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking in Parliament, Yosano said the sharp rise in Japanese  
steel exports to the United States last year was mainly due to 
strong demand for steel caused by robust economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japan never intended to flood the U.S. with the Japanese  
steel,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. steelmakers have complained about a surge of imports from  
Japan, Russia and Brazil. The U.S. Commerce Department is expected 
to make a preliminary finding this month on whether the imports 
have been sold in the United States at unfairly low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Yosano said Japanese steel exports to the United States have  
been declining since the end of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japanese steel exports have begun to drop since November or  
December last year,'' he said. ``And the U.S. administration is 
aware of the decline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. criticism is expected to increase after Utah-based  
Geneva Steel Co. Monday filed for bankruptcy citing increased 
imports as a factor undermining its operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Geneva Steel Co. filed a petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy  
protection.

	AT&AMP;T, Time Warner Strike Phone Deal  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. has struck a deal to offer telephone  
service over Time Warner Inc.'s cable systems in 33 states, greatly 
escalating the long-distance phone company's move into local 
service. The deal comes as AT&AMP;T is close to completing its purchase 
of Time Warner's biggest rival in the cable TV industry, 
Tele-Communications Inc. In the deal announced today, AT&AMP;T and Time 
Warner expect to begin offering the new service in one or two 
cities by the end of 1999 and begin broader commercial operations 
in the year 2000. AT&AMP;T shares rose 2 15/16 to 93 11/16; Time Warner 
shares were down 3/16 to 62 5/16.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. has asked federal regulators to  
stop BellSouth Corp. from continuing to market a prepaid card that 
people can use anywhere in the country to make long-distance and 
other phone calls. AT&AMP;T contends the arrangement violates a 
provision of a 1996 law that bars BellSouth and the nation's four 
other regional Bell telephone companies from providing 
long-distance service to their local phone customers.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton sent Congress a $1.77  
trillion spending plan today for 2000, beginning a new century with 
record budget surpluses that he would use to shore up Social 
Security and shower billions in new spending on programs from child 
care to the Pentagon. The release of Clinton's budget is the 
opening shot in what's sure to be a bitter struggle with the 
Republican-controlled Congress.

	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- European Central Bank President Wim

meet with Finance Minister Pedro Malan tomorrow in Brasilia, the 
capital. The talks could expedite release of the second installment

<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization has agreed to  
investigate U.S. anti-dumping laws. The complaint over the 1916 
Anti-Dumping Act was brought by the European Union and will mean a 
dispute settlement panel looking at the case, one of many disputes 
currently unresolved between the two largest members of the WTO. 
Dumping refers to the selling of large quantities of goods at a

will create Europe's second-largest bank and came at a time when 
French banks have been criticized for being slow to react to the 
industry consolidation across the continent. Paribas shares rose 3 
to 105; Societe Generale shares were off 0.62 to 35.62.

<HEADLINE> `She's All That' Opens at No. 1 / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- With the box office deflated by the Super  
Bowl, one teen film -- ``She's All That'' -- knocked another one -- 
``Varsity Blues'' -- from No. 1, while ``Shakespeare in Love'' got a 
boost from the Golden Globes, final figures showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Business overall was down nearly 32 percent from the same  
weekend last year, when there wasn't a Super Bowl but there was the 
Super Bowl of movies in theaters, with ``Titanic'' cruising toward 
record grosses. 
</P>
<P>
	Atop the box office was ``She's All That,'' the Pygmalion-style  
story of a high school class president who tries to transform an 
art geek into a prom queen. ``She's All That'' opened with $16.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's leader, the high school football movie ``Varsity  
Blues'' dropped to third with $5.9 million. ``Patch Adams'' 
remained in second place with $6 million and ``A Civil Action'' was 
fourth with $4.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love,'' which picked up three Golden Globe  
awards Jan. 24, added screens and business, grossing $4 million for 
fifth place. After eight weeks in release, ``Shakespeare'' 
maintained a strong $5,320-per-location average. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stepmom'' was sixth with $3.6 million, ``The Thin Red Line''  
seventh with $3.3 million, ``You've Got Mail'' eighth with $3

Prince of Egypt'' 10th with $2.6 million.

<HEADLINE>  IOC Leader Lash Back at Critics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- International Olympic Committee  
leaders are lashing back at their critics as they turn from one 
ethical crisis to another. 
</P>
<P>
	Still reeling from the worst corruption scandal in its 105-year  
history, the IOC is pressing ahead this week with a world summit on 
fighting performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have questioned whether the IOC has the ethical  
authority to lead the anti-doping fight while its own standards are 
under attack. 
</P>
<P>
	But IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and his deputies,  
concerned the drug conference is being overshadowed by the scandal, 
took pains Sunday to dispel that notion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This outfit is not in disarray,'' executive board member Kevan  
Gosper of Australia said. ``This outfit is managing itself through 
one of the most serious crises in its history. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it carries the authority on all matters relating to  
Olympic sports, and that includes the overseeing of this 
anti-doping conference. There is only one authority and one 
organization capable of doing it and that's us, and that's why 
we're doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's credibility remains at stake at the 2 1/2-day doping  
conference opening Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the main goals of the meeting is to approve the creation  
of an international agency to coordinate drug-testing programs 
worldwide. But there's likely to be controversy over the IOC's role 
in the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch on Sunday said he would oversee the agency and  
proposed that IOC medical commission chief Prince Alexandre de 
Merode run the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my personal opinion the man running this agency must be  
the president of the medical commission of the IOC, who has been 
doing a very good job for many years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	De Merode, a Belgian, has led the IOC medical commission since  
its inception 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have called for the world agency to be fully  
independent, saying the body would lack credibility if it's run by 
the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said it was still uncertain whether the world agency --  
funded largely by Olympic television rights fees -- would be based 
in Lausanne or elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the conference should also approve a precise  
definition of doping, a single medical code for all Olympic sports 
and a campaign to educate athletes about drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, he said he was ``astonished'' at the vitriol of the  
attacks against him in the world's media, including the ``rubbish 
that is said in some papers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So many silly things are coming,'' he said. ``Who can produce  
all this news?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch cited a Swedish report that he lives in a villa and  
flies by helicopter every day to IOC headquarters. In fact, 
Samaranch resides in a hotel suite in Lausanne and travels by car 
to his office. 
</P>
<P>
	He also recounted that a Japanese paper accused him of  
frolicking with geisha at a ``huge party'' at a hotel in Nagano at 
the close of the 1998 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``First of all, I was with my wife,'' Samaranch said. ``And  
second, I am 78 years old. I am not of the age to have parties with 
geisha girls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite calls from outside the IOC for his resignation,  
Samaranch reiterated he will stay as long as he has the support of 
the committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	``My obligation is to stay and to put all my efforts to get back  
the prestige that the IOC had during the last years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old Spaniard, who has led the IOC since 1980 and  
whose final term ends in 2001, will put his leadership to a vote of 
confidence at a special general assembly March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe some people they are very tired to see me as president  
after 18 years, mainly some people outside the IOC,'' Samaranch 
said. ``But I would like to repeat: I put my position to the IOC 
members. It is up to them. My position belongs to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch wouldn't predict the outcome of the vote but said, ``I  
can assure you I have received many telephone calls, many letters 
from IOC members. Until now, they all are supporting me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he was confident the general assembly would  
support the recommendations of the executive board to expel six 
members for alleged misconduct stemming from Salt Lake City's 
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine have either resigned or been expelled, three remain under  
investigation and one received a warning. Other members could be 
implicated as the investigation continues. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Investigators say the total of cash, services and gifts given  
to IOC members or relatives by Salt Lake bidders topped $1 million, 
USA Today reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources, said the  
investigators had found an additional $250,000 in IOC-directed 
expenses by Salt Lake officials, including numerous purchases from 
high-end jewelry and department stores in the Utah capital. 
</P>
<P>
	-- IOC members may have to ride buses instead of chauffeur-driven  
cars at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Australian Olympic Committee 
president John Coates said a range of luxuries routinely provided 
to Olympic delegates is under review and have been discussed with 
Sydney organizing committee president and state government Olympics 
Minister Michael Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to review the level of assistance we're  
providing in those areas,'' Coates said today. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Australians IOC members Kevan Gosper and Phil Coles are among  
those being investigated by the FBI in the Salt Lake scandal. The 
FBI reportedly is examining links between 60 past and present IOC 
members and students at the University of Utah to tell whether 
scholarships were given to try to lure votes. 
</P>
<P>
	-- An unexplained $13 million was earmarked as a ``secret  
weapon'' to aid Melbourne's 1996 Olympics bid, the Herald Sun in 
Melbourne reported. The newspaper said records do not say where the 
money was to go but it was not to be spent until after Melbourne 
won the event. The city lost to Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Florida To battle Crop Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Florida agriculture officials are proposing  
a four-year, $165 million plan to stop the spread of citrus canker, 
a disease that already has led to destruction of 100,000 trees and 
threatens thousands more. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the money will go to removing thousands of additional  
trees to form a ``firebreak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state's multibillion-dollar citrus industry could lose $200  
million a year if the plant disease is not blocked, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the bacteria has stayed in the area of Miami-Dade and  
southern Broward County, about 50 miles from the nearest commercial 
grove, but agriculture officials have not been able to keep it from 
spreading within that area. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this isn't an agriculture emergency of national  
significance, then I don't know what is,'' said Richard Gaskalla, 
director of the state's Division of Plant Industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Eating infected fruit does not make people sick, but the  
bacteria makes citrus unsightly and unmarketable. There is also 
risk that other countries would stop importing Florida fruits for 
fear their crops would catch the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	About $25 million already has been spent since the highly  
contagious bacteria was detected in 1995 in the Miami area. And 
Gov. Jeb Bush issued an emergency order last week providing an 
additional $8 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new plan, the number of canker-eradication workers  
would be increased from 500 to more than 1,700 over the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The foundation of that $165 million is resources to go out and  
do the survey work,'' Gaskalla said Monday. ``The lion's share ... 
will be for detection of the disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About $18 million would pay for the cutting of about 54,000  
trees out of a mile-wide ``firebreak'' stretching from the Atlantic 
Ocean to the Everglades in Broward County in an effort to keep the 
canker from reaching commercial groves. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, crews have chased the canker from behind -- cutting  
and shredding trees that were already infected. 
</P>
<P>
	Some South Florida residents have filed a lawsuit against the  
state for cutting down their trees.

<HEADLINE>  Tech Titans Speak at World Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- The heads of high-tech titans  
Microsoft and Dell said today that distributors and dealers face a 
stiff challenge from trade over the Internet but that traditional 
business shouldn't feel too threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft chairman Bill Gates told the World Economic Forum that  
he saw the biggest potential for small companies to trade worldwide 
because they ``are able to offer their unique services through the 
Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Dell, chief executive of the world's biggest direct  
seller of personal computers, Dell Computer Corp., called the 
Internet ``a turbocharger for our success in our business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The companies which use a series of distributors or dealers  
are challenged by this,'' Dell told industry and political 
heavyweights at this annual economic gathering. 
</P>
<P>
	But Scott McNealy, chief executive of leading computer systems  
maker Sun Microsystems Inc., said companies should focus on their 
products rather than Internet-based business itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a hard time with the concept of a virtual corporation  
because it might lead to virtual profits,'' McNealy said. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. government report last week said 52,000 Americans log on  
to the Internet for the first time every day. Companies across the 
economy are exploring sales and marketing on the Internet of 
products from flowers to plane tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cost of comparison shopping has gone to zero -- that is a  
huge, huge win,'' said McNealy. 
</P>
<P>
	The process ``sets up some winners and losers,'' he added. ``I'd  
rather bet on Ford long-term than the dealer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On-line commerce will make recognized brand names even more  
valuable, McNealy claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Martin, international president of the retail giant Wal-Mart  
Stores Inc., said Internet business is ``at the threshold'' of 
takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``I don't think that traditional business should be  
threatened by what's taking place,'' Martin said. ``We've 
established the brand, we've established the trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates said ``operating in a very digital way'' would be a key to  
global success in future. 
</P>
<P>
	McNealy said he primarily sees electronic commerce creating new  
opportunities -- not edging out existing business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly it's easy to get on line, but that doesn't mean that  
everyone who does it is going to do as well as companies which 
excel in that medium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters later, McNealy said the millennium bug  
could still create problems for the computer industry because Asia 
is ``disastrously behind'' in preparing for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Other regions are in ``pretty reasonable shape'' in stocking up  
on bug-free components, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates said the bug, ``although it's a terrible distraction, a  
terrible cost, and there will be some disruption,'' had helped push 
companies toward using more standardized software. 
</P>
<P>
	Some programs, especially older ones, may fail when the date  
changes to 2000. Because they were written to recognize only the 
last two digits of a year, they could read the digits ``00'' as 
1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder also was to speak at the
