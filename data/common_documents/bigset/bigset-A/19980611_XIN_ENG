<HEADLINE> OAU Summit Ends Committed to Stronger Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- African leaders Wednesday
concluded the 34th summit of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) after adopting the Ouagadougou declaration and decisions on
the political and economic situation in Africa.
</P>
<P>
A decision on the African Economic Community (AEC),
inaugurated last year to promote continental integration, was
also adopted at the three-day summit, which was dominated by the
escalating conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The conflict has caused grave concern from President Blaise
Compaore of Burkina Faso, who was elected executive chairman of
OAU at the opening of the summit, as well as from the leaders
present at the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing ceremony, Compaore urged the two
countries to follow the recommendations made by the OAU council
of ministers to "put to an end to all hostilities at the same
time and simultaneously."
</P>
<P>
The two countries should seek a peaceful solution to the
conflict through dialog, said Compaore, who also urged Guinea
Bissau to maintain national security and stability.
</P>
<P>
There could be all losers in situation of conflict and
instability, he added.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chairman then called on member states to contribute to
enhancing the effectiveness of the central organ of the
continental body's conflict prevention, management and resolution
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, Compaore said leaders to the summit had
exchanged views and decided to step up the pace of the
continent's integration by bringing into full play the role of
AEC and through close cooperation between AEC and other regional
economic organizations.
</P>
<P>
The leaders had renewed their commitment to a stronger Africa
in the next century, he stated.
</P>
<P>
The structural reforms of the 35-year OAU also became the
focus of attention at the summit.
</P>
<P>
According to Compaore, the organization should be streamlined
to suit the current world situation when great changes have taken
place since its establishment in 1963.
</P>
<P>
Denis Sassou Nguesso, president of the Republic of Congo, also
delivered a speech at the closing ceremony, expressing the common
desire for peace and development of his country and the African
continent as a whole.
</P>
<P>
It was announced the next OAU summit would be held in Algeria
in June 1999.

<HEADLINE> More Germany Companies Predicted to Go Bankrupt in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of German companies going
bankrupt would continue to rise for the sixth consecutive year in
1998, a record since the end of World War II, a state-backed
credit insurance company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Hamburg-based Hermes Kreditversicherungs-AG forecast in a
statement that the number of corporate insolvencies in Germany
would surge 5 percent to a new high of 28,800 this year.
</P>
<P>
Of all the businesses to collapse, 20,100 were western German
companies, up 4 percent over 1997, and 8,700 were in the eastern
area of the country, up 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The services and in particular the construction sector would be
hardest hit, according to the insurance company.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Industrial Potential Highlighted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has great potential as an
exporter of manufactured products despite the handicaps of its
landlocked position, a Commonwealth Secretariat official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Easter, Deputy Director in the Economic Affairs
Division of the Commonwealth Secretariat made the remarks while
addressing delegates at a two-day seminar on "Export
Competitiveness in Zimbabwe" in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe had an advantage in that it had a diverse base of
natural resources, low wages for literate labor, good physical
infrastructure and strong manufacturing capabilities, the
Zimbabwe News Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
"These strengths have not yet been fully realized. The
country's manufactured exports are still fairly small compared
with other export-oriented economies, the slow growing,
fragmented regional market remains the main destination for
exports and many legacies of inward-orientation persist in
policies and enterprise behavior, he said.
</P>
<P>
Easter said a study to enhance export competitiveness in
Zimbabwe reviewed the competitive strengths and weaknesses at the
national and enterprise levels, relative to international
competitors in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The study would highlight key areas for future analysis and
action as Zimbabwe moved toward re-engineering its economy,
particularly its export sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
The study suggested the establishment of a Zimbabwe
Competitive Council to oversee all issues relating to sustaining
national competitiveness, and creation of a stable and credible
macro-economic environment.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested the development of strong export promotion
policies, a targeted foreign investment promotion strategy and
the promotion of small and medium enterprise competitiveness.

<P>
BONN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A midnight fire in a shabby apartment
house killed eight people including two women in the eastern
German city of Bochum, with only five residents surviving the
flames Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Three of the dead were found to be tenants, while the
identities of other bodies remained unclear. Tramps often slept in
the three-storied building in a working-class quarter of the city,
it was reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the firefighters, They found the stairwell in
flames and the egress blocked for residents when arriving there.
</P>
<P>
They also assumed that the people were asleep and had little
chance to escape when the fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
All five survivers were taken to hospital for smoke inhalation
treatment, with none of them in critical condition. Four of the
people were evacuated by firefighters and one jumped to safety
from a first-floor window, suffering only minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the midnight fire was still under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Hold Talks With Jordanian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat and Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdul-Salam Majali are scheduled to discuss the latest
developments in the stalled Mideast peace process in Gaza
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Chairman Arafat just returned from Burkina Faso and he will
discuss with Majali about the latest developments concerning the
peace process and the ongoing efforts about the convening of an
Arab summit," a PNA official close to Arafat told Xinhua from
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return, Arafat said that all efforts of peace have
failed and the contacts are still going on for convening the Arab
summit, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also criticized the Israeli government's approval to
build 58 housing units on Mount of Olives in East Jerusalem,
saying it is a blatant violation to the signed agreements between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Interior Ministry approved on Tuesday the plan
submitted by the Jerusalem Municipality to build 58 new housing
units for Jewish students on Mount of Olives, to allocate a spot
on the eastern side of the Mount of Olives for an Arab girl school,
and to build 100 housing units for Palestinians in the adjacent
A-Tur neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
The PNA and the Israeli peace movement "Peace Now" opposed
the plan.
</P>
<P>
PNA Cabinet Secretary Tayeb Abdel Rahim said on Tuesday that
the decision to build new housing units for Jewish students is
proof of the continued Israeli aggression and the intent to empty
Jerusalem of its Arab residents.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Recruits More Black Policemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Eighty one percent of the
1,200 constables accepted into the South African police since
last year were black, the police announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
South African Police Services (SAPS) management was very happy
with the racial composition of the intake, SAPS divisional
commissioner Neels Steenkamp told parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, Steenkamp complained that of all new police recruits,
only one fifth were women.
</P>
<P>
The intention was to have an equal number of men and women in
the police force, he said, adding there was still a "mental or
physical barrier" to women wanting to become police officers, and
those already in the force were mostly in administrative or
support positions.
</P>
<P>
Steenkamp said the first 300 recruits started their training
at the beginning of this month, and the rest would follow in
batches of 300 at two-month intervals.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the future of the police force in the country, he
said the size of the force would be reduced over the next five
years from its present 129,233 to 120,000 well-trained, well-paid
and well-motivated.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Computer Jobs Double in Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Jobs for computer programers and
system analysts almost doubled in Canada from 1992 to 1997,
Statistics Canada reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the country had 267,000 such jobs, which was 92
percent more than that of 1992.
</P>
<P>
"The unemployment rate for computer programers in 1997 was
about 3 percent lower than any national unemployment rate since
the mid-1960s," the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
Factors contributing to this expanding job market include the
rapid growth of the Internet, the spread of intranets in large
organizations, as well as the growing demand for people who can
fix the so-called year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
Those programers with previous work experience had the best
luck finding jobs, with the number of those aged over 45 growing
by 131 percent in the five-year period, and those aged between 25
and 34 up by 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
Data shows that programers are not wealthy workaholics as they
were perceived in the past, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
They worked an average 38.8 hours a week in 1997, and the
average earnings per week stood at 843 Canadian dollars (580 U.S.
dollars), while those workers in the natural science, engineering
and mathematics group earned 877 dollars per week.

<HEADLINE> S. African Opposition Parties Meet on Coop Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's two
opposition parties have met to discuss possible opposition
stranglehold on power.
</P>
<P>
During a four-hour meeting in Cape Town on Tuesday night,
leaders of the biggest opposition National Party (NP), and the
Democratic Party (DP), a white-based opposition party, had "a
frank exchange of views" but they did not reach any agreement#,
South African Press Association quoted a joint statement by the
two parties as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"No conclusions were arrived at, other than that other
parties should be involved in any process," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The NP's delegation consisted of party leader Marthinus van
Schalkwyk and three Western Cape provincial leaders, including
Premier Gerald Morkel. The DP delegation comprised party leader
Tony Leon, his deputy William Mnisi and five other senior
officials.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was a follow-up to formal talks late last year
between the parties' leadership, the report said.
</P>
<P>
With the 1999 general election around the corner, the NP had
repeatedly called on opposition parties to join forces to fight
the ruling ANC in the polls. The DP also indicated its
willingness to form an opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
While declining to give details about the substance of the
talks, a DP delegate to the meeting said Wednesday it was routine
and part of an ongoing program of consultations with other
parties.
</P>
<P>
He said Leon had suggested a basis for cooperation among
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Van Schalkwyk described Monday's meeting as "very important",
the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation between like-minded opposition parties is
vital," Schalkwyk said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The NP had tabled a number of proposals, including a council
of opposition parties in which all would have equal status,
regardless of size, he said. But he emphasized that the talks
were preliminary and there had not been discussions about
cooperation with other opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The NP's federal executive would meet in mid-June and the
NP-DP meeting would be on the agenda, van Schalkwyk said.

<HEADLINE> Ties With China Important for S. African Economy: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- South African-Chinese
relations were important for South African trade and exports as
China's trade with South Africa were growing quickly, Trade and
Industry Minister Alec Erwin said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
China could soon rise from its current position as South
Africa's sixth largest trading partner to its fifth or fourth
largest partner, Erwin said in parliament.
</P>
<P>
China was currently ranked 30th largest trading nations in the
world, and it had the potential to enter the ranks of the top 25
soon, Erwin said.
</P>
<P>
Establishing diplomatic relations with China in January this
year had been an important political milestone, and it would also
bring in significant trade and investment benefits, he said.
</P>
<P>
Trade with China, including Hong Kong, totaled 8 billion Rand
(1.6 billion U.S. Dollars) in 1996, and China was the
11th-largest source of foreign investment in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said negotiations on a trade agreement with China were
underway, following his recent visit to China.
</P>
<P>
A technical team would return to China in the near future to
conclude the agreement and related matters, he said.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Seeks African Mediation to End Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea Wednesday sought the
mediation of Egypt and other African countries to end its bloody
border dispute with Ethiopia, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"We want Egypt to play a role in this respect besides other
African countries, as Egypt has a major role within the
Organization of African Unity (OAU)," said Aboudula Mahmoud Jaber,
the political advisor of Eritrean President Issayas Aferwerki.
</P>
<P>
"Both the Eritreans and Ethiopians share good relations with
Egypt," Jaber told reporters after his meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jaber said that basic differences between Eritrea and Ethiopia
are over borders inherited since the days of colonialism.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea have argued peacefully over their border
for years, but the dispute turned violent on May 6, with each
accusing the other of incursions. Hopes that U.S.-led mediation
would prevent a deterioration were dashed last weekend as bloody
clashes had occurred.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, among the world's poorest, are at odds over
at least six areas along their common border. They were one state
until Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Jaber and Mubarak was attended by members
of an Eritrean delegation which arrived here Tuesday night to
inform Egyptian officials of the developments on the
Eritrean-Ethiopian borders.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean Minister of Local Government Mohamud Sherifo handed
over a message from Aferwerki to Mubarak during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader has sent two messages to leaders of both
Eritrea and Ethiopia, calling for an immediate end to the
fightings and holding negotiations to resolve the border row that
centers on a 400 square kilometers rocky triangle of land along
their western border.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting erupted Tuesday along the Ethiopian-Eritrean
frontier as the Horn of Africa neighbors turned their armies
against each other in the latest chapter of an escalating border
dispute.
</P>
<P>
The OAU has reportedly agreed to send a high-level mediation
team to the disputed border area between Ethiopia and Eritrea for
mediation to end the confrontation.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Accused of Arming Separatists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Somalia's three political
factions Wednesday accused Ethiopia of meddling in Somalia's
internal affairs by supplying arms to separatists.
</P>
<P>
The three factions -- the Somali National movement (SNM), the
Somali Democratic Alliance (SDA) and the United Somali Front
(USF) which originate from Somalia's Northwestern regions have
accused Ethiopia of supplying large amounts of military weapons
to Ibrahim Egal of the breakaway republic of Somaliland.
</P>
<P>
In a strong-worded statement issued in Mogadishu, the three
factions have also condemned Ethiopia for defying the resolutions
by the U.N., the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the
regional organization of Inter-Governmental Authority for
Development (IGAD), which impose arms embargo on Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The signatories of the statement included Abdurahman Ahmed Ali
Tur, the chairman of the SNM. They have also blamed Ethiopia for
violating Somalia's unity and territorial integrity by constantly
sending its military officials to Hargeisa, capital of the
breakaway republic of Somaliland.
</P>
<P>
The three factions are allied with faction leader Hussein
Mohamed Aidid and they said Ethiopia has already given diplomatic
recognition to Egal by opening its own mission in Hargeisa while
reciprocally offering an office to the secessionist
administration of Egal in Addis Ababa to promote what they called
Ethiopia's particular military and economic interests.
</P>
<P>
The three factions also said they will no longer tolerate what
they called Ethiopia's deliberate and arrogant intransigence.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia last year supplied weapons and ammunition to the
factions of Ali Mahdi Mohamed and the Somali Salvation Democratic
Front.
</P>
<P>
They have also made two armed insurgencies into Somalia's
border region of Gedo in their support of the Somali National
Front fighting against the Islamic fundamentalist group of
Al-Itihad Al-Islam.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian military officials have also opened early in the
year three training camps for the Hawadle clan militiamen in the
central region of Hiran.
</P>
<P>
At least 750 former militiamen trained and supervised by
Ethiopia are currently operating in Hiran in accordance with the
Ethiopian led program which still remains unknown.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Hezbollah to Exchange Detainees, Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese leading anti-Israel Muslim
group Hezbollah is expected to swap on June 17 the remains of a
killed Israeli soldier for Lebanese detainees held in Israel, the
Orient radio reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted sources of the Shiite Muslim Amal Movement
led by Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri as saying that
Israel will free 50 Lebanese detainees from its south Lebanon
Khiam prison and return 40 remains of killed Lebanese guerillas.
</P>
<P>
In return, Hezbollah, or Party of God, will return the remains
of an Israeli soldier killed in an Israeli bungled commando raid
on the Lebanese southern coastal village of Insariyeh last
September.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the swap is expected to be carried out
in the Feraruz crossing in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese detainees and remains of the killed guerillas
which will be returned by Israel would be mainly from Amal
movement and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah. The two groups have
been fighting Israeli troops and trying to oust them from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer so-called security zone
in south Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its
northern settlements from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The current negotiations are under way between Israel and
Hezbollah through the International Committee of the Red Cross
and the Lebanese government.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Cut Oil Output by 100,000 Barrels Per Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran Wednesday announced to cut
its oil production by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) as of July 1,
joining the efforts of other oil exporters to boost oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made following a meeting between Iranian
Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh and his visiting Saudi
counterpart Ali al-Naimi, the Iranian official news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Iran undertakes to trim output by 100,000 bpd as of July 1, in
addition to the 140,000 bpd cut previously agreed upon," the oil
ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Iran's decision came after Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico
reached an agreement in Amsterdam on Thursday to further cut
their oil productions.
</P>
<P>
In a swift reaction, Tehran hailed the output cuts, stating
that it supports any collective action by members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to restore
the oil market and shore up the prices.
</P>
<P>
Iran, the second largest exporter in the OPEC block, has a
production quota of 3.94 million bpd according to the OPEC
decision made in November. But its actual production is much less
than the figure due to its out-of-date facilities.
</P>
<P>
Suffering a sharp fall in oil incomes during last Iranian year
(ended March 20), Iran repeatedly announced readiness to
cooperate with other OPEC countries, Saudi Arabia in particular,
to cut oil production in order to boost prices.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi oil minister arrived here on Tuesday on a trip to
lobby oil exporters to join efforts to restore oil market. He
earlier visited Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman
to seek their support.

<P>
BAGHDAD, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's ruling Baath Socialist
Party on Wednesday condemned U.S. and British troops for using
depleted uranium bombs against Iraqi troops during the 1991 Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the party's Foreign Relations Bureau, released
by the official Iraqi News Agency, said the use of such weapons
constituted a serious crime as their subsequent effects are not
only confined to direct injuries, but also include long-standing
contamination of soil, water and air.
</P>
<P>
It emphasized that the subsequent effects of the use of
depleted uranium bombs will affect the health of coming
generations through touching, breathing, drinking and ingestion.
</P>
<P>
The statement referred to the findings of many international
studies, which demonstrated the detrimental effects of these
internationally banned bombs and their contribution to the
increased incidence of cancers and congenital deformities among
children.
</P>
<P>
The party appealed to all forces of good will in the world to
expose the true nature of this grave crime by lodging protests
through all possible channels to international organizations, the
U.N. Human Rights Commission and the U.S. and British government.
</P>
<P>
It added that the U.S. and Britain should be held responsible
legally and humanely for committing this horrendous crime against
the people of Iraq.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Deplores Russia's Delay on Start II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Wednesday deplored the Russian parliament's
latest refusal to approve a treaty sharply reducing nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on arms control at the Henry Stimson Center in
Washington, Albright said the decision of the Duma was a serious
setback to efforts to curb the spread of nuclear weapons around
the world. "I deeply regret that action."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Russia's Duma, or the parliament, decided
to postpone hearings on the START II arms reduction treaty from
next week until the fall, further delaying hopes of ratification.
</P>
<P>
Albright said she hoped the Duma would reverse itself and
recognize that nuclear testing in India and Pakistan made
approval of the Start II treaty even more vital.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was concluded in 1992 and ratified by the U.S.
Senate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Albright reiterated the U.S. position not to proceed with
anything more than preliminary negotiations on a follow-up treaty
to make even deeper cuts until the Russian parliament acts on
Start II.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Albright urged the Senate to ratify the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The Indian and Pakistani tests
made the treaty more crucial because it would set up a monitoring
system and try to curb proliferation of nuclear weapons
technology, she added.

<HEADLINE> Rawlings Defends OAU Summit's Function </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry
Rawlings said Wednesday the OAU summit was not at all a social
gathering of African leaders but a forum for them to discuss hot
issues facing the continent.
</P>
<P>
"It allows a room for an interchange to reduce frictions and
the suspicions that exist among African countries," Rawlings told
Xinhua at the end of the three-day summit of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) here.
</P>
<P>
"I think it has been conducted in a very competent way and the
exchange among us has been very healthy," the Ghanaian president
said.
</P>
<P>
"It has given an opportunity for us to express our feelings on
certain issues, and this is why I find the agenda for this
session is very interesting," he added.
</P>
<P>
Peace and economic development are issues of priority which
were put high on the agenda of the OAU summit, which ended with a
renewal of African leaders' commitment to building a stronger
Africa in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings, reported to be close friend of Nigeria's late Head
of State General Sani Abacha, also commented on the leader of the
most populous country in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Abacha reportedly died of a heart attack shortly before his
departure to attend the summit Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Describing the late general as "a great nationalist of his
country," Rawlings gave the credit that in his time, Abacha "was
able to reduce the massive debt of Nigeria."
</P>
<P>
Although the Nigerian people are suffering from hardships at
present, they will see the fruits under Abacha's leadership,
according to him.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanaian president believed that the domestic policies and
those toward the west African sub-region made under Abacha would
be maintained.
</P>
<P>
On the current conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea as well
as the situation in Guinea Bissau, which have become hot spots of
the continent, Rawlings said, "I don't think they are
non-containable problems."
</P>
<P>
According to him, African leaders at the summit had an
opportunity to discuss these issues and take some steps in order
to prevent the situations from escalating.
</P>
<P>
Describing the relationship between China and Ghana as "very
healthy," Rawlings said, "we intend to transfer this relationship
into as many fields of our economic and trading activities as
possible."
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped to see more exchange of visits by leaders
of the two countries.

ST DENIS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Brazil beat
Scotland 2-1 thanks to an own goal from Tommy Boyd in the opening
game of the World Cup finals on Wednesday.

The Brazilian team took an early lead just 4 minutes into the
match as Cesar Sampaio headed home a corner from Bebeto.
</P>

The Scottish team, which failed to go beyond the group match
stage in their seven previous World Cup finals, fought hard and
were finally awarded with a penalty at the 34th minute when Sampaio
brought down Kevin Gallacher within the penalty area. John Collins
made no mistake in converting the shot.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the equaliser, the Scottish team played better in
the second half, but Boyd's own goal let down all their efforts and
gave the defending champions their first victory at the France'98
World Cup finals.

<HEADLINE> No Merger Among Egypt's State-owned Banks: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the Central Bank of
Egypt Ismail Hassan said Wednesday that there are no plans to
merge any of the four biggest public sector banks, the Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt has no plan in any way to amalgamate either among these
banks or with any other private or joint bank," he told
reporters. He said that statements made in this connection were
without foundation.
</P>
<P>
He referred to a statement published by the Egyptian Al Alam
Al Youm newspaper Wednesday and said such statements "served no
cause and caused confusion."
</P>
<P>
The four largest national banks, namely, the National
bank of Egypt, Misr Bank, Bank of Alexandria and National
Investment Bank, hold 70 percent of the country's commercial
assets, 60 percent of deposits and 68 percent of loans.
</P>
<P>
Hassan said public sector banks are owned by the state who has
not decided on such a step.
</P>
<P>
"If there ever was such a trend -- and this is not under
consideration at present -- this would be considered by owners of
the banks in accordance with rules and procedures provided in
current laws," he said.
</P>
<P>
The governor of the central bank said he was aware that
amalgamations are "a feature of the age" in the banking sector and
industrial companies, but he added such procedures take place at
the decision of shareholders with the right timing and the
right circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian People's Assembly approved in principle Monday a
draft bill regulating contribution of the private sector in the
capital of public sector banks.
</P>
<P>
The bill says that the private sector may contribute to the
shares of the capital of banks wholly owned by the state. It gives
no timetable for the government to offer the banks for sale.

regular budget to finance the activities of the African Economic
Community (AEC).
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the OAU General Secretariat will also
prepare a detailed budget and submit it for consideration by the
policy organs of the OAU which have the responsibility for
approving the budget.
</P>
<P>
According to a decision adopted at the second ordinary session

public Wednesday, the OAU general secretariat should also
streamline the activities of the AEC as a way of achieving
efficiency in resource utilization.
</P>
<P>
A plan will also be worked out to ensure the complete freedom
of movement of persons throughout the community and officials of
the AEC and Regional Economic Communities (RECS) and holders of
the official travel documents of these institutions should be
exempt from visa requirements during travels within member
states, the decision says.
</P>
<P>
Member states should ensure the effective implementation of
the programs of the RECS as a way of facilitating the attainment
of the objectives of the AEC.
</P>
<P>
Regarding industrial policies and strategies, all member
states and RECS are called upon to ensure the harmonization of
their industrial development plans with the Alliance for Africa's
Industrialization (AAI).
</P>
<P>
Member states are also requested to create or strengthen
consultative mechanisms between the government and the private
sector with a view to formulating industrial development policies
and strategies in line with the objectives of their economic and
social development plans as well as programs for regional and
sub-regional economic integration and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Public sector should also be restructured to enable it to
improve its performance, modernize its management and stimulate
competitiveness in order to be in position to assist the private
sector in its industrialization endeavor.
</P>
<P>
Feasibility study will be conducted for the establishment of
the African Energy Commission for working out energy policies and
strategies.

OUAGADOUGOU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- African leaders have once

plaguing the world's poorest continent and claiming a large
number of lives every year.
</P>
<P>
The 34th assembly of heads of state and government of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) in a decision calls upon all
member states to commit additional human and material resources
for malaria prevention and control, including disease
surveillance and research, in line with the development of health

African continent and to increase its level of support in that
respect.
</P>

TEHRAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
on Wednesday openly defended his Interior Minister Abdollah
Nouri, who was under a threat of impeachment demanded by 31
deputies in the Majlis (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Khatami gave a vote of confidence to Nouri in a meeting with
visiting Kuwaiti Interior Minister Sheikh Mohammad Khalid
al-Sabah who arrived here on Tuesday for a three-day visit, the
Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
"Security paves the way for development and development
consolidates security," he said, "having this in mind, we asked
our capable brother (Nouri), also an outstanding personality of
the revolution and the system, to take over the heavy
responsibility of the Interior Ministry, and thanks god he has
been successful at this job."
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one conservative Majlis deputies on Wednesday called for
an impeachment of the interior minister, claiming that
"continuation of Nouri's service in the post of interior minister
is detrimental to tranquillity and stability in the country."
</P>
<P>
They accused Nouri of creating tension in the society, making
provocative interviews and speeches in different provinces and
appointing inexperienced people to managerial posts at the
interior ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to the Majlis regulations, Nouri should appear
before the Majlis within 10 days to give his explanation after
the proposed motion for the impeachment was submitted to the
Majlis.
</P>
<P>
The proposed motion against Nouri was believed to be another
step launched by the conservatives against the moderate
government of President Khatami, following their efforts to put
Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi, Khatami's another strong
supporter, on trial on corrupt charges.

<HEADLINE> Britain Welcomes EC Proposal to lift Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The British government Wednesday
welcomed the European Commission's proposal to lift the
two-year-old global ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive branch of the European Union
(EU), announced early Wednesday that it had proposed lifting all
the restrictions on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
However, the proposal is yet to be discussed by EU veterinary
experts and is expected to pass on to EU agriculture ministers for
a final decision.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this proposal, British Agriculture Minister Jack
Cunningham was quoted by BBC television as saying, "It is very
good news, but it is not the end of the story."
</P>
<P>
"Clearly we shall be doing everything we can to minimize the
time between this announcement and the final agreement for beef to
flow again into international markets," Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President of the British National Farmers Union Ben
Gill said, "We've now turned the corner and we are in the home
straight. The momentum must not be lost."
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the worldwide ban on all British beef exports in
March 1996 when the British government admitted possible links
between mad cow disease and its human equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease.
</P>
<P>
Last month, EU ministers decided to lift the beef products
export ban on Britain's Northern Ireland region, where a computer
database can track cattle movements.

ADDIS ABABA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Chamber of
Commerce said Wednesday that the business community is ready to
facilitate the transportation of goods from the port of Djibouti
to the hinterland.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, president of the

</P>
<P>
Private transit operators should be allowed to work along with
the maritime transit enterprise to facilitate the transportation

</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has become a landlocked country since the
independence of Eritrea in 1993. It uses both Assab port of
Eritrea and Djibouti port as its outlets for export produce.
</P>
<P>
However, the present border conflict between Ethiopia and
Eritrea has made the Assab port unavailable for Ethiopia's
export.
</P>
<P>
Genna expressed his conviction that Ethiopia would overcome
the problem that arose from the border crisis.

they would leave the government if Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu goes ahead with his plan to carry out a major
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
To show the seriousness of their warning, 11 members of the
Land of Israel Front, the far-rightist parliamentary faction that
opposes any land handover to the Palestinians, held a meeting with
prominent religious figures, Rabbi Abraham Shapira and Mordechai
Eliahu, religious mentors of the major coalition party National
Religious Party (NRP).
</P>
<P>
They said they were drafting a religious ruling which would
obligate the NRP lawmakers to topple the government if Netanyahu
gives up more land of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The NRP, a religious party that still embraces the ideology of
Greater Israel which believes Israel must retain control over the
land between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River, has
repeatedly threatened to oust Netanyahu if he carries out a
redeployment of exceeding 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
It seemed that amid reports that Netanyahu is close to a
U.S.-brokered deal on a 13 percent redeployment, the
far-rightwingers felt an urge to deter the prime minister from
doing so.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the centrist coalition party The Third Way came out
to prod Netanyahu to move forward on the redeployment issue. The
party warned that it would also bring down the government, if no
agreement will be reached on the second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Party member Yehuda Harel described his Tuesday meeting with
Netanyahu as the "toughest" one, but said he was not sure the
prime minister was trying to wrap up the second redeployment. If
there was no agreement on the issue, The Third Way would try to
topple the government and go to early elections, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the opposition party Meretz also presented a
no-confidence motion to the Knesset (Parliament) over the
government's indecision on the redeployment, saying the current
negotiations were "nothing but a bluff."
</P>
<P>
Despite the continued negotiations and contacts through the
U.S. mediation, the prospect for a quick breakthrough faded due to
the strong opposition that Netanyahu is facing within his
government. Netanyahu denied earlier this week the reports that he
was on the verge of a deal with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He once again toughened his tone Wednesday, saying that the
real peace with the Palestinians must be based on Israeli security
and the Palestinian compliance with existing agreements.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Jerusalem at a meeting of Haifa University's Board
of Governors, he reiterated that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
must expunge clauses in the Palestinian Covenant calling for
Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
"How can Israel be expected to make further concessions to the
Palestinian Authority, when it refuses to say that the covenant
calling for Israel's destruction has been rescinded?" he asked.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Expresses Concern Over Increased Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Wednesday expressed his serious concern over the increased
tension in Gali district of Abkhazia, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The tension in this area appears to have persisted in spite of
the signing on May 25, 1998 of the Protocol on a Cease-Fire and
Withdrawal of Armed Formations.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the U.N. chief appealed urgently to the
government of Georgia and the Abkhaz authorities to settle their
dispute at the negotiating table and not through armed
confrontation, which would only lead to further unnecessary human
suffering and additional loss of life.
</P>
<P>
Annan expressed the hope that a meeting between the Georgian
president and the Abkhaz leader will take place soon and that it
will contribute to defusing the situation on the ground.
</P>
<P>
He said he has instructed his special representative to pursue
vigorously his contacts with both sides with a view to resuming
the Geneva process.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Increase Strongly in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to the strong spending
on cars and trucks, the U.S. retail sales increased 0.9 percent in
May, marking the seventh consecutive monthly growth, the Commerce
Department reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The increase, to a seasonally adjusted 224.6 billion U.S.
dollars, was larger than predicted by some economists and followed
a 0.7 percent gain in April, revised up from an earlier estimate
of 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
May's gain was the largest since February, when unseasonably
mild winter weather helped keep Americans shopping. But the
persistence of strong buying demand into the April-June quarter
implies economic growth may not drop all that much from the
robust 4.8 percent annual rate reached during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
In May, auto sales surged 2.4 percent, hitting 1.51 million
units of cars and trucks, the best performance in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
General merchandise stores, including department stores, also
reported strong sales. They rose 0.6 percent last month after an
even-better 0.9 percent gain in April.
</P>
<P>
Sales jumped 1.5 percent at furniture and home appliance
stores, the best in four months, and 0.7 percent at gas stations.
They inched 0.2 percent higher at food stores.
</P>
<P>
However, sales fell 0.3 percent at drug stores, 0.1 percent at
building supply and hardware stores and 0.1 percent at restaurants
and bars. Receipts were unchanged at apparel and specialty shops.
</P>
<P>
In another separate report released Thursday, the Labor
Department said the number of first-time claims for unemployment
insurance dropped by a seasonally adjusted 23,000 to 315,000 last
week. A less-volatile four-week moving average of claims rose by
2,250 to 319,000, a low number but nevertheless the highest since
late January.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislature Urges Law Enforcement Inspectors to Be Honest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature today
urged its law inspection inspectors to be honest in performing their
duties.
</P>
<P>
An inspection team for law enforcement is to leave for Shandong
Province tomorrow, checking on the observance of the Law on Marine
Environmental Protection. The series of law inspections,
which started in mid-May, are the first of their kind initiated by
the Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress
(NPC).
</P>
<P>
Two other teams are to go to coastal areas of Liaoning
Province and the island province of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee stressed that inspection teams must
not participate in banquets or accept any gifts from
localities. All the members must oppose extravagance and waste.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, they should report both their positive and
negative findings to the country's highest legislature, which has
unprecedentedly organized seven law-enforcement inspections this
year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the NPC Standing Committee has decided that it
must strengthen the checking and supervision of laws for the overall
development of the country, especially in the market economy.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the Standing Committee has organized 23
inspection teams, checking 21 laws, decisions and
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
This year the Standing Committee will inspect the observance of
the Agriculture Law, Law on Water and Soil Conservation, Law on
Administration of Taxation, Law on Marine Environmental
Protection, Law on Application of Scientific and Technological
Findings and two others.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the law, the inspection teams will not be
involved in the settlement of problems but urge
governmental departments to effectively implement the laws.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Asked to Reveal Truth on Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B. J. Habibie
here Thursday asked the Armed Forces (ABRI) to reveal truth about
the mastermind of riots in Jakarta more than three weeks ago,
according to Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Habibie asked the military to make the revelation during a
meeting with high-ranking officers of the ABRI, including Defense
Minister and ABRI commander Gen. Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
The president asked the military to reveal if there was an
organized group that provoked people to damage, loot and burn
vehicles and stores during the widespread rioting that rocked
Jakarta between May 13 and 15.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 shops and houses were burned and looted and
more than 1,200 people killed in the riots.
</P>
<P>
The riots had eventually forced former President Soeharto to
step down and install Habibie as the country's third president.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Habibie stressed that the country and the
international community are still sensitive about the riots, the
way they were handled and the death toll, with respect to the
observance of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Human rights, unlike in the past, can no longer be ignored as
they have become a measurement of a country's development, Habibie
said.
</P>
<P>
He thus expressed hope that the armed forces would follow the
U.N. conventions that the government has pledged to ratify in
stages.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a social organization working for harmonious
inter-ethnic relations on Wednesday called on the ABRI to issue a
guarantee for the safety of all non-indigenous Indonesians.
</P>
<P>
The organization also proposed to Habibie that the government
issue an official statement condemning all the violations of human
rights that occurred during the riots.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian TV station Thursday reported that Habibie will sign
a decree next week, abolishing the use of "non-indigenous" to
describe other ethnic groups in the country.

<HEADLINE> Indian MPs Say 2,000 Killed in Cyclonic Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Members in the Lower House of
the Indian Parliament said Thursday that some 2,000 people were
killed and 50,000 others were missing in the deadly cyclonic storm
that lashed the west coast of India Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bhavnaben Dave from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
told the house that the severe storm caused massive devastation in
many parts of Gujarat though the state government had taken
elaborate precautions.
</P>
<P>
Official figures put the death toll at 565 including nine in
neighboring Rajasthan till Thursday morning as army and civil
authorities fought adverse conditions to rescue survivors and
provide relief to them.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the hit areas said 151 bodies have been identified
so far and with recovery of more bodies from the rubbles of
flattened houses and uprooted trees and electric poles along the
coastal areas, the toll would most likely further go up.
</P>
<P>
Many of the deaths and those missing are salt workers who were
washed away into the sea by the tidal waves rising from the Gulf
of Kutch and could only be discovered later.
</P>
<P>
The cyclone, which entered the coastal city of Porbandar,
Gujarat State, around 10:30 a.m. Tuesday and weakened Wednesday
morning, left an unprecedented trail of destruction and paralyzed
life in the hit areas.
</P>
<P>
Civil authorities, assisted by the army and the air force,
began a massive relief and rescue operation shortly after the
storm, but widespread heavy rains that followed in the devastated
areas have made the relief work more difficult.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of houses were damaged and road and communication
links disrupted and cities like Jamnagar, Porbandar, Gandhidham,
Bhuj and Khambhaliya in the state were in total darkness.
</P>
<P>
Initial estimates said colossal damage to property is worth
around 12 billion rupees, or 300 million U.S. dollars in Kutch and
Saurashtra areas.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee appealed Wednesday
night to Indians and those of Indian origin living abroad to make
generous contributions to the relief work in the devastated areas.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government said it would issue a statement on the
disaster later Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union and China
signed several cooperation projects Thursday to promote the
economy in China's Tibetan Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The projects, worth 84 million ECU (92.4 million U.S. dollars),
include an integrated rural development project to enhance the
agricultural self-sufficiency of ethnic Tibetan people by
improving food production through better irrigation.
</P>
<P>
The long-term protection of grazing land and the development of
training facilities for the local population are also contained in
the projects.
</P>
<P>
The projects were signed by European Commission Vice-President
Sir Leon Brittan and visiting Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangshen.
</P>
<P>
Shi and Brittan also signed a memorandum of understanding,
through which the 15-nation union is expected to help China build
a robust financial sector in the wake of the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister came here for the annual EU-China Joint
Committee meeting, which focused on a wide range of bilateral
trade issues, including the problems facing European companies
investing in China, the export of dual-use products, and the fight
against Intellectual Property piracy.
</P>
<P>
Shi also held talks with his EU counterparts on China's
accession to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier move, the EU removed China and Russia from its
list of non-market economy countries so as to give the two
countries better trading conditions.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close at Five-Month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket was
dragged down Thursday by slumps on key Asian equity markets, a low
Australian dollar and concerns about the direction of interest
rates in the nation.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries Index ended down 34.2 points at a five-month
low of 2558.7, although it was 15.2 points above its low for the
day after some light buying emerged in afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
"It was a pretty negative day for sentiment all round," said
Rob Black, an institutional dealer.
</P>
<P>
"I think there is still Asian concern. With our market, it is
more the case of there not being any buying around," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index dropped as foreign companies moved to lighten
their equity exposure to the fragile Japanese economy while the
Hong Kong market worsened on concerns about Asian currencies and
selling of interest rate-sensitive stocks, the Australian
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
That led to a further deterioration of confidence in an
Australian market already damaged this week by a drop in the value
of the Australian dollar and speculation about an official
interest rate hike.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's negativity was not restricted to currency-exposed
stocks.
</P>
<P>
Global media giant News Corp. fell after a strong run-up this
week arising from its large proportion of foreign currency
revenues. Its ordinary shares dropped 35 cents to 9.79 Australian
dollars while its preferred stock fell 28 cents to 8.54 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Financial stocks fared poorly as the market saw tangible
evidence of the arrival of a higher interest rate environment as
leading ANZ and St George banks moved to lift some fixed home loan
rates.
</P>
<P>
ANZ lost only 5 cents to 10.62 Australian dollars while St
George dropped 6 cents to 10.02 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of other major banks, National Australia fell 29.8 cents to
21.005 Australian dollars, Westpac bank lost 12 cents to 9.48
Australian dollars, Commonwealth suffered a 33-cent drop to 17.4
Australian dollars and Colonial slumped 15 cents to 4.53
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The All Industrials Index weakened 63.4 points to 4437.6 while
the All Resources was 10 points down at 1051.2.
</P>
<P>
Australia's leading company BHP lost 9 cents to 13.35
Australian dollars after announcing an understanding to sell Timor
Sea petroleum assets.
</P>
<P>
Global miner Rio Tinto was 15 cents down at 19.5 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index was 0.9 points down at 1125.2 as the bullion
price rose 4.1 U.S. dollars per ounce to 294.2 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Turnover Thursday was 360.7 million shares worth 684.4 million
U.S. dollars. Falls of 819 outnumbered rises of 423.

<P>
BORDEAUX, France, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Italian coach Cesare Maldini
was reluctant to give any hint on the starting line-up against Chile
in their Group B opener here at the soccer World Cup tournament on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hit by a string of unfitness and illness, the Italian squad has
lost the veteran goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi and striker Fabrizio
Ravanelli, who was replaced by Enrico Chiesa on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Their defence, which would be pounded by the Chilean attacking
combination of Ivan Zamorano and Marcelo Salas, was further weakened
by the unavailability of right-back Moreno Torriceli.
</P>
<P>
The firepower in the front was also dimished by the missing of his
unfit Juventus teammate Allessandro Del Piero.
</P>
<P>
But Maldini is expected to field former national captain Roberto
Baggio of Bologna and a stronger and younger Christian Vieri.
</P>
<P>
The other two teams in Group B are Cameroon and Austria, which face
each other in Toulouse Thursday night.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Climbs Through 59 U.S. Cent Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar climbed
back above the key psychological level of 59 U.S. cents Thursday
but experts warned that it could head lower again Friday.
</P>
<P>
The local currency was able to briefly catch its breath
Thursday as the onslaught from offshore markets eased.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign exchange dealers said that as soon as market
participants squared their books the Australian dollar would
resume its test of the downside.
</P>
<P>
At the close in Sydney the currency was trading at 59.18 U.S.
cents from 58.32 U.S. cents at Wednesday's close.
</P>
<P>
"Overall I think it is just short squeezing at the moment and
once the market is out of its short positions the dollar will
probably have another test on the downside," said John Reedyk,
foreign exchange sales manager with the Australian and New Zealand
Banking Group.
</P>
<P>
"There has been little interest today from offshore markets,
the onshore market was still a bit short from yesterday so that is
why we've seen a short squeeze this afternoon," Reedyk said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday a dealer from the Commonwealth Bank of
Australia warned that as soon as the Japanese yen weakened against
the U.S. dollar the Australian dollar would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was also buying 83.88 Japanese yen from
82.35 yen at Wednesday night's close.
</P>
<P>
It was trading at 1.0636 German marks from 1.0385 marks, at
0.3633 British pounds from 0.3559 and 1.1792 New Zealand dollars
from 1.1788.

<HEADLINE> Albright Urges Enhanced Sino-U.S. Cooperation (Part I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States hopes the
forthcoming June Sino-U.S summit will advance the two countries'
relationship in ways that serve the American and Chinese peoples,
says U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton is scheduled to make a reciprocal
visit to China in late June following Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's trip to the United States last fall.
</P>
<P>
"Our main concern at the June summit will be to advance our
relationship in ways that serve the American and Chinese
people. We want to deepen our dialogue on global, regional and
bilateral issues of common concern, including non-proliferation,
human rights and trade, as well as our respective policies related
to development and conservation of energy and protection of the
environment," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to work to close the gaps where we have differences
and work together to meet international challenges and promote
peace and prosperity in the world," said Albright in response to
written questions by "Outlook" weekly. The interview is published
in the June 15 issue of the magazine affiliated with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Albright said since the October summit, significant progress
has been made in the areas the two presidents discussed, citing
the following examples:
</P>
<P>
During her trip to China in April, Albright and Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan signed an agreement establishing a hot line
between Washington and Beijing; on March 19, the United States
implemented its agreement with China on the Peaceful Uses of
Nuclear Energy; in December, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
and his Chinese counterpart Chi Haotian signed the Military
Maritime Cooperation Agreement establishing procedures for the two
navies to follow; and more recently, the inaugural meeting of the
Joint Liaison Group on Law Enforcement was held in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"We've also strengthened our strategic dialogue and held
military exchanges," the secretary of state said. "In short, we
have made significant progress in the short time since the October
summit. The United States hopes to build on these accomplishments
during President Clinton's trip to China."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of U.S. policy toward China, Albright said: "Our
strategy of 'engagement' toward China is based on the premise that
a sound and stable relationship between our two countries serves
the fundamental interests of the American and Chinese peoples."

<TEXT>
<P>
"Although we have areas of disagreement, we have significant
common interests and the strong will on both sides to meet
challenges cooperatively," she said.
</P>
<P>
"In areas where we have differences we do not have a policy of
so-called 'containment.' We approach these differences, such as on
human rights, with mutual respect, candor, and a determination to
achieve real progress," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The best thing we can do to maintain positive momentum in our
relations is to continue to show to our two publics that improved
relations produce positive results for both countries," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Our trade imbalance with China is an indication of continuing
barriers to free trade," according to Albright. "We hope that
China will take steps to improve the access of foreign companies
to its markets. This would benefit the Chinese and American people
and help to bring China closer in line with international
standards."
</P>
<P>
On Taiwan, Albright said the United States maintains a firm
"one China" policy based on the three U.S.-PRC (The People's
Republic of China) joint communiques and the U.S. law. "We
maintain unofficial relations with the people in Taiwan. Because
we believe that cross-Strait communication and exchanges help
promote peace and stability in the region. We have encouraged both
the PRC and Taiwan to resume their cross-Strait dialogue," she
said.
</P>
<P>
On WTO and MFN, President Clinton supports the renewal of
China's most favored nation tariff status, Albright said. The
United States is also working actively with the Chinese government
to achieve China's entry into the World Trade Organization on
commercially viable terms.
</P>
<P>
One of the primary goals of President Clinton's trip to China will
be to increase mutual understanding between the two peoples, Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
The president hopes to be able to show contemporary China to
the American people to help outsiders see its complexity and
diversity.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Issues New Rule on DOSRI Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
on Thursday approved a new ruling to strengthen controls over
banks' directors, officers, stockholders and other related
interest (DOSRI) loans.
</P>
<P>
The new ruling, approved by the central bank's decision-making
body, the Monetary Board, requires DOSRI loan borrowers to waive
their secrecy of deposits in their banks and other banks before
they are allowed to get any loan.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson told reporters that the
new ruling is part of the central bank's crackdown on DOSRI
violations which have been cited as the cause in a couple of bank
failures.
</P>
<P>
"It is one important reform to tighten up on DOSRI rules,"
Singson said.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing DOSRI rules, a DOSRI loan borrower can only
borrow up to 15 percent of the total loan portfolio of a bank.
</P>
<P>
But DOSRI violations are rampant because borrowers are able to
use dummy individuals or corporations.
</P>
<P>
By forcing DOSRI borrowers to waive their right to secrecy of
their deposits, the central bank could better detect if the
borrowers are legitimate and capable of repaying their loans.
</P>
<P>
DOSRI violations can lead to the fall of a bank since the DOSRI
borrowers are basically robbing their own institutions, Singson
said.
</P>
<P>
This was most glaring in the case of Orient Bank wherein the
DOSRI loans reached up to 6.1 billion pesos (156 million U.S.
dollars) or more compared to the bank's total assets of only 8.2
billion pesos (210 million dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
Orient Bank declared a bank holiday in February this year due
to a shortage of cash caused by the DOSRI violations. Most of the
bank's DOSRI loans are non-performing.

<HEADLINE> Laos Takes Measures to Deal With Currency Fluctuation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Lao government has been taking
emergency measures to deal with sharp currency fluctuations, a
report reaching here said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with local media, the Bank of Laos Governor
Cheuang Sombounekhanh said the fluctuation in the currency
exchange, which started on May 18, plunged the value of Laos'
currency, the kip, by 16-20 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the fluctuation has devalued the kip and made the
prices of market goods sky rocket, affecting the lives of the
people.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the situation, the Bank of Laos is considering
measures to normalize the situation, such as raising interest
rates for deposits from 19 percent to 22 percent and selling bonds
to mobilize funds, Cheuang said.
</P>
<P>
The bank will also consolidate the management of gold and other
jewellery shops, establish state-private joint venture currency
exchange shops, and possibly set up an inter-bank monetary
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Cheuang said the main reason for the financial turbulence was
brought on by speculating opportunists trying to take advantage of
the difficult economic times during the financial crisis in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Cheuang also attributed some of the turbulence in the currency
exchange to the release of two new bank notes, the 2,000 and 5,000
kip notes.
</P>
<P>
He said between January and April this year, the kip lost 55
percent of its value, a devaluation rate similar to other
Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Laos cannot avoid the influences of the financial crisis in the
region because of close trade relationships, the governor said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Banks Boost Rates as Dollar Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Three of Australian large banks
including the ANZ Thursday handed the federal government a
pre-election headache, lifting fixed home loan interest rates in
the wake of the plunging Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
And in another psychological blow for the Howard government,
figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed
Australia's unemployment rate crept above the 8-percent mark in
May.
</P>
<P>
As the Aussie dollar clawed its way above 59 U.S. cents
Thursday, the ANZ, Bank S A and St George Bank announced increases
in their fixed-term home loan interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Non-bank lender RAMS also said it would raise its two home loan
fixed interest rates, but the central bank, the Reserve Bank of
Australia, held its nerve on official cash rates.
</P>
<P>
The lenders' announcements came after Treasurer Peter Costello
Wednesday urged against any movement on home loan rates, saying
there was no case to do so because official cash rates had not
budged.
</P>
<P>
Before the local markets opened Thursday Costello again moved
to talk up the economy and rejected any talk of a recession.
</P>
<P>
The treasurer said he is ready for an election "as from now"
and that the state of the economy would be a factor in the timing.
"You would obviously take into account the state of the Australian
economy."
</P>
<P>
Hours later the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed a fall
in employment in May and a rising unemployment rate -- once again
hovering above 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate rose by 0.2 percent for the month to a
seasonally adjusted 8.1 percent while employment fell by 4,700,
the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Employment Minister David Kemp said he expected job growth to
continue and the unemployment rate to fall over the coming months
despite the Asian crisis and economists' predictions of a lag
effect on jobs.
</P>
<P>
Both Kemp and Finance Minister John Fahey refused to speculate
on the movement in the Australian dollar and the possibility of a
rise in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard urged people not to be discouraged
by the fall of the Australian dollar and the Asian economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Don't be discouraged by people running around saying there's a
bit of turmoil, a bit of uncertainty and therefore taxation reform
should be put on the shelf," Howard told the 500 Club in Perth.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Budget Presented to Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Finance Minister Shah
A.M.S. Kibria on Thursday placed before the Jatiya Sangsad, the
country's parliament, the government budget for the 1998-99 fiscal
year beginning July 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The minister announced a 207.76 billion taka (about 4.52
billion U.S. dollars) revenue budget against a proposed
expenditure of 159.37 billion taka (about 3.46 billion dollars),
leaving a surplus of 48.39 billion taka (about 1.05 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The revenue surplus of the coming fiscal would go toward
financing the Annual Development Program of 136 billion taka
(about 2.96 billion dollars), the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed outlay for the revenue for the coming fiscal year
was 10.6 percent higher than the revised revenue of 187.77 billion
taka (about 4.08 billion dollars) of the current fiscal, with the
expenditure 9.9 percent higher than the revised budget of the
1997-98 fiscal.
</P>
<P>
The revenue receipts for the coming fiscal have been estimated
at 19.99 billion taka (about 435 million dollars) higher than the
revised revenue receipts of the current financial year of 187.77
billion taka (about 4.08 billion dollars) which shows a decrease
of 8.47 billion taka (about 184 million dollars) over the original
target.
</P>
<P>
The new budget would be up for adoption by the parliament by
June 30, on which the current fiscal year ends. Besides the
budget, the session may also consider some other bills, such as
the Code of Civil Procedure Amendment Bill, before it ends on July
10.

Members of parliament from the major opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party and the Jammat-e-Islami were absent from

<HEADLINE> S. African Coach to Join Top English Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- South African national soccer
team coach Philippe Troussier will be heading for England for his
next assignment after the World Cup, local media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Troussier confirmed Wednesday that he has agreed terms with
English club Sheffield. "I have been approached and have agreed to
join Sheffield after the World Cup," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Safa (South African Football Association) had not approached
me about staying on with South Africa after the World Cup and I
have exercised my option to sign up with Sheffield," the Frenchman
said.
</P>
<P>
Troussier has a contract to coach South Africa until after the
World Cup with an agreement he could take up any other offer then.
</P>
<P>
Before taking over the South African team, Troussier had
coached national teams of Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria and Burkina
Faso. He took Burkina Faso to the semifinals of the African
Nations Cup in February against all expectations.
</P>
<P>
But the 43-year-old coach has not had an easy transition in
South Africa and has had a run-in with the media since he took the
reins in March.
</P>
<P>
His abrasive style did not endear him to some who accused him
of being uncooperative and rough on players.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Pushes for New Banking Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
is pushing for a piece of legislation that would immediately put
banks declaring a bank holiday under the government's supervision
to protect the interests of depositors.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Deputy Governor Alberto Reyes told reporters
Thursday that the proposed legislation is part of a whole package
of legislative reforms the central bank is drawing up for the
entire banking system.
</P>
<P>
Under this proposal, Reyes said, a bank declaring a bank
holiday will be immediately put under the supervision of the
Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC).
</P>
<P>
This will make the rehabilitation of the bank easier and enable
the PDIC to immediately pay off insured depositors when the bank
is finally closed, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, a bank can declare a bank holiday almost
indefinitely without being put under PDIC supervision until it is
ordered closed by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
This has been the case with Orient Bank which has been under a
bank holiday since February this year. There is still no end in
sight as to whether it will be rehabilitated or closed and
liquidated for good.
</P>
<P>
The PDIC, under present rules, only takes over a bank once the
central bank declares it insolvent and orders its closure.
</P>
<P>
The central bank is preparing a package of legislative reforms
for the banking system as part of the continuing effort to
strengthen the banking system which has already felt the bite of
the protracted Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Besides Orient Bank, two other small banks have been ordered by
the central bank to shut down this year due to serious cash-flow
problems.

<HEADLINE> NATO Considering Military Intervention in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- NATO defense ministers expressed
their preparedness on Thursday to intervene militarily "within
days" if Belgrade does not stop its use of force against civilians
in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) official told
reporters on Thursday that the ministers were prepared to make a
decision regarding military intervention after further
consultation and discussion.
</P>
<P>
A timetable would be set for Belgrade to settle the Kosovo
crisis peacefully, or the Western military alliance would step
forward with its own action, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"Days rather than weeks is the timetable because there are
lessons to be learned from Bosnia," British Defense Secretary
George Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that patience was running out among the allies and
that Belgrade needs to get the message that NATO means business
and that military intervention could start within days unless
Belgrade stops its offensive against Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO defense ministers are meeting in Brussels to discuss and
decide what action the alliance could take in helping solve the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Naumann, chairman of NATO's Military Committee, said
earlier that air strikes could be called to force Belgrade to stop
its indiscriminate use of force against civilians in its Serbian
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Military Committee is the highest military authority within
the 16-nation alliance.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the 15-nation European Union decided
Monday to enact bans on all new European investment in Serbia and
freeze Belgrade's state-held funds in EU countries.
</P>
<P>
An arms embargo and a ban on the delivery of police equipment
to Serbia are already in force.

JOHANNESBURG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Japan will provide 10
million Rand (1.9 million U.S. Dollars) to Lesotho to help the
tiny southern African mountain kingdom to improve its food
production, according to an agreement signed Thursday in Maseru.

The grant will enable the Lesotho government to buy

Hatakenaka and Lesotho's Foreign Minister, Tom Thabane, signed

</P>
<P>
Hatakenaka said the assistance is aimed at encouraging
Lesotho's self-sufficiency in food production as the country's
farming sector is still recovering from the drastic effects of
drought in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth grant provided by Japan since 1986 to help
Lesotho to increase food production. The grants totaled 49.5
million Rand (9.7 million Dollars), Hatakenaka said.

MOSCOW, June 11 (Xinhua) -- President of the Yugoslav
Federation Slobodan Milosevic will meet his Russian counterpart
Boris Yeltsin to discuss the Kosovo crisis during a two-day visit
to Moscow on June 15-16, the Russian presidential press service
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic is expected to discuss the crisis in its Kosovo
region with Yeltsin and other Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and his Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov held a
telephone conversation Thursday on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that Moscow is trying to exert its influence
with its traditional ally Belgrade to seek a peaceful settlement
to the crisis amid Western threats of a military solution.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, NATO defense ministers are pondering intervention
by force.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry has urged Belgrade and its Kosovo
region resume talks as soon as possible and stressed its
opposition to the use of NATO forces in Kosovo. Ethnic Albanian
comprise 90 percent of the population, and the province is
demanding independence from the Serbian Republic of the Yugoslav
Federation.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 people have reportedly been killed in clashes
between government forces and armed militants of the Albanian
independence movement.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, members of the six-nation Contact Group, which
monitors crises in the Balkans, discussed Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Blot, the French representative, said the group plans
to propose a "phase of persuasion" during which Russia will help
negotiate with the Yugoslav federation and the ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic's Moscow visit next week is apparently part of
Russia's efforts to broker a peaceful solution to the crisis in
the "phase of persuasion."

<HEADLINE> Agencies Ask for Helicopters for Afghan Quake Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and the
International Committee of the Red Cross Thursday issued a second
urgent appeal for helicopters to aid victims of an Afghanistan
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made as the response to an earlier appeal was
totally insufficient, according to the two organizations.
</P>
<P>
Both organizations, as well as several donor governments, have
been battling for more than a week now to bring additional
helicopters in to deliver assistance to the victims of the May
30th earthquake in northern Afghanistan, said a press release by
the Office of the U.N. Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator for
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
So far, despite making agreements for 10 more helicopters, none
has appeared, it said.
</P>
<P>
"This is unbelievably frustrating. In fact, it's scandalous
given that so many lives are at stake," Witschi-Cestari, U.N.
Coordinator for Afghanistan, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Deals have been agreed, contracts made, and still, 11 days
after the earthquake, only a tiny fleet of helicopters is
operating. This is slowing down the whole relief operation and
preventing us from delivering help to people in desperate need of
clean water, food and shelter," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We desperately need the extra helicopters," he said. "The
donors are coming forward with money to pay for them. We have
supplies in Afghanistan to deliver. We call on governments and
companies in the region to offer us helicopters. Without them, we
can only deliver a fraction of what is needed."
</P>
<P>
An earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale rocked
Afghanistan's northern province of Badkhshan and Takhar late last
month, killing more than 3,000 people.

WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The House of Representatives voted to rewrite the nation's
bankruptcy laws, approving a plan that would make it harder for
cash-strapped individuals to wipe out their debts.
</P>
<P>
-- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright dismissed as

<P>
HARARE, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's year-on-year inflation is
now creeping towards the 30 percent level, after pegging at 29.3
percent for May, the highest since April 1993.
</P>
<P>
This was 2.9 percentage points up from April level of 26.4 percent
according to the Central Statistical Office's latest review on price
trend released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Inflation had been on the high side since the beginning of the

<P>
There has been an upsurge in the consumer prices for all item
categories except for drinks and tobacco, according to the

</P>
<P>
Increases in the consumer price indexes for clothing and footwear,

<HEADLINE> No-Confidence Motion Against Japanese PM Submitted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Three Japanese opposition parties
Thursday submitted a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto's cabinet over its poor handling of the battered
economy.
</P>
<P>
The motion was sent to congress by leaders of the opposition
Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), the Liberal Party (LP) and the
Japanese Communist Party (JCP), Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's cabinet should take responsibility for its
"deflationary" policy partly brought about by last year's fiscal
austerity law, DPJ head Naoto Kan said.
</P>
<P>
A law on fiscal structure reform, which was enacted last
November, demanded the government reduce the combined deficit
of central and local governments below three percent of gross
domestic products.
</P>
<P>
The leader also criticized the government for wavering on
policy changes, delayed response to the bad loan problem and a
lack of political ethics.
</P>
<P>
The motion, however, is doomed to be killed at Friday's plenary
session of the lower house, which is controlled by the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) headed by Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
Members of the LDP's one-time non-cabinet ally, the Social
Democratic Party (SDP), and the New Party Sakigake, an ally of the
LDP, are expected to disapprove the motion.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese economy, once the second largest in the world, has
ground to a standstill since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Despite an April stimulus spending package of a record 16
trillion yen (123 billion dollars), the Japanese currency slid
below the 141-yen level Tuesday for the first time in seven years.
</P>
<P>
Japan's fiscal deficit, which currently equals seven percent of
the GDP, is expected to reach 529 trillion yen by March 1999.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Get $30m for Debt Servicing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- International donors have agreed
to contribute 30.2 million U.S. Dollars to support the government
Ministry of Finance said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent donor's conference on Rwanda held in
Stockholm, Sweden, the director of macro-economic analysis in the
Ministry of Finance, Prosper Musafiri said, "Donors agreed to
service only the debt owed to three multilaterals: World Bank,
IFAD and ADB as the main creditors and most obligatory ones", the
Rwandan News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government of Rwanda had requested 122.3 million
U.S.Dollars to service the external debt during that meeting.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1997, Rwanda's total external debt is about 1.2
billion Dollars (including arrears amounting to 97.5 million
Dollars) which makes 65 percent of the country's national GDP, as
shown by the statistics presented in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
And 81 percent of this amount (about 947 million Dollars) was
owed to multilateral creditors, while bilateral creditors were
owed 16 percent, equal to 181 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Suppliers credits amounted to 37.4 million Dollars which is
three percent of the total debt.
</P>
<P>
On the internal debts, Rwandan government owes about 26.3
million U.S.Dollars to the local creditors.
</P>
<P>
However, the government represented by the Minister of
Finance, Donald Kaberuka, signed an accord last year with
internal creditors on how the government will be eable to pay
debts within 15 years beginning from 1998.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Companies Urged to Be "Euro-Ready" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's companies have to
be "euro-ready" to take advantage of a single currency within
Europe's Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) member countries,
Citibank EMU specialist and foreign exchange sales head Stephen Li
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysian companies which are euro-ready stand to gain the
most from the creation of the EMU, one of the largest economic
restructurings the world has ever seen," he said in a statement
issued by Citibank.
</P>
<P>
"Even if Malaysian companies feel relatively insulated, they
will still have to make or receive the occasional euro payment
which will require that their financial systems be able to do so,"
Li said.
</P>
<P>
Based on 1997 figures, the EMU will become Malaysia's third
largest trading market behind the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The EMU, scheduled to kick off on January 1, 1999, will have 11
countries as its initial members, namely Germany, Austria,
Belgium, Finland, France, Luxembourg, Ireland, Italy, Spain,
Portugal and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
A fixed exchange rate between the currencies of EMU member
countries and the euro will be held until the currencies cease to
exist on July 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
"There are many business opportunities to be explored given the
vibrant economic cooperation between Europe and the Asia Pacific
region," Li added.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Yen Blamed for Indonesian Rupiah's Weakness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian central bank has
attributed the rupiah's (the country's national currency) weak
condition in the last few days to external factors, especially the
Japanese yen's depreciation against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
In the last few days, the rupiah continued to drop against the
U.S. dollar and traded at 15,000 per dollar on Thursday, the
lowest level since January this year.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah is expected to regain strength after the
disbursement of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan, Bank
Indonesia Governor Syahril Sabirin said here Thursday following a
meeting with President B. J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
The IMF is scheduled to disburse its third tranche of 1 billion
U.S. dollars in early July. Indonesia has received 4 billion
dollars from the IMF which had organized a 43 billion dollar
bailout package to Indonesia since October last year.
</P>
<P>
Local currency dealers said the fluctuation of the rupiah was
most possibly caused by the uncertain political climate in the
country, such as widespread demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
It could also be caused by the weakening of the yen which hit
140 against the greenback, they said.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has lost more than 80 percent of its value against
the U.S. dollar since July last year when the monetary crisis
started in the Southeast Asian region.

<HEADLINE> Army Officers Arrested for Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Five South Korean Army officers have
been arrested for accepting money from parents of young men who
asked for exemption from the mandatory 26-month military service
or better assignments, the Defense Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The five officers of the Military Manpower Administration
allegedly received a total of 540 million won (about 400,000
U.S. dollars) from parents of 138 soldiers for granting the
exemptions or better assignments.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the 138 soldiers will be re-evaluated.
</P>
<P>
The scandal, the largest one in the military's history, was
brought to light amid suspicions that wealthy or influential
people, businessmen and executives of large corporations,
attempted to get military exemptions for their sons.
</P>
<P>
The ministry revealed the names of 12 fathers who bribed
officers, but didn't disclose names of those parents whose sons
received better assignments.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Defense Minister Chun Yong-taek apologized to the
public for the scandal, vowing to take measures to prevent similar
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
"I deeply apologize for these irregularities, and the Defense
Ministry will continue to push reform so that such a scandal will
not happen again," Chun said in a statement.

<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The economy of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) is believed to be capable of
smoothly overcoming difficulties amidst the lingering Asian
financial crisis, Premier Zhu Rongji said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks when meeting with a Hong Kong
General Chamber of Commerce delegation led by its chairman Peter
Sutch.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is a well-grounded market economy-oriented region
with advantages in the sectors of international finance and free
port, according to Zhu. "I believed that the HKSAR government
is capalbe of properly handling the current situation and Hong
Kong's economy can smoothly pass over the current difficult period
caused by the Asian financial turmoil," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the delegation of the state economic operation
and reform.
</P>
<P>
Sutch said that although the Hong Kong economy has met some
difficulties, the situation is not as bad as some people have
imagined. The local economy has inland China as its powerful
backing force, the support from the central government and the
commitment of not devaluing the RMB, he added.
</P>
<P>
He told the premier that the HKSAR government is making efforts
to tackle the problems and the business circle in Hong Kong will
support such efforts of the government.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the central government will continue
to support Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1861, the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce now
has more than 4,000 member units, whose combined output value
accounts to 75 percent of Hong Kong's GNP.
</P>
<P>
The delegation came here at the invitation of the China
Council for Promoting International Trade.

twon of Baidoa are now being stricken by famine and severe
diarrhoea.
</P>
<P>
RRA humanitarian secretary, Sheikh Qasim Ibrahum Nur, said the
worst affected areas are the villages of Seydhelow and Bulo
Barakow, about 40 Km South of Baidoa, where dozens of people have
fallen for the diarrhoea with no one to treat them.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea to Defend Use of Land Mines at U.N. Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will demand that the use
of land mines be exempt from the category of `war-crime behavior'
when it attends a U.N. conference on the proposed establishment of an
International criminal court.
</P>
<P>
"South Korea and the United States will oppose including land
mines in the category of banned weapons," a spokesman of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 nations will discuss the creation of the international
court, which will handle exclusively war-related crimes, at the
U.N. conference in Rome from June 15 to July 17.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Hague Tribunal, which only passes legal judgments,
the new court will indict, pass sentence and punish war criminals.
</P>
<P>
Some European countries demand that the soon-to-be established
court should put land mines on the list of banned weapons, and
that those who use them should be punished for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
But other countries, including the United States, oppose such a
detailed list of banned weapons. They prefer comprehensive, not
specific, regulations on weapons.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has been opposed to signing a worldwide treaty on
banning anti-personnel land mines. The mines, it said, have been a
integral part of its national defense for half a century.
</P>
<P>
About one million mines are believed to be buried along the
Demilitarized Zone, which is four kilometers wide and 249
kilometers long, and divides the Korean Peninsula into two parts.

CAIRO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat has put off his Cairo visit scheduled for

Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will first go to Italy and Vatican Friday for a two-day

Arafat is supposed to brief Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on

support for an Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
Arafat pinned the hope on the summit to reach a unified Arab
stance toward the Israeli hardline policy, especially after Israel
rejected a U.S. proposal to withdraw its troops from 13 percent
more in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But the Arab summit seems not a matter within days due to
differences among the Arab countries over its venue, timing and
agenda.
</P>

<P>
LUANDA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaria has come up to be the No.
1 killer in Angola, claiming 6,000 lives each year, a senior
Angolan official has said.
</P>
<P>
Filomeno Fortes, Director for the Malaria Prevention Planning
Agency, revealed the figure Wednesday at the closing ceremony of
a seminar on the diagnosing, curing and prevention of malaria
held in Cacauco near Luanda.
</P>
<P>
He said that about 6,000 died of malaria each year among the
three million sufferers who went to see doctors for the disease.
</P>
<P>
The tropical weather, plus the bad sanitation condition
resulting mainly from the long years of civil war, have lead to
the fast spread of the disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the above-mentioned toll figure is only the
registered number from hospitals. The actually malaria figure
could be much bigger as many who suffer from malaria simply
didn't go to hospital.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, Fortes said, is part of the joint efforts by the
World Health Organization and the Angolan government to prevent
malaria.

<P>
"Over the past decade most Chinese villages have held three
direct elections of village officials, and the concept
of 'democratic election' has become deeply rooted in many farmers'
minds," said Zhang the director.
</P>
<P>
However, he conceded that efforts made to improve democracy in
village management remain far from enough nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The idea of promoting open management of village affairs was
formally promulgated in 1994, but only half of the villages in
China have adopted this system so far, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"No matter how democratic and successful a village election is,
if the farmers' democratic rights to take part in and monitor
village management can't be guaranteed, the democracy which
emerges will just be incomplete, fragile and short-lived," Zhang
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that, apart from adding impetus to the
building of democracy, the system of open management of village
affairs will also effectively reinforce the anti-corruption
efforts by the Party and the government.
</P>
<P>
"An extensive fight against corruption in the vast countryside
will exert a great influence on the entire nation," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The system of open management of village affairs will not only
deter dishonest officials from trying to seek personal benefits
with their power, but also serve as a channel of mutual
understanding between the officials and the people, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it can help improve the image of the Party and the
government in the farmers' minds, and promote reform, development
and stability in the rural areas," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Taxation Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature today
urged concerned government departments to speed up drafting the
revision of the current taxation law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Standing Committee of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC) plans to check the enforcement of the Law
on the Administration of Taxation in July.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee today called together senior
officials of the Ministry of Finance, the State General
Administration of Taxation and the Supreme People's Court to
discuss how to improve the country's taxation system.
</P>
<P>
The Law on the Administration of Taxation, which was adopted in
1993, is aimed at securing a continuous, steady growth of revenue
for the country.
</P>
<P>
"The total taxation revenue in the past five years was valued
at 2.75 trillion yuan (about 331 billion US dollars)," said Lu
Renfa, deputy commissioner of the General Administration of
Taxation.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the taxation value has increased by 17.5
percent annually in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement organs throughout the country punished more
than 6.47 million tax evaders and other related offenders between
1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
The country has already established the tax declaration
system. "The awareness of paying taxes has greatly improved among
the people, and effective checks have reduced the amount of tax
evasion," said Gao Qiang, assistant minister of finance.
</P>
<P>
The traditional planned economy in China made the Chinese
people lack the awareness of paying taxes. Moreover, some taxation
bodies sometimes only loosely enforced the law.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Ponders Referendum on Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Thursday hinted at holding a national referendum on
further Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Before his meeting with visiting Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer, Netanyahu told reporters that taking the issue
to the public is "one of the possibilities" aimed at making a
decision on further withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel is making efforts to reach an agreement
with the Palestinians on the scope of the pullback, over which the
peace talks between two sides have been stalled for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
But he demanded reciprocity from the Palestinians so as to
advance the peace process, saying the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) must take measures to ensure the security
interests of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has accepted a United States proposal calling on Israel
to hand over 13.1 percent more of the West Bank in the second
stage pullback under the signed agreement between the Palestinians
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, however, rejected the proposal. The right-wingers in
the ruling Likud coalition even threatened to bring down the
government if Netanyahu agrees to yield more than 9 percent to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from the U.S. and the world, some members of the
Knesset (Parliament) have suggested that Netanyahu could bypass
the cabinet by holding a referendum on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists List 100 Major Scientific Puzzles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- One hundred major scientific
puzzles were listed for the first time by 118 Chinese scientists,
including 25 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
A collection of papers on the 100 topics such as substance
structure, mechanics-turbulence, extraterrestrial civilization and
migrating to space and earthquake mechanism, were published today
by the Jilin People's Publishing House, which is named 100
Scientific Puzzles in the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
"All the 100 scientific puzzles were selected from the
frontier of basic science researches. Most of them belong
to the science of nature, and some have much to do with the social
science especially philosophy," said Li Xixian, head of the
selecting group and an official with the CAS.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Guangzhao, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress and former president of the CAS, said
that the listing of the scientific puzzles will greatly push forward
China's scientific research, since "asking questions is the first
step of making progress."
</P>
<P>
"Currently many researchers put their attention only onto minor
issues. As a result, their findings cannot bring the nation's
science research to a new level," he said. "We should focus more
efforts on these major scientific puzzles so as to make more
breakthrough."
</P>
<P>
At a meeting marking the publication of the book 100 Scientific
Puzzles in the 21st Century, Lin Quan, an official with the
Ministry of Science and Technology, said that while the external
conditions for scientific research are getting better and better
in China, encouraging the spirit of blazing new trials has come to
be the most important thing.
</P>
<P>
"The listing of the 100 scientific puzzles will help encourage
more pioneering work and new ideas," he said.
</P>
<P>
A deputy editor-in-chief from the Jilin People's Publishing
House said at the meeting that the development of sciences in
China needs more concerns from the national and the society.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that in the next century more scientific puzzles will
be settled by Chinese scientists, we hope that in the next century
China can have the honor to have its own Nobel Prize winners," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Syria Urges Ending Arab Normalization with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Syria urged the Arab countries to
commit themselves to the decisions made by the 1996 Arab summit,
which call for a halt of normalization with Israel if it fails to
fulfill its obligations.
</P>
<P>
"Syria believed such commitments are preconditions to make the
proposed Arab summit a success," a Syrian diplomatic source, who
asked not to be named, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and Syria are
spearheading an effort for a common Arab stance to confront the
hardline Israel after it failed to accept a U.S. formula on troop
redeployment in the West Bank, which is widely seen as a way to
get the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks back on track.
</P>
<P>
The formula calls on Israel to pull back its troops from 13
percent more of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Citing security reasons, Israel has so far boycotted the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat began to push for an Arab
summit to adopt an unified stance toward Israel's intransigence
shortly after Israel refused to buy the U.S. compromise formula.
</P>
<P>
But the proposed Arab summit is still just on paper due to the
differences among the Arab states over how to deal with Israel
and the reported U.S. pressure for delaying the summit.
</P>
<P>
Syria, PNA and some more want to see a hardline Arab stance
while some others, such as Egypt and Jordan, favor a more moderate
approach.

<HEADLINE> Transparency New Focus in China's Rural Democracy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Having promoted democracy in the
rural areas for a decade, the Chinese government is now shifting
its focus from holding direct elections of village leadership to
ensuring greater transparency in village management and tighter
supervision of village officials by local people.
</P>
<P>
Major Chinese news media today published a circular jointly
issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
and the State Council, the country's cabinet, which requires the
country's nearly one million villages to adopt a system called
"open management of village affairs".
</P>
<P>
Under this system, village officials are obliged to make
regular reports to the entire village on the village's financial
conditions and other major affairs that have an impact on the
local people's interests.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very important and timely document, which reflects the
central authorities' strong advocacy of an open and democratic
village management system," said Zhang Mingliang, director of the
Grassroots Power Building Department under the Ministry of Civil
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1988, the Chinese government required all village
officials to be directly elected by all the villagers, instead of
being appointed by governments at higher levels.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, it also started to promote a system called
"villagers' self-government" in the countryside. The system
features "four democracies", namely, democratic election (of
village officials), democratic decision-making (in village
management), democratic management (of village affairs) and
democratic supervision (by the villagers over the village
leadership).

<HEADLINE> Yen's Depreciation No Help to East Asian Economy: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao today urged Japan and countries related to take
effective measures to prevent the Japanese yen devaluating further.
</P>
<P>
The yen's consistent depreciation will not help stabilize the
present financial turmoil in the East Asia financial market, Zhu
said at today's routine press conference.
</P>
<P>
Japan and other countries with influence in the Asian financial
sphere should face the facts with courage and wisdom, make their
co-operation closer and create the necessary conditions for the
restoration of the regional economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Considering the position of the Japanese economy and the yen in
the world economy, China is extremely concerned about the yen's
recent consistent depreciation against the US dollar, which has
caused another round of turmoil in the Southeast Asia financial
market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he reaffirmed that China's policy of keeping its
currency stable has not changed.
</P>
<P>
The East Asia financial crisis has caused some difficulties for
Hong Kong's economy, Zhu said, pointing to the fact that Hong
Kong's economic growth rate has slowed down, and the first quarter
even saw a decrease.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, the basic factors of the Hong Kong
economy have remained sound, its foreign exchange reserve is
abundant and the financial administration mechanism is
healthy. Moreover, the economy in inland China has retained
sustained development, he said, expressing confidence that Hong
Kong's economy will shake off the present inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
is undertaking measures to invigorate the local economy, and the
central government supports all its efforts in this regard,
including safeguarding the link between the Hong Kong dollar and
the US dollar, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
To maintain Hong Kong's status as an international financial
center, it is important to keep their exchange rate stable, he
noted.

<HEADLINE> Macao Office of Preparatory Committee Secretariat Inaugurated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Preparatory Committee of the
Macao Special Administrative Region (SARPC) inaugurated its Macao
secretariat office Thursday to canvas opinions from all quarters
of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The main task of the Macao office is to provide help to SARPC
members, to serve as a liaison and reception office. It also
handles letters and visits from local residents, said Chen Ziying,
secretary-general of the SARPC, who unveiled the name plaque of
the office here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Established last May in Beijing, the SARPC is responsible for a
series of issues for the founding of the Macao Special
Administrative Region. They include the formation of the first
Macao SAR government, the first legislature and the judiciary
bodies of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that to accomplish these tasks, it is necessary to
listen to opinions and suggestions from Macao residents.
</P>
<P>
"The setting up of the Macao secretariat office will help (the
SARPC) listen to the opinions and proposals of Macao residents so
that decisions made by the SARPC will be in better keeping with
the actual situation in Macao, and better represent the wills of
Macao residents," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao said here today that the 6th Meeting of the Diplomatic and
Military Experts Group on the China-India Boundary Issue has failed
to make any progress.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing, Zhu said that the meeting held here on June
8-9 is a routine one, but both sides mainly exchanged views on the
present situation of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Chinese side has pointed out that leaders
of the Indian government have made frequent remarks to slander
China recently, and this has hurt the feeling of the Chinese
people and damaged the sound development climate for bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
China has strongly demanded India to halt all groundless
attacks of China, and to take practical actions to bring
bilateral ties back to the track for normal development, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Ruhe Blasts on Deteriorating Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- German Defense Minister Volker
Ruhe blamed Serbia on Thursday for attempting to "systematically
create a buffer zone between Kosovo and Albania."
</P>
<P>
The Serbian government, Ruhe said, resorted to regular armed
forces in ethnic cleansing by means of using tanks and artillery
indiscriminately against the civilian population in the Serbian
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The new level of violence was posing a threat to the security
and stability in the entire Balkan region, he told a North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) defense ministers meeting.
</P>
<P>
The NATO defense ministers were here to discuss military
options to stop the violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Ruhe said political, economic and strategic means are needed to
influence Belgrade to stop forthwith the excessive use of force
against civilians and to withdraw its special police and armed
forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade should also be pressured into constructive dialogues
and negotiations in search for a peaceful solution, he said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO has decided to stage an air-land joint military
exercise in Albania before the end of August.
</P>
<P>
In addition, sources close to the NATO Military Committee said
the defense ministers are expected to announce new military
exercises to be held soon in Albania to demonstrate the visibility
of the alliance in the region.
</P>
<P>
The ministers were said to be considering air strikes and a
no-fly zone in Kosovo to force Belgrade into accepting the terms
the international community has set out.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the 15-nation European Union met on Monday
to enact bans on all new European investment in Serbia and a
freeze on Belgrade's state-held funds in EU countries as new
sanctions against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Already in force are arms embargo and delivery of police
equipment to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The EU also appealed the NATO to accelerate the study process
of its military options.
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers, in their council meeting late last
month, authorized the military branch of the alliance to study
what the NATO could do to help resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said after the foreign
ministers meeting that NATO did not rule out anything in its
pursuit for a solution to the Kosovo crisis.

<HEADLINE> S. African Bank Raises Lending Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Absa, the biggest commercial
bank in South Africa, has announced to lift its lending rates and
mo lending rates by two percentage points, sparking fears
that chances for higher economic growth in the country would be
severely damaged.
</P>
<P>
Absa said Wednesday the lending rate will increase from 18.25
percent to 20.25 with effect from Thursday. Mortgage lending
rates go up as follows: new loans from June 11; existing loans
from July 1; and loans with a one month's notice period from
August 1.
</P>
<P>
For now, South Africa's major banks chose to remain
tight-lipped after Absa's announcement.
</P>
<P>
Most banks said they were still weighing their options.
However, speculation is that most of the banks will soon follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
"We are still considering our options and have not made a
decision yet," a spokesperson of the First National Bank said
soon after Absa's announcement.
</P>
<P>
Standard Bank's Eric Larsen also said: "We are not yet
prepared to issue a statement in that regard."
</P>
<P>
Claire Gebhard-Mann, General Manager of the Banking Council of
South Africa, said that banks had been hesitant to go the route
of lending rates hikes, but the hikes were the logical way to go,
given the current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Absa's increase comes a few weeks after South African Reserve
Bank (SARB) Governor Chris Stals asked banks not to up interest
rates, citing the stabilization of the Rand, the national
currency of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Rand, which fell to 5.20 Rand against one U.S. Dollar in
May, stablized to 5.11 Rand after the SARB increased its repo
rate, the rates at which the central bank lends to commercial
banks on May 26 to ward off speculators.
</P>
<P>
Last week the SARB cut the repo rate by half a percentage
point. The Rand fell to 5.1935 against U.S. dollar Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night Finance Minister Trevor Manuel also appealed
to banks not to increase their rates.
</P>
<P>
Local economists said the interest rate hike, though
temporary, will take a heavy toll on economic growth. They
forecast the rate of growth in gross domestic product this year
at a paltry one percent, compared with initial expectations of
about two percent and recent projections of more than 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
GDP growth next year can be as low as two percent to three
percent, compared with earlier hopes of about 3.5 percent,
economists said.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Progress in Exploring Overseas Oilfields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China has gained great headway in
exploring overseas oilfields and has been granted the rights to
contract, operate and hold shares in an increasing number of
oilfields in other countries, including Canada, Peru, and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has had an annual oil supply of 700,000 tons from
overseas oilfields which it has contracted to operate, either
wholly or partly, marking a major breakthrough in expanding the
international oil market.
</P>
<P>
And the establishment of the China Overseas Oil and Gas Co. Ltd,
a subsidiary of the China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), has
attracted close attention of the international oil circle.
</P>
<P>
CNOOC has by now purchased 32.58 percent of the stock from the
Indonesian Malacca Oilfield, becoming its largest
shareholder. China has obtained 400,000 tons of oil a year from
the Malacca Oilfield since 1994. And by now, CNOOC has taken back
all its investments.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, CNOOC has succeeded in expanding its technological
presence in the world oil market. The overseas projects taken on
by CNOOC include an offshore platform in the United Arab Emirates,
offshore oil drilling in Japan, and geophysical prospecting and
seismic data collection in some other countries.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, CNOOC experts have been invited to act as
technological advisors for oil exploration in Kazakhstan.

<HEADLINE> Tension Builds up in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Tension is building up in Nigeria
as the government has warned pro-democracy groups to call off
their planned rally Friday to mark the annulled June 12, 1993
election.
</P>
<P>
In the southern metropolis of Lagos, which is center of
pro-democracy groups, police spokesman Young Arabame Wednesday
warned organizers of any rally without permit to be ready for the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
State Administrator Colonel Mohammed Marwa said the same day
that the proposed mass rally is unnecessary at the time when the
nation is mourning the death of late head of state, General Sani
Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he called on the groups to embrace the hand of
friendship extended to Nigerians, including those in self-exile,
by the new leader, General Abdulsalam Abubakar, who has promised
to continue Abacha's transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
The administrator warned that the security agencies are ready
to ensure that peace and tranquillity of the state are not
disturbed under any guise.
</P>
<P>
He urged all law-abiding citizens to go about their lawful
businesses Friday with the confidence that the government has the
capacity and the will to prevent any unlawful demonstration or
breakdown of law and order throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that he will prefer, at this period of
national mourning, to avoid any situation that will necessitate
the use of force.
</P>
<P>
Despite Abubakar's pledge to continue the transition program
in his maiden national broadcast Tuesday night, pro-democracy
groups have criticized the speech as vague and empty, failing to
address key issues such as June 12 and political detainees.
</P>
<P>
The groups now demand that the government forgets about the
transition program. Instead, they want a national unity
government headed by Moshood Abiola, the widely-expected winner
of the 1993 election now in jail.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Action Committee of Nigeria (JACON), an umbrella of
52 pro-democracy groups, has called for mass rallies Friday
throughout the country to mark the 5th anniversary of June 12.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Wednesday in Lagos, the organization
said, "Traders should lock up their shops and markets. Students
should boycott lectures. Drivers and road transport owners
should keep their vehicles off the road. Churches and mosques
should encourage their members to join the peaceful mass
rallies."

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Warns over Ozone Depleting Substances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has warned
of adverse effects through ozone depleting substances in the east
African country, calling for a controlled production and use of
chemicals concerned.
</P>
<P>
Currently the nation consumes a total of 600 tons of the ozone
depleting substances which entails use of about 300 tons of
methyl bromide in protection of food grains in stores, local
press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We must strike the balance between the two (protections of
food and ozone layer) by having alternative storage chemical,
that is environmentally friendly," said Jesse Maia, the
assistance minister for environmental conservation, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, we must protect our food, but ozone layer is equally
important," he told a one-day seminar.
</P>
<P>
"A number of chemicals including methyl bromide and some other
man-made chemicals are directly involved in destroying the ozone
layer faster than it is formed naturally," said Maia.
</P>
<P>
"If the controls recommended by the Montreal Protocol are
followed, it is predicted that the stratospheric ozone layer
would recover by about 2030, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that his ministry is preparing a draft Environmental
Management Protection Bill which would be tabled in parliament
soon.

<HEADLINE> Information Technology to Be Boosted in East Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Some 18 billion Shillings (295
million U.S. Dollars) will be invested in information technology
in the east African region this year, the BMI Techknowledg
Africa has announced in a survey.
</P>
<P>
Kenya will have half of the total investment followed by
Tanzania with 30 percent and Uganda with the rest, the survey was
quoted by local press reports as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The East Africa Information Technology Survey, the first of
its kind in the region, said that two thirds of the new
investments in information technology will be spent on public and
private telecommunications sectors.
</P>
<P>
It said that the telecommunications infrastructure of Kenya is
low with less than one line for every 100 people.
</P>
<P>
The density is, however, higher compared to some other African
countries with a density of 0.4 percent of the population. South
Africa is the exception with over 10 lines for every 100 people.
</P>
<P>
"Customers have access to a wider and internationally more
competitive array of services in Tanzania and Uganda, where
private sector is servicing strategic niche markets which are
vitally important especially for multi-national companies," the
survey said.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that although revenue per phone line in Kenya
is nearly 15 percent higher than the sub-regional average,
productivity per employee was over 30 percent below the regional
average and less than half of the average for all of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are about 8,000 Internet users in Kenya, 20
percent of them home users, according to the survey.

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM Chairman Arrives in Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Richard Butler, chairman of the
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, arrived here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Butler and the delegation accompanying him arrived at the
Habbaniya military airport, 80 kilometers west of Baghdad at noon.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM chairman is expected to hold talks with Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on tasks Iraq has to fulfill in
order to get the U.N. economic sanctions lifted. He will leave
here next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Butler paid his last visit to Baghdad late March. U.N. arms
inspectors entered Iraq's presidential sites on the same day he
left here but found no prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, when Butler briefed the U.N. Security
Council on his bi-annual technical report on Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction, he gave a list of priority tasks that Iraq has
to fulfill.
</P>
<P>
The priority tasks, called as a "road map" for Iraq to follow
to secure the lifting of the crippling sanctions against it,
requires Iraq to meet fully its obligations to provide access to
all necessary materials, documents and information concerning the
areas of ballistic missiles, chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
Butler reportedly said if Iraq can give the highest quality of
cooperation in this regard, UNSCOM can present the Security
Council a report in October that will be quite different from the
previous ones, and UNSCOM can move its work faster.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM must certify that all Iraq's chemical, biological
weapons and ballistic missiles have been accounted for and
destroyed before the Security Council can consider lifting the
sanctions that have been in place since Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990.

<HEADLINE> 30 km Electric Fence Removed from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Botswana is dismantling a
30-km long electric fence along Botswana-Namibia border, informed
sources reaching here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Work on rolling back a section of the killer barrier in
Ngamiland in northern Botswana, started more than two weeks ago,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The erection of the electric fence along the border,
stretching from Caprivi's Mahango Game Reserve to the Kwando
River, resulted in game, including elephants, giraffes, buffalos
and kudus, suffering a tortur death after getting entangled in
the fence during migration between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Concerns were raised in Botswana and Namibia over the
disruption of natural migratory routes and the impact on the
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Namibia reportedly launched a top-level probe into the
negative impact of the fence last year and also raised the issue
with the Botswanan government.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper the Citizen quoted Botswana's Director of
Animal Health and Production M. V. Raborokgwe as saying that his
department had been instructed to take down a section of one of
the recently erected cordon fences in Ngamiland, in order to open
up the seasonal wildlife migration route.
</P>
<P>
Only the 30-km Northern Buffalo-Kwando River fence will be
taken down, Raborokgwe said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Botswana and Namibia had agreed that only
wild animals and not cattle be allowed to move freely.

<HEADLINE> Sabotage to Derail German Train in March Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The German government confirmed
Thursday that a high-speed train nearly derailed on March 14 after
someone deliberately placed slabs of concrete on the tracks.
</P>
<P>
However, as reported by the German daily newspaper Bild earlier
in the day, the incident was just one of 40 attempts to sabotage
rail traffic in Germany since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
The InterCity Express (ICE), Germany's fastest train with a top
speed of 280 kilometers an hour, ran into the obstacles and
swayed, but did not jump the tracks, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the newspaper report, an Interior Ministry spokesman
said a list of registered railroad sabotages was compiled after
the occurrence of the country's worst rail tragedy on June 3.
</P>
<P>
In the latest incident, the exact cause of which is yet to be
determined, an ICE train derailed and crashed into a road bridge
near the northern German town of Eschede, killing over 90 people.
</P>
<P>
Investigators are suspecting a broken wheel as the most likely
cause, but still have to make clear how the crash has occurred.
</P>
<P>
The deadly crash considerably undermined the public trust in
the ICE train, which had had a perfect safety record since coming
into service in 1991.

<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Xiong Guangkai, deputy chief of
General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, met with
James Schear, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense, and his
party here today.
</P>
<P>
Schear was here for a seminar on humanitarian assistance and
disaster relief between the two armed forces, which was held
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Xiong said that military relations are an important part of the
Sino-U.S. relationship, and that relations between the two armed
forces will develop further thanks to the growth of the bilateral
relationship.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two militaries have been actively implementing
an agreement reached by heads of state of the two countries since
President Jiang Zemin's successful visit to the United States last
October.
</P>
<P>
He added that relations between the two armed forces have
entered a new phase of development. He said that defense ministers
of the two countries will hold their first annual meeting in
Beijing next month.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the two sides inform each other of their
respective activities in humanitarian assistance and disaster
relief and share experience in this area not only demonstrates an
important action in implementing agreement reached by heads of the
two countries, but signals a major step toward advancing
military-to-military relations and enhancing mutual trust and
exchanges, Xiong said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Only 798 foreign cars were sold in
South Korea in the first five months of this year, against 3,977
units in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the Korean Automobile Manufacturers Association said
Thursday, the market share of U.S. cars grew 14.3 percentage
points from the 51.5 percent in the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Among U.S. automakers, Chrysler enjoyed a 37.5 percent share of
the total foreign car sale with 299 units, followed by Ford with
219 units, or 27.4 percent, and General Motors with one.
</P>
<P>
General Motors sold 225 cars at the same time of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all European automakers, including Mercedes Benz,
BMW and Audi (Volkswagon) of Germany, and Volvo of Sweden, and
Japanese ones, saw their market shares plummeting.
</P>
<P>
U.S. cars outsold the European and Japanese ones because their
prices were more reasonable for the South Koreans who are still
haunted by the crisis-ridden economy, said the auto association.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Climbs to 142 Yen in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar climbed at one point to
142.10 yen in Tokyo on Thursday, a level last seen in September 1990,
as the Japanese currency was bogged down by regional stock market
plunges.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was quoted at 141.67-70 yen at 5 p.m. (local time), up
from 141.43-45 yen at 9 a.m., and from 141.50-60 yen late Wednesday in
New York.
</P>
<P>
The dollar hit the day's high just after 3:00 p.m., a level not
seen since September 6, 1990 as sentiment for the yen was dampened
after the key Nikkei index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost more than
320 points in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Market players looked to exchange their devalued yen for "safe"
dollars for investments abroad, a mood enhanced by falling stock
markets in Asia, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, market players reacted with more pessimism after data
released Thursday by the Economic Panning Agency (EPA) indicated that
corporate capital spending will be depressed for the next six to nine
months.
</P>
<P>
Sentiment for the yen will likely be further damaged by Friday's
release of Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) for the
January-to-March period, dealers said.

<HEADLINE> Owls Used to Save Paddy From Rodents in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The northeastern state of
Terengganu in Malaysia is using owls to save paddy from rodents
which attack paddy fields.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 380 nests have been created for owls in rice
bowl areas like Setiu and Besut in the state, which saved some
4,800 tons of paddy of the first crop, worth 4.8 million ringgit
(1.215 million U.S. dollars), Malaysia's national news agency
Bernama reported Thursday quoting the state's Agriculture
Department Director Sofian Mohd Salleh.
</P>
<P>
This rodent control method would also be used in the areas of
Kuala Terengganu, Marang and Dungun with the creation of 100 nests
this year, Sofian said.
</P>
<P>
The official said the method also allowed farmers to breed
fresh-water fish in their paddy fields following reduced usage of
pesticides against the rodents.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Terengganu state produces 47,000 tons of paddy
per season.

<P>
-- To the surprise of all, the pilots of Air France and the
management Wednesday reached an agreement, which foresees to keep
the status quo of the salaries of pilots for seven years and a
five-year program to pay young pilots a specific salary. The strike
has cost Air France more than one billion francs (167 million U.S.
dollars) and has relaunched the debate on privatization of the air
company.
</P>
<P>
-- The international community has hardened its tone against
Yugoslavia. The six member countries of the Contact Group on former
Yugoslavia threatened on Wednesday to impose new sanctions on
Belgrade if it does not put an end to its conflict with Kosovo
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- After nine days of strike, the management of Air France and
the National Syndicate of Pilots of Airlines signed an agreement on
Wednesday to put an end to the conflict. The management yields to
almost all demands of the pilots, except that the salaries of the
pilots will be maintained at the present level for seven years.
</P>
<P>
-- The Minister of National Education Claude Allegre is preparing
a plan to ban teachers from being absent from their classes and
replace those who are frequently absent from their students in high
schools.

<HEADLINE> High Auto Emissions Banned in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government has a
plan to ban vehicles with emissions higher than the European
standard into the country's auto market.
</P>
<P>
As announced by Romania's official television station Wednesday
evening, the measure taken by the Ministry of Transportation will
be effective from July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Also mandatory is that Romanian auto-makers will have to,
starting January 1, 1999, comply with the low emissions standard
of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
All sub-standard locally made vehicles will no longer be
allowed to register after January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The government measure is prompted by the deterioration of air
quality in urban areas across Romania, where an increasing number
of vehicles are hitting the street.
</P>
<P>
The problem, as explained by Ioan Tiganas, an official in
charge of vehicle registry in Romania, was partly due to the
importing of used cars in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Average 12 years in service, vehicles now in operation in
Romania are usually far below the latest emissions standard,
making them a major source of air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The ban on sub-standard vehicles are expected to help curb the
importing of used foreign cars while the authorities are putting
up a list of compliant car models.

<HEADLINE> Beirut Pressured to Accept Israeli Withdrawal Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The pro-Israeli militia the South
Lebanese Army (SLA) Thursday warned the Lebanese government of
grave consequences if it continues to reject Israel's offer on
conditional withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published on the Daily Star, the SLA said that
Lebanese government's blanket rejection of the Israeli offer would
force Israel to leave South Lebanon unilaterally and lead to a
bloody war between the SLA and the anti-Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
"If it is effected, it will lead to a bloody war between the
SLA and the residents of the region against those who claim to be
resisting," the statement said, adding that the SLA could also
clash with the Lebanese army and eventually cause another Israeli
invasion.
</P>
<P>
Israel, in alliance with the SLA, has been occupying
1,200-square-kilometer border strip in south Lebanon since 1985
after two invasions.
</P>
<P>
With an average of 35 soldiers being killed there annually and
under mounting domestic pressure, Israel decided on April 1 to
pull out of the "death trap," provided security arrangements are
worked out with Beirut, including the safety of the 2,500 SLA
militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon flatly rejected the offer, insisting that the
withdrawal should be unconditional as stipulated in the
U.N. resolution 425, which Israel had been rejecting over the past
20 years.
</P>
<P>
The SLA statement appeared to be part of the continued efforts
of Israel to put more pressure on the Lebanese government to
accept the Israeli plan.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah (Party of God) has been leading a
guerrilla war to oust Israeli troops from the Israeli
self-proclaimed security zone.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Continue Plunging in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices plunged for the second
straight day in Tokyo Thursday on continued worries about major
Japanese banks, the sputtering Asian economies and the falling yen.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Averagy of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 325.22 points, or 2.12
percent, from Wednesday's close to end at 15,014.04.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, slid 19.79 points, or 1.65 percent, to end at
1,178.81.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went up to an estimated 400 million
shares from Wednesday's 353 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was the day's most actively traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Traders said pessimism on the market are growing due to the
deflating Japanese economy, falling share prices in Hong Kong and the
ever-weakening yen.
</P>
<P>
Market sentiment was also dampened by Thursday's announcement that
April machinery orders in Japan in the private sector fell 16.8
percent from the previous month and an unadjusted 17.8 percent from a
year earlier, they said. The figures are considered an early indicator
of trends in corporate capital spending over the six to nine months to
come.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,336 issues listed on the First Section, losers outweighed
gainers 858 to 248, with 152 issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Increasing IPR Protection at Southern Chinese Customs-House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen Customs, in south
China's Guangdong Province, will do more to protect intellectual
property rights for domestic and overseas businesses.
</P>
<P>
Since China adopted the Customs Regulations on Protecting
Intellectual Property on October 1, 1995, Shenzhen Customs
officers have taken IPR protection as their major job, according
to Zhou Jizhong, deputy chief of the branch.
</P>
<P>
By May, the customs had uncovered more than 200 copyright,
trademark, and patent violations and cases of compact disc piracy
in a two-year period, and confiscated and destroyed over 3.2
million pirated CDs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Motion Picture Association, the International
Federation of the Phonographic Industry and the Business Software
Alliance commended the customs house for its work.
</P>
<P>
The officers use a machine that can accurately distinguish
source discs from others, allowing officers to seize source discs
that are being smuggled into China for illegal copying.
</P>
<P>
The customs house also tries to safeguard the interests of
domestic enterprises. Since July 1997, it has seized 5.6 million
yuan (about 670,000 U.S. dollars) worth of fake cloth that bore
brand-name product markings.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Village Benefiting From The Great Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Although hardly anyone knew its
name a decade ago, the village of Mutianyu, tucked in the
mountains to the north of Beijing, has become one of the richest
around.
</P>
<P>
The secret of its success is simple enough: it was lucky enough
to be in the vicinity of the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall,
which has become one of the 16 most famous scenic spots around the
Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
One of the villagers, Hao Wenxia, gets up very early every
morning with his wife to get to their stalls at the foot of the
Great Wall before tourists arrive. The couple are a bit of a
rarity, since they have two business licenses. He sells souvenirs
while his wife sells clothes.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old man told reporters that he had been quite happy
at his job in a local garment factory until 1988, when the
Mutianyu section of the Great Wall opened to tourists and he
decided to gamble and quit his job to go open a stall.
</P>
<P>
Then, as the tourists kept pouring in, his two shops soon
developed into a bigger business, bringing to his family over
20,000 yuan (2400 US dollars) a year, and sometimes as much as
50,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
With that money, Hao built a new house equipped with running
water, solar heating, and a telephone. He also acquired a minibus.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhao Zhikui, head of the village, each of the 150
households there has a tourism-related business of one sort or
another.
</P>
<P>
Because foreign tourists are always considered a big source of
money, there has been an accompanying desire to learn foreign
languages among the villagers. At Mutianyu, tourists can be heard
bargaining with vendors in English, Japanese, Russian, French and
German.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the villagers' income went up to 13,100 yuan, compared
with about 720 yuan before 1988. And, every family owns a
motorcycle, over 30 households have minibuses and cars, and at
least 20 of them have flats in urban parts of Beijing, and half of
them have bank accounts with as much as 100,000 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Province Striving to Improve Agricultural Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 11 (Xinhua) --Liaoning Province, an old
industrial base in northeast China, has decided to implement six
major industrialized agricultural programs with the help of
science and technology beginning from this year.
</P>
<P>
Wei Wenduo, director of Liaoning Provincial Commission of
Science and Technology, said they hoped that the move would help
the province advance the transition from traditional agriculture
to a highly-efficient modern one.
</P>
<P>
The six industrialized agricultural programs will include
industrialization of the production of forest frog-related
products, new-type fodders and fodder additives, cash crops and
related products, bio-pesticides, bio-organic compound fertilizers
and enriched natural fruit juice.
</P>
<P>
The province is expected to rake in an annual 8.5 billion yuan
in agricultural output value, 2.8 billion yuan of pre-tax profits,
and earn 42 million U.S. dollars from exports of agricultural
products by the year of 2000 if the six industrialized
agricultural programs are fully implemented, said experts.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning was saved from a loss of four billion kg of grain last
year owing to application of scientific and technological
achievements though its agriculture suffered severe natural
disasters, and was instead blessed with increases of 80,000 tons
of meat, 70,000 tons of poultry and eggs and 100,000 tons of
aquatic products.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Researchers Develop New X-Ray Method </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli researchers have
developed a new type of detector plate for digital X-ray which can
provide instant computer readouts, cover large scanned areas and
greatly reduce the amount of radiation to patients.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post reported Thursday that the polycrystalline
mercuric iodide plates are expected to replace emulsion film
currently in use in X-ray radiology.
</P>
<P>
The plates can allow direct digital readouts in real time that
can be stored and handled by a computer, and the image can be
viewed on the screen and sent for consultation anywhere in the
world via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The plates are relatively inexpensive, highly sensitive and can
produce excellent images, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The research team from Jerusalem's Hebrew University Wednesday
received the Kaye Innovation Award, established by Issac Kaye of
England, a leading figure in the pharmaceutical industry there.
</P>
<P>
Professor Michael Schreiber, who heads the research team,
called the method a "breakthrough" in digitalization that will be
commercialized in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The plates can also be used in mammography, fluoroscopy or
dental imaging, as well as in other applications that require
large-area imaging detectors, such as astrophysics.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines to Resume Regular Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The strike-bound Philippine
Airlines (PAL) said Thursday that it will resume regular, though
limited, scheduled services to 14 domestic points and four
international destinations Friday, the country's national day.
</P>
<P>
PAL management said in a statement that PAL will expand this
initial flight schedule in the coming months as it builds up its
pilot corps by taking in new recruits to replace the 620 striking
pilots.
</P>
<P>
The PAL management Wednesday unilaterally declared an end to
the crippling strike by its pilots belonging to the Airline Pilots
Association of the Philippines (ALPAP) which staged the walkout
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The airlines said it is currently processing applications for
pilot positions that are now vacant after the striking pilots
abandoned their posts and defied the government's back-to-work
order Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Before the pilots union's wildcat strike, PAL was mounting an
average of 160 departures daily in its domestic network, flying to
39 points across the country.
</P>
<P>
Its international services used to cover 30 points in 17
countries. But the airlines can now only operate regular services
from Manila to Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong and San Francisco, and
vice-versa.
</P>
<P>
The ALPAP said they were striking to protest a 30-year-old
early retirement policy contained in a collective bargaining
agreement reached between the union and the management.
</P>
<P>
Describing the policy as unfair, the ALPAP said about 200
senior pilots will be forced to retire in coming years.
</P>
<P>
But the PAL management said that the policy was already agreed
by the union which also invoked it when it was in their favor.
</P>
<P>
The strike has dealt a heavy blow to PAL, the country's
national flag carrier, which claimed to have lost 1 billion pesos
(25.6 million U.S. dollars) during the five-day work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Labor and Employment is still mediating
between the striking pilots and the PAL management. The department
said earlier it would rule on whether the PAL's decision to fire
the striking pilots is legal.

<HEADLINE> Poultry Overtakes Beef in Zimbabwe's Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Poultry has overtaken beef as
Zimbabwe's most valuable meat export, with producers selling 18
million U.S. Dollars worth of chickens, eggs and chicks to
southern African countries between January and March this year.
</P>
<P>
The commercial Poultry Producers' Association said Wednesday
that about 3,500 tons of chicken, 8.8 million chicks and 1.9
million table eggs were exported during the first three months
this year, the Herald newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chicken exports surpassed those of beef by 400 tons during the
same period agaisnt the background that Zimbabwe was unable to
meet its annual beef export quota of 9,000 tons to Europe
following a slump in demand caused by the outbreak of the ''mad
cow'' disease last year. Meanwhile, cattle producers are
rebuilding their dwindled herd following recent drought.
</P>
<P>
But the local demand for chicken is likely to grow further
with the proliferation of fast-food outlets, as in December last
year, the Zimbabweans consumed at least 1.5 million chickens.

<HEADLINE> Australia Expecting More Tourists From China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- People in Australia's tourism and
airline industries are encouraged by the growing number of Chinese
tourists visiting the country, which went up 23 percent to close
to 70,000 in 1997, according to the latest tourist administration
figures.
</P>
<P>
Australia has replaced the Singapore-Malaysia-Thailand tour as
the Chinese tourist's favorite choice, with the latter down 3.6
percent, because of the Southeast Asian financial crisis since
last October.
</P>
<P>
Australian tourist agencies have been trying to take advantage
of this with tourist promotions in China and by diversifying
services to attract more Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
Some airlines, like Ansett, Australia's second largest air
carrier, have increased the number of flights to meet the
increasing demand. It added a third flight to its Shanghai-Sydney
route in June 1997. Craig Wallace, manager of the company's
international department, says that its turnover in China last
year has greatly exceeded their expectations and it is planning to
do even better this year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Fears Over Yen Send Asian Markets Plummet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Stock and currency markets in Asia
tumbled in the past few days on continued uncertainty about the
Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
Policy makers and financiers urged the Group of Seven (G-7)
industrialized nations to act to stem the continuing yen slide.
</P>
<P>
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index lost another 7.62
points to 284.48 at midday Thursday before plunging 16.15 points
or 5.2-percent from the previous day to close at 292.10.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the SET index fell below the
psychological 300-point level in 11 years. Dealers said it was the
lowest closing record since 1987, when the SET began its bullish
run.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday in Hong Kong, despite a rise in interbank interest
rates, the Hang Sen index lost 412.09 points, or 5 percent, to
close at 7,979.37 points, its lowest close since March 1995.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, the key Straits Times industrial index plunged
4.4 percent to 1,067.81, the lowest level in seven years. Seoul
stock index similarly plunged 4.3 percent to 324.54 points.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen Wednesday fell to 141.5 against the U.S.
dollar, dragged down by investors' concerns that the G-7 deputy
finance ministers meeting in Paris would not take any concerted
action to halt the yen slide.
</P>
<P>
Further depressing sentiments were clear signs of a sharp fall
in the baht, which traded late Wednesday at 43.00/10 to the
dollar, against 42.90 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Amaret Sila-On, chairman of the Stock Exchange of Thailand,
attributed the bearish atmosphere across the region to the
ineffective measures Japan has taken to spur its economy.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed the G-7 nations for failing to take a lead in
tackling the economic problems in the region.
</P>
<P>
The dependence on the Japanese economy could partly explain why
the yen slide was triggering a currency and stock avalanche across
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the major export market for many Asian nations as well
as the biggest investor in the region, projected its gross
domestic product (GDP) growth rate at only 0.23 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The estimation caused the so-called "confidence crisis" among
Southeast and East Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
South Korea forecast that its GDP growth this year will
contract 2.2 percent, while Singapore also lowered its projection
of GDP growth from the previous 7.8 percent to 2.5 percent. Both
Malaysia and Hong Kong saw contraction in their GDP growth in the
first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The fluctuation of the Asian currency markets has kept the
interest rates high, if not forcing them to go higher, aggravating
the liquidity crunch experienced by businesses in Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, local businessmen have long complained about the
high interest rates. The unaffordable high rates have pushed them
to the brink of collapse, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank, with the painful memory of the baht
depreciation last July still in mind, persisted in its stance of
keeping the rates high for fear of a free fall of the currency
under speculative attacks.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said that the yen depreciation has both
negative and positive implications for the economies of Thailand
and other Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
They hope with weaker currencies exports in these countries can
be boosted.
</P>
<P>
But export records in the past few months after currency
devaluation showed that lower prices were not as effective as the
governments had expected.
</P>
<P>
The governments must try hard to find the way out of the second
wave of crisis, as some named the current turmoil.

<P>
CAIRO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- In another move to repair their
long-strained ties, a high-level Iranian economic delegation
arrived here early Thursday on a five-day trip to boost trade and
economic cooperation with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The visit was the first of its kind in nearly two

invited by Chairman of the Egyptian Industries Federation Abdel
Moneim Saudi.
</P>
<P>
The visit followed a similar trip to Iran by a delegation from
the Union of the Egyptian Industries in March this year, when the
two sides discussed prospects for holding an exhibition of
Egyptian products in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
This time the two sides are expected to discuss the preparatory
work for holding the planned exhibition in a bid to upgrade the
economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The sluggish Egyptian-Iranian economic cooperation was the
bitter fruit of the strained diplomatic and political relations
between the two countries in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Iran disrupted its political and economic ties with Egypt after
Sadat's historical visit to the arch enemy Israel to launch his
peace initiative in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Egypt accused the post-Islamic Revolution Iran of
backing Muslim militants fighting to overthrow Egypt's secular
government.
</P>
<P>
The ice in the Egyptian-Iranian relations has gradually thawed
in the recent years. The bilateral trade in 1997 amounted to 75
million U.S. dollars, with Egypt imports reaching 35 million
dollars and exports 45 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iran is currently investing 220 million Egyptian pounds (about
64.7 million dollars) in seven projects of weaving, carpets,
ready-made garments and banks in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Charge d'Affaires in Cairo Akbar Kassemi has hailed the
new developments in Egyptian-Iranian relations as "a breakthrough."
</P>
<P>
One direct spur to their bilateral ties was the talks held by
then Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati with senior
Egyptian officials during his visit to Cairo last year, he added.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's State Enterprises Attracting Get Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai will push its large and
medium-sized state enterprises to raise international funds with a
goal of getting four billion U.S. dollars worth of overseas
investment this year.
</P>
<P>
Similar investment was down 10 percent in the first five months
compared with the same period last year, to 1.3 billion
U.S. dollars, although contracts for funds were up 40 percent to
2.6 billion U.S. dollars, according to Wan Junyi, an official from
the municipal overseas investment office, who attributes the
decrease to smaller cash flow from some Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
He says that projects needing overseas investment are valued at
over 100 billion yuan. The municipal government is encouraging
large and medium-sized state enterprises in packaging,
infrastructure and hi-tech industries to improve ties with
multinationals.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is allowing overseas business people to purchase
companies, or merge with or lease them, or buy shares in smaller
state firms, about a hundred of which have been traded in this way
this year.
</P>
<P>
Wang also says that Shanghai is experimenting with overseas
investment in technological development and for tourist agencies
and even for education.

<HEADLINE> Protecting Snakes In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The need to protect snakes was
discussed at a seminar that opened on Wednesday in the city of
Shanghai, sponsored by the Shanghai Wild Animal Protection
Association and the International Wild Animal Protection
Association.
</P>
<P>
Because of the money to be made, people continue to kill snakes
and have caused a decrease in their numbers. The city used to have
16 types of snakes around it, but now only five to six types can
be seen.
</P>
<P>
Roughly half of the city's 20,000 restaurants prepare snakes in
one way or another, helping to consume more than a thousand tons
of them a year.
</P>
<P>
Medical uses also increase the demand for snakes and they are a
popular item for export. Shanghai exports 250,000 tons of Pallas
pit vipers every year, earning 500,000 US dollars worth of foreign
currency.
</P>
<P>
Things are changing however. The city has put the 16 types of
snakes under protection and passed regulations to control the
snake business.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. has retreated from its original position to
delineate the size of a third Israeli redeployment, as part of a
package being considered to enable a second withdrawal and
permanent-status negotiations to get under way, according to
American sources.
</P>
<P>
Under the new idea, Israel would send the U.S. a letter stating
how much territory it would be prepared to withdraw from in a
third pullback, but this figure would not necessarily be presented
to the Palestinians for their approval.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Russia has provided a sophisticated weapon system to Syria
for the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and
the Syrian army has also renewed negotiations for the purchase of
SA-10 anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials Wednesday expressed their concern over the
latest development, but the security establishment has not altered
its basic analysis that although Syria is still preparing a
military option, it will probably not start a war in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- One pupil was seriously injured and two others were believed
to have been trapped under the wreckage of a Beersheba school gym,
whose ceiling collapsed late Wednesday night during basketball
practice.
</P>
<P>
The coach and nine pupils managed to get out safely before the
ceiling came down.

<P>
MANILA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
Regional Office for the Western Pacific said Thursday that the
elimination of leprosy is likely in the region by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the Manila-based WHO regional office said
almost all the countries and areas in the region have eliminated
leprosy, a communicable disease which progresses inconspicuously
over years.
</P>
<P>
The office said that efforts will be intensified to help 11
lagging countries in the region to root out the disease, which the
WHO expects to be eradicated by the year 2000 globally.
</P>
<P>
At a three-day regional workshop on the elimination of leprosy
ending here Thursday, WHO Regional Director for the Western
Pacific S.T. Han called on the governments in the region to
sustain their political commitments to fighting leprosy.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the international community to continue its
financial and material support to the goal of rooting out the
disease.
</P>
<P>
The number of registered leprosy cases in the region is
continuously declining and has reached a low level of less than
25,000 among a population of 1.6 billion people, Han said.
</P>
<P>
The remaining problem of leprosy will be far more difficult as
it includes neglected areas, population groups and communities, he
said.

HARARE, June 11 (Xinhua) -- the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) protocol on trade has been ratified by
Zimbabwe's parliament, Zimbabwe's newspaper The Herald reported

<HEADLINE> Worldwide PC Demand Lukewarm in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Facing up with "a lukewarm
environment," unit volume in the worldwide personal computer (PC)
market this quarter is expected to grow 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The environment, said a market researcher, is the result of a
downturn in the Asia-Pacific region, softness in the portable PC
market and problems in the supply channel in the United States.
</P>
<P>
By region, West Europe is likely to grow 14 percent on low-cost
PCs, improving economies in France and Germany and a greater focus
from global PC manufacturers, said International Data Corp. (IDC).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. market will see a similar growth rate in vendor unit
shipments, owing to a strong economy and the low-cost market.
</P>
<P>
However, IDC said in its latest report, in the United States
and other markets, severe price pressure will limit revenue and
profit growth for most PC vendors.
</P>
<P>
In addition, inventory problems have slowed channel ordering
and induced a more conservative stance on PC manufacturing in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Demand in the Asian-Pacific region (excluding Japan) continues
to be weak, with Southeast Asian countries and South Korea showing
no signs of economic recovery, IDC said.
</P>
<P>
Adding fuel to the fire are the economic sanctions recently
placed on India.
</P>
<P>
Based on these market conditions, IDC expects unit shipments in
the second quarter to show slight negative growth in the region,
and the growth of the entire year to be 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, IDC said, ongoing financial concerns and reduced
consumer demand will result in negative growth this quarter and
only two percent growth for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
Looking forward, there is little relief to the tough pricing
environment, IDC said.
</P>
<P>
While the inventory situation may improve, slower market
growth, expansion of the low-cost PC market and heightened
competition among central processing unit (CPU) suppliers will all
catalyze an ongoing price war, IDC concluded.

NANCHANG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China's Huayi Group, a major
CFC-Free compressor and refrigerator producer, exported 15,000
freon-free refrigerators to 23 countries and regions in the first
five months of the year, up 39 percent from the same period last
year, giving China's freon-free products a place in the world.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province is
using expressway construction to boost economic development in its
northern part.
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, the northern part of the province is
expected to build 1,000 km. of expressways, at a cost of 30
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Work on the Taixing-Jingjiang expressway, the first six-lane
highway in the area, started in October 1996, at the beginning of
the construction program. It was followed by work on the 240-km
Lianyungang-Xuzhou Expressway, the 153-km Huaiyin-Jiangdu
Expressway, and the 1,688-m. Xinshuhe Bridge.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 1.7 billion yuan was spent on these projects.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of this year, work on the
Lianyungang-Xuzhou, Xinyi-Haiyang, Nanjing-Suqian-Xuzhou, and
Nanjing-Jingjiang-Yancheng expressways will start.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu has had some rapid economic development but with a lack

<HEADLINE> Cyclone Toll Rises to 565 in West India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in the deadly
cyclonic storm that lashed the west coast of India Tuesday has
increased to 565, according to reports from the cyclone-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
With the recovery of more bodies from the rubbles of flattened
houses and mazes of uprooted trees and electric poles in the
coastal areas, the toll would most likely increase.
</P>
<P>
Many of the victims and those missing are salt workers who were
washed away into the sea by the tidal waves rising from the Gulf
of Kutch.
</P>
<P>
The cyclone, which hit the coastal city of Porbandar, Gujarat
state, around 10:30 a.m. Tuesday and weakened Wednesday morning,
caused unprecedented destruction and paralyzed life in the hit
areas.
</P>
<P>
unconfirmed reports put the toll at over 1,000 with another
1,000 missing in the worst-hit Kutch area of Gujarat alone. The
state government evacuated more than 15,000 people to safer areas.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of houses were damaged and road and communication
links disrupted in the cyclone, and cities like Jamnagar,
Porbandar, Gandhidham, Bhuj and Khambhaliya in Gujarat were in
total darkness.
</P>
<P>
Initial estimates said the damage to property is around 12
billion rupees, or 300 million U.S. dollars, in Kutch and
Saurashtra areas.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee appealed Wednesday
night to Indians and those of Indian origin living abroad to make
generous contributions to the relief work in the devastated areas.
</P>
<P>
Civil authorities, assisted by army and air force personnel,
began massive relief and rescue operations shortly after the
storm.
</P>
<P>
Indian Minister of State for Agriculture Sompal said Wednesday
in the parliament that the crisis management system at the
national level had been activated and the Union government was
maintaining a close contact with the three cyclone-hit state
governments.
</P>
<P>
The minister informed the parliament that the second
installment of relief fund of 290.3 million rupees (7.25 million
U.S. dollars) was released Wednesday in advance.
</P>
<P>
The first installment of the central share of calamity relief
fund of 804.4 million rupees (20.1 million dollars) for the
current year had already been released in April.

SHANGHAI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The first phase of construction
at the Pudong International Airport, Shanghai's largest
infrastructure project this century, which began on October 15,
1997, will be completed by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The 32 sq km airport area in the Pudong new area is
expected to handle 70 million passengers and 5 million tons of
goods annually on its 4 north-south runways and 4 terminals.
</P>
<P>
The first phase will cost 12 billion yuan, mainly for a

facilities. It will allow a handling capacity of 20 million
passengers and 750,000 tons of goods annually.
</P>
<P>
Airline passenger traffic in Shanghai has gone up by 23.5
percent annually, and reached 12 million last year. Its Hongqiao

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Export Promotion Bureau
(BEPB) has decided to implement 43 market development programs in
the July 1998-June 99 fiscal year to expedite the country's export
growth, said a BEPB press release reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Of the programs, 27 are international trade fairs, five
single-country fairs, four commodity marketing missions and seven
minor bazars.
</P>
<P>
The private sector would participate in the fairs with
commodities like leather and leather goods, textiles, food items,
consumer goods, handicrafts, computers and household goods, which
would be held in various countries of Asia, Europe and the
Commonwealth of Independent States, the United States and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The main objective to participate in the fairs was to
popularize Bangladesh's products in the prospective markets
throughout the world, the release pointed.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh maintained export growth at the rate of 16.75
percent in the last 10 months (till April) of the current fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
Total export was about 4.18 billion U.S. dollars during the
period against 3.58 billion dollars in the corresponding period of
the last fiscal year, and total export for the fiscal year was
expected to reach 5.2 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Edge Jazz in Game 4, One Step away from Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan and Scottie
Pippen joined hands to score 62 points as the Chicago Bulls edged
the Utah Jazz 86-82 in Game 4 of the NBA Finals, leading the
best-of-seven series 3-1 at the United Center of Chicago on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
It was the third straight loss for Utah, who beat Chicago in
Game 1 but slumped to a humiliated loss Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls, who are bidding for third straight victory in the
Finals this decade, only one step away from the target. The next
game will be on Friday, still staged on their home floor, where
they have a 36-4 record.
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone hit 21 points and grabbed 14 rebounds, but was
totally shut down by Dennis Rodman in the final quarter. The ace
score of the Jazz only hooped two points and landed three boards,
clearly outnumbered by the "Worm", who showed enough nerve to put
in four balls at the line in the final minutes, and hauled off
four rebounds.
</P>
<P>
After routing Utah 42 points last Sunday, the Bulls enjoyed a
slight edge over their rivals all the way to wind up the first
half 39-37.
</P>
<P>
The score was seasawed mid-way into the third quarter and the
gap was kept within a range of four points. Jordan and Pippen
contributed 21 points each before the final quarter, with Malone
dominated the scoring board for Utah with 21 points.
</P>
<P>
But Malone played a unsteady game tonight, hit no point in the
entire second quarter, and almost repeated the no-show in the last
12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls looked have a clear edge over the ailing Jazz, and a
successful sweep of the final triumph is within their reach.
</P>
<P>
It is not realistic for Utah to win the following three games
in a row, so Game 5 might be the last battle for the Bulls on
their way to win their sixth championship.

FUZHOU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province
expects to build a port group and transport system with hubs at
Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Meizhou by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
A Provincial Transport Department official says that by 2000,
Fujian will build 19 deepwater berths, bringing the total number
to fifty, with a total annual handling capacity of 68.53 million
tons. As many as 85 deepwater berths will be built by 2010, with a
total annual handling capacity of 200 million tons.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the province had 31 deepwater berths for
ships of 10,000 DWT, with a total annual capacity of 37.7 million
tons, and 730,000 TEUs, making Fuzhou and Xiamen two of the ten
largest ports in China. The annual handling capacity of Quanzhou
topped 10 million tons for the first time.
</P>
<P>
To keep up with foreign demand, Fuzhou, the provincial capital,
will increase construction, adding four or five deepwater berths,
and raising 200 million yuan for the dredging of the Minjiang
River waterway, and construction of the Jiangyin Port.
</P>
<P>
The province will use securities and shares to raise port
construction funds, open a port construction company, and use the
BOT (build-operate-transfer) method and World Bank loans.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 80 percent of the
estimated 5.6 million Cambodian voters have registered for the
elections to be held in July, the Cambodia Daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The National Election Committee (NEC) was quoted as heralding
the success of the first three weeks of the month-long
registration, scheduled from May 18 to June 15, in spite of many
technical difficulties in the process.
</P>
<P>
The NEC figures put the number of voters registered in the
first and second weeks at more than 1.7 million and more than 1.5
million, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The third-week number has reached 688,132 according to the
statistics from only ten of the country's 20 provinces.
</P>
<P>
Prum Nhean, a NEC member, said that the final number of the
eligible voters would be slightly higher than the estimated with
the inclusion of Khmer Rouge defectors in the former rebel
stronghold of AnlongVeng.
</P>
<P>
Ten registration stations opened in the AnlongVeng area this
week, Prum Nhean said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NEC acknowledged problems in the registration
process, such as multiple registrations, the registration of
non-Cambodian citizens and the collection of polling cards from
voters after they had registered.
</P>
<P>
NEC Chairman Chheng Phon warned Wednesday that anyone who
attempted to collect the cards would be punished according to the
law. Similarly, any electoral officials who deliberately
registered a non-Cambodian national or anyone who registered more
than once would be subject to a fine or other punishment.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Agriculture Grows by 2.9 Percent in 1997-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's agriculture grew by 2.9
percent in its output value in the 1997-98 fiscal year ended March
despite experience of flash floods and drought during the fiscal
year in some areas, according to the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, which is the mainstay of Myanmar's economy, has
traditionally accounted for 35 to 40 percent of the country's
total gross domestic product (GDP) and about 35 percent of its
export.
</P>
<P>
Its four major crops are designated as paddy, beans and pulses,
cotton and sugarcane, while other cash crops include rubber, palm
oil, jute, coffee, corn, mulberry and tea.
</P>
<P>
The paddy production of the country in the fiscal 1997-98 was
17.3 million tons, a little less than that of the previous year,
according to a report of the country's financial, economic and
social conditions issued by the Ministry of National Planning and
Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
The output of various beans and pulses reached 1.52 million
tons in the fiscal year, of which 660,773 tons were exported.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year, Myanmar imported 46,727 tons of wheat and
280,000 tons of chemical fertilizer, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The country produced 17.6 million tons of paddy with 100,400
tons of rice exported in the last 1996-97 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Myanmar's GDP registered a 4.6 percent
growth in the 1997-98 fiscal year, lower than the set target of
6.4 percent. The average annual growth rate in the previous five
years (1992-93 to 1996-97) was 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the 1998-99 fiscal year, which began in April, the country's
GDP is set to increase by 6.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> India Rejects Proposals for Curtailing Nuclear Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- India has reminded the Group-8
countries, due to meet in London Friday, of its "categorical
rejection of any suggestions" for curtailing its nuclear weapon or
missile development program.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Wednesday night, the Ministry of External
Affairs said India expected positive response to its initiatives
from the G-8 countries rather than "prescriptive and coercive
suggestions which are neither responsible nor constructive".
</P>
<P>
India had announced a moratorium on further nuclear tests and
its willingness to resume talks with Pakistan on all issues.
</P>
<P>
"Any action on the part of G-8 which does not take these
proposals into account is short-sighted and will be
counter-productive," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the Indian government has preempted
criticism by the international community on its conduct of nuclear
tests four weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the United States had persuaded Britain to
"widen the scope" of the G-8 meeting so as to magnify the
criticism against India for the nuclear arms race and the
deterioration of situation in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The statement came in the wake of reports that Britain had
invited "newly converted" states like South Africa, Ukraine and
Brazil to the G-8 foreign ministers meeting in London.

<HEADLINE> Protest Against Peace Treaty Ends in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The two-day "long march" of
Bangladesh's seven-party opposition alliance, after a nearly
400-kilometer journey, ended on Wednesday afternoon in the
country's southeastern Chittagong Hill Tracts, reports reaching
here Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
The long march, which started from Dhaka on Tuesday, was
organized to press the demand to scrap the peace treaty on the
hill tracts signed between the government and the tribals in
December last year.
</P>
<P>
At a huge public rally at the hill district of Khagrachhari
Wednesday afternoon, opposition leader Begum Kaleda Zia strongly
criticized the accord, which she said had "violated the
Constitution" and "snatched the fundamental and citizenship rights
of the people" in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We want peace and development of this area without taking
recourse to any discrimination," she said, adding, "We want an
agreement that would ensure equal rights and dignity of all. We
wanted to make a law which would establish permanent peace in the
region."
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader announced a dawn-to-dusk hartal across
the country on June 18 to protest against "obstruction of the long
march, price hike of essentials, unabated corruption,
deteriorating law and order and the government's failure to meet
the demand for gas, power and water."
</P>
<P>
She also called for observing a "protest day" on June 22
through demonstration, rallies and processions to protest the
"failure of the autocratic inefficient government in every
sector."
</P>
<P>
Some 70,000 people with about 1,000 vehicles were reportedly to
have participated in marching towards Khagrachhari, and about
10,000 people towards Rangamati, another hill district.
</P>
<P>
The long march was largely peaceful, despite minor clashes
between supporters and opponents before and during the march which
left dozens of people injured, the reports said. There were so far
no reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
The seven-party alliance includes the BNP, the Jammat-e-Islami,
the Jatiya Party, the Democratic League, the National Democratic
Party, the Progressive Nationalist Party, and the Democratic
Nationalist Alliance.

<HEADLINE> 16 Percent of Bangladeshis Use Electricity: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- At present, only 16 percent of
Bangladesh's 127 million people consume electricity, an English
daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Minister Without Portfolio Noor Uddin Khan
(former energy minister) while replying to a question in the
parliament Wednesday, The Daily Star said.
</P>
<P>
Of the total consumers, 579,000 consumers representing 15
percent of the subscribers were commercial subscribers while over
three million representing 79 percent of the total subscribers
were domestic users, the minister told the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The problems relating to load shedding and low voltage had
improved partially following the government's step to close down
shops and markets after 7 p.m. in the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has a power shortage of 450 megawatts every day
against the minimum nationwide demand for 2,200 megawatts,
according to officials with the Power Development Board.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken a series of steps to streamline the
power generating and supplying system and it is also implementing
several projects in this regard to increase the number of
electricity consumers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Chief Justice Refuses to Discuss Lack of Minority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Randy Jones, president of the
National Bar Association representing 17,000 black lawyers, said
Wednesday he would continue to seek changes in the judicial system
despite Chief Justice William Rehnquist's refusal to discuss the
scarcity of minority law clerks.
</P>
<P>
Jones said black lawyers will continue to try to convince the
chief justice of the usefulness of such discussion.
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist had turned down a request by minority lawyers to
discuss the scarcity of minority law clerks at the Supreme Court,
saying he did not think such a meeting "would serve any useful
purpose".
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist, in a May 27 letter to the president of the nation's
largest organization of black lawyers, said each justice chooses
his or her own clerks, making it an issue beyond his authority.
</P>
<P>
"I have no control, nor would I seek to assert any control,
over the hiring practices of my eight colleagues," Rehnquist wrote.
</P>
<P>
Jones had extended the invitation to Rehnquist on behalf of a
coalition of minority bar association leaders.
</P>
<P>
"This issue is not dead by any means," the Associated Press
quoted Jones as saying from his office in San Diego, California.
"We're hoping to convince him that it would be beneficial both to
the Supreme Court and to the minority law community."
</P>
<P>
Jones said the coalition of minority lawyers began broaching
the lack of minorities clerking at the Supreme Court in March.
The group wanted to find out how it could increase diversity among
the clerks, particularly by learning about the application process
and the qualifications needed to secure the competitive positions.
</P>
<P>
"We think it's in the best interest of justices to have
different viewpoints," Jones said, noting that law clerks often
screen which cases make it to the judges. "To have that branch
aloof from the people is a detriment to the administration of
justice."
</P>
<P>
In March, USA Today said that of the 394 clerks hired by all
nine current justices during their tenures, one percent were
Hispanic, two percent were black and 4.5 percent were Asian. No
Native Americans have served as clerks.
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist said he chooses his three law clerks each year "on
the basis of superior professional achievement in law school,
together with an appraisal as to how well we would work together."
 He added that he has never excluded anyone from consideration
based on race or nationality.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, the chief justice also offered to take
recommendations from the minority lawyers in support of particular
applicants. Jones said that could be a critical first step in
addressing the problem.

<HEADLINE> Thai Airway Well-Prepared for Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Thai Airway International (Thai)
said it is well-prepared for any problems related to the so-called
"millennium bug," the computer glitch that will make many old
generation computers and software worldwide unworkable after
December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Leading English-language newspaper The Nation reported Thursday
that Thai has sorted out half of the potential complications and
expects to have all the critical areas under control by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The entire exercise is estimated to cost between 200 to 300
million baht (4.65 to 6.98 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
About 137 software applications are involved throughout the
airline, all of which have to be identified, investigated, fixed
and tested in a careful, methodical manner that does not disrupt
the day-to-day work.
</P>
<P>
The main priority areas are safety and maintenance of aircraft
and spare parts, and the computer reservation system which has to
be error-free in order to ensure that people, as of January 1,
1999, can reserve flights in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In tackling the problem, Thai's 340-strong information
technology staff worked closely with a specially set-up corporate
y2k committee comprising of representatives from the airline's
various departments.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Offers Discount Card to Boost Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has become the first
country in Asia to offer the Touristcard, which will be marketed
worldwide and offer holders discounts of up to 20 percent, the
Bangkok Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, discounts will be available at
selected restaurants, tourist attractions and retailers at major
tourist destinations.
</P>
<P>
Micheal Thomas International (MTI), the Asian licensee for
Paris-based Touristcard Co. Ltd., said the company expects 3-4
million card holders in Thailand during the amazing Thailand
campaign in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
Each card is valid for up to six people a year from the date it
is first issued. Holders can collect points to redeem for extra
gifts.
</P>
<P>
Touristcard has introduced the card successfully in seven
cities in France and is in the process of placing it in other
major tourist destinations in Europe such as London, Rome and
Madrid.
</P>
<P>
There are now 2.5 million card holders worldwide, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
The first participating tourist card retailers in Bangkok will
be announced next week. More members will be signed up in other
tourist destinations such as Chiang Mai, Pattaya, Phuket and Samui
within three months.
</P>
<P>
The card is believed to be helpful for promoting purchasing in
Thailand, since purchasing data will be recorded on the microchip
of the card, which will be valuable for the Tourism Authority of
Thailand (TAT) in terms of developing and marketing attractions.
</P>
<P>
TAT figures showed that shopping accounted for the most
spending by foreign tourists, at about 38 percent of the total.
Last year, tourists spent 89 billion baht (2.07 billion U.S.
dollars) on shopping in Thailand.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is prepared to
offer Thailand an additional 800 million U.S. dollars in loans to
help fund the country's environmental, social development and
industrial programs.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post Thursday quoted J. Shivakunmar, World Bank's
director in Thailand, as saying that the funds would be divided
into two lots, with the first 400 million dollars available in the
first half of 1999 and the second lot in the second half.
</P>
<P>
The funds are designed to strengthen Thailand's industrial
competitiveness in the long-term and help alleviate the social
impact of the economic slump, the director said when signing an
agreement Wednesday with officials from the Fiscal Policy Office
for a separate 400 million dollar loan.
</P>
<P>
Fiscal Policy Office Director-General Sommai Phasee said that
part of the 400 million dollar fund would be used to recapitalize
state financial institutions such as the Bank of Agriculture and
Agricultural Cooperatives, Export-Import Bank, Government Housing
Bank and Government Savings Bank.
</P>
<P>
The remaining funds would be extended to the four banks as soft
loans for relending to the public, Sommai said.
</P>
<P>
The 400 million dollar loan is part of the World Bank's 1.5
billion dollar structural adjustment loans to Thailand under the
International Monetary Fund's 17.2 billion dollar package.

<P>
SOFIA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The 16th International Crime Control
Conference ended here Wednesday with calls for intensifying the
battle against organized crime, especially in Europe.
</P>
<P>
With huge money reserves, international mafias can corrupt
and control a country's administration through bribery, Interpol
Assistant Director Ralf Muchke told the conference.
</P>
<P>
In Russia, the mafia controlled 40,000 companies, 550 banks and
4,000 joint stock companies, he added.
</P>
<P>
Crimes committed by the Russian mafia groups have gone up by
8.5 times since 1990, said Anatolii Kolesnikov, deputy director of
the Russian Organized Crime Control Service.
</P>
<P>
In some regions, the Russian mafias have infiltrated into
government, Kolesnikov said. The shadow economy accounted for
30-40 percent of the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
Russian mobsters have also commit crimes in more than 40
countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Interpol, European police forces,
Germany, Russia, Italy, Romania and Bulgaria attended the two-day
conference. All the participants called for strengthening of
international information exchanges on organized crime.
</P>
<P>
Another information from the conference said that France would
be flooded with drugs from Colombian cartels during the World Cup
Finals.

HEFEI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Companies operating around Chaohu
Lake in east China's Anhui Province will have to to reach standard
waste water discharge levels by the end of next year,
Vice-governor Zhang Ping announced.
</P>
<P>
Chaohu is China's fifth largest lake and has been on the State
Council's key pollution treatment list. The water quality of
the lake has sharply declined in recent years, due in large part
to the 550,000 tons of waste water discharged each day by
enterprises in the provincial capital, Hefei.
</P>
<P>
To solve this problem, the city government began pollution
treatment projects. A waste water treatment plant with a daily
capacity of 150,000 tons is being built and will go into operation
in the later half of the year, and a quarter of the city's
industrial enterprises are being told that they will have to reach
waste water discharge levels by the end of the year.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's preventive drug
education programs have yielded encouraging results with fewer
drug-related arrests in recent years, Singapre's Home Minister
Wong Kan Seng told the U.N. special session on drugs here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of people arrested dropped from 6,160 in 1994 to
4,750 last year, while the number of new addicts fell from 1,420
in 1996 to 1,130 last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The drug situation in Singapore is very much under control,"
he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Singapore took the drug problem seriously because its
geographical location put it at constant risk of being used as a
transshipment point for drug trafficking, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
Strict anti-drug laws and effective enforcement also operated
and drug offenders were treated equal regardless of whether they
were citizens of Singapore or other nations, the Minister said.

UNITED NATIONS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The General Assembly of the
United Nations on Wednesday concluded a three-day Special Session
and adopted three documents on fighting the world drug problem.
</P>
<P>
The Special Session, also known as the "Drugs Summit," reviewed
previous policies against the illicit production, sale, demand,
trafficking and distribution of narcotics and psychotropic
substances and proposed new strategies to combat the problem.
</P>
<P>
A Political Declaration adopted at the session calls on member
states to commit themselves to significant and measurable results

</P>
<P>
It also calls for strong domestic laws and programs by 2003 to
deal with such issues as money-laundering and synthetic drugs,
increased drug prevention among the young, and more cooperation
between nations to catch and prosecute drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Guiding Principles of Drug-Demand Reduction, another document

<HEADLINE> Drug Abuse Grows in Canada, Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada and Germany, two
developed countries, recognize that their drug abuse problem is
getting serious.
</P>
<P>
Although Canada's climate precludes the cultivation of either
coca bush or opium poppy, it does produce cannabis, and has become
a cannabis exporting country, Canada's Solicitor General Andrew
Scott told the United Nations General Assembly special session on
drugs here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Canada views its drug problem as serious," he said. Cannabis
was the most commonly used illicit drug in the North American
country, followed by cocaine and heroin, with a moderate use of
synthetic drugs.
</P>
<P>
"Canada is experiencing a particularly serious health crisis in
Vancouver with a high level of overdose deaths and one of the
highest rates of HIV infections in developed countries," Scott
said.
</P>
<P>
Taking the floor at the conference, German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel said Wednesday that Germany has seen a steady rise in
the number of first-time users of hard drugs since 1995, with 1997
experiencing a 25 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. special session took the drug demand reduction as an
essential part of a balanced approach to the drug problem,
striving for a substantial reduction in ten years.

<P>
The 49-year black man, James Byrd Jr., was chained to a pickup
truck and dragged to his death in Jasper, Texas, on Sunday. The

found Sunday on a bumpy winding country road about 16 kilometers
from his Jasper home. His severed head, neck and right arm were
about a kilometers away.

what this country is all about," Clinton said at the opening of a
speech on women's pay equity.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "We are determined that the investigation will be
thorough, will be fair, and that the guilty will be brought to
justice."
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, of Sulphur Springs, and Shawn
Allen Berry and John William King, both 23, of Jasper, were
charged with murder. The three, all with criminal records, are
being held without bail.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the men have ties to white supremacist
groups and one carried a lighter engraved with an emblem of the Ku
Klux Klan.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends U.N. Mission for Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan Wednesday recommended the
establishment of a U.N. observer mission in Sierra Leone to help
disarm the former ruling junta and support the "fragile but vital
process" of promoting civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the U.N. Security Council, Annan said the
situation in Sierra Leone has in some respects improved
considerably.
</P>
<P>
However, in the eastern area and parts of the north, remnants
of the former junta continue to resist the Monitoring Group of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and attack
Sierra Leonean civilians, said Annan.
</P>
<P>
He said the mission, known as the United Nations Observer
Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL), would be composed of 70
observers and led by his Special Envoy in Sierra Leone, with a
mandate of six months, beginning in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
The mission would monitor the military and security situations
in Sierra Leone, assist the government and ECOWAS in disarming the
former ruling junta, monitor progress in the creation of a new
national army, and monitor respect for international humanitarian
law at disarmament and demobilization sites.
</P>
<P>
"Such a deployment at this stage could lead (a) much-needed
impetus to a fragile but vital process, which deserves the support
of the international community," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian-led West African peacekeepers ousted Sierra Leone's
military junta of Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma in February and
restored the elected government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah,
who was toppled in a coup in May last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of people living below
the poverty line is expected to reach 30 million if the economic
crisis persists, Antara News Agency Thursday quoted a government
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Before the economic crisis began in mid-1997, only 22 million
of Indonesia's 202 million people were living below the poverty
line, said Coordinating Minister for the People's Welfare/Poverty
Eradication Haryono Suyono.
</P>
<P>
The figure even decreased to 17 million following the
implementation of programs aimed at eradicating poverty.
</P>
<P>
"But with the economic crisis, the figure is expected to go
back to 22 million. It could even reach 25 million. And if (the
crisis) continues over a long period, it could reach 30 million,"
the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Education and Culture Minister Yuwono Sudarsono told
reporters here Wednesday that the government will support as many
as students as possible during the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said that around 30 percent of the country's 31 million
students had dropped out.
</P>
<P>
The financial programs announced by Sudarsono include
scholarships and the provision of operation costs for schools.
</P>
<P>
"Through the provision of financial support, the government
wants to prevent as many students as possible from falling victim
to the present economic crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said, implementation of the financial
programs must wait until the disbursement of funds from the
International Monetary Fund.

BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A national survey show that
116,500 ha of farmland in China has been left idle or used
inefficiently, and 54 percent of this figure is cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
The survey listed top ten areas for leaving large amount of
land idle as Guangdong, Hainan, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian,
Shandong, Liaoning and Hunan provinces, Shanghai municipality and

ROME, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States will try to set the
compensation it proposes to pay for the victims of the Mount
Cermis cableway disaster "as quickly as possible," the ANSA news

</P>
<P>
United States Defense Secretary William Cohen said this Tuesday
after talks with his Italian counterpart, Beniamino Andreatta.
</P>
<P>
Twenty were killed when a U.S. Marine Corps Prowler electronic
surveillance jet sliced through a cableway on Mount Cermis in the
Dolomite Alps, on February 3.
</P>
<P>
The 20 died when the cable car they were traveling in plunged
onto the mountain-side.
</P>
<P>
Court martial proceedings against the crew opened in the U.S.
on April 20, and Cohen said they would proceed "responsibly."
</P>
<P>
He said that if the pilots' commanders were also found to have
responsibilities in the tragedy, they too will have to respond to
charges.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta said the Italian government would do everything in
could to speed up compensation procedures over the 100 million
lire (60,000 U.S. dollars) it had promised the victims. But he
noted that to date only two families had filed all the necessary
paperwork.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta said he had asked military attaches at all Rome
embassies which represented victims countries of origin to contact
the related families and help them complete the needed
documentation to receive, at least, the 100 million lire.

<HEADLINE> IMF May Resume Aid to Indonesia in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) may resume its aid to Indonesia in early or mid-July,
according to IMF's top man in Asia, quoted by the local press
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The disbursement of the second tranche of Indonesia's bailout
package can only be resumed once the review is complete, said IMF
Asia Pacific Director Hubert Neiss who arrived here Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
The IMF put on hold the second disbursement of its 43 billion
U.S. dollar Indonesian aid package amounting to one billion U.S.
dollars because of the recent political turmoil which led to the
resignation of former president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
The IMF was to have disbursed the aid on June 4.
</P>
<P>
Neiss said the IMF review team, consisting of around 15 people,
started their task when they arrived in Jakarta last Monday.
</P>
<P>
The review team would be in Jakarta for two to three weeks, he
added.
</P>
<P>
On the visit, Neiss said his visit is aimed at reviewing
Indonesia's macroeconomic targets.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Indonesian State Minister for National Development
Planning Boediono told reporters here Monday that the visit of the
IMF team is not aimed at determining whether or not the IMF will
disburse one billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The discussion will focus on macroeconomic targets, banking
affairs, social safety net and the state budget," Boediono said.

LONDON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- London will not bid to host the

announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With Athens having already being awarded the 2004 Olympic Games
and the probability that another European city will be awarded
the 2006 Winter Games, the BOA decided there would be little point
in entering an expensive and potentially futile race to bring the
Olympic Games back to London, venue of the 1948 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The BOA chairman Craig Reedie said: "A later bid gives us the
opportunity to ensure that we have the time to plan effectively
to create a Games for London of the highest quality."

<HEADLINE> Space Technology Brings Fortune to Chinese Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Zhao Changgeng, a farmer in
Guangchang County in east China's Jiangxi Province, said he never
expected to collect more than 100 kilograms of lotus seeds in a
pond of 0.066 hectares.
</P>
<P>
But that's just what he did with the help of space-bred seeds.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the local Lotus Institute joined the Chinese Academy
of Sciences in carrying out an experiment on the breeding of lotus
seeds on a space satellite. About 800 lotus seeds were put on the
satellite, which was then launched into orbit.
</P>
<P>
A dozen days later, these seeds were sent back to Guangchang
and planted in 800 vats. One year passed and three seeds were
found mutated and named Space One, Two and Three.
</P>
<P>
Zhao planted the offspring of these seeds and they have brought
him good fortune.
</P>
<P>
"Just imagine, one Mu (0.066 ha.) can yield nearly 100 kilograms
of lotus seeds, an unheard-of figure," he said. "Isn't it a miracle?"

Now Zhao, in his 50s, devotes most of his time in his 0.4
hectares of lotus pond, which produces 60 percent of his annual
income.
</P>
<P>
Zhao built a new house and bought a color TV with the money
earned from planting this new lotus variety.

<P>
The space-bred seeds are high-yielding, said Xie Keqiang,
director of the institute, defining the highest per-hectare yield
to be 1,900 kilograms, 60 percent higher than the original variety.
</P>
<P>
"We are planning to set up another 67 hectares of fine
seed-breeding base, so that more farmers will be able to plant
with the space-bred seeds," said Xie.
</P>
<P>
At present, the space-bred seeds have been planted in about
20,000 hectares of lotus ponds in Guangchang and its neighbouring
region, according to local sources.

<HEADLINE> Most World Cup Matches to Be Televised Live in Viet Nam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- 58 out of 64 matches of World
Cup '98 final round will be televised live, much to the excitement
of Vietnamese football fans, according to an announcement from the
Central Viet Nam Television.
</P>
<P>
A ticket to France World Cup '98 has been merely a dream for
most people in Viet Nam where average per capita income is about
some 250 U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
A official report here said the Vietnamese people's love for
this fantastic sport is comparable to that of other to ranking
nations in the world even though the Vietnamese national squad was
ranked 125th in FIFA rankings.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to give viewers better pictures of France '98
matches, VTV installed an additional antenna receiver.
</P>
<P>
The French International Channel (CFI) is responsible for
providing live pictures of matches of the global four-year sport
event organized in France's stadiums from June 10 to July 13 to
VTV.
</P>
<P>
Several 300-inch screens have been installed for the first time
in public places in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh city.
</P>
<P>
Managers of coffee shops, restaurants and hotels in urban areas
throughout the country will not miss this opportunity to promote
their prestige with many of them affording large screen tv sets.
</P>
<P>
In a move to prevent possible negative "social phenomenon"
during the high time, Ho Chi Minh city issued an instruction
providing regulations for leisure facilities in the city to
provide live televised matches at public places.
</P>
<P>
Most of Vietnamese newspapers have devoted large coverage to
carrying reports on France '98 to satisfy local fans' enthusiasm
for the game.
</P>
<P>
Domestic market has been also influenced by this worldwide
sport event. Dealers of tv and sport wear shops are the most
happy.
</P>
<P>
Prices of large-screen tv sets (over 21 inch) have been soaring
in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh city as World Cup approaches.
</P>
<P>
Restaurants, hotels and clubs have done the same thing to be
ready for the event while police, public transports and store
departments are expecting a specially quiet night.

<HEADLINE> Attorney General Asks States to Do Gun Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Attorney General Janet Reno on
Wednesday urged states to do their own criminal background checks
of would-be gun buyers when new national gun control rules take
effect this fall.
</P>
<P>
Beginning November 30, all gun purchases from licensed dealers
will be subject to "instant background checks" done on the spot by
computer or phone. States may do the checks, or leave them to the
FBI. Gun dealers will likely pass on the cost of the check to
customers.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department wants states to do the background checks
to save money at the FBI and to prevent confusion over different
state laws. The FBI plans to charge 13 to 16 dollars per
background check to states that won't do their own.
</P>
<P>
"No one knows more about state records than the states
themselves," Reno said.
</P>
<P>
About half the states have so far agreed to do their own
checks.
</P>
<P>
The National Instant Check System takes effect November 30 as
part of the 1993 Brady Act. The law set up a five-day waiting
period for handgun purchases and also required establishment of a
national system to perform instant checks.
</P>
<P>
The instant checks, which replace the waiting period, are
supposed to weed out felons and others not entitled to buy guns.
</P>
<P>
The system is designed to handle up to 15,000 requests an hour.
About 80 percent of the time, the would-be buyer will get
immediate approval, a Justice Department official said.
</P>
<P>
The system will link the FBI with more than 60,000 gun dealers
nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: African Leaders Heading for Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Conflicts, both real and
potential, are remaining to be the top threat to peace and
stability in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth Africa has attained in recent years is
still fragile, mostly because of this reason.
</P>
<P>
Despite this harsh fact, leaders across the continent, who
have just concluded a continental summit Wednesday, do not seem
pessimistic about the future of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The 34th summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
served as a forum for the leaders to renew their commitment to
build a politically and economically strong Africa in the next
millennium, said President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso, who
has chaired the meeting for the past three days.
</P>
<P>
Instead of being a social gathering of African Heads of State
and Government, a saying rejected by Ghanaian President Jerry
Rawlings, the summit has done a lot in this regard.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the summit, the leaders approved all the 31
resolutions submitted by OAU's Council of Ministers, and adopted
the Ouagadougou Declaration and two decisions on the political
and economic situation in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Issues concerning peace and stability in the continent
dominated the summit.
</P>
<P>
Following heated debate and discussions, the leaders of OAU
member states urged Ethiopia and Eritrea "to put an end to all
hostilities at the same time and simultaneously" so as to prevent
the conflict from escalation.
</P>
<P>
About 50 civilians, including school kids, were reportedly
killed and some 150 wounded during the air raids the two Horn of
African countries launched against each other last week.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict, escalated from border
dispute, erupted when African leaders have just breathed a sigh
of relief with the improvement in the situation in Sierra Leone,
Liberia, Burundi and some other parts of the continent.
</P>
<P>
The leaders, deeply concerned over the conflict, decided that
host President and new OAU Chairman Blaise Compaore leave within
one week for the Horn of Africa at the head of a delegation to
find a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
Another major decision made at the summit is the commitment by
the leaders to enhancing the effectiveness of the central organ
of OAU's conflict prevention, management and resolution
mechanism, aiming at seeking peace and stability for the world's
poorest continent.
</P>
<P>
However, the establishment of an all-African peace keeping
force, which had been widely expected before the summit, did not
appear on the agenda of the leaders who worked together here in
the past three days.

<HEADLINE> IDB Supports Peace Process in Guatemala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) announced here Wednesday the approval of an 8 million
U.S. dollar loan to Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
The resources will be utilized to help finance preinvestment
studies in priority areas as specified by national peace
agreements.
</P>
<P>
The studies will enable the government to rationalize
investments and present financing proposals in a timely way to the
international donor community so as to speed up the process of
mobilizing resources that will push forward the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreements were signed in December 1996 in Guatemala
to end 36 years of armed violence, and the international donors
of the Consultative Group on Guatemala pledged 1.9 billion dollars
in financial assistance to back economic and social development in
the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The IDB, which chaired the consultative group's meetings, has
approved several loans to assist the peace process, including 50
million dollars for the Community Development for Peace Trust
Fund.

<P>
Apart from that, the summit managed to spare considerable time
and energy on economic issues.
</P>
<P>
The leaders in the end adopted a document which aims to
finalize the structure, operational modalities and various
policies of the one-year old African Economic Community (AEC).
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the decision may be seen as a sign to show
that African leaders have taken actions toward the realization of
their political will for the integration of the continent.
</P>
<P>
The latest development followed the encouraging achievements
African countries have made in the past few years, according to
host President Compaore.
</P>
<P>
The African development bank estimated the gross domestic
product growth in African countries at an average of 4.5 percent
in the past two years, up from that of less than two percent
during the 1990-95 period. The growth rate in 1998 and in the
medium-term will be around four to five percent.
</P>
<P>
Higher rate would be achieved if the political crises are duly
coped with and the heavy debt burden reasonably relieved.
</P>
<P>
As for the process of the continental economic integration,
the leaders called for efforts to strengthen the development and
inter- and intra-regional trade, and urged AEC to cooperate
closely with other regional economic organizations.
</P>
<P>
Promoting the development of the private sector has also been
recognized by the leaders as an effective means to boost African
economy.
</P>
<P>
The summit, meanwhile, did not forget to give sufficient
consideration to various social problems concerning poverty,
education, health, women and children, among others.
</P>
<P>
All these that were discussed and decided at the summit are of
critical importance to the future of Africa. People of the
continent, and the world at large, are watching with keen
interest the future development going on under the guidance of
the African leaders.
</P>
<P>
It is the hope of the people that African leaders, on their
part, will make convincing effort to put their commitment into
action for the realization of the common desire for a strong and
prosperous Africa.
</P>
<P>
If this comes true, there will be a bright future for Africa
and the world as a whole.

WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank Wednesday announced the approval of loans totaling 49.35
million U.S. dollars equivalent to help finance a 27 megawatt
geothermal plant in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
This is the first private sector energy project in the country
to be built on the basis of a contract awarded through competitive
bidding.
</P>
<P>
The project is also the first one in the country under the
terms of a 1995 law designed to encourage private investment in
the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
The IDB financing is made up of a 16.45 million dollar loan
from the Bank's ordinary capital and a syndicated loan of 32.9
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The project company, Geoenergia de Guanacaste, Limitada, is
investing some 16.45 million dollars in equity.
</P>
<P>
The power plant, located in a geothermal field in the province
of Guanacaste in northwestern Costa Rica, will sell its entire
electricity to the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad under a

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders Sanctioning Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Wednesday ordered to freeze Serbian assets in the U.S. and ban
investments in that country because of its crackdown on Kosovo
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group, comprising of Germany, France, Britain,
Italy, Russia and the United States, decided to impose the
sanctions last month but suspended it after Belgrade agreed to
talk with the Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the State Department announced the decision to
reimpose sanctions because of the recent escalating violence in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing on Wednesday, State Department
spokesman James Rubin said the U.S. is seeking to arrange
confidence-building measures in Kosovo as a precondition to
resuming talks between Serbia and the separatists.
</P>
<P>
Such measures, he said, could include security guarantees for
the ethnic Albanians, the return of refugees and an agreement to
station observers in the province, where Serbian troops have
launched an offensive to crush separatist sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Washington was in touch with the Kosovo Albanians and the
Serbians with a view to resuming the dialogue, according to Rubin.
The two sides were to have met again last week but the meeting was
called off by the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"We want to establish a situation where both sides recognize
the solution is at the negotiating table, not on the battlefield,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the "best way to do that" is Belgrade offers
"a credible confidence and security building plan" that will give
the Kosovar Albanians new confidence and new assurances.
</P>
<P>
"The Kosovar Albanians have indicated... that to talk in the
absence of a confidence and security building plan and in the
presence of this kind of onslaught is simply untenable. And we
certainly understand that," Rubin said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon and Bulgaria Wednesday
signed two cooperation protocols in diplomatic and cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
The documents were signed here by visiting Bulgarian Foreign
Minister Nadezhda Mikhailova and her Lebanese counterpart Farez
Boueiz, the National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Boueiz said at a joint news
conference with Mikhailova that the two countries should set the
private sector as a key area for bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"From now on, we begin to study the possibility to sign other
cooperation agreements such as accords on avoiding double
taxation and protecting investments between the countries," he
added.
</P>
<P>
From her part, Mikhailova expressed hopes to boost cooperation
ties with Lebanon, especially in the economic aspect, saying the
two countries can be complementary in many fields.
</P>
<P>
She said her country for the first time in the history
witnessed a 4 percent of gross domestic product growth this year
and the foreign exchange reserves also for the first time reached
24 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
She added all these achievements provided a strong base for
cooperations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On south Lebanon issue, the Bulgarian minister said that her
country supports the full implementation of the United Nations
resolution 425 and other international resolutions which will lead
to a solution for the Israeli-Arab conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old resolution calls for an unconditional and
immediate Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Mikhailova came here on Tuesday on a two-day visit. She is the
first Bulgarian foreign minister to visit Lebanon since the
establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries in
1966.

OUAGADOUGOU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- African leaders have decided
to establish an African fund for AIDS control to deal with the
worsening AIDS situation in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the just-ended 34th summit of heads
of state and government of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) after taking into full consideration the serious AIDS
situation and the decisions made in the Dakar declaration on the
AIDS epidemic in Africa (1992) and the Tunis declaration on AIDS
and the child in Africa (1994).
</P>
<P>
The summit expressed full support to the proposal put forward
by the republic of Cote d'Ivoire to establish a solidarity fund
to help treatment of patients from Africa and urged the OAU
Secretary-General to pursue this proposal with the government of
Cote d'Ivoire and concerned agencies and report to the next
summit.
</P>
<P>
However, the summit did not elaborate on details concerning

The summit requested the international community to adequately
consider Africa in the global resources available for HIV/AIDS in
order to facilitate prevention and wider accessibility to current
research findings, especially on drugs and other medicines
necessary in the overall responses to this infection.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the African leaders also urged the
international community, especially the pharmaceutical companies
manufacturing anti-retroviral and other drugs necessary in the
management of HIV/AIDS patients to consider wider accessibility
to those drugs by lowering their retail prices.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985 when the first cases of AIDS were reported in
Africa, the situation in most of the African countries has
worsened and by the year 2000, the continent will have as many as
14 million infected adults and up to 40 million infected children
including 10 million orphans.
</P>
<P>
The social and economic consequences of AIDS have been shown
already to be placing a severe strain on the weak economies of
most of African nations especially those in central, eastern and
southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Even if there were no further infections, the trauma of deaths
of those already infected will continue for the next 20 years,
and the economic and social repercussions will persist for
generations, OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said during
the summit.

<HEADLINE> Suspects on Rwandan Genocide Caught in W. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- U. N. International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) said Wednesday that six Rwandans
allegedly involved in the 1994 Rwanda genocide were arrested in
west Africa last week.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Louise Arbour said in a statement reaching here
that the authorities of Benin, Cote d'Ivoire and Togo arrested
the accused on June 5 and 7 at his request.
</P>
<P>
The move is "the result of the continuing strategy adopted a
year ago to investigate and prosecute persons responsible for
crimes within the jurisdiction of the ICTR and who held positions
of leadership in Rwanda during 1994," said Arbour.
</P>
<P>
Among them are Mathieu Ngirumpatse, President of the National
Revolutionary Movement for Development (MRND) party which held
power at the start of the genocide, and his top aid Edouard
Karamera who was also the interior minister in the interim
government that ruled during the killings.
</P>
<P>
Others are Emmanuel Bagambiki, former Prefect of Cyangugu,
Joseph Nzirorera, former President of the National Assembly and
MRND Secretary-General, Juvenal Kajelijeli, a former senior
official, as well as Omar Serushago, a local military leader.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated over 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were
killed during the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said they would be transferred to the ICTR
headquarters based in northern Tanzanian town of Arusha soon.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal has so far indicted a total of 36 people on the
Rwandan genocide, 25 of them in custody in Arusha.

<P>
NAIROBI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Malawi has called on Southern
African Development Community (SADC) member states to integrate
their management efforts to overcome water scarcity in the
region, the Malawi News Agency (MANA) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
MANA quoted Malawian Minister of Water Development Edward
Bwanali as saying that the lack of integrated efforts in the
sub-region is counterproductive in the task of achieving the
objectives of the SADC's water sector.
</P>
<P>
"We should recognize as an immediate goal the need to
collectively achieve success and overcome this prevalent water
scarcity," Bwanali told a sectoral committee meeting of senior
SADC water sector officials in Malawian capital Lilongwe.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that water is a vital component for the
region's social and economic development, MANA reported in a
dispatch sent to Xinhua based in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
"The region's socio-economic development is being threatened
by prevalent water scarcity, degradation, depletion, exploitation
and conflict of interests which also result from lack of
integrated requirements," said Bwanali.
</P>
<P>
He added that water is the "backbone of economic development
within the SADC."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, "Let's do justice to ourselves by
critically assessing all the proposals on integrated water
resources management at national and regional levels."

WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung said Wednesday that American investors can yield big
rewards if they invest in South Korea and buy its companies'
stocks.
</P>
<P>
"Korea will become one of the best countries for international
investors to freely and safely do business," Kim told a joint
meeting of the House and Senate. "This is a precious opportunity.
And we must seize it."
</P>
<P>
During his half-hour speech, Kim gently prodded the
Republican-led Congress to do more to help the International
Monetary Fund replenish its accounts, badly strained by the Asian
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The administration's 18 billion dollar IMF bill has been
stalled in Congress for two months, mostly over unrelated issues.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF is to international finance what the Federal Reserve
is to your nation's financial system -- the lender of last
resort," Kim said. "And the IMF deserves continued support."
</P>
<P>
Kim said his country needs help from the United States so that
South Korea could come out of financial abyss.
</P>

Earlier, Kim made a similar appeal to business leaders here,
urging them to invest in South Korea and buy its companies'

<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- African leaders who ended a
summit here Wednesday called again for the lift of sanctions
imposed by the United Nations Security Council on Libya.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions has created immense human and material losses to
the Libyan people and nationals of other member states of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), according to a decision
adopted at the summit.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council was recommended to soften its stance
so that Libyans and their leaders as well could fly out of the
country for humanitarian and religious activities, said OAU
Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim at a press conference at the
end of the summit.
</P>
<P>
African countries respect the resolutions of the U.N. Security
Council, but they will not comply any longer with that two
resolutions numbered 748 (1992) and 883 (1993) respectively if
the United States and Britain refuse to accept that the two
Libyan suspects of the 1988 bombing of Pan-American Flight 103
over Lockerbie, Scotland, be tried in a third neutral country, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"OAU and its members will not comply from now on with the
sanctions imposed against Libya related to religious obligations,
providing humanitarian emergencies or fulfilling OAU statutory
obligations," the decision says.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also expressed regret for lack of positive
response by the U.S. and Britain to the international and
national initiatives and efforts aiming at finding a solution to
the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The two Western countries have insisted that the two Libyan
suspects be tried in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The International Court of Justice has confirmed its
competence to look into the dispute, which has been welcomed by
African countries.

Announcing the visit Wednesday, Cypriot Foreign Minister

<P>
LUSAKA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba Wednesday strongly urged Ethiopia and Eritrea to stop
fighting and resolve their border dispute through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the appeal in Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina
Faso, when Ethiopian and Eritrean foreign ministers called on
him, according to the Zambia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
he told the two ministers that extermination and decimating of
human life is not acceptable.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said Zambia is not making a judgement over the
conflict because it has already had inside information of how the
war started.
</P>
<P>
He said what matters is not who started the conflict and the
current military actions are not acceptable because they are
causing loss of life and damage to property.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will assist Africa much if they end their
hostilities and allow a peaceful resolution to their crisis, the
president said.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Moderate Newspaper Jame'e Banned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Tehran public court Wednesday
revoked the publication license of the moderate daily newspaper
Jame'e (society), which has so far released 87 issues, Iranian
official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The court also banned the daily's license holder and managing
director Hamid Reza Jalaiepour from working in a similar position
for one year.
</P>
<P>
Jalaiepour was also fined 16 million rials (about 2,857
U.S. dollars), the IRNA said without mentioning the charges
against the daily and its managing director.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said commander of the Islamic Revolution's
Guards Corps (IRGC) Yahya Rahimi Safavi accused the daily, which
started its publication about three months ago, of revealing his
secret speech and insulting the IRGC and himself.
</P>
<P>
In April, Safavi reportedly warned to crack down on a wave of
internal dissent and criticism in a meeting with the IRGC navy
commanders. His speech was interpreted as a warning to the
moderates and their newspapers, who strongly criticized Safavi for
his hard-line remarks.
</P>
<P>
However, the IRGC later stated that Safavi's speech was
distorted by the print mass media.
</P>
<P>
The ban on the moderate daily coincided with the open trial on
Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi and a demand of impeachment
of the Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Local observers noted that the ban on Jame'e and the trial on
Karbaschi would pose a serious blow to the moderates, main
supporters of the government of President Mohammad Khatami.

LUSAKA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Finance Minister Edith
Nawakwi Wednesday urged the stock market to ensure that investors
coming into the country are properly protected, according to
Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
Opening the securities legislation-term review workshop in
Lusaka, Nawakwi said the investor is the most important player in
any securities market and that if he feels cheated, the market
would collapse.
</P>
<P>
"If the investor, however small or big, feels cheated and not
properly protected, they will not trade and the market will
collapse," said the finance minister.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that strong statutory regulation of the
securities market is needed in order to promote investor
protection.
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi further called for the participation of all stake
holders in the regulation of the capital market.
</P>
<P>
The market must be fair, efficient and transparent apart from
being an attractive destination for local and offshore funds, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
She added that the securities and exchange commission as an
advisory body must be operated in a manner that it will maximize
public confidence in the transparency and fairness of the market.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Struggle to 2-1 Win over Scotland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SAINT DENIS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Brazil
needed a huge share of luck today to beat underdogs Scotland 2-1 in
the opening game of the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
An own goal from Tommy Boyd at the 73rd minute lifted the
Brazilian team to the victory.
</P>
<P>
The four-time world champions controlled much of the game but
failed to display their spark and flare of traditional Brazilian
football.
</P>
<P>
Cafu came free in front of the net only to have his shot blocked
by the face of goalkeeper Jim Leighton. But the ball rebounded off
the upper body of Boyd and settled into the net.
</P>
<P>
Boyd, a 32-year-old defender from Celtic, said after the
match:"It is not the kind of goal I like to score. The ball broke
from midfield and one of their guys hit it and Jimmy made a great
save and it hit off my chest and there was nothing I could do to get
out of the way."
</P>
<P>
"It's probably the worst feeling I have ever had in football,"
said John Collins, who last scored an own goal againstAberdeen three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Collins said:"Brazil snatched it. That is fate for you and that
is the way things go for Scotland in the World Cup."
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo played superbly, particularly in the first half. He set
up Rivaldo with a dummy and then created a chance for Leonardo with
a backheel. He also displayed his magical dribbling skills and
threatened the Scottish goal with his shots several times.
</P>
<P>
However, the Brazilian team looked uninspired and Scotland
looked set to clinch a point when the disaster struck.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia has intensified
anti-drug fight as drug abuse is growing in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the U.N. special session on drugs here on
Wednesday, Deputy Foreign Minister Yury Ushakov said the Law on
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances which meets
international standards entered into force in Russia in April,
among other anti-drug measures.
</P>
<P>
Russia attaches importance to building up a reliable anti-drug
barrier within the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States)
framework, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of joint large scale operations of CIS law
enforcement agencies in recent years, hundreds of drug dealers
with worldwide connections have been neutralized, he added.
</P>
<P>
Russia has a total of 2 million people engaged in drug abuse,
with the annual growth rate of drug addicts moving from 10 to 15
percent in the beginning of the 1990s up to 60 percent in 1997, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Russia is located at the cross-roads of major traffic
itineraries of drug production and consumption where drug
smuggling from abroad is growing rapidly, the official noted.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said on Wednesday that the risk of disaster in
South Asia is high following nuclear tests by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"For both nations, the strategic environment is now far more
complicated and grave. Both face the prospect of an arms race
neither can afford. Each faces the risk of nuclear missiles
being pointed at their cities," Albright told a group of
non-proliferation experts at Henry L. Stimson Center.
</P>
<P>
"Neither can be confident it will have early warning of what
the other will do. And the risk of misinformation leading to
miscalculation, leading to disaster, is high," she added.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the payoff for exploding nuclear devices by
India and Pakistan is "mutual insecurity, decreased prosperity,
a harvest of fear at home and condemnation abroad."
</P>
<P>
She called on leaders in New Delhi and Islamabad "to forswear
any future tests and to refrain from deploying nuclear weapons
or from testing missiles capable of delivering them."
</P>
<P>
She also urged both countries to join the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty without conditions.

<HEADLINE> President: Cyprus to Keep Good Ties with Israel, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides said Wednesday that Cyprus will continue to strengthen
its ties with Israel while maintaining friendship with the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering of world Jewish community leaders
Wednesday evening in the southwestern coastal town of Limassol,
Clerides said Cyprus made the decision despite the military
alliance between Israel and Turkey, its arch rival.
</P>
<P>
This was because Cyprus had taken into consideration of the
assurances given by the Israeli government over the nature of its
alliance with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to continue working for the strengthening of our
relations with Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Turkey have been upgrading their military ties since
early 1996 when the two countries signed an important military
cooperation agreement. Turkey has since come under strong
criticism from the Arab world for allying with Israel.
</P>
<P>
But Clerides at the same time made it clear that Cyprus'
good relations with Israel "will not in any way change our friendly
feelings and close relations with our Arab neighbors."
</P>
<P>
He lauded Arab neighbors for having all along supported Cyprus
in "our struggle for freedom and justice for Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
The president added that Cyprus' entry to the European
Union would enhance its role as a bridge of cooperation and
cultural interaction between the Middle East and Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We fully share the vision of a peaceful and prosperous
Middle East, characterized by new challenges and opportunities and
increased cooperation and prosperity for all the peoples in
the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 Jewish community leaders from around the world
gathered in Cyprus to thank the people of the island for helping
Jews detained in two camps here by the British army after the
World War II.

LONDON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
issued a stark warning Wednesday that military action might be
needed to resolve the worsening Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at British parliament Wednesday afternoon, Blair said
that Britain was attempting to get support from other countries to
press Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to resolve the Kosovo
crisis by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
"The only circumstance in which we will ensure that President
Milosevic responds to diplomatic pressure is if that is backed up
by the threat, the credible threat, of the use of military force,"
Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Blair, who has just finished a whistle-stop tour of other 14
European Union (EU) countries, noted that Britain had been working
"to get the necessary support for that course of action".
</P>
<P>
"If we can do that, then of course we will be in a position to
make that diplomacy work, and if that diplomacy fails, then we
should be in a position to take the military action necessary," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from the Contact Group countries including
the United States, Russia, Germany, France, Italy and Britain will
meet in London on Friday to discuss how to defuse the Kosovo

TEHRAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
gathered his cabinet members on Wednesday to discuss the possible
impeachment of Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri proposed by the
Majlis or parliament.
</P>
<P>
Khatami expressed his welcome to impeachment, saying that the
process of impeachment would help bring about the necessary
transparency in the matter, the Iranian official news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Nouri has the necessary capability to
elaborate on the stance and issues related to the Interior
Ministry," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He added that "although we may share differences of opinion on
the timing of the impeachment of the interior minister with some
of Majlis deputies, we hope that with the good-will of the Majlis
deputies and their alertness, the consequences would tilt to the
benefit of the country, the government and the people."
</P>
<P>
However, it was not clear whether the cabinet, which was formed
last August, has made any decision to counter the possible
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
The impeachment demand was raised by 31 conservative Majlis
deputies who claimed that "continuation of Nouri's service in the
post of interior minister is detrimental to tranquillity and
stability in the country."
</P>
<P>
In a swift response, Khatami said that his interior minister is
a "capable, outstanding personality of the revolution and the
system" and has been successful at his job.
</P>
<P>
Nouri was accused of creating tension in the society, making
provocative interviews and speeches in different provinces and
appointing inexperienced people to managerial posts at his

<HEADLINE> Scientists Solve A Long-Standing Mystery about The Sun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A clash of magnetic fields is
likely to explain why the Sun's outer atmosphere is much hotter
than its surface, researchers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
For more than half a century, scientists have been puzzled by
the fact that the surface of the Sun is barely 6,000 degrees
Centigrade, while that of its outer atmosphere scorches up to
several million degrees.
</P>
<P>
A new discovery, made by the research team led by Professor
Eric Priest of St Andrews University in Scotland, together with
scientists in Britain, France and the United States, have partly
solved this long-standing mystery.
</P>
<P>
The scientists believed that a clash of magnetic field lines,
tangling like spaghetti, is causing heating of gigantic and
super-hot loops that extend high up over the Sun's surface into
its outer atmosphere, thus producing the extreme temperature.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that scientist are able to measure how the
temperature varies along such giant loops by using the Soft X-ray
Telescope on a space satellite called Yohkoh, according to a press
release from St Andrews University.
</P>
<P>
The researchers will detail their findings in a letter to the
scientific journal Nature of 11th June, the press release said.

Besides Mcbride, the source said, other two accomplices, Vusi
Mbatha and Alexandre Uambe, were also on trial.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, the court will review the argument
presented by the defense attorneys of the accused and then decide
whether there is enough evidence for sentencing them.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican judges have not been able to bring Mcbride to
court since he was detained in March in Machava prison in the
suburb of Maputo City. Therefore, Mcbride's defense attorney
Albano Silva demanded that the Supreme Court of Mozambique should
withdraw the case.
</P>
<P>
According to the Mozambican law, the accused could be
sentenced to 16 to 20 years of imprisonment on espionage and
eight to 12 years of imprisonment for arms smuggling.

<HEADLINE> Norway, Morocco Draw 2-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MONTPELLIER, June 10 (XInhua) -- Norway rallied to draw Morocco
2-2 in a World Cup Group A match here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Morocco played an entertaining game with their splendid skills
while Norway displayed their stamina and strength to come from
behind twice for the draw.
</P>
<P>
Hadji starred in the game and opened the scoring at the 38th minute
with a fine sole performance. Norway levelled the score 1-1 just
before the interval thanks to an own goal from Amzine who tried to
clear the ball but headed the ball home instead.
</P>
<P>
After the interval, the two teams played as strongly as in the
first half. Hadda put Morocco 2-1 ahead in the 59th minute but only
to see his team's advantage faded away two minutes later.
</P>
<P>
The match was quite fierce and exciting as well. The two teams
stole the limelight on the day when defending champions Brazil
played the opening match against Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian team, trying to win their fifth World Cup in
France, put up an under-par performance and won the match thanks to
good luck.
</P>
<P>
Tommy Boyd of Scotland scored an own goal to help lift Brazil to
a 2-1 victory though the Brazilians controlled most of the match.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo proved that he is the genius but failed to score. It
was Cesar Sampaio who scored for the Brazilian team.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio repeated his feat in the friendly against Germany when
he headed home a corner from Bebeto to put Brazil 1-0 ahead. But he
then brought down Kevin Gallacher in the penalty area and John
Collins converted the shot from the spot.
</P>
<P>
Then came Boyd to Brazil's rescue. He punched home a rebound to
give Brazil the win.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Italy will play Chile at Bordeaux while Cameroon
takes on Austria at Toulouse.

<HEADLINE> UK Likely to Review Compensation for Ex-POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
promised here Wednesday that his government would consider whether
to demand more compensation from Japan for former British
prisoners of war (POWs).
</P>
<P>
Blair reportedly made the promise after meeting leaders of
groups representing the war veterans who maintain that it was not
too late to make such a claim.
</P>
<P>
Mark Oaten, chairman of an all-party parliamentary group of MPs
which looks after the interests of the war veterans, told
reporters that the 40-minute meeting marked "a significant change
in the government's position".
</P>
<P>
Martyn Day, the lawyer advising the POWs groups, said: "The
government clearly has the political will to put the case to the
Japanese government if they are satisfied about the law."
</P>
<P>
The British government had previously ruled out the possibility
of demanding more compensations from Japan on the grounds that
Britain had accepted final compensation terms from Japan in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll, which was carried out by the war veterans,
revealed that 76 percent of British people believed the veterans
should receive full compensation and a formal apology from Japan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Navy to Face Pilot Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Navy could soon face
pilot shortage as the Air Force do partly because of increased
hiring by commercial airlines and operational stress, the Navy's
top admiral said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Admiral Jay Johnson, chief of naval operations, told reporters
the Navy was moving quickly to boost pilot retention and avoid a
shortfall expected within two years.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force said last week that it has a shortage of several
hundred pilots and operational stress could leave the service
2,000 short of the required number of pilots in two years.
</P>
<P>
The service is facing unplanned operational tensions because
its pilots are now being increasingly deployed with 90-day Air
Expeditionary Forces to the Gulf and other trouble spots around
the world.
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that the Navy appeared to have a pilot retention
advantage over the Air Force because its aviators have been
traditionally required to make annual six-months deployments at
sea with carrier battle groups.
</P>
<P>
But he said that when large numbers of Navy pilots are promoted
to higher, nonflying ranks over the next two years, the service
will have to increase recruiting rates for pilots by up to 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Air Force General Richard Hawley, chief of the Air
Combat Command, called for additional cuts in U.S. air power in
the Gulf near Iraq, citing stress on American personnel and the
ability to dispatch warplanes quickly to threaten Iraq in any new
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The United States has recently announced a reduction of its
military presence in the Gulf region to maintain some 200
warplanes and one aircraft carrier, the level before a major
build-up over U.N. arms inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But Hawley said that operational stress was mounting in the
shrinking Air Force because of growing deployments to world
trouble spots and that even deeper cuts could be made in the Gulf
for now.
</P>
<P>
Some 5,000 Air Force personnel were currently deployed in
temporary overseas assignments and it caused extra work in
U.S.-based units providing the deployed fliers and ground crews,
said Hawley.
