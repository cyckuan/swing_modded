<HEADLINE> Iran to Hold Second Round of Parliament Elections (Part II) (By Chen Ming)  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Political analysts here said that the victory of the two
candidates in Tehran was more a tribute to their own individual
popularity than to popularity of their respective factions.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri belongs to the powerful Society of Combatant Clergy
(SCC) whereas Faezeh Hashemi, an outspoken feminist, was
nominated by the liberal group known as G-6 which supports
President Rafsanjani's development policies.
</P>
<P>
SCC controls about two thirds of current parliament. But early
results of the votes showed that the traditional rightist group
has lost its firm hold on the parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here believe that SCC has not lost its
influence over the voters in Tehran. They point to the fact that
out of 30 top candidates in Tehran's March 8th elections, some 22
people were nominated by the SCC.
</P>
<P>
Out of seven G-6 candidates included in the list of 30 who
received the highest votes, six are members of the leftist groups
which allied themselves with G-6 in a bid to end SCC's rule over
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The leftists have also made great gains in the provinces. A
parliamentary observer told Xinhua that the leftists have won
more seats in the provinces than the rightists.
</P>
<P>
"In many provinces, including the northeastern province of
Khorassan, the leftists defeated incumbent rightists," he said.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here said that the rise of the leftists
could be explained based on the economic hardships that people
have experienced since 1993.
</P>
<P>
"The people hold the rightists responsible for the economic
woes they are suffering. Naturally, they are driven to vote
rightist MP's out of the parliament," one observers said.
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen to what extent the alliance between the
left and the modernist liberals will last. Some observers here
believe that the leftists will not be able to work with modernist
liberals.

<HEADLINE> New CIS Integration Steps to Be Announced Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said today that new steps aimed at promoting further
integration within the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
will be approved and announced soon.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters here that the presidents of Russia,
Kazakhstan and Belarus will meet in late March to approve and
announce "a serious decisions to strengthen the CIS integration."
</P>
<P>
"This is required by the logic of the living processes of
restoration of friendly relations, mutually assistance and
cooperation within the CIS," the premier added.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, attempts "to return us to the state of
preprogrammed collapse, to the agony of the dying Soviet Union
will bring benefits."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the resolution adopted by the State Duma (lower
house of the Russian Parliament) Friday, Chernomyrdin stressed
that "it is hard to take it seriously" because it was designed to
"work for the elections."
</P>
<P>
The resolution declared null and void the 1991 agreements
signed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and then leaders of
Ukraine and Belarus on the dissolution of the Soviet Union and on
the formation of the CIS.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the communist-dominated Duma, the premier called
its resolutions "more than abstract" and "a part of the left
opposition's election tactics."
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that it was not a joking matter especially
considering the fact that it was adopted by the people who want to
come to power.
</P>
<P>
The presidential elections in the country are scheduled for
June 16. Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov has been seen as
the most strong rival of Yeltsin who declared a month ago that he
would run for a second term of office.
</P>
<P>
In a statement circulated here earlier today, Yeltsin described
the Duma decisions as "an direct contradiction to the
Constitution," noting that those who adopted the documents "intend
to create a situation of a political and legal impasse in Russia."
</P>
<P>
He warned that he would not allow any attempts at undermining
the foundation of the Russian state and destabilizing the
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
But Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov said in his statement today
that "the Duma's resolutions give no reason to speculate that
somebody intends to restore the former state by force."
</P>
<P>
"Deputies who voted for adopting these resolutions declared
after about five years passed that the great Soviet Union was
destroyed despite the peopel's will and with gross violations of
the Soviet Constitution," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Duma speaker also noted that the Duma deputies "told the
whole world on behalf of their voters that the three leaders of
former Soviet republics had stolen their country."

<HEADLINE> Iran to Hold Second Round of Parliament Elections (Part I) (By Chen Ming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced today that it will
hold a second round of parliamentary elections in mid April which
will deepen the rift between liberals headed by President
Rafsanjani and conservatives headed by hard-line Parliament
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
The main battle is expected to take place in the capital of
Tehran as only two of the 402 candidates got enough votes in the
first round and 56 candidates will compete for 28 vacant seats
left in the second round of the elections for the capital city.
</P>
<P>
In the first round of elections held March 8, some 139
candidates found their way into the Iranian parliament known as
Islamic Consultative Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The election rules mandate that only top candidates who
receive at least one third of the votes will win in the first
round. Only 139 people were elected into the 270-seat parliament
on March 8.
</P>
<P>
Across the country some 262 candidates will jockey for 131
remaining seats. An official at the Interior Ministry told Xinhua
today that the race this April will be between top candidates from
80 constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Official figures for the first round of elections put the
number of voters at over 24.7 million people, which is above 32
percent more than the number of voters who voted in 1992
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Despite heavy promotional blitz by different rightist factions
prior to the elections, only a small number of individual
rightist candidates emerged across the nation, with the exception
of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that most voters voted for individual
candidates, people whom they knew or trusted, instead of their
factions.
</P>
<P>
As another failure of the factions, they also pointed to the
strong anti-incumbent mood in the provinces leading to the
election of 84 fresh faces for the fifth parliament. Most of the
84 candidates elected reportedly have no connections with any of
the existing groups but are said to have leftist leanings.
</P>
<P>
"This election showed that the factions, mainly rightist
factions, failed to address the bread-and-butter issues," said one
observer.
</P>
<P>
"If people had cared about the factions, they would have
filled out all the blank spots on the voting sheets, especially
here in Tehran," he added.
</P>
<P>
The capital city has a share of 30 seats in the
parliament. But only two candidates have been chosen, Parliament
Speaker Nateq-Nouri and President Rafsanjani's daughter Faezeh
Hashemi.

<HEADLINE> Swazi King Promises To Review Its Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 16 (Xinhua)-- Swaziland's existing
constitution will be reviewed and then put to the entire nation
for decision, Swazi King Mswati II said today in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Mswati told reporters that the people of Swaziland would
decide which political route the country should take.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on the day, Mswati met South African President Nelson
Mandela, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and Botswana
President Ketumile Masire to brief them on the political
situation in his country.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only southern African country where political
parties are banned. Mswati's father King Sobhuza II outlawed all
political parties when he suspended the constitution and
introduced emergency rule in 1973.
</P>
<P>
Thus far the executive King Mswati, who rules his kingdom by
decree, has resisted growing pressure from the still-banned
opposition parties to allow multiparty politics in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mswati said he briefed the three leaders on the actions his
country are about to initiate. But he said he would consult his
people on the road ahead after his return to Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
A proposed committee will look into the present constitution,
from where every Swazi will be given an opportunity to say
whatever he wants to say, said the king.
</P>
<P>
A formal constitution will then be drawn up with the help of
lawyers and presented to the Swazi people, added Mswati.
</P>
<P>
When asked what the role of the opposition will be in this
process, Mswati said: ''We leave that to the nation to decide
which direction it wants to take."

<HEADLINE> Mandela Optimistic About Proposed Imbizo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 16 (Xinhua)-- South African President
Nelson Mandela today said that he was not discouraged by his
discordant meeting with traditional Zulu leaders yesterday.
</P>
<P>
He believed a planned Imbizo (a gathering of the Zulu nation)
will still take place.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at his official Pretoria residence,
Mandela said he was happy about the outcome of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
''Despite the discordance, one thing came out clearly: people
were beginning to think,'' said the president, noting that the
overwhelming majority of people in Kwazulu/Natal were yearning
for peace.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Mandela met about 300 traditional Zulu leaders at
Nongoma in Kwazulu/Natal in a bid to set the agenda for the
proposed Imbizo to bring an end to the violence in the
strife-torn province.
</P>
<P>
However, what Mandela said at the meeting drew some angry
responses and loud jeers from some chiefs.
</P>
<P>
Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and Inkatha Freedom Party leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on the day, Mandela conceded that Friday's meeting was
a difficult one, but said no one should be disheartened by this.
</P>
<P>
Asked when an Imbizo could be expected, Mandela said: ''We
have to examine the matter carefully and having done so, decide
what to do.''
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, African National Congress leader in Kwazulu/Natal
Jacob Zuma said that he was confident a date for the proposed
Imbizo would be set soon.
</P>
<P>
There would be a follow-up meeting to decide on the Imbizo
date, said Zuma.

LUSAKA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has opted
for amendment of the current constitution instead of adopting a
new constitution, revealed the constitution of Zambia (amendment)
bill published here today.
</P>
<P>
The amendment bill repeals 14 provisions of the current
constitution including the provisions relating to the
qualification for presidential candidates based on origin or
birth of the candidate's parents among others.
</P>
<P>
The option will facilitate the ruling party and government to
pass the amendment bill at parliament, according to local press
reports.
</P>
<P>
For the past several months, some of opposition parties and
mass organizations have insisted that a new constitution should
be adopted by a larger constituent assembly and a national
referendum.
</P>

Both adoption of a new constitution and amendment of the
current one are provided in clauses suggested by the Zambia

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Requests UN to Investigate Theft of Icons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government has
asked the U.N. to investigate an alleged theft of icons from
the historic St Barnabas Monastery in the Turkish occupied
northern areas of the island.
</P>
<P>
The request was made following a report today by the Turkish
Cypriot newspaper "Kibris" that 10 to 12 armed masked men broke
into the Monastery, which the Turkish Cypriot regime has turned
into a "Museum", and several icons were stolen.
</P>
<P>
The paper also reported that the masked men have pillaged the
tomb of St Barnabas, the founder of the Greek Orthodox Church of
Cyprus. No information is available so far as regards what was
stolen from the tomb.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, government spokesman Yiannakis
Cassoulides said that Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides has
made presentations to the U.N. resident representative in
Cyprus, Gustave Feissel.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister asked the U.N. to investigate the incident
 as soon as possible and to "take all necessary measures to
prevent the export of icons or other objects of cultural and
religious value that might have been stolen".
</P>
<P>
He also asked the U.N. to help locate the icons, so as to keep
them in a safe place and to see that the pillaged tomb of St
Barnabas is restored.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides has also asked the ambassadors of the U.S. and
Britain to the island "to intervene for the protection of Cyprus'
cultural and religious heritage" which is threatened.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has also given instructions to its
permanent representatives to the UNESCO and the European Union to
ask for their intervention.
</P>
<P>
St Barnabas Monastery, situated in the Turkish-controlled
Famagusta District, was founded in the fifth century A.D. by
Archbishop Anthemios.

<HEADLINE> Regulator Bars 9 Ex-Barings Executives from City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Nine former executives of Barings
have been barred from working in the City for their share in the
responsibility for the collapse of the UK merchant bank a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Futures Authority (SFA), which grants the
vital licenses needed to operate in Britain's financial markets,
Friday served notices of disciplinary proceedings against the nine
former executives of Barings.
</P>
<P>
The SFA, the regulator for brokers and futures dealers, which
has been investigating 12 former senior Barings employees, told
the nine they had failed to show "due skill, care and diligence"
and were guilty of "misconduct."
</P>
<P>
The nine include Peter Norris, former chief executive of
Barings' investment banking division, and Ron Baker, head of the
financial products group and manager of Nick Leeson, whose trading
in Singapore brought down the bank.
</P>
<P>
The SFA is suspending the individuals from its registers for
one to three years, and it has charged them costs of 10,000 pounds
(15,200 U.S. dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
They have 10 working days to decide whether to come to a
settlement with the SFA or take their case to a tribunal.
</P>
<P>
But the SFA cleared the two most senior Barings executives
under investigation, Peter Baring, chairman of the Barings group,
and Andrew Tuckey, the deputy chairman, saying it had found no
evidence indicating that responsibility for the Barings crash
could be attributed to their actions.
</P>
<P>
The SFA, in taking its relatively limited action, has largely
followed the Bank of England report into the Barings collapse and
rejected the contention of the Singapore inspectors that Barings
executives conspired to cover up losses.
</P>
<P>
The suspensions and costs are relatively mild for the SFA,
which can expel individuals outright from its registers and has
imposed fines as high as 200,000 pounds (304,000 U.S. dollars) on
individuals who profited from their misconduct.
</P>
<P>
But the SFA came under immediate criticism from Jonathan Stone,
representative of Barings note holders who lost 100 million pounds
(152 million U.S. dollars) in the collapse. "So much for the City
regulation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Former and current Barings executives attacked what they
regarded as the SFA's double standards in punishing the mid-level
executives while refraining from censure of the chairmen. "This is
the system protecting itself," said one former executive.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Moldovan President Mircea
Snegur Friday ordered the dismissal of Defense Minister Pavel
Creanga, accusing him of misusing army property, said reports from
Chisinau, capital of the former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
The president appointed First Deputy Defense Minister Tudor
Dabija as the acting minister.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the presidential press service said that
Dabija had taken measures to ensure discipline and order in the
army and to prevent the use of the army by some forces for their
political goals.
</P>
<P>
However, Creanga has declined to step down, saying the order
for his removal was unconstitutional. A statement from the Defense
Ministry's press service described the president's accusation
against Creanga as "groundless".
</P>
<P>
The Moldovan parliament convened an emergency meeting this
morning following the order for the removal of Creanga.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Deputy Speaker Dumitru Motban said that the
president's order violated the Constitution, and that "the army
has been split and parliament should take resolute actions."
</P>
<P>
According to Moldovan law, the president has no right to
directly dismiss government members, who may be dismissed only at
the prime minister's request or through a vote in the parliament.

<HEADLINE> GCC Forces End Maneuvers in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Joint military forces from
five of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states have ended
their two-week-long maneuvers, Kuwait News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The Peninsula Shield Forces wrapped up their drills in Kuwait's
northern area of Adaira, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The GCC member states, with the exception of Qatar, sent troops
to participate in the maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
The set targets were accurately met and a lot of experience
gained after the maneuvers, Kuwait's Defense Minister Ahmed
Al-Humoud al-Sabah told the press following the conclusion of the
maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his regret over the Qatari absence from the
maneuvers, but said "we understand the special circumstances which
Qatar is passing through."
</P>
<P>
Qatar did not participate in the drills because of loggerheads
with some of its GCC partners.
</P>
<P>
In his speech before the conclusion of the maneuvers, Chief of
Staff of the Kuwaiti armed forces Ali al-Momen lauded the role
played by the Peninsula Shield forces during the 1991 Gulf War, in
which the GCC forces were part of the U.S.-led multi-national
coalition forces that drove the Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"We turned the most important lessons we gained from the war
for the liberation of Kuwait into facts on the theater through the
Peninsula Shield maneuvers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The success of the maneuvers was the fruit of proper
planning and joint efforts by the GCC member states, he said.
</P>
<P>
Training Director Rashed Al-Saif said that most of the Kuwaiti
military forces, including F-18 fighters and Gazelle helicopters,
took part in the drills.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Palestinians Demonstrate against Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Palestinian
workers took to the street in Gaza today in protest against the
closure imposed on the Palestinian territories by Israel after a
Jerusalem bus bombing 20 days ago.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators came by bus, truck, car or whatever to the Erez
Crossing between the Gaza Strip and Israel, tossing tomatoes and
flowers in the air to show their anger.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat came out of his
office to address the protesters. Slamming the closure, he said
that Israel wants to subjugate and siege the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also pointed an accusing finger at Iran, which,
according to him, ordered the recent suicide bombing attacks in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that Arafat specifically singled out
Iran as the mastermind of a series of attacks which killed nearly
60 people.
</P>
<P>
Under heavy pressure from the Palestinians, the Israeli
military authorities will further ease the closure Sunday,
according to a report of Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian workers will be allowed to return to their
jobs at areas of industrial zones in the West Bank. Agricultural
produce will also be allowed to be brought out from the Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the ban on the internal traffic between villages in
the West bank was lifted. But the ban on Palestinian entry into
Israel will remain in force.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Strong Counter-Terrorism Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today called the Republican-controlled House of Representatives
soft on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"The House took the teeth out of our efforts to fight
terrorism," Clinton said in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged the Senate to stand firm and turn the bill back
into the "strong anti-terrorism legislation I want to sign and
America needs." A Senate-House conference committee will draft a
final version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
The Senate passed the administration-backed version of the
legislation last June, but the president criticized the House for
delaying until "finally acting to gut the bill."
</P>
<P>
The House approved the measure Thursday after conservative
Republicans and pro-gun Democrats voted to drop key sections on
the grounds they would have given federal law enforcement
officials excessive power and endangered individual liberties.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the House removed a provision to chemically mark
explosive materials commonly used by terrorists "because, for some
reason, the Washington gun lobby opposed it."
</P>
<P>
He said the House also removed from the bill language giving
the Justice Department authority to stop terrorist organizations
from raising money in the United States and a provision to permit
the quick deportation of foreign nationals who support terrorist
activities.
</P>
<P>
"And it voted to cripple our ability to use high-tech
surveillance to keep up with stealthy and fast-moving terrorists,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time the bill went easy on terrorists, it got
tough on law enforcement officials," he said. "The House stripped
a provision that would have helped protect police officers from
cop-killer bullets. And it ordered a commission to study not the
terrorists, but the federal law enforcement officials who put
their lives on the line to fight terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"Congress should get back on track and send me tough
legislation that cracks down on terrorism," he said. "It should
listen to the cries of the victims..., not the back-alley whispers
of the gun lobby."

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi navy has been given the
responsibility for helping maintain the security of Chittagong
port and keep it functioning.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by State Minister for Shipping Shajahan
Siraj here today at a high-level meeting held to review the
activities of the ports.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the security provided to Chittagong port,
the largest port in Bangladesh, by the civilian forces was
disrupted by the intervention of the mayor who is also the
opposition leader of the city. He asked the port authority to take
orders from him if the port is to be operating.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition parties have launched an indefinite
strike-like non-cooperation movement to press the demand for
annulment of the ruling party-held February 15 elections,
resignation of the present government and holding of a fresh poll
under a neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
The stand-off that has been created at Chittagong port due to
the current situation in the country has pushed the import-export
and garments and other industries onto the verge of closure, the
state minister said.
</P>
<P>
The official confirmed that arrangements are being made to
transport goods from Chittagong port to different places including
the capital Dhaka.

<HEADLINE> Governor Foresees Economic Boom From Local Advantages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Shaanxi Province in northwest China
is striving to have a booming economy at the end of the century by
taking full advantage of its rich natural and tourism resources as
well as its strong scientific research capabilities, according to
Governor Cheng Andong.
</P>
<P>
Cheng talked about Shaanxi's economic development plans at a
press conference hosted here today by the on-going session of the
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi has abundant natural resources. A total of 92 types of
minerals have been discovered there, with deposits of 28 minerals
ranking first to third among all provinces, he said.
</P>
<P>
The province is expected to develop the world's largest fine
coal field and one of China's largest natural gas production
bases, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe in 1997 or the year next, Beijing will be able to
use gas from Shaanxi," he announced.
</P>
<P>
The province has 56 universities and colleges and nearly 1,000
research institutions, and its capability in scientific and
technological studies is next only to Beijing and Shanghai, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the coming five years, the province will take effective
measures to turn its research advantages into industrial strength,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi was believed to be the country's first to open itself
to the outside world. The famed Silk Road started from Chang'an,
the present-day Xian, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
A long history has brought rich tourism resources for the
province, which received 440,000 overseas tourists last year and
is expected to welcome 750,000 a year by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi drew the world's attention in the 1970s following the
discovery and excavation near Xian of terra-cotta warriors and
horses dating back to Qin Dynasty (221-207 BC). It will draw the
world's attention once again as China steps up efforts to develop
its central and western areas, the governor noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheng, Shaanxi's economic and technological
cooperation with the outside is broad, covering such fields as
development of infrastructure and basic industries, enliving state
enterprises, and boosting high-tech industries, export-oriented
agriculture and tourism.
</P>
<P>
With regard to infrastructure in particular, the province plans
to build three railways and three high-grade highways during the
coming five years, together with a large number of projects
involving coal, electric power, gas, petroleum and mineral
resources.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Ruling Partner Urged to Meet on No-confidence  Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the National
Democratic Party (RPP), Nepal's second ruling party, today urged
the party to hold an emergency Central Committee meeting to
discuss the party's stance on a no-confidence motion against the
coalition government to be tabled by the main opposition next
week.
</P>
<P>
A joint letter, signed by 14 RPP Central Committee members, to
party President Surya Bahadur Thapa, said today the request for
the Central Committee meeting was made in order to hold
discussions on the no-confidence motion by the Communist Party of
Nepal (UML) and the UML proposal to form a RPP-UML government to
replace the present government.
</P>
<P>
The RPP leaders said in the letter that the party Central
Committee should meet soon and take appropriate decisions as a
grave political situation had arisen in the country.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition UML party last Monday called a special
House session for it to table a no-confidence motion against the
coalition government led by the Nepali Congress (NC) party.
</P>
<P>
UML has requested for support from RPP and offered to form an
alternative coalition government with RPP parliament party leader
Lokendra Bahadur Chand as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
RPP, believed to be divided in two groups loyal to Chand and to
Thapa respectively, has shown differences over whether the party
should withdraw from the ruling coalition and support the
opposition motion in the special House session slated for next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
RPP President Thapa earlier had announced that his party would
remain in the government and not support the no-confidence
motion.
</P>
<P>
But Chand and his loyalists denounced Thapa's announcement and
demanded an emergency party Central Committee meeting to finalize
the party's decision.
</P>
<P>
RPP, with 19 seats in the House of Representatives, holds the
key to the survival of the coalition government as the main
opposition UML and the main ruling NC party have 88 and 86 MPs
respectively in the 205-seat House.

<HEADLINE> Farmers to Enter Next century with Better Image: NPC Deputies (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shi Lijun, mayor of Laiwu City in Shandong Province, east
China, made a point of raising local farmers'qualities all the
more on education and science.
</P>
<P>
"Cultural and scientific qualities are key components of
contemporary civilization, and to raise farmers' knowledge on
these sectors will help boost rural economy and improve he
farmers' living standards," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
The state has attached importance to education in rural areas.
Officials statistics at the end of last year showed that there
were 145 million illiterate or relatively-illiterate people above
the age 15, with most of them living in villages.
</P>
<P>
The outline stresses on revitalizing the nation through science
and education. Therefore, China will, by resorting to various
measures, popularize compulsory education with more input in the
sector and overcome illiteracy among young and middle-aged people.
</P>
<P>
Being a local official, Shi put forward ambitious plans to
enliven her rural areas with use of science and techniques, and
place more emphasis on improving local farmers' scientific and
technological qualities.
</P>
<P>
In such a city with 1.2 million people, her goal is to train
1,000 senior agrotechnicians, 10,000 mid-level agrotechnicians and
300,000 junior agrotechnicians.
</P>
<P>
"Further development in China's rural areas hinges on the
emergence of new generations of farmers who have good cultural and
scientific attainments," Lu Wenfu said. "That is what the
government should do in addition to efforts done by farmers."
</P>
<P>
As a writer, Lu noticed that farmers in economically booming
areas like Jiangsu Province have found it a pressing job to
improve themselves culturally and put it into practice, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
In rural Jiangsu, an increasing number of young people, who are
engaged in business, would do reading daily and often turn to
books for help as soon as they get home. And many township
enterprise managers have a good understanding of up-to-date
technical know-how and other cultural knowledge.
</P>
<P>
"That is one of the reasons for Jiangsu's prosperity and,
beyond any doubt it represents the trend of Chinese farmers
today," Lu said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Slams Duma for Attempt to Revive Soviet Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today slammed the communist-dominated State Duma, the lower house
of parliament, for an attempt to restore the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by the presidential press service,
Yeltsin described the resolution passed by the Duma on Friday as
unconstitutional and politically dangerous.
</P>
<P>
The Duma approved by a majority vote two resolutions denouncing
the so-called Belovezhsk agreement which renounced the 1922 Treaty
on the Formation of the Soviet Union and declared the creation of
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed in 1991 in Belovezhsk, Belarus, by
Yeltsin and the then leaders of Belarus and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Yeltsin said: "What strikes the eye is the
legal invalidity of the resolutions adopted by the Duma and its
direct contradiction of the Constitution of the Russian
Federation."
</P>
<P>
The Duma resolutions were designed to create "a situation of
political and legal impasse in Russia" but "are unable to
resurrect the Soviet Union," he said. "They can only generate
uncertainty concerning the legal status of the Russian Federation."
</P>
<P>
The president said that the resolutions, which can be seen as
an attempt by the Duma to "liquidate our state," "call into doubt
the legitimacy of the bodies of state authority, including the
present State Duma, and...the possibility of holding presidential
elections (scheduled for June 16)."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin outlined a list of other possible "consequences" of the
resolutions, including:
</P>
<P>
-- Destruction of the mechanisms of international and regional
security;
</P>
<P>
-- A threat of uncontrolled proliferation of nuclear weapons;
</P>
<P>
-- The growth of international terrorism and regional conflicts;
</P>
<P>
-- Barriers to real integration of the CIS;
</P>
<P>
-- Reanimating nationalist extremist forces in the CIS member
states and the three Baltic countries; and
</P>
<P>
-- Worsening the situation of Russia's compatriots in those
countries.
</P>
<P>
"These actions cannot be regarded as anything but betrayal of
the interests of Russia," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
"For my part, I assure the citizens of Russia that...I
resolutely support all proposals for deepening integration of the
nations and states which were component parts of the USSR," he
said. "But I reject politically volatile and juridically unlawful
unilateral decisions."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the work to create a unified economic, social,
technological, scientific, educational, cultural and information
entity has been going on for more than a year within the framework
of the CIS.
</P>
<P>
"Integration within the framework of the CIS will continue.
Breakthrough decisions in this field can be expected already in
March," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Russia preserves its legal status and abides
by all agreements signed by it.
</P>
<P>
"As the guarantor of the Constitution, I will allow no attempts
at undermining the foundation of the Russian state and
destabilizing the situation in the country," Yeltsin added.

BONN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- German's track and field stars
called for higher efficiency in anti-doping measures from the
national federation (DLV), complaining that they have not
undergone random tests in months, reports reaching here said on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Caren Jung, a 100-meter hurdler, said she had not been tested
since July 21, 1995. 400 meters runner Grit Breuer, who returned
from almost three years of bans for drug related cases, also said
she has not been tested in six months.
</P>
<P>
The 5,000 meters Olympic champion Dieter Baumann said he was
surprised that he was not tested during a recent training camp in
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
"When I complained at the DLV I was told this had to do with
the random selector," Baumann said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Follow NPC Session With Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese public has
demonstrated great interest in this year's session of the National
People's Congress, the country's top legislature, by writing
letters to air their views and raise suggestions.
</P>
<P>
A total of 9,511 letters have been received in the past 16
days, about one sixth of the total the NPC Standing Committee
receives in a year, according to session organizers.
</P>
<P>
Public interest is concentrated in national development plans
for the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Chang Ruzhi and Zhang Yanzheng, both natives of Shenyang city
in northeast China, say in their letter that they "are inspired"
by the plans.
</P>
<P>
Li Yonghe, of central Hubei Province, is concerned about
China's reunification. "Taiwan is an unalienable part of China and
anyone attempting to split Taiwan from China will come to no good
end," he writes in his letter.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Dexin, of Tongliao City, Inner Mongolia, raises three
suggestions in his letter: more emphasis on farm mechanization;
more sales channels for grain by the state; and greater efforts to
control the prices of agricultural capital goods to alleviate
farmers' burdens.
</P>
<P>
In some letters, their writers criticize some local officials
for encroaching upon the interests of farmers and local law
enforcers for violating laws and disciplines themselves.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary analysis shows that more than 600 views and
proposals contained in the letters are "fairly valuable" and that
letters sent by government officials and intellectuals have
increased considerably in number this year, according to the
Letters and Visits Division of the NPC Standing Committee General
Office.
</P>
<P>
Letters exposing law violations by Party and government
officials will be handed over to the Supreme People's
Procuratorate or the Ministry of Supervision, which will report to
the NPC Standing Committee on the handling of the cases, according
to the Letters and Visits Division.

HARARE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's ruling party ZANU (PF)

A statement issued today by ZANU (PF) Secretary for the

an earlier pledge to participate in the second presidential
election.

The two opposition leaders pulled out of the poll citing an
uneven playing ground resulted from the alleged inconsistencies
in the constitution, electoral act, political parties (finance)
act and the government infiltration.
</P>
<P>
"The people must not pay any heed to this plainly deceitful
act of irresistibility by these treacherous opposition
politicians who are trying to frustrate the process of democracy
and good governance," he said.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today described as unconstitutional and politically dangerous a
resolution passed by the State Duma calling for the restoration of
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here by his press service, Yeltsin said
he would not allow "any attempts to undermine the foundation of

</P>
<P>
He blasted the move by the Duma, the lower house of the Russian
parliament, as an attempt to "disrupt" the presidential elections

</P>
<P>
He also instructed foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov to inform
foreign countries that the Duma resolution does not affect the
status of the Russian Federation under international law, or its
rights and international commitments.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which denounced the breakup of the Soviet Union
and demanded its restoration, passed in the communist-dominated
Duma on Friday by 250-98 votes with no abstentions.
</P>
<P>
It called for reversing a Soviet legislative decision on
December 1991 that laid the basis for the breakup of the Soviet
Union into 15 separate nations and the creation of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, which now groups 12 of the
former 15 Soviet states.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Delegations from 22 Asian and
Pacific Rim countries have agreed to actively study ways to build
an Asian highway and steadily push for construction of a trans-
Northeast Asian railway.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at a meeting of the committee for
regional economic cooperation of the Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), which was held here
between March 13 and 16.
</P>
<P>
The 22 member countries, including China, South Korea, Japan,
Russia and the United States, agreed to begin feasibility studies
for construction of the "Asian highway" early next year and make
efforts to connect the Asian railway network with the railway
networks of other regions.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), also an ESCAP
member, did not participate in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting stressed that intraregional economic cooperation
among Northeast Asian countries is vital to the development of the
Asia-Pacific as a whole.
</P>
<P>
If constructed, the Asian highway's northern leg will pass
through South Korea, the DPRK, China, Mongolia, Russia, Vietnam,
Laos, Cambodia and Thailand. Its southern extension will traverse
India, Pakistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The trans-Northeast Asian railway will pass through South
Korea, the DPRK, China, Mongolia, Russia and Kazakhstan, and

<HEADLINE> hke031624--News Analysis: Mediation by Bangladeshi President Fails  (by Jiang Xianming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Mediation efforts by Bangladeshi
President Abdur Rahman Biswas to end the country's prolonged
political crisis have virtually gone nowhere as the opposition
rejected his latest statement on constitutional amendments,
analysts here say.
</P>
<P>
At the request of both the government and the opposition,
Biswas held a series of talks with the country's major political
players in the past week, including opposition leader Sheikh
Hasina, Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia and some leading legal
experts.
</P>
<P>
"It appears that the president has his limitations and that the
constitution is required to be amended to accommodate the
provision for the formation of a neutral caretaker government
followed by a countrywide referendum," Biswas said in a statement
Friday
</P>
<P>
The opposition denounced the statement as echoing the stand of
the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) to legalize the
February 15 parliamentary elections boycotted by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The president's remarks about the BNP's accepting the main
demands of the opposition enraged the opposition even more.
</P>
<P>
Biswas stressed the BNP has agreed to fresh general elections
by May under a neutral caretaker government and the passage of a
bill on the caretaker government in the very first session of the
newly-elected parliament.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition parties led by the Awami (People's)
League (AL) reacted sharply by saying Biswas totally ignored the
public opinion in protecting the partisan interests of the BNP.
</P>
<P>
They said his failure to acknowledge or show any respect to the
views of the people would push the country towards anarchy and
confrontation instead of ending the crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to observers here, the opposition parties were
"surprised" and "disappointed" at the president's statement
because they had been hoping that Biswas could use his
constitutional powers to resolve the political impasse.
</P>
<P>
The opposition now seems to think that the president, who is a
BNP member himself, was only trying to trick the opposition into
giving up their demands.
</P>
<P>
AL President Hasina has threatened to not only continue the
opposition's indefinite non-cooperation campaign but also
intensify it to realize the people's democratic rights.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has been seriously disturbed by the strike-like
campaign launched last Saturday by the opposition to press for the
cancellation of the polls and resignation of the BNP government.
</P>
<P>
Deaths and injuries occurred almost daily in Bangladesh in bomb
blasts, gunfire and violent clashes between opposition activists
and BNP supporters, affecting the country's economic production
and business activities as well as normal life in cities and
towns.
</P>
<P>
With the president's latest failure to broker an agreement
between the government and the opposition, concerns are being
raised over a possible deterioration of the confrontation and
violence in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, BNP leaders said they "still believe that the problem
can be solved through discussion."
</P>
<P>
They reiterated that "the president, the prime minister, the
speaker or the Election Commission -- none has the power to cancel
the February 15 elections."
</P>
<P>
President Biswas urged all political parties to show restraint
and mutual accommodation in negotiations to resolve the crisis for
the greater interest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the constitution, a presidential reference
might be made to the Supreme Court to seek its opinion on the
formation of a neutral caretaker government, provided that all the
parties agree.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that this may be a way out of the two-year-old
crisis, but it is not easy for any single move to satisfy the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
They say compromises are needed from both sides on the key
issue of the legality of the February 15 elections. Otherwise,
they warn, the military may interfere when the situation runs out
of control.

<HEADLINE> Two Ex-Barings Top Officials Cleared by Regulator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Securities and Futures
Authority (SFA), the City's leading regulator, Friday cleared the
former chairman and deputy chairman of Barings of any direct
responsibility for the bank's collapse last year.
</P>
<P>
The SFA found no evidence that the bank's ex-chairman Peter
Baring and ex-deputy chairman Andrew Tuckey were responsible for
the bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
However, the SFA, which grants the licenses needed to operate
in Britain's financial market, sought assurances from Baring that
he "does not wish to re-enter the investment industry."
</P>
<P>
Tuckey, once expected to succeed Baring as bank chairman, has
undertaken "not to seek in the foreseeable future" any position in
an investment house which would require his registration by the
authority.
</P>
<P>
He is allowed, however, to become a director if his duties are
limited to providing corporate finance advice.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Stone, chairman of the Barings Noteholders Action
Group, which represents investors who lost more than 100 million
pounds (152 million U.S. dollars) as a result of the bank's
collapse, called the announcement "incredible and totally
unsatisfactory."
</P>
<P>
"I come back time and time again to the question, where did the
money come from? It was sent from London, and are you going to
tell me that people at the top of the merchant bank did not know
it had been sent?" Stone said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Geoffrey Barnett, former chief operating
officer of Barings, and a handful of other executives, including
five unnamed bankers who still work for ING Barings, have also
been cleared of any responsibility.

GUIYANG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The annual per capita income of
farmers in remote Guizhou Province, in southwest China, went from
435 yuan in 1990 to 1,087 yuan last year, thanks to the
government's efforts.
</P>
<P>
Of that figure, 871 yuan came from household management,
meaning that individual families have shown their ability at
economic activity, and their self-development capacity in farming
has been strengthened.
</P>
<P>
One of China's poverty-stricken provinces, Guizhou concentrated
on rural economic development by fostering rural industrial
enterprises and improving farming conditions during the 1991-95
period.
</P>

A survey has shown that the province has helped 2.1 million
poor people escape poverty over the past two years.

FUZHOU, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A 3.33-metre-long female sturgeon
was caught in a local fisherman's net at the mouth of the Minjiang
River on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The rare fish weighs about 300 kg and is about 15 to 20 years
old. This is the second sturgeon that has been found at the
river's mouth in this century.
</P>
<P>
Records also reveal that the longest sturgeon ever been found
in the country in many years was just 3.2 metres long. A fish this
large has never been caught before.
</P>
<P>
The fish has been moved to the Zuohai Aquarium in Fuzhou, the
provincial capital. But because of problems in transporting the
large fish and changes in the environment, the fish was injured
several spots.
</P>
<P>
A team of experts was assembled to try to save the animal.
</P>
<P>
The sturgeon has been in existence for 140 million years, and
in China are mainly found in the Yangtze River and in the cold
waters of northeast China's Heilongjiang River. It has become
endangered in China in recent years because of the Gezhouba
Barrier at the hydro-electric plant there, which blocks their
passage during the breeding season.
</P>
<P>
In order to save the endangered fish, China releases millions
of sturgeon fingerlings into the two rivers every year.

<HEADLINE> APEC Finance Ministers Aim to Avoid Currency Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KYOTO, Japan, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Finance ministers from
member economies of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum today started their two-day meeting to find ways to
stabilize currencies and encourage more private investment for
infrastructure in the world's fastest growing region.
</P>
<P>
"At the meeting tomorrow, we will discuss broad issues on the
macro-economics in the region as well as financial challenges we
face," Japanese Finance Minister Wataru Kubo, the chairman of the
Kyoto meeting, told a banquet hosted tonight by local government
and business leaders in the central Japanese city.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers from the 18 member economies will hold a
full-day session Sunday to discuss ways to ensure macro-economic
and financial stability in order to maintain dynamic economic
growth in the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
Developing economies in Asia are vulnerable to rapid shifts in
capital flows. The ministers will stress that APEC members should
learn the lessons of the Mexican peso crisis in late 1994 and
early 1995, which was sparked after foreign investors pulled their
money out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The topics of the third APEC finance ministers meeting are of
particular concern to the member economies amid increasing
exposure to global financial markets as a result of steady
expansion of free and open trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are expected to emphasize that rapid exchange
rate movements create problems for the region's economies.
</P>
<P>
"The Kyoto meeting is expected to be a first step toward the
forum's cooperation in stabilizing exchange rates," the Asahi
Evening News quoted a Japanese Finance Ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The APEC finance chiefs will also discuss ways to mobilize
capital for infrastructure development in the region, especially
ways to coordinate public and private resources in financing
infrastructure projects, Chinese Finance Ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
Such projects require funding of an estimated 1 trillion
U.S. dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
At the start of Sunday's meeting, Michel Camdessus, managing
director of the International Monetary Fund, will report on the
economic situation of each APEC member. This is the IMF chief's
first meeting with APEC ministers.
</P>
<P>
APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Chinese Taipei,
Thailand and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Joint Venture's Commercial Secret Intruders Punished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIANYUNGANG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Shimin, a former
employee of the Haiyuan Handicrafts Co, Ltd in east China's
Jiangsu Province, and Chen Xiuchun, Zhou's boss, were fined a
total of 1.9 million yuan recently for illegally taking
information from the company.
</P>
<P>
Zhou was a senior staff member at Haiyuan, which is the
country's biggest producer of woven wicker products and a
Sino-foreign joint venture with an export value of five million US
dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
He left the company in January, 1994, after having gained
extensive knowledge of the company's customers, their addresses,
and other commercial secrets. He was then hired by Chen Xiuchun,
manager of Four Stars Handicrafts Co, Ltd, which was also engaged
in exporting wicker products.
</P>
<P>
Zhou and Chen made use of the privileged information to obtain
85 orders from the former employer's customers. Then, last April,
Zhou established two more companies of his own, and continued to
do business in this fashion.
</P>
<P>
Having discovered what was going on, Haiyuan, at the end of
last year turned to the Lianyungang Intermediate People's Court
for redress of its grievances.
</P>
<P>
After carefully reviewing the case, the court reached a verdict
recently, and, in accordance with the country's law prohibiting
unfair competition, ordered the defendants to compensate the
plaintiff for its losses, for a total of 1,922,920.87 yuan.

It was reported that Pentagon officials had said recently that

"China has never promised to abstain from resorting to arms,"
Shen reiterated, adding that "the act is certainly not directed to
the Taiwan compatriots."
</P>
<P>
"There is no change in our basic Taiwan policy which
is 'peaceful reunification and one country, two systems,'" he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, if something like "Taiwan independence" or
violation of Taiwanese space by a foreign force should occur, "we
certainly will use every means necessary to safeguard the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland."

<HEADLINE> Program Provides Opportunities for Students Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS), China's most prestigious scientific research institution,
has recently announced the elevation of 20 young scholars to the
status of "Leading Scientist," of whom eight are scholars having
studied abroad, known as "returned students" in China.
</P>
<P>
China started in 1994 a "100 Scientists Program" designed to
cultivate before the end of the century 100 outstanding scientists
able to lead research in their respective fields. The recently-
selected 20 belong to this accomplished group.
</P>
<P>
Yan Yixun, vice president of CAS, said he was not surprised at
the big proportion of returned students in the choices based on
high standards.
</P>
<P>
"It is the '100 Scientists Program' that has attracted them to
come back," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yan is here attending the annual session of the National
People's Congress, the Chinese legislature, as a deputy. NPC
deputies have been examining China's Ninth Five-Year Plan and
long-term goals for the year 2010 since the session began early in
the month.
</P>
<P>
"China's development plan for the next 15 years will provide
more opportunities for Chinese scholars studying overseas than the
'100 Scientists Program'," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng, in his report on the country's
development plans at the NPC session, emphasized the importance of
talented people in carrying out the programs successfully.
</P>
<P>
In five years or so, China's leading scientists trained in the
1950s and 1960s will retire, and CAS with some 50,000 scientists
will face a shortage of talented scientists, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This will provide many opportunities for scholars studying
overseas to work back home," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 17 years, China has sent some 150,000 students to
study overseas, of whom 80,000 have returned after completing
studies. Some of them have started businesses in China and others
have become leading scientists in their respective fields.

<HEADLINE> Report Says Arab spending growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Spending in the Arab world has
been growing in recent years, according to a report of the Abu
Dhabi-based Arab Monetary Fund, AMF, obtained today.
</P>
<P>
Total consumption, including public and private sector spending
of the 22-member Arab League increased 2.6 percent, from 382.5
billion dollars in 1993 to 392.7 billion dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the AMF said spending in 1995 grew faster than
1994 because of the increase of oil earnings. But the figures will
be published in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's number one oil producer and
exporter, was the biggest Arab spender. Its total consumption in
1994 was 85 billion dollars. The kingdom was followed by Egypt
with 43 billion dollars; Algeria 30.7 billion dollars; Libya 30.6
billion dollars; UAE 26 billion dollars and Kuwait 18.8 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The AMF said "all Arab states recorded positive real economic
growth rates in 1994, with the exception of Algeria and Yemen."
</P>
<P>
The combined GDP of Arab states increased 2.18 per cent, from
490.5 dollars in 1993 to 501.2 billion dollars in 1994, the report
said.

<P>
XI'AN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Yan'an, where the Communist Party
of China built a revolutionary base during the 1930s and 1940s,
has become a booming tourist resort in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Favorable tourist spots in Yan'an include well-preserved cave
offices and residences of CPC leaders such as Mao Zedong, Zhou
Enlai, and Zhu De. There are also a number of other sites of
historical interest in the well-known "sacred place of the Chinese
revolution".
</P>
<P>
Tourists can also appreciate in Yan'an the typical folklore
culture of China's loess plateau, including waist drum dancing,
yangko dance, paper cutting, embroidery, farmer painting, and all
sorts of local delicacies.
</P>
<P>
During the 1990-1995 period, Yan'an welcomed over two million
Chinese and overseas tourists. In 1995 alone, the number of the
visitors reached 433,000.
</P>
<P>
Many visitors head to Yan'an after visiting Xi'an, an ancient
Chinese capital of several dynasties, and a hot tourist attraction
which is located over 300 kilometers to the south of Yan'an.
</P>
<P>
Half way between Xi'an and Yan'an, there is another attraction
on the tourist trail, the cemetery of Huangdi -- the legendary
first ancestor of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 kilometers to the southeast of Yan'an, at the
Shaanxi-Shanxi border is the world-renowned Hukou Waterfall on the
Yellow River, which attracts a large amount of tourists every
year. The scenic area is under the protection of the Central
Government.
</P>
<P>
Transportation to and around Yan'an is convenient, with direct
air routes with Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi, Taiyuan, capital of
Shanxi, and Beijing, as well as trains to Xi'an.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Juventus captain Gianluca Vialli on
Saturday criticised the head of Italy's soccer federation for
comparing him with the English legendary hero Robin Hood.
</P>
<P>
Vialli, one of the top players leading Italy's Serie A to a
strike this weekend, was compared ironically to Robin Hood by
Antonio Matarrese as the former national's recent remarks
describing the strike as a way of millionaire footballers to help
their poorer colleagues.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which was called by the players' union and in
support of the Serie A players, is aimed to get more say for the
players in the running of Italian soccer.
</P>
<P>
The league and federation were also called to pay more into a
fund to protect players against clubs going under.
</P>
<P>
Vialli, who suffered an ankle injury two weeks ago, returned
to the field on Friday for a full 90 minutes in a friendly
against third division Carrarese that was called to replace
Saturday's home game against Udinese.

NINGBO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Ningbo, an economically-thriving

attract talented people to help with its development.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the city's plan, a number of talent exchange

One of China's major rivers, the Haihe snakes for 72 kilometers

<HEADLINE> Iran Reacts Strongly against German Arrest Warrant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran today criticized Germany for
issuing an arrest warrant against Iranian Information Minister
Ali Hallahiyan who was charged for ordering the killing of four
members of the Kurdish opposition in Germany.
</P>
<P>
With strong background of the Foreign Ministry, the English
daily Tehran Times reacted strongly to the issuance Friday by the
German Federal Prosecutor's office of an arrest warrant for the
Iranian Information Minister.
</P>
<P>
However, the Public Relations Office of Iran's Information
Ministry reached by telephone declined to comment on the issuance
of the arrest warrant against the minister.
</P>
<P>
But, the official from the Public Relations Office said that
the Information Ministry might come up with a statement soon.
</P>
<P>
After four members of Iran's Kurdish opposition were found
murdered in a Berlin restaurant in 1992, the relations between
Iran and Germany has gone through periodic crises.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told Xinhua that there was a tacit
agreement between Iran and Germany that Bonn would no longer talk
of Iranian involvement in the killing of the four Kurds in
exchange for the release of a German national accused of spying
against Iran.
</P>
<P>
"Germany is Iran's number one trade partner. Iran also values
German technology and political support. Therefore, I do not think
that a full-scale diplomatic war will start between the two
countries," he said. '
</P>
<P>
In a response to the allegation, the official daily noted in
its editorial: "Although the court has issued the warrant under
the influence of Zionist circles, the Iranian nation strongly
calls on the German government to check the shameless act of the
court and stop its nonsensical treatment as soon as possible if it
is eager to maintain its cordial relations with Iran."
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli influence on the court's procedure is clear to
Everyone. After the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit failed to fulfil the
desires of the Zionist regime, the court issued the warrant,
indicating that the Zionists and certain circles in the U.S.,
which have a proven animosity against the improvement of
Tehran-Bonn relations, are again at work," it underlined.
</P>
<P>
It deplored the court's handling of the case, which it said has
been changed into "a platform for the political trial of a
country" and pointed to the unusual manner with which the court
has allowed the issue to drag on for several years.
</P>
<P>
Questioning the competency of the court in dealing with the
case, it noted that all witnesses are members of anti-Iran
terrorist groups masquerading as political groups harbored by the
West.
</P>
<P>
"Iranians will not compromise their national pride," Tehran
Times stressed, underscoring, "we did not do so during the
difficult years of the Iraqi-imposed war and we will not do so in
peace time."

<HEADLINE> Gansu Improves Agriculture by Using Foreign Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu Province
spared no effort at improving agricultural production by using
foreign aid over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that the province has received 130
million US dollars' worth of foreign aid, with 90 million invested
in agricultural or aid-the-poor projects.
</P>
<P>
Gansu is a comparatively backward province that is constantly
faced with a shortage of funds for economic development.
</P>
<P>
By using foreign aid, the province developed a number of water
conservation projects, such as the Second Phase of the Jingtai
Electric Pumping Project.
</P>
<P>
There were also projects for designing and spreading the use of
agricultural machinery and personnel training in agricultural
techniques.
</P>
<P>
The completion of these projects helped accelerate agricultural
development in the province and improve the quality of local
farmers' work, said local officials.
</P>
<P>
Good economic and social benefits brought more foreign aid to
the province. Last year, it had 59 foreign-aid projects, with 32.8
million US dollars in foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
According to the local government, ten more projects of this
kind are likely to be approved this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
KYOTO, Japan, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Finance Minister Liu
Zhongli and U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin today met
privately to discuss major economic issues including Beijing's bid
to join the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The two are in Kyoto to attend a two-day meeting of finance
ministers of the 18-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum that began this evening.
</P>
<P>
At the private meeting, Liu criticized the U.S. for erecting
obstacles to China's accession to the WTO, the minister told
reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear to Rubin that China, as a developing nation,
could not accept the U.S. demand that it fulfill criteria as a
developed economy.
</P>
<P>
Rubin stressed the need for the administration of President
Bill Clinton to continue engaging China in economic areas.
</P>
<P>
Liu expressed the hope that Washington will translate its words
into action instead of just paying lip service.
</P>
<P>
On the annual U.S. renewal of China's most-favored-nation trade
status, the Chinese minister urged the Clinton administration to
follow its policy of de-linking the trade question with the human
rights issue.
</P>
<P>
The extension of China's MFN status is of benefit not only to
China but also to the U.S., he added.
</P>
<P>
Before and after the meeting, Liu also met separately with
Australian Treasurer Peter Costello, Thai Finance Minister
Surakiart Sathirathai and Chilean Deputy Finance Secretary Manuel
Marfan.
</P>
<P>
He is also scheduled to meet later with Michel Camdessus,
managing director of the International Monetary Fund, who is
attending the APEC finance ministers meeting for the first time.

<P>
HARARE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- In his election campaign of the
past five weeks, President Mugabe faced the challenge by the two
opposition candidates.
</P>
<P>
The three candidates and their parties propagandized their
respective programmes for the country's economy and, in some
cases, even engaged in verbal attacks on one another.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, 72, promised to take the development of the national
economy as a major objective of his policy for the next six
years, while reiterating socialism, based on Zimbabwe's
experience, as his party's ideology.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to speed up the process of redistributing land for
landless black people and promised more dams, roads, schools and
hospitals, in addition to increased job opportunities for the
country's young.
</P>
<P>
While ZANU (PF) hailed Mugabe as the best candidate for this
election, it deemed Sithole and Muzorewa as having no requisite
qualifications or ability to lead the country, denouncing them as
"renegade" and "murderer".
</P>
<P>
Sithole, 76, and Muzorewa, 71, denied the charges from the
ZANU (PF) and counter-accused Mugabe's government of "plunging the
country's economy to its lowest ebb because of rampant corruption
and mismanagement".
</P>
<P>
They held the government responsible for the spiral price
hikes of basic commodities, massive retrenchments and closure of
many companies.
</P>
<P>
But if they themselves were voted into power, they would rid
the country of corruption and reduce the budget deficit and
taxes, the opposition candidates assured.
</P>
<P>
The heated struggle ushered Zimbabweans to the polling station
of today, with observers in the country predicting Mugabe almost
certain to win the election in the southern African country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese peasants employ nannies and housekeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A number of peasants in east
China's Zhejiang Province employ housekeepers and nannies because
they are cashing in on the booming economy and are too busy to
take care of their families.
</P>
<P>
It's a far cry from the traditional image of the country's
peasants eking out a modest living from the land.
</P>
<P>
Now many peasants are joining the ranks of the nouveau riche as
their businesses take off.
</P>
<P>
It is not surprising any more for urban citizens to hire
baby-sitters. Now, however, there are increasing peasants in
suburban Hangzhou who employ housekeepers and nannies.
</P>
<P>
Most of these peasants are engaged in businesses, managing
factories, dining halls and daily-use goods stores, and some are
contractors of farmland.
</P>
<P>
They boast big profits, but they are so busy that they have
little time to take care of their children, parents and household
chores.
</P>
<P>
To find a way out, they have focussed their attention on
housekeeper employment centers in urban Hangzhou, capital of east
China's Zhejiang province.
</P>
<P>
Ying Xiuqing, a resident in urban Hangzhou who manages a
housekeeper employment center, says that usually more a dozen of
peasants visit her such a small center for baby-minders each month.
</P>
<P>
These peasants also have high demand for housekeepers.
</P>
<P>
Farmers look for housekeepers who are educated, quick in
accounting, and can warmly greet visitors.

<HEADLINE> 18 Pieces of Chinese Art Works Stolen in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A total of 18 pieces of
paintings and calligraphy, a collection dating back half century,
was stolen from Hong Kong's famed Luk Yu Tea House on Friday
morning, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese art works valued at more than one million HK dollars
(128,205 US dollars) include master pieces from famous artists
Zhang Da-qian, Yu Pingbo and Deng Feng.
</P>
<P>
Three burglars armed with a crowbar broke into the building
about 1:45 a.m. Friday and tied up the watchman who had come down
to investigate after hearing noises.
</P>
<P>
The watchman freed himself more than two hours later and called
 police. Investigators said thieves had broken in by sawing
through iron bars on the toilet window on the first floor.
</P>
<P>
Most of the missing pieces were landscape scrolls and floral
prints, ranging from one meter to more than two meters wide.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Chinese
Importers' and Exporters' Association (HKCIEA) will go all out to
support the work of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR), said Ng Lin Fung, president
of the association.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, Ng said that at the late
phase of Hong Kong's transition period, HKCIA will do its best to
promote Hong Kong's exchanges with overseas business sectors and
contribute to Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
HKCIEA was set up 42 years ago. Currently it has 3,000 members
involving 60 trades.
</P>
<P>
He said that last year, Hong Kong's total external trade rose
21 percent over 1994 with re-export up 22 percent and import
rising 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
This year, he said, the external trade is expected to rise
continuously.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong's economy is now in a period of
readjustment and the increase of the external trade will promote
Hong Kong's economy to grow as bank's interest rates lowering,
unemployment rate dropping and property market recovering.
</P>
<P>
According to Ng, his association will send a delegation to
Beijing late this month to exchange views with the related
departments of the Chinese government on stabilizing Hong Kong's
economy in the transition period.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Passes First Mining Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese National Assembly
passed the nation's first mining law here Friday, the official
Vietnam News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The law, which requires firmer control of the mining industry
by the central government while granting local communities more
benefits, will come into effect September 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
While encouraging on-the-spot ore processing for local
consumption and export, it allows mining companies to sign
contracts that could eventually extend for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The duration of a mining enterprise is set at approximately 30
years and exploration approximately two years. Yet extensions for
both exploitation and exploration can be granted for a limit of
another 20 years and two years respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, licensing rights to valuable ore deposits will be
controlled strictly by the government.
</P>
<P>
The law also encourages domestic ore processing capability and
refining industry by offering incentive policies.
</P>
<P>
The domestic ore processing capability will be promoted by
gradual reduction of imported materials made from ore that can be
produced locally, according to the law.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's first legal framework on mining and natural
resources, an ordinace, was produced in August 1989. However,
subsequent ordinances and decrees proved to have many loopholes
that once caused fledgling mining activities to become chaotic
beyond the control of the government.

MACAO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Portuguese president has
reappointed Vasco Rocha Vieira as Governor of Macao, and a leading
Macao newspaper said it is a positive move toward the stable
transition of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The "Va Kio" newspaper said in a commentary that Vieira has
been Macao Governor for five years, and is familiar with Macao
affairs and in good cooperation with the Chinese Government.
</P>

It said that people in Macao hope that they could have a
governor who will maintain a stable society, a prosperous economy
so that Macao will be smoothly handed over to Chinese exercise of
sovereignty by 1999.
</P>
<P>
Although some people have different opinions, they generally
agree that what he has done is in accordance with the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, the paper said, adding that he
has been making efforts to ensure a smooth transition of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Vieira said that he and Portuguese new president "share the

<HEADLINE> Roundup Zimbabwe: Strife Before Poll (Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's presidential election
goes ahead today and tomorrow with all the three nominated
candidates, in accordance with law and despite invalid attempts
by two of them to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe of the ruling ZANU (PF), retired
bishop Abel Muzorewa of the United Parties and Ndabaningi Sithole
of ZANU (Ndonga) are expected on the ballot. Whoever gets at
least 50 percent of the votes will be declared president.
</P>
<P>
This is the country's second presidential election since
independence in 1980. The first took place in 1990, when Mugabe
claimed 78.3 percent of the votes, defeating the Zimbabwe Unity
Movement leader and former ZANU (PF) Secretary-general, Edgar
Tekere, who got 15.9 percent
</P>
<P>
It was unexpected that on the eve of the poll Sithole and
Muzorewa announced their withdrawal from the race.
</P>
<P>
Muzorewa's pullout came minutes after his party's application
for the postponement of the elections was vetoed by the supreme
court on Friday. His party demanded a postponement citing flaws
in the constitution and electoral act which they say are rigged
in favour of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Sithole quit on Tuesday to protest the alleged interference
into his party's operations by the state central intelligence organ.
</P>
<P>
He claimed he had uncovered the organ's documents which
disclose how the secret police had fabricated the story that he
planned to kill Mugabe and overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
Registrar-general Tobaiwa Mudede has ruled the elections go
ahead as scheduled, and both withdrawal cases are invalid in
terms of the electoral act, which stipulates that pulling out can
only be done 21 days before polling.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts held the withdrawals as Opposition's
tactics aimed at foiling a election in which their success
appears dim.
</P>
<P>
Vice-president Joshua Nkomo described Muzorewa and Stithole as
cheaters. They knew that they would not win but they convinced their
sponsors to part with millions of dollars, he said. More

<HEADLINE> Life of Tibetan Nuns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Another day had begun for the nuns
of the Sutra-Pitaka Temple as they started with their chanting of
the Tripitaka.
</P>
<P>
Alvoaji, a 22-year old nun, positioned herself in a front seat
as usual, ringing a Buddhist bell. Her wrist watch said that it
was 7 o'clock.
</P>
<P>
Alvoaji's nunnery is located on the side of the Gongburi
Mountain, one of Tibet's four most famous mountains. It overlooks
the newly developed county of Zetang in the southern part of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Alvoaji came to the nunnery when the main temple was built with
state investment and local funds in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"All 22 nuns here came from farmer's families or from urban
areas." she said. "My family members are Buddhists, and becoming a
nun has been my dream since I was a pupil."
</P>
<P>
She explained that she got permission from the local religion
authority to make her home inside the nunnery in 1985 and in a
temple later on with support of her family.
</P>
<P>
In her Tibetan style residence, warm sunshine lights up the
hall and blossoming flowers in a line of tiny flowerpots on the
windowsill.
</P>
<P>
"We have many social contacts and activities with ordinary
people and a nun's life shouldn't be cut off from the outside
world," Alvoaji said.
</P>
<P>
The oldest nun, Niaejua, 57, was not satisfied with the young
nuns' manners. She said that they are fond of window shopping,
public gatherings and snacks.

HARARE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe
cast vote at Cyril Jennings Hall of Harare at 08:40 this morning
at the start of the country's second presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The 72-year old leader of the ruling ZANU (PF) is already
assured of victory following last-minute withdrawals by
opposition leaders, retired Bishop Abel Muzorewa of the United

However, registrar-general Tobaiwa Mudede declared the
withdrawals invalid in terms of the electoral act which
stipulates that a candidate can only pull out of the race 21 days

to affect voter turnout as most people will not bother casting
votes in what is already a fore-gone conclusion that Mugabe has
already won the elections, the Zimbabwe National News Agency said
today.

<P>
Some 4.9 million people of the country 10.5 million population

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's Rubber, Tin Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian rubber prices
ended the week lower compared to the previous week due to a lack
of buying interest coupled with the absence of fresh leads.
</P>
<P>
The price for April RSS1 dropped by 12.5 sen to 389.5 sen
(about 1.56 US dollars) per kg from 402 sen (about 1.6 dollars)
last week while the SMR20 was down by 13.5 sen to 372 sen (about
1.49 dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
Some producers liquidated their positions to cut losses as most
buyers were sidelined amid a gloomy outlook.
</P>
<P>
The poor performance on the local front was also in line with
the softer regional markets especially in Tokyo and Singapore
futures markets.
</P>
<P>
Tin price on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) finished the
week at 15.28 Ringgit (about 6.11 dollars) per kg, six sen lower
from last week's close.
</P>
<P>
The market opened the week higher Monday at 15.52 Ringgit
(about 6.2 dollars), thereafter, tin price fell 19 sen in line
with the lower London Metal exchange (LME) which followed the
downward trend of other metals on the exchange.
</P>
<P>
The weak market lasted till the end of the week with heavy
selling making things worse for the market.
</P>
<P>
Turnover for the week was 559 tons from 509 tons previously
with European, local and Japanese buyers dominating the bulk of
the transactions.
</P>
<P>
The premium between KLTM and LME Friday widened to a premium of
115 dollars per ton against 90 dollars previously.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's crude palm oil (CPO) physicals ended the week
unchanged. The news that Pakistan tendered for 6,000 tons of CPO
for late March shipment and some buying interest from China and a
few private parties from Pakistan did not help much to push prices
upwards.
</P>
<P>
The price for March South stayed unchanged at 1,215 Ringgit
(about 486 dollars) per ton.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is invited to
play a leading role in the development of Africa and the
implementation of the United Nations initiative to develop the
continent, "The Citizen" reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the South African launch of the 25 billion US
Dollar UN initiative in Johannesburg, UN co-ordinator in South
Africa David Whaley urged South Africa to play the role by
strengthening its own economy and society as a first step.
</P>
<P>
Whaley said: "South Africa is obviously infinitely better
resourced than the majority of African countries."
</P>
<P>
Whaley believed South Africa had "an enormous amount" to share
with the rest of Africa in terms of high technology, saying South
Africa could take the lead in cooperation in trade, finance,
production and services.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa is in a particularly good position because of
the country's ready access to global markets," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
UN Director of Information in South Africa Yobert Shamapande
hailed the country's reconstruction and development programme as
an attempt to address the very issues the UN initiative was
emphasizing.
</P>
<P>
The UN Africa Initiative is aimed at reviving development in
the world's poorest continent as a global priority over the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali said yesterday in
Geneva that it was a chance for the international community to
show its commitment to a continent that was a constant
preoccupation for everyone.
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time for the United Nations and international
community as a whole to stand together with Africa," said
Boutros-Fhali.

<HEADLINE> Maize Price In Zambia Slashed By 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government and the
Agriculture Commodity Exchange (ACE), a marketing enterprise,
have reached an agreement on reduction of maize prices by 10
percent, the "Zambia Daily Mail" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ace General Manager Andrew Fletcher was quoted as saying that
this had been necessitated by new imports of maize from Tanzania
and Malawi at prices well below the minimum reserve price of the
staple food.
</P>
<P>
"Mealie meal (maize flour) is also coming mainly through South
Africa. The last two weeks have seen a reduction in maize sales
and we re-aligning the prices to accommodate changes in the
market," Fletcher said.
</P>
<P>
Prices of mealie meal were expected to experience a downward
effect in the next week depending on the operational cost of
individual millers, he added.
</P>
<P>
After the reduction of maize prices, white maize which was
pegged at 340 US Dollars per ton will sell at 306 Dollars while
that of yellow maize will fetch 261 Dollars per ton from the
previous 290.
</P>
<P>
The reduction comes barely a week after President Frederick
Chiluba's accusation that some businessmen were manipulating the
prices of the commodity.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, prices of mealie meal have been hiked by
over 30 percent.

<HEADLINE> China Prepares to Reap Summer Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to reap a good
summer grain harvest providing there is no major natural disaster
in forthcoming months, a senior agricultural official has predicted.
</P>
<P>
China has sown winter crops on almost 30 million hectares of
land, three quarters of which is wheat. Wheat sowing has extended
to an extra 266,000 ha over the previous year's figure.
</P>
<P>
Crops in the country's leading wheat growing areas have turned
green, and are growing well, said, Liu Chengguo, vice minister of
agriculture, at a recent national conference on wheat production,
adding this is a rare scene in recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, the vice minister issued stern advice: " We should not
lower our guard. There exists some unfavorable factors for the
summer harvest, such as severe drought in north China, and the
possibility of insect pests on large tracts of land as a result
of the warm winter."
</P>
<P>
 He urged all localities and government departments to
energetically support spring sowing, provide adequate
agriculture-related products, such as chemical fertilizers, power
and farm chemicals, and send agro-technicians to help with field
management using modern science.

COLOMBO -- About 16 military personnel were killed and four
others wounded Friday during a confrontation with Tamil rebels in
Mannar Island in north of Sri Lanka, according to reports reaching
here today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that a combined Sri Lankan Navy and Army sea
patrol hunting for Sea Tiger craft of the liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) came under a fierce attack off the Mannar
island.
</P>
<P>
The Army and Navy mounted a search operation after they
detected some Sea Tigers activities off the Mannar island around 5
 p.m. Friday. The Sea Tigers had been waiting to strike as soon
as they moved to an area about three km north of Pallimunai in
the Mannar island.

KIEV -- Ukrainian leaders said Friday their country will not be
affected by a Russian parliamentary resolution which nullifies the
legal basis of the collapse of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Alexandr Moroz, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine

a 1991 parliament decision to dissolve the Soviet Union, was an
internal affair of Russia and that Ukraine is beyond the
jurisdiction of that country.

UNITED NATIONS -- The talks between Iraq and the

U.N. spokesperson Sylvana Foa said Friday.

the current round of negotiations would end Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to finish this round tonight," Ambassador Abdul Amir
al-Anbari told reporters as he began late Friday talks with the
U.N. Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
He said the main stumbling block was still the issue of how
food and medicine would be distributed to Kurdish regions in the
north, where the Kurdish are seeking independence from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under strict U.N. trade sanctions ever since its
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.

BELGRADE -- U.N. Human Rights Rapporteur in the former
Yugoslavia Elisabeth Rehn has expressed concern over the mass
exodus of Serbs from Serb Sarajevo sectors which are to be handed
over to the Muslim-Croat federation by March 19.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Radio Yugoslavia in Belgrade after talks with
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic Friday, Rehn said that the
majority of Serbs had left the five Serb suburbs of Sarajevo which
were reverted to the Muslim-Croat federation under the Dayton
agreement and that not more than 1,000 Serbs remained in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
"This is a disaster," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said Serbs were not given protection needed for a safe stay
in Sarajevo, but Serbs had partly been pray to propaganda, which
encouraged them to leave the city.

<HEADLINE> Two Draft Laws Amended in Line with Deputies' Suggestions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The drafts of the Law concerning
Administrative Punishment and the Criminal Procedure Law have been
amended according to suggestions by deputies at the on-going
session of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
When discussing the Law on Administrative Punishment, some
deputies suggested that regulations regarding administration
punishment be publicized and inform the public of these
regulations in advance so as to embody the principle of openness.
</P>
<P>
The fourth article of the law draft specifies that regulations
governing administrative punishment to offenders must be made
public. Otherwise, it adds, they cannot be used as the basis for
administrative punishment.
</P>
<P>
To enforce effective supervision over administrative
punishment, deputies proposed a change in supervision power from
the former local institutions at the country-level to
administrative institutions above the county-level.
</P>
<P>
The scope of hearing should be enlarged so as to still better
protect the rights and interests of the litigants. More audience
should be allowed to attend the hearings in administrative
punishment cases, which have major impacts on the litigants'
interests including "charges on production or business stoppage,
revoking of business license or fining of a large sum of money."
</P>
<P>
After deliberations, the draft law has been changed to "inform
litigants of their rights for conducting a hearing and if
litigants request for attending the hearing, it is up to
administrative organs to organize it."
</P>
<P>
In line with suggestions raised by deputies, another
stipulation has been added to the draft, namely, administrative
punishment should mete out to those law executors who have
derelicted their duties, failing to stop or punish the offences
that should have been stopped or punished, so that the lawful
rights and interests of individual citizens, legal persons and
other organizations, public interests and social order are
subsequently undermined.
</P>
<P>
In deliberating the amendments to Criminal Procedure Law
(draft), some deputies proposed that the maximum period should be
set for the detention and summoning for interrogation so as to
protect the citizens from taking in possible custody. The law
draft defines that the time limit of the maximum period for
summoning a suspect to court, detaining or summoning him for
interrogation should not exceed 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
Deputies also raised for a proposal on a time limit to be set
for lifting the products being withheld or bank deposits being
frozen when they are found irrelevant to the case. The draft law
now sets the time limit at three days.
</P>
<P>
Xue Ju, chairman of the Law Committee of the National People's
Congress, said today that his committee has amended the two drafts
in accordance with proposals by deputies, and they are feasible,
while suggesting that the session amend and approve the draft
laws.

northern part of the country following the recent attacks by the
rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA).

The local daily "The New Vision" today quoted Minister of
State for Defence Amama Mbabazi as saying that these measures
include the reinforcement of troops escorting vehicle convoys
along the routes in the north.

The UPDF will, among others, avail a ferry on Panyimur route
to provide a second passage to West Nile area in the northwest,
according to the minister.

build a rapid reaction force to deal with the banditry in the
northern part.
</P>
<P>
He explained to the students that last week's ambush by the
LRA at Karuma was due to the failure by the UPDF surveillance
teams to detect the presence of the rebels in the area.
</P>
<P>
"In the indiscriminate shooting that followed, 21 people were
killed on the spot, 110 injured seriously, 71 abducted, and 11
vehicles including seven buses burnt," he confirmed.

provinces, for moving refined oil, was formally begun here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The almost 1,000-km pipeline, with a total investment of 2.25
billion yuan, will run through 18 cities and counties en route,
and is expected to be completed in two years.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, it will greatly increase the amount of refined
oil coming from the oil refineries in northwest China and
guarantee an oil supply for parts of southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Along with the pipeline project, there is an oil refinery
project to expand annual crude processing capacity to 10 million
tons and an ethylene project with annual production of 500,000
tons to be built in the next five to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The three projects will require a total investment of 33 billion
yuan.

ABU DHABI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Bahraini security forces have
been sealing off some areas in the country since two bomb attacks
on restaurants killing seven people from Bangladesh Thursday, and
anti-riot units have arrested more than 400 people, today's Gulf
News reported.
</P>
<P>
A report from Manama said black-uniformed troops from the
army's special forces, armed with machine-guns, assault rifles
and tear gas guns, were deployed around some districts outside
Manama.
</P>
<P>
In the early morning of Thursday, an Indian restaurant was
attacked by gangs, killing seven people from Bangladesh in the
worst single incident since the unrest began 15 months ago in the
island country.
</P>
<P>
Another attack took place earlier. The report quoted witnesses
as saying six assailants armed with iron bars and knives threw
Molotov cocktails into the entrance of a restaurant in Jidhaf and
tried to stop the people inside from getting out, but a dozen
foreigners, most of them Britons in the restaurant at the time,
managed to flee along with the staff.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Death Rate Falls By 20% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- China's mortality rate has
dropped by 20.05 percent over the past 20 years, a new survey
published in Beijing has revealed.
</P>
<P>
Female death rates dropped more than males, according to a
recent national sampling survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by China's national tumor control
research office, was aimed at discovering the causes of death
among Chinese people. The study started at the end of 1992,
covering 10 percent of the total population, from 26 Chinese
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
For the 18 kinds of major diseases that cause the death of
Chinese people, all except malignant tumors and brain vessel
diseases, have seen a fall of mortality rates.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the total death rate for the areas
surveyed is 604.22 out of 100,000 people (658.75 for males and
546.49 for females).
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that among the causes of death, diseases
of the respiratory system rank the first, accounting for 22.77
percent of the total death rate, while malignant tumors are in the
second place, accounting for 17.94 percent. The mortality rate
from infectious diseases dropped to eighth place.
</P>
<P>
The death rate in cities is lower than that in the countryside,
which are 546.80 and 624.52 per 100,000, respectively.The results
of the survey were detailed in the latest issue of "Health News"
in the Chinese capital.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputy Urges End to Inclination to Departmental Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A deputy to the National People's
Congress (NPC), the Chinese parliament, has proposed that
inclination to the interests of one's own department or sector be
guarded against during the course of law legislation.
</P>
<P>
Nie Dajiang, vice-chairman of the Education, Science, Culture
and Public Health Committee of the NPC, said this is meant to
prevent individual administrative departments from overstressing
their own interests while proposing enacting a law and formulating
its draft.
</P>
<P>
Although the proposal for enacting a law is usually initiated
by administratice departments, ministries and commissions under
the State Council, the Chinese cabinet, and they do most
preparatory work for making such a new law and the formulation of
its draft, which is subsequently submitted to the NPC for
examination.
</P>
<P>
With this practice, he noted, administrative departments often
increase their inclination to their own interests consciously or
unconsciously instead of attaching due importance to orbiting
their administrative behaviors strictly onto the track of legal
system.
</P>
<P>
Nie called for enacting a law concerning legislation, which, he
said, will help embody the the country's unified and overall
interests as well as the NPC's leading status in the legislation
process.
</P>
<P>
It will also help define and clarify the functions of the
various committees of the NPC, he said, emphasizing the importance
of a unified legal system for China.
</P>
<P>
He also urged importance to be attached to the integrity and
unity of legislation, saying that it necessary to introduce other
countries' experience in legislation for the sake of further
improving China's legal system but the tendency of overlapping
reference to laws of different countries' laws in formulating a
certain law must be avoided.

<HEADLINE> Consumers Prefer China-made Brand-name Commodities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey concluded that
Chinese consumers still love China-made brand-name products better
though foreign goods are posing greater challenge to the domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
The survey, the result of which was released on the
International Consumers' Day of March 15, showed that Chinese
brand-name products are enjoying much higher market share while
their foreign counterparts have sharper competitive edge and
market influence in China.
</P>
<P>
The survey also illustrated that there are increasing number of
China-made brand-names which have not only established themselves
in China but also overseas.
</P>
<P>
However, many Chinese enterprises were found not attaching
adequate importance to developing famous-brand products.
</P>
<P>
Jointly conducted by the All-China Association of Journalists
and the People's Daily, the survey is aimed at building a bridge
between consumers and enterprises and providing the Chinese
consumers a chance to choose their ideal China-made commodities.
</P>
<P>
The results were based on 13,000 questionaires recovered from
door-to-door investigations on 10,893 urban families.

<HEADLINE> Program To Narrow Gaps Not "Robin Hood Plan", Say Economists (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Northwest Gansu Province has remained underdeveloped despite
having reserves of more than 20 minerals that rank first in China.
</P>
<P>
Its vice governor Han Xiuguo reminds people in the east that
investment in exploiting Gansu's resources will boost the
economies of investing provinces.
</P>
<P>
"The economic value of Gansu's minerals reaches more than 300
billion US dollars," he says.
</P>
<P>
Beijing University President Wu Shuqing sees a westward shift
of investment as an inevitable trend.
</P>
<P>
"The east has seen rapid economic development since the 1980s
and to date its former advantages in land and labor no longer
exist," he says. "A move of capital from east to west, which has
rich resources and cheap labor, is a natural trend."
</P>
<P>
"This is to pursue common prosperity, not something else," the
professor says.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jinbao, a senior banker from Shanghai, said increased input
in central-western areas mainly in the form of transfer payment by
the central government is used to improve infrastructure there for
developing local resources.
</P>
<P>
"Since transfer payment is often tied to industrial
restructuring, it will be investors' economic behaviors regulated
by the market," he says.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, some big enterprises in east
China, including private firms, have begun moving part of their
operations westward.
</P>
<P>
Tsang Hin-chi, president of Chinese General Chamber of Commerce
of Hong Kong, said his chamber is drawing a detailed plan for
investment in central-western regions, which will be the
destination for over 60 percent of loans from international
financial organizations and foreign governments in the next five
years, according to the central government.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shuqing says, "Narrowing regional gaps in economic
development is a long-term goal and the first thing to do is to
halt their further widening."

<TEXT>
<P>
The last five years have seen a widening gap in economic
development between east China and the central-western regions.
The 12 eastern provinces and municipalities has had an annual
economic growth rate of 16 percent, against only nine percent in
central-western regions.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, according to official sources, east
China has received 67 percent of the country's total fixed asset
investment, whereas the rest of the country with 85 percent of the
country's total land area has had only a 32.6 percent share of
such investment.
</P>
<P>
Regional economic gaps are the rule rather than an exception
for all countries with a vast territory, says Liu Jinbao,
president of the Bank of China Shanghai Branch, who has inspected
central-western regions on many occasions.
</P>
<P>
"Such gaps can be narrowed only after national economic
development enters a certain stage. Now is the time to address
this issue since the nation has carried out a policy of reform and
opening to the outside world for 17 years," he says.
</P>
<P>
Deputies, who are also officials, from both developed and
underdeveloped provinces, see eye to eye on the "gap" issue.
</P>
<P>
Xu Kuangdi, mayor of Shanghai, says, "Support for the
central-western regions is to Shanghai's own benefit as well as a
contribution to national economic development."
</P>
<P>
Shanghai needs to transfer its labor-intensive and
resources-intensive industries westward in a new round of
industrial restructuring, the mayor says.
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai factories won't move west for free," he says. In a
westward move, fixed assets will be accompanied by capital,
technology, information and skilled labor, for "joint exploitation
of natural resources in central-western China at low costs, he
says.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- China's decision to accelerate
economic development in its central-western regions is not a
"Robin Hood plan" as described by some Western China watchers, say
Chinese economists and officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000),
China's newest, being discussed at the ongoing session of the
law-making National People's Congress, economic development in the
country's central-western regions will be speeded up to halt
widening disparities between China's east and west in terms of
industrialization, economic efficiency and income.
</P>
<P>
The draft plan calls for people in rich coastal regions to
render a helping hand to their less fortunate brothers and sisters
in central-western China and for accelerated cooperation between
the east and west, all for achieving what Deng Xiaoping called
"common prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Deputies to the NPC maintain that the plan, formulated under
the principles of a market economy, will not simply shift wealth
from the coastal regions. The plan encourages more eastern China
investment in central-western regions endowed with rich natural
resources and having a vast market, to the benefit of both, they
say.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a plan of 'robbing the rich to help the poor'," says
Deputy Wu Shuqing, a well-known economist and president of the
prestigious Beijing University. "Conditions do not exist for doing
this since the government has a vastly reduced function in the
operation of state enterprises and since businesses of many
ownership forms co-exist today in the country."
</P>
<P>
"I don't see anything in the plan that intends to sacrifice the
east to narrow regional economic disparities, " Wu says.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the government's aid-the-poor program is what
some Western China watchers call a 'Robin Hood Plan'," the
professor says.

market situations in this world's fastest growing region.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will hold a full-day session Sunday to discuss
ways of ensuring macro-economic and financial stability to
maintain the dynamic economic development in the Pacific Rim,
Chinese Finance Ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will stress cooperation between APEC members in
stabilizing capital flows and preventing sudden withdrawal of
foreign investment, they said.
</P>
<P>
At present, foreign capital is flowing into the APEC economies
in large amount. However, this could also mean sudden outflows if
a financial crisis breaks out in any member.
</P>
<P>
The APEC members will discuss establishing a regional currency
stabilization system at the meeting, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers will also seek ways of coordinating
public and private resources in financing infrastructure
improvement projects, which is estimated to cost one trillion
U.S. dollars by 2000.
</P>

APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand and
the United States.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Signs Stopgap Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
signed today a stopgap spending bill for some U.S. government
agencies, the 10th in fiscal 1996, averting yet another partial
government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
The week-long measure will keep U.S. federal employees on the
job and programs running at least until March 22, but does not
resolve budget impasse between Clinton and the Congress over a
broad range of spending priorities in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
In signing the legislation, Clinton said it was "regrettable
that I must sign yet another" temporary spending bill to prevent a
third government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
Although the White House and Republican-controlled Congress
remain far apart on how much money the government will spend and
how for the rest of this fiscal year, neither Democrats nor
Republicans wanted to bear the political fallout from another
shutdown of dozens of government departments and agencies.
</P>
<P>
"I urge Congress to meet its responsibilities by sending me
legislation for the remaining fiscal 1996 appropriations bills in
an acceptable form," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
With fiscal 1996 half gone, some U.S. government departments
and agencies have been operating under one or another temporary
spending bills. The Congress now wants to provide 160 billion
dollars for them for the remaining half of fiscal 1996. President
Clinton is demanding 8 billion dollars more but the Congress is
willing to add less.
</P>
<P>
The changes he wants, Clinton argued, would protect vital
programs in education, the environment, law enforcement and
technology.
</P>
<P>
The temporary spending measure, approved by the Congress
yesterday, will buy more time for the White House and the Congress
for bargaining on the budget impasse.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Bruton Urge IRA to Restore Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and visiting Irish Prime Minister John Bruton today urged The
Irish Republican Army (IRA) to restore the ceasefire and pave the
way for Sinn Fein, IRA's political wing, to take part in the set
all-party political talks in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Irish leaders made the appeal during a ceremony
marking the St. Patrick's Day at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"I am not asking these people to start trusting each other and
loving each other overnight," Clinton said. "There is nothing to
be lost here by taking a leap of faith" and participating in
all-party peace talks scheduled for June 10.
</P>
<P>
The 17-month ceasefire in Ulster was abruptly interrupted by a
new wave of bombings in London. The IRA has claimed
responsibility for the blasts.
</P>
<P>
The all-party peace talks are supposed to involve the British
and Irish governments as well as representatives of the Catholic
and Protestant factions in Northern Ireland that have waged
guerrilla war for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The British government has said that Sinn Fein would not be
allowed to take part in the talks unless the IRA declared to
restore the ceasefire in the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Bruton said that the setting of a
firm date for the start of the all-party talks was "the goal we
have been working for."
</P>
<P>
"Violence has no place in this process. The ceasefire must be
restored," Bruton stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Irish leader said that he believed the IRA "ought to" and
"will" restore the ceasefire in order to allow Sinn Fein to take
part in the negotiations.

<HEADLINE> IDB Funds Not Well Utilized in Indonesia: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Funds from the Islamic
Development Bank (IDB) have not been fully utilized in Indonesia,
according to a government report received here today.
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by the executive committee for the Middle
East of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, attributed the
problem to a local banking regulation stipulating that banks can
only provide guarantees at a maximum of 20 percent of their total
asset.
</P>
<P>
This has become one of the major constraints on Indonesian
businessmen who want to benefit from the IDB funds, the report
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The IDB aims to improve trade activities between Indonesia and
other members of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
Credit facilities offered by the IDB could be utilized to
finance Indonesia's counter trading with other OIC member
countries at an interest of 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has so far utilized only some 200 million US dollars,
which is less than the total capital it injected into the IDB.
</P>
<P>
The country's total export value to OIC countries stood at 2.7
billion US dollars in 1995 while its total import value from OIC
countries reached 2.6 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia exports textiles, plywood, electrical equipment,
footwear and furniture and imports chemical products, iron and
steel, machinery and automotive from OIC countries.
</P>
<P>
The report stressed that Indonesia should penetrate the OIC
market as soon as possible in preparation for the full
implementation of free trading.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Drug Policy Chief on Cocaine, Crack Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Use of cocaine and crack in
the United States seems to be stabilizing but heroin is becoming
more readily available, the White House drug policy chief said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Releasing a quarterly study of U.S. drug use at his first news
conference since assuming the position last week, Barry McCaffrey
cited recent favorable trends and significant long-term
developments since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
But he said overall drug abuse remains too high and is damaging
the quality of American life.
</P>
<P>
The quarterly study, based on interviews with drug researchers,
law officials and drug treatment workers, said, "The use of both
cocaine and crack has stabilized in most areas." But in some areas
of the West, cocaine users are switching to methamphetamines, it
said.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey said the number of cocaine users appears to have
dropped about 30 percent over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The problem is we still have three million or more
chronic addicts and they are threatening the quality of life in a
large part of America. They are causing enormous amounts of
crime. They are using more drugs than ever -- over 300 tons a
year of cocaine in this country."
</P>
<P>
He said, "We're finding that heroin is coming back. Part of it
is because the purity and availability of heroin have increased."
</P>
<P>
The survey said more than two-thirds of the areas checked
reported a rise in younger users.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that marijuana use "remains prevalent"
and the supply plentiful.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey said that "we've got a drug problem among young
people at increasingly younger ages. Down through fourth, fifth
and sixth graders, we see a slippage in the their understanding of
the threat that drugs pose."
</P>
<P>
He said his office has developed some measurement tools to show
Congress and the public that "there are treatment programs that
reduce the damage done by drug abuse to American society."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved a stand-by credit for Hungary which is
equivalent to about 387 million U.S. dollars to back the country's
economic program through end-1997.
</P>
<P>
Hungary's 1996-1997 economic program is aimed to bolster its
economic growth to 2 percent in 1996 and 3.2 percent in 1997, from
1.7 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
It is also designed to reduce inflation from 28.3 percent in
1995 to 16.6 percent in 1996 and 12.7 percent in 1997 and further
consolidate the external current account deficit to 4 percent of
GDP in 1996 and 3 percent of GDP in 1997 from some 5.6 percent in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Hungary joined the IMF in May 1982. Its quota is about 1,105
million dollars equivalent and its outstanding use of IMF credit
currently totals 379 million dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Developers
Association has urged the government to remove most of the legal
levies in house building in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement received here today, the association explained
that the government levies, which account for up to 13 percent of
sale prices, discourage its members from building low-cost
housing.
</P>
<P>
According to data quoted by the association, on average such
additional costs added up to 13 percent to the sale price of very
low-cost houses, 10 percent to low-cost houses, 5 percent to
medium-class houses and 3 percent to luxury houses.
</P>
<P>
Presently, very low-cost houses cost 4.9 million rupiah (2,130
US dollars) per unit.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports said the office of the State Minister of Public
Housing said that at least 26 levies imposed by the office would
be reviewed and are likely to be removed.
</P>
<P>
The association noted that if the levies can be reduced or
eliminated, it would certainly encourage its members to build
low-cost houses, adding that these levies are especially
burdensome to the association's small or new members.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Opposition Denounces President's Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi opposition parties have
sharply reacted to the president's statement on his recent
discussions with different parties to seek solution of political
crisis, saying that it is a strategy of the ruling party to
legalize the February 15 "farcical" elections.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Friday, President Abdur Rahman Biswas
said that "the ruling party has accepted the main demands of the
opposition of holding a fresh general election under a neutral
caretaker government. They have also agreed to pass a bill on
caretaker government in the very first session of the 6th
parliament and hold general elections by May this year under the
caretaker government."
</P>
<P>
In their emergency meetings last night immediately after the
president's statement, the mainstream opposition parties -- the
Awami (People's) League, the Jatiya (National) Party and the
Jamaat-e-Islami -- regretted that the president had not only
violated the people's opinion to protect the party interest of the
ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), but also adopted a
strategy to constitutionally legalize the vote fraud and rigging
by BNP violating the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The BNP held the 6th parliamentary elections along with some
small parties and independent candidates on February 15 despite
all opposition parties' boycott.
</P>
<P>
The opposition have demanded for cancellation of the polls,
resignation of the "illegal" BNP government and holding of a fresh
6th parliamentary elections under a neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
Under the request from the both sides, the president has
decided to take his initiative for dialogue for an end to the
country's prolonged political crisis.
</P>
<P>
He held separate discussions with leaders from the major
opposition parties and the BNP as well as some top legal experts.
</P>
<P>
The opposition considered the president's statement as a move
to dash the hopes and aspirations of the people for an immediate
solution to the political crisis and resolved not only to continue
but also to intensify the mass movement till the realization of
their demands.
</P>
<P>
The sudden statement of the president disregarding the
sentiment of the nation would push the country to further anarchy,
confrontation and violence instead of solving the crisis, warned
Sheikh Hasina, president of the largest opposition party -- the
Awami League.

killed and four others wounded Friday during a confrontation with
Tamil rebels in Mannar Island in north of Sri Lanka, according to
reports reaching here today.
</P>

patrol hunting for Sea Tiger craft of the liberation Tigers of

<HEADLINE> 12,000 Baby Turtles To Be Released in Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 12,000 baby turtles in
Venezuela will be released to nature tomorrow in another move to
preserve a species considered in danger of extinction.
</P>
<P>
The turtles, raised in the nurseries in the southern states of
Amazonas and Apure, will be set free in the Orinoco River, in the
section known as Rio Pad.
</P>
<P>
This will be the third batch of turtles freed since 1994, to
make a grand total of 25,000.
</P>
<P>
The baby turtles remained for a year in the nurseries located
in the cities of Puerto Ayacucho (Amazonas), and San Fernando (the
capital of the state of Apure) to protect them from its predators
when they seek the river waters after being born.
</P>
<P>
Among the predators of these turtles are catfish, alligators,
and herons.
</P>
<P>
The Arrau turtle, as the Orinoco River turtle is known, has its
habitat in the basin of this river waterway.
</P>
<P>
There are evidences that the number of these chelonia is great
in the past, but it has been almost extinguished by turtle
hunters, because their meat and eggs are part of the diet of the
inhabitants of this remote region of Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The authorities keep a close watch in the zone all year round
to prevent the capture of the turtles and the pillage of their
nests, using patrol boats in the river and vigilance on foot on
the banks of the river.

Statistics also show that Italy's trade surplus with
non-European Union (EU) countries last year stood at 31,360

with EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The Central Institute of Statistics attributed the difference
to Italy's increased trade surplus with new industrial countries
in Asia including Japan, Singapore and Malaysia, and its decreased
surplus with the European Free Trade Association and the

<HEADLINE> Over One Million Motor Vehicles Run in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Beijing had over 1.003 million
motor vehicles by the end of February, more than double the figure
of the 1980s, today's Beijing Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the Chinese capital saw a net increase
of over 470,000 motor vehicles, of which 159,202 were added in
1995, the daily says.
</P>
<P>
Passenger vehicles, especially private cars, have seen the
fastest growth, with private cars and motorcycles reaching over
350,000.
</P>
<P>
The taxis running in Beijing hit 70,000, in addition to 40,000
to 50,000 cars and lorries coming into Beijing everyday from other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
There are also over eight million non-motor-vehicles running
here in Beijing, aggravating the traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
Despite huge government financial support in building roads,
the growth of roads are far behind that of the vehicles. Most of
the trunk ways within the third ring road are now in the state of
saturation or over-saturation, the newspaper points out.
</P>
<P>
Experts have called for slowed growth of motor vehicles, the
daily said.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will reduce customs
tariffs by a smaller margin than previously agreed concerning
products from the South American Common Market (Mercosur), it was
known here today.
</P>

the Brazilian side, according to advisors to the government's
economic team.
</P>
<P>
The tariffs on electronics products will be slashed from the
current 62 percent to 30-40 percent, instead of the 20 percent
level agreed originally to last until 2001, the advisors said.
</P>
<P>
The new tariffs on electronics products, textiles and footwear
will be in force as of April 1, as stipulated in the List of
Exceptions to the Common External Tariff of Mercosur.

<HEADLINE> Yellow River: China's New 'Breadbasket' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Areas around China's Yellow
River will become the country's major 'breadbasket', experts
have predicted.
</P>
<P>
They said at a wheat production meeting that there is a great
potential for wheat output to increase in the Huanghuaihai Area,
along the Yellow River, the Huaihe River and the Haihe River.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the meeting agreed that it is likely to become the
major area in the country for wheat output increases in the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
The Huanghuaihai Area, including ten provinces and
municipalities, is already a major wheat producer in the
country. Statistics show that the annual wheat output in the area
is 75 billion kilograms, or 74 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
The experts predicted that the average output for the area is
likely to increase, noting that in the past five years, except
Shandong province, the other nine provinces and municipalities
witnessed marginal fluctuations in wheat production.
</P>
<P>
"If the wheat output in the former large wheat provinces, such
as Henan, Jiangsu, Shanxi, Shaanxi provinces, can resume their
historically highest levels," the experts said, "the total wheat
output in the area will increase by five billion kilograms each
year."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, wheat output per hectare can be further raised,
according to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Almost each of the ten provinces and municipalities has
witnessed higher wheat crops, using advanced agriculture
know-how.
</P>
<P>
Experts admitted that there are some problems in today's grain
production, such as falling grain planting acreages, and
shortages of agricultural technology.
</P>
<P>
Increased wheat planting acreage, and spreading the use of
agriculture technology, have been listed high on the next several
year's grain production scheme.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Kazakhs Favor Restoring Soviet Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Over 68 percent of the Kazakh
people favors the restoration of the former Soviet Union which was
disintegrated in December 1991, according to a survey published by
the Karavan Weekly today.
</P>
<P>
The latest polling results coincided with the fifth anniversary
of a referendum held across the former Soviet Union on March 17,
1991, in which 76 percent of the voters wanted the Soviet Union to
continue. But the Soviet Union ceased to exist a few months later.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh survey, conducted by an influential Kazakh
institute, questioned 1,000 people in 10 cities such as Alma Ata
and Akmola, over their attitude towards the restoration of the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
It showed that 68.6 percent of the respondents were in favor of
restoring the Soviet Union, while 17.6 percent opposed the idea.
</P>
<P>
Those who found it difficult to answer or adopted an
indifferent attitude accounted for 5 percent and 8.8 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
While 75.8 percent of the ethnic Russians polled supported the
restoration of the Soviet Union, only 42.6 percent of the Kazakh
people held similar views.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Soviet Union could be restored by peaceful
means, 40.8 percent of the respondents said yes but 45.7 percent
challenged the answer.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey results indicated that most residents in
Kazakhstan had conflicting opinions with the Kazakh government on
the question.
</P>
<P>
Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev has asserted for many
times that his country opposed restoring the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Russian State Duma (the lower
house of parliament) voted today to declare null and void a 1991
parliament decision that led to the dissolution of the former
Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> Volcano Rumbles to Life on U.S. Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A volcano rumbling to life
with small earthquakes on an Aleutian island forced residents
today to flee the island of Akutan, 760 miles southwest of
Anchorage, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 residents of Akutan were flown 40 miles south to Dutch
Harbor after minor quakes set off by the rumbling volcano broke
water pipes and cracked walls.
</P>
<P>
The volcanic island was occupied by about 80 year-round
residents and 500 seasonal cannery workers who were now on the
island processing crab and pollock.
</P>
<P>
The minor quakes, most not strong enough to be felt, were a
hint that the cloud-shrouded volcano could erupt at any time
within the next few days with little or no warning, said Terry
Keith of the Alaska Volcano Observatory in Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
But she added that the other possibility was that the rumbling
volcano could go back to sleep and nothing more will happen.
</P>
<P>
Akutan is one of the most active volcanoes in the Aleutians,
with low-level eruptions every couple of years.
</P>
<P>
If Akutan shoots ash above 10,000 feet, airlines that cross the
North Pacific on Asian routes may have to give the area a wide
berth, said U.S. aviation officials.

<HEADLINE> NPC Vice-Chairmen on Legislation, Supervision, Law-Enforcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Twelve vice-chairpersons of the
National eople's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee have joined
panel discussions of the current NPC session to examine the NPC
Standing Committe's work report.
</P>
<P>
During a panel discussion Friday with deputies from Hunan
province, Vice-Chairman Tian Jiyun said that since the Eighth NPC
the pace in legislation has been accelerated over the past three
years, to facilitate the establishment of a market economic
structure, and the quality of the legislation has been improved
gradually.
</P>
<P>
However, the tasks for the top legislature remain arduous and
relatively great difficulties are involved in the enacting of some
laws, he said. Moreover, he noted, further efforts should be made
for law enforcement and supervision, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Chairman Ni Zhifu said in a panel discussion with Shaanxi
deputies that equal attention should be paid to supervision of
law-enforcement and to legislation, in a bid to ensure that the
laws promulgated are strictly and effectively observed.
</P>
<P>
The NPC should also beef up its efforts to educate and do
public promotions concerning laws, especially among officials at
various levels, as part of an effort to educate them in doing all
things in accordance with law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Local people's congresses at various levels should better
supervise the work of their governments, courts and procuratorates
at their levels, and increase supervision by the media and the
public, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Chairwoman Lei Jieqiong said during a group discussion
with Shanghai deputies that the NPC should also step up its
efforts to the development of culture and socialist ethics and
attach importance to legislative work, while accelerating its pace
of legislation on economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
A complete legal system is essential for the solution to
various problems that have cropped up during the course of China's
drive toward the market economy, Vice-chairman Wang Bingqian said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Vice-Chairpersons Chen Muhua, Fei Xiaotong, Sun
Qimeng and Buhe also gave their respective remarks concerning
paying attention to the women's role in China's economic and
social development, increasing regional economic cooperation,
revitaling China through the use of science, technologies and
education, and enhancing the unity of all nationalities in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Chile Rejects U.S. Helms-Burton Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Chile will not accept a new
U.S. bill aiming to strengthen the U.S.-imposed trade embargo
against Cuba, Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Before a meeting with visiting Cuban Vice Foreign Minister
Jorge Bolanos, Insulza said the Chilean Government will not accept
laws made by other countries that will affect "the interests of
Chilean entrepreneurs or common citizens".
</P>
<P>
"We are not to act alone," the diplomat said, mentioning that
foreign ministers from the continent, including those from the
Group of Rio, will discuss the issue of Cuba when attending the
meeting to be held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the Helms-Burton law, "which we deeply
deplore," is "deleterious to the general interests of free trade
and besides, it is a form of intervention in the economic
relations between third countries, and we see it as completely
inappropriate from the point of view of international law."
</P>
<P>
The anti-Cuba bill, named after its Republican sponsors, was
approved by the U.S. Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton
as a punitive measure against Cuba which shot down two U.S. planes
piloted by Cuban exiles.
</P>
<P>
But the bill gained little support from the international
community as more and more countries, especially Latin American
countries, have established closer economic relations with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Chile and Cuba have promoted their political and economic
cooperation since the normalization of their relations in April,
1995. Chile has invested about 50 million U.S. dollars in the
Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban diplomat, arriving here this morning for a three-day
visit to Chile, will continue his tour in Bolivia, Brazil and
probably Argentina to explain Cuban position of rejecting the
Helms-Burton Bill.

<HEADLINE> Polish President: Poland Determined to Join NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, March 15 (Xinhua) -- President Aleksander Kwasniewski
today expressed the hope that Russia will not take Poland's
joining NATO as a threat to either the security of its neighbors
or to the integration of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Polish president made this remark when he met the visiting
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski assured Primakov that maintaining rapprochement
with Russia conforms to the interests of the country and that of
Europe and the entire world.
</P>
<P>
It is logical for Poland to join the Western alliance after the
dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, the fall of the Berlin Wall and
the inception of the integration of Europe, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He added that his country is willing to promote dialogues with
Russia concerning concrete issues.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski is scheduled to visit Russia between April 9 and
11, according to the Polish Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
Primakov has also met his Polish counterpart Dariusz Rosati as
well as Jozef Zych and Adam Struzik, speakers of the lower and
upper houses of the Polish parliament, respectively.
</P>
<P>
On winding up his one-day visit, Primakov told the press that
the NATO expansion toward central and eastern Europe will encroach
upon the strategic geographical position of Russia, which
therefore has to find a way that can both meet Poland's demand and
secure the interests of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russia will continue to say "no" to NATO's eastward expansion
while looking for a way to cope with it, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said this approach will be applied to the Czech Republic,
Hungary and Slovakia, which together with Poland, have formed a
Central Europe Free Trade Zone and intended to join the North
Atlantic alliance.

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in
northwest China has made a remarkable progress to improve its
investment environment in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Regional Economic and Trade Committee says
that the region has been spending as much as 60 percent of its
fiscal incomes on roads, telecommunications and power projects for
several years.
</P>
<P>
The region now has a 8,500-km-long highway network that
radiates from regional capital Yinchuan, and links it with
neighbouring regions.
</P>
<P>
Its railway length has also risen from 420 km several years ago
to the present 779 km. The region in the remote west is now
connected to coast China, and via Xinjiang to the Middle East and
Europe by two railway lines. And a third electrified railway line
is to run across the region.
</P>
<P>
Air travel is also getting easier in Ningxia. It has opened air
routes from Yinchuan to Beijing, Shanghai and other major Chinese
cities. A new airport is also being built.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia now leads other western regions in the digitization of
its telephone networks. The number of telephone lines have seen a
35-fold increase in a period of 15 years.
</P>
<P>
"Software" environment has also been improving. The region has
issued local laws on land-use-rights and labor relations in
overseas-funded enterprises, which promise more favorable policies
and conditions for investors.
</P>
<P>
In the next few years, the region will continue to focus much
of its efforts on the improvement of roads, telecommunications and
other infrastructure sectors, regional officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
made a serious mistake by signing into law the Helms-Burton Bill
that tightens economic embargo against Cuba, an official magazine
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"As the head of the most powerful country on this planet, the
president of the United States committed a serious mistake by
signing the Helms-Burton Bill," said the "Granma Internacional"
weekly in a commentary.
</P>
<P>
On March 12, President Clinton signed into law the Helms-Burton
Bill that intensifies the U.S. blockade imposed on the island
country 34 years ago. The law will also punish nations conducting
trade with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"In this case, the consequences will be suffered by many of
Washington's allies and other states who have already expressed
condemnation of and concern about this law, which infringes upon
the fundamental principles of international trade and the
sovereignty of these states," said the Granma Internacional.
</P>
<P>
It said the law was opposed worldwide because "it violates the
most fundamental principles and agreements of international and
regional organizations, as well as the integration efforts of the
third world countries."

<HEADLINE> Kiev Says Ukraine Independent From Russian Duma Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian leaders said today their
country will not be affected by a Russian parliamentary resolution
which nullifies the legal basis of the collapse of the former
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Alexandr Moroz, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine
(parliament), said the resolution, which was adopted today to void
a 1991 parliament decision to dissolve the Soviet Union, was an
internal affair of Russia and that Ukraine is beyond the
jurisdiction of that country.
</P>
<P>
Another resolution passed by the State Duma of Russia, or lower
house of parliament, on Friday legally binds the result of a March
17, 1991 referendum by the Russian Federation which showed a
majority of the population was in favor of preserving the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
Moroz said that his country will abide by the result of a
referendum on December 1, 1991, which showed that more than 91
percent of the Ukrainians were in favor of independence.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma described the resolutions as
"a real threat not only to neighbouring countries once part of the
Soviet Union and for the world community as a whole."
</P>
<P>
Echoing the accusations against the Duma move, a foreign
ministry statement warned that the resolutions -- should they be
carried out -- would mean a Russia's pull-out from the CIS circle,
thus leading to "unpredictable consequences."
</P>
<P>
Ukraine was one of the first republics of the former Soviet
Union to sign the agreement on December 12, 1991 upon dismantling
the Soviet Union and replacing it with the Commonwealth of
Independent States.

BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of college and
university grads in the country's capital hits a record high of
55,000 this year, according to the Employment Administration
Center for Beijing College and University Graduates.
</P>
<P>
There were 32,000 undergraduates, 7,000 master degrees, 1,000
doctor degrees, and 13,000 graduates of professional schools.
</P>
<P>
Although the capital has never had so many graduates in the
past, the number still tallies with demand this year, as
medium-sized and small enterprises, grass-roots units, and remote
areas express an urgent need for talented youngsters.
</P>
<P>
Not all graduates can find a good job, however. Those from
well-known universities, or with higher degrees can always find
favor with employers, as can those with specific technical skills.
</P>
<P>
Qinghua University students are very popular with
employers. The university has 3,000 graduates this year, but only
1,744 are looking for jobs. The others are either continuing their
studies in China, or going abroad to further their study.
</P>
<P>
Competition is such that each of the graduates is being sought
by at least five different employers.

<HEADLINE> Senior Tibet Official Calls for Building Railway in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior official from the Tibet
Autonomous Region urged the central government to conduct
possibility studies on construction at an earlier date of a
railway in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"The Tibetan people have long been aspired a railway leading to
Tibet," said Gyaincain Norbu, chairman of the Tibet Autonomous
Regional Government, at the on-going session of the National
People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
According to the "Outline (Draft) of Ninth Five-year Plan
(1996-2000) for National Economic and Social Development and
Long-term Target for the Year 2010", feasibility studies on
building a railway that leads to Tibet would be carried out in the
first 10 years of the next century.
</P>
<P>
But Chairman Norbu regarded the time fixed for the conducting
construction feasibility studies as too late. "We hope that
preliminary studies can be made during the next five years, and
that construction should begin early next century," he said,
adding that a leading group has been formed in Tibet to undertake
the task.
</P>
<P>
It will be easier to start the construction of the railway from
the new emerging city of Gulmut in neighboring Qinghai Province,
he said, adding that there are not many high mountains and deep
valleys along the route.
</P>
<P>
Backward infrastructure in transportation, energy and
telecommunications is a restraint on rapid economic and social
growth in Tibet, the chairman said, and problems involving in
transportation and energy are most eminent.
</P>
<P>
Tibet boasts abundant forestry and mineral resources, he noted.
Nevertheless, he added, the capacity of highway and air transport
is far from adequate.
</P>
<P>
There are now five highways connecting Tibet with Qinghai,
Sichuan, Xinjiang and Yunnan as well as Nepal, but only the
Qinghai-Tibet highway is unimpeded all year round.
</P>
<P>
Furthmore, there are air routes from Lhasa, capital of Tibet,
to Chinese cities of Chengdu and Chongqing in Sichuan Province,
and Kathmandu of Nepal, but with only 17 flights each week.
</P>
<P>
The early construcction of a railway linking Tibet with outside
has been an aspiration of the Tibetan people, Norbu said.

<P>
LONDON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The third British National Week of
Science, Engineering and Technology (SET96) was launched today in
London.

the SET96.
</P>
<P>
In one of the attractive scenes, children were laughing with
tears when they talked with a half-meter-tall robot at Imperial
College of Science, Technology and Medicine in London.
</P>
<P>
"Do you like football?'' asked children.
</P>
<P>
"I don't like any sport because I can't run," The robot named
JEM answered.
</P>
<P>
"Do you have a dad?"
</P>
<P>
"I haven't a dad, and you?"
</P>
<P>
Such shows could be seen from the smallest primary schools to
national research councils, each planned with different subjects,
but Taylo said the program covers the "entire spectrum of science
and technology."

<HEADLINE> Sampras Knocked Out Champions Cup Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Paul Haarhuis pulled down top
seed Pete Sampras on Friday to book his first semifinal spot in
the Champions Cup men's tennis tournament in Indian Wells,
California.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch boasted the upset 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 6-1, dashing aside
all the hope of the American to regain his world top spot this
week.
</P>
<P>
Running up and down the court, Haarhuis kept his service games
intact as the American tried in vain for a semifinal spot to
regain the top spot from Austrian Thomas Muster.
</P>
<P>
Haarhuis said Sampras was not in his top form, while he himself
kept his own rhythm in the clash.
</P>
<P>
"I got some rhythm on my serve and in the rallies I stayed with
him. I tried to make him hit as many volleys as possible, then you
have the chance with the second shot," said Haarhuis.
</P>
<P>
Early in the second round, the Dutch man uprooted eighth-seeded
Swede Thomas Enqvist in straight sets en route to his first showup
in the event's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Haarhuis is to play the semis against sixth
seed Croatian Goran Ivanisevic who beat Spain's Carlos Costa 6-4,
6-4 in the other quarterfinal.

<HEADLINE> China Prepares to Reap Summer Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to reap a good
summer grain harvest providing there is no major natural disaster
in forthcoming months, a senior agricultural official has predicted.
</P>
<P>
China has sown winter crops on almost 30 hectares of land,
three quarters of which is wheat. Wheat sowing has extended to an
extra 266,000 ha over the previous year's figure.
</P>
<P>
Crops in the country's leading wheat growing areas have turned
green, and are growing well, said, Liu Chengguo, vice minister of
agriculture, at a recent national conference on wheat production,
adding this is a rare scene in recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, the vice minister issued stern advice: " We should not
lower our guard. There exists some unfavorable factors for the
summer harvest, such as severe drought in north China, and the
possibility of insect pests on large tracts of land as a result
of the warm winter."
</P>
<P>
 He urged all localities and government departments to
energetically support spring sowing, provide adequate
agriculture-related products, such as chemical fertilizers, power
and farm chemicals, and send agro-technicians to help with field
management using modern science.

<P>
They must also strictly control the behavior of their spouses,
children and aides, he said, adding that major members of leading
bodies must strictly control the behavior of other members and
assume overall responsibility for building a clean government
and the anti-corruption struggle in their departments or areas.
</P>
<P>
"Leadership at all levels must conscientiously abide by laws
and discipline, and overcome local and departmental protectionism,
in order to make sure that the policies and orders of the central
authorities are implemented to the letter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li urged that greater efforts be made to solve salient
problems such as the abuse of banqueting at government expense,
the use of luxury cars and improper housing distribution.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the need to improve supervision and
restriction of leading officials of state-owned enterprises, and
prevent them from abusing their power for personal gain.
</P>
<P>
Second, it is imperative to concentrate on investigating major
cases involving violations of laws and regulations, the premier
said.
</P>
<P>
Investigation will continue to focus on leading departments,
administrative law-enforcement departments, judicial departments,
economic administrative departments and leading officials at and
above the county magistrate level, he said.
</P>
<P>
A special task force will be organized to inspect sectors in
which major criminal cases are rife, such as banking, securities,
real estate, land leasing and contracting, and subcontracting for
construction projects, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li also called for the implementation of effective
measures to crack down on tax deception and evasion, and the
making of false financial statements.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative to perfect systems and improve education to
stop some people from turning budgetary funds into extra-budgetary
funds or turning public funds into private funds, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"All corrupt officials abusing their power for personal gain,
accepting or offering bribes and committing serious dereliction of
duty must be punished according to law, regardless of their
positions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The results of investigations into major criminal cases will be
announced in a planned and selective manner to deter corrupt
officials and educate officials and the general public, he added.
</P>
<P>
The leader also emphasized the need to halt the collection of
illicit tolls from drivers, and illicit fees from primary and
middle school students, farmers and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, the collection of such illicit fees involves
the interests of local governments, departments and working groups.
</P>
<P>
To eliminate this malpractice it is imperative to standardize
the behavior of governments and departments.
</P>
<P>
"Our power is granted by the people, and must be used to serve
the people, and should never be used to seek personal gain," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Effective measures must be taken this year to stamp out
malpractices in the management and utilization of extra-budgetary
funds, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is absolutely impermissible for any locality, department
or unit to conceal financial revenues or illicitly make use of
budgetary funds, he warned.

urgency of the anti-corruption struggle, from the height of the
reform, development, stability and the socialist modernization
drive.
</P>
<P>
The leader described the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000) and the next 15 years as "vital" to the reform,
opening up and the modernization endeavors.
</P>
<P>
It is therefore imperative to step up the building of a clean
government, and the anti-graft struggle, and to score greater
successes in this regard, in a bid to achieve a fundamental turn
for the better in the general mood of society, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Whether the anti-corruption struggle will be carried
out in a thorough way, and score real success, is essential to
popular feeling and the survival of state power, political and
social stability, and whether the line, policies and principles of
the Chinese Communist Party will be implemented."
</P>
<P>
"This is a precondition for promoting the reform, opening up,
and economic growth, and maintaining social stability, and
constitutes an important guarantee for fulfilling the Ninth
Five-Year Plan and meeting the long-range goal for the year 2010,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that people's governments at all levels shoulder a
special and important mission in the anti-corruption struggle.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, honesty is a basic requirement imposed by the
people on government officials, and combatting corruption is a
major duty of the government.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, under conditions of imperfect systems and
inadequate supervisory and restrictive mechanisms, those
officials, who are not sound politically and ideologically, are
liable to abuse their power for personal gain, trading their power
for money.
</P>
<P>
"Whether governments can make the anti-graft struggle a success
is crucial to the success of the anti-corruption campaign as a
whole," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
That is why the State Council, China's highest administrative
body, attached the utmost importance to the anti-corruption
struggle and defined explicit requirements for building an honest
government in the course of drawing up the Ninth Five-Year Plan,
and setting the long-range target for the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
He asked departments and governments at various levels to
combine the anti-graft struggle with their routine work, and
increase their awareness of combating corruption, while
implementing their long- and medium-term development plans and
annual work plans.
</P>
<P>
The anti-corruption measures carried out by governments at all
levels in 1996 will continue to focus on making sure that leading
officials are honest, and strict with themselves, investigating
major criminal cases, and correcting malpractices, Li said. For
this purpose, it is necessary to intensify a supervisory
mechanism, and stress the main points and substantial results, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Russian Wins Stage, Jalabert Keeps Overall Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian veteran Andrei Tchmil took
the sixth stage on Friday as Frenchman Laurent Jalabert survived a
fall to keep his overall lead in the Paris-Nice cycling race.
</P>
<P>
Pacing up in the rains, the 33-year-old Russia completed the
199.5-kilometer course from Vitrolles to Saint Tropez in a winning
time of five hours 27 minutes 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
After setting off on the gunfire, a trio of French Richard
Virenque, Italian Antonio Santaromita and German Thomas Fleischer
formed the leading group until the last 10 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Along an uphill mountaineous road at some 60 kilometers away
from the finish, Jalabert fell down with his left cheek and left
knee bruised.
</P>
<P>
However, the world number one rider geared up anew to overtake
the leading trio and finish fifth in the stage.
</P>
<P>
Jalabert maintained his overall lead by 47 seconds from Lance
Armstrong of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Runner-up of the stage was Britain's Olympic champion Chris
Boardman who ranked fourth overall.
</P>
<P>
A total of 123 riders crossed the finishing line with 29 others
withdrew from the race after six days.

<HEADLINE> Iraq and UN to Continue Oil-for-food Talks Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The talks between Iraq and
the U.N. Secretariat on an oil-for-food plan will continue on
Monday, U.N. spokesperson Sylvana Foa said today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Iraq's chief negotiator with the United Nations said
the current round of negotiations would end today.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to finish this round tonight," Ambassador Abdul Amir
al-Anbari told reporters as he began late Friday talks with the
U.N. Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
He said the main stumbling block was still the issue of how
food and medicine would be distributed to Kurdish regions in the
north, where the Kurdish are seeking independence from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under strict U.N. trade sanctions ever since its
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
The embargo has caused severe lack of food and medicine. The
U.N. Security Council agreed last April to allow Iraq to sell up
to 2 billion U.S. dollars of oil for the purchase of food and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq has to meet several conditions before it can export
oil. The council demanded that it export the main part of its oil
through Turkish oil pipelines in the north and give part of the
money earned to the Kurdish minorities in the northern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the U.N. Secretariat held the first round of talks
last month on some technical matters regarding the
implementation of the council decision. They began the second
round of talks this Monday.

LAGOS, March 15 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Russia beat Kenya in three
straight sets to win the opener of the African women's Olympic
volleyball qualifiers at the Indoor Sports Hall of the National
Stadium here Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Russians, that lost to Germany in the European qualifiers
early, outpowered the Kenyans 15-5, 15-1, 15-4.
</P>
<P>
According to the tournament fixtures, Nigeria will play against
Kenya on March 16 and face Russia on March 17 after Egypt withdrew
from the tournament for lack of fund.
</P>
<P>
The decision to put Russia in the African qualifiers was
untenable and insistence of the Federation of International
Volleyball (FIVB), said Elias Gora, secretary-general of the
Nigeria Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
"If Russia wins (the African tournament), Russia will go to
Atlanta, but not representing Africa. Only an African country can
represent Africa, and Russia is not an African country," said
Gabriel Lohoury Guigui, president of the African Volleyball
Confederation.
</P>
<P>
"If FIVB and IOC want Africa to be there (Atlanta), they should
make the decision. It will be their own decision to take or not
to take the best team of africa," said the president.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks End Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Stocks in New York were mixed in
heavy, computer-driven trading Friday. The Dow Jones industrial
average rallied hard in the final hour to close barely lower on
the day and broad market indexes were mixed.
</P>
<P>
The Dow industrials closed down 1.09 point at 5,584.97.
</P>
<P>
For the week, the Dow added 114.52 points. The gain was still
not enough to recover all the territories lost last week, when the
the blue-chip gauge plunged 171.23 points March 8.
</P>
<P>
The total volume reached 529.96 million shares, the
fourth-heaviest trading day ever and well above Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
Broad market indexes finished mixed. The NYSE's composite index
declined 0.01 to 343.39. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
rose 0.56 to 641.43.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 8.28 to 1,099.35. The American
Stock Exchange's market value index fell 0.27 to 561.51.
</P>
<P>
Blue-chip stocks dropped with the bond market, where the
30-year benchmark Treasury bond lost about 0.25 point, yielding
6.73 percent.
</P>
<P>
Friday stocks and bonds responded to a Federal Reserve report
that industrial production shot up 1.2 percent in February, the
biggest advance in more than eight years.
</P>
<P>
A University of Michigan report that its consumer sentiment
index rose to 95.7 in March, a remarkable increase from 88.5 in
February.
</P>
<P>
Despite the growth in the economy, inflation appears to be
under control, according to economists.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Labor Department said consumer prices edged up
a moderate 0.2 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
The economic reports were considered negative for both stock
and bond markets because they suggest the economy is growing too
fast to persuade the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates March
26.
</P>
<P>
Oil and oil-drilling stocks eased after making strong gains in
the past several sessions.

<HEADLINE> UN Rapporteur Worried About Sarajevo Serb Exodus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Human Rights Rapporteur in
the former Yugoslavia Elisabeth Rehn has expressed concern over
the mass exodus of Serbs from Serb Sarajevo sectors which are to
be handed over to the Muslim-Croat federation by March 19.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Radio Yugoslavia in Belgrade after talks with
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic today, Rehn said that the
majority of Serbs had left the five Serb suburbs of Sarajevo which
were reverted to the Muslim-Croat federation under the Dayton
agreement and that not more than 1,000 Serbs remained in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
"This is a disaster," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said Serbs were not given protection needed for a safe stay
in Sarajevo, but Serbs had partly been pray to propaganda, which
encouraged them to leave the city.
</P>
<P>
Rehn said that her team had met a group of Serb doctors and
nurses who wished to stay but were not convinced that new
authorities would protect them.
</P>
<P>
Rehn said that she had called on international community's High
Representative for Bosnia Carl Bildt, who is in charge of the
civilian aspect of the Dayton agreement, to protect the property
of Serbs who left the city in case they decided to return.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Serbs have fled their homes in fear of
reprisals from Muslims and Croats. Many of them have even dug up
the coffins of their dead relatives and burned their houses.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Futures Rise for Five Days on End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil futures prices in New
York surged Friday to the highest level in more than three years
-- rallying for the fifth straight session.
</P>
<P>
The continued tightness of oil supply and the market's
uncertainty about the progress of negotiations aimed at allowing
Iraq to resume sales of oil.
</P>
<P>
Light, sweet crude oil for April delivery rose 83 cents to
21.99 U.S. dollars a barrel, the highest since October 19, 1992
when crude oil closed at 22.14 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the energy complex, including natural gas, also
jumped, with heating oil seeing an increase of 2.8 cents per
gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid concerns over
tight supplies.
</P>
<P>
April heating oil rose 2.8 cents Friday to 57.87 cents a
gallon; April unleaded gasoline rose 0.47 cent to 62.92 cents a
gallon; and April natural gas rose 8.6 cents to 2.333 U.S. dollars
per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
Oil stocks in the U.S. are at their lowest levels since 1977,
when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries nearly
doubled the price of oil.
</P>
<P>
Analyst said many investors were short on crude oil, betting
that before the April contract expired, Iraq would take that
agreement.

<HEADLINE> IFOR: Military Accords to be Implemented as Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 15 (Xinhua) -- IFOR Commander, U.S. Admiral
Leighton Smith said here today it was the general opinion that the
military aspect of the Bosnia peace accord would be implemented as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic,
Smith said he had informed the Serbian president about the IFOR
peace mission in Bosnia to date, and the two had devoted special
attention to the situation in Sarajevo's municipality Grbavica.
</P>
<P>
Grbavica is the last of the five Serb municipalities in
Sarajevo to be handed over to the Muslim-Croat federation on March
19 under the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Smith said Milosevic has asked that all possibilities be
explored for providing greater security for Sarajevo Serbs who had
decided to remain in their homes.
</P>
<P>
In fear of reprisals from their former enemies, tens of
thousands of Serb Sarajevans have fled to other Serb territories,
leaving behind burned houses and public buildings.
</P>
<P>
Smith said IFOR had already decided to strengthen its presence
in Grbavica, and would continue to cooperate with the
International Police Force patrolling in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
He also said Milosevic would urge at the Geneva meeting with
contact group members and leaders of Croatia and Bosnia on Monday
that commercial air links with Bosnia-Herzegovina be renewed.
</P>
<P>
IFOR would help in this as much as possible, because it was the
common position that the renewal of commercial air links with
Sarajevo and Serb city in western Bosnia Banja Luka was one of the
best ways to start with bosnia's reconstruction, the IFOR
commander added.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, both Milosevic and Smith expressed conviction
that the two entities in Bosnia -- Republika Srpska and the
Muslim-Croat federation -- would continue resolving open issues
through talks and in cooperation with the peace force, Tanjug news
agency said.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Somalia to Achieve Stability and Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Members of the U.N.
Security Council today urged all parties in Somalia to accelerate
national reconciliation, restore peace and open its main seaport
to allow delivery of humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Security Council's open debate on the situation
of Somalia, representatives of many countries expressed their
concern about the worsening of security, food and health situation
in Somalia as they received reports of malnutrition and a
potentially dangerous outbreak of cholera in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Power struggles and clan clashes broke out in Somalia following
the downfall of President Siad Barre in January 1991. The
hostilities resulted in widespread death and destruction, forcing
nearly a half of its population to flee their homes and causing a
dire need for emergency humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has made its humanitarian efforts in Somalia
from the very beginning of the conflict. The Security Council
established a peace-keeping force known as the United Nations
Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) in April 1992 and expanded the size
and mandate of UNOSOM in March 1993. The U.N. peace-keeping
operation came to an end in March 1995. However, the political
situation has not changed in Somalia since then.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Wang Xuexian said that the Chinese
government and people have always paid attention to the situation
of Somalia and showed deep sympathy for the suffering of Somali
people. The solution of the Somali issue depends on that all
parties abandon their past disputes and realize national
reconciliation through broad-based political consultation.
</P>
<P>
While stressing the decisive role of Somali people, he said
that the international community, especially, the United Nations,
should make greater efforts to help Somalia restore peace, rebuild
and develop its economy.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of of the European Union, Italian representative
Lorenzo Ferrarin said that EU is deeply concerned by the spiral of
seemingly endless violence gripping Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"It is out responsibility to keep the international community's
focus on the country, to prevent Somalia from disappearing not
only from the international scene, but also from our agenda, and
becoming a true no-man's land," he said.
</P>
<P>
While stressing the efforts of the United Nations and the
international agencies to assist the civilian population, he
appealed to the Somali parties and factions to open
unconditionally Mogadishu's main seaports and other transportation
facilities in order to allow the delivery of humanitarian
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Juan Somavia, representative of Chile, stressed that the
humanitarian problem turned out not so much on an absence of food
and medicine, but on an inability to deliver those commodities
because the main seaport remained closed.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian representative Nugroho Wisnumurti said that the
Organization of African Unity, the League of Arab States and
Organization of the Islamic Conference should continue their
efforts in cooperation with the United Nations in the search
towards lasting peace in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Russian representative Sergei Lavrov said that Somalia needed a
broad-based government that would be representative of a variety
of factions and supported by regional organizations. Moreover, all
states should honor the continuing embargo of arms for Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Elaraby, representative of Egypt, recommended that a
pan-Somali congress be convened in a neighboring state, a joint
presidential council or other means of power sharing be
established, a Security Council mission or a high-level envoy be
dispatched to evaluate the situation there. He also encouraged
regional and national organizations to work towards convincing the
Somali leaders of the importance of dialogue.

<HEADLINE> "U.S. Economy Will Grow Steadily" -- Researchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy will grow
steadily through the rest of this year, according to The
Conference Board's latest economic analysis released here today.
</P>
<P>
The New York based private research group said that the real
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth should average 2.5 percent in
1996, with the economy growing 3.2 percent between the fourth
quarter of 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The February employment numbers together with positive signals
from the Conference Board's recent help-wanted and consumer
confidence indexes suggest that 1996 will be a good economic
year," says Gail D. Fosler, Vice President and Chief Economist of
the board. "The new forecast shows the economy rebounding in
1996," she added.
</P>
<P>
While the February employment numbers overstate the underlying
economic strength, they more than offset earlier signs of
weakness. On balance, the economy is continuing to recover from
the early 1995 slowdown.
</P>
<P>
But the researcher added that the General Motors strike in
recent weeks could pose a problem for the economy.
</P>
<P>
"The industrial adjustment has taken longer than expected,
but inventories are near record lows," she said.
</P>
<P>
Corporate profits should stay strong this year, Fosler said,
adding that "Productivity always picks up when industrial
activity accelerates, and, the cost-structure remains extremely
lean.

<HEADLINE> Kwazulu/Natal's Provincial Constitution Adopted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Constitution for
Kwazulu/Natal province, the first of its kind among South
Africa's nine provinces, was adopted unanimously by the
provincial legislature today.
</P>
<P>
It was seen as a major step in bringing an end to the violence
in the strife-torn province.
</P>
<P>
The move followed 22 hours of negotiations which at last
resulted in the compromise between the National Party (NP) and
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the two major parties in the
provincial legislature.
</P>
<P>
After the agreement between the two rivals, almost all the
leaders of the seven parties in the provincial legislature
described the adoption of the constitution as "historic".
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress (ANC) leader in Kwazulu/Natal,
Jacob Zuma, echoed the feelings of many politicians, saying they
had "found a common ground at last, despite seemingly impossible
differences".
</P>
<P>
Constitutional Assembly Chairman Cyril Ramaphosa who is also
the ANC Secretary-General, said the adoption of the constitution
might "signal the return of the IFP to the process of national
constitutional-making.
</P>
<P>
NP's Kwazulu/Natal leader Danie Schutte said the unanimous
adoption of the provincial constitution "opened a chapter of
greater autonomy and asymmetry between provinces".
</P>
<P>
"What we have achieved here in Kwazulu/Natal, in the most
inclusive manner, has to be an example to national government,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Swazi King To Hold Talks With Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 15 (Xinhua)-- Swaziland King Mswati III
was due in South Africa tomorrow for ''confidential discussions''
with President Nelson Mandela, a reliable senior South African
government source said tonight.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and Botswana President
Quett Masire are also expected to attend the talks on Saturday in
Pretoria, the South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The source, who did not want to be named, said King Mswati and
the three presidents would discuss the political situation in
Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
Mswati was due to meet Mandela in South Africa on March 1, but
called off the meeting when it was leaked to the media
before-hand. Instead, Mandela flew to Swaziland to meet Mswati
for talks.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only southern African country where political
parties are banned. Mswati's father King Sobhuza II outlawed all
party political activities when he suspended the constitution and
introduced emergency rule in 1973.
</P>
<P>
In January, an eight-day nationwide strike, called by the
Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU), had brought the
kingdom's crippling economy to a complete standstill.
</P>
<P>
The SFTU demanded the lifting of the 23-year-old ban on free
political activities and reinstatement of the suspended
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Under growing pressure, Mswati announced earlier this month
that his government would set up a constitutional forum so that
different interest groups could discuss political reform.
</P>
<P>
However, the proposed constitutional forum excluded the
still-banned political parties.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland's largest anti-government political party, the
People's United Democratic Movement, yesterday said it wanted an
interim government established representing all interest groups
to oversee changes in the country.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is a small land-locked country surrounded by South
Afica and Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis -- East Africa On Way To Economic Integration </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Businessmen in the region said
the new grouping is a turning point in their ventures as they
predict huge trading potentials for the region.
</P>
<P>
"If it works we could have a significant market with around 70
million population of the three countries," said Arnold Kilewo,
vice-chairman of the Confederation of Tanzanian Industry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, critics are arguing that by creating the
cooperation, East Africans want to ditch the Preferential Trade
Area (PTA) bloc.
</P>
<P>
"This is not true," said Francis Muthaura, the newly appointed
Secretary General of the EAC.
</P>
<P>
"The new body will give impetus to the PTA states because we
are not withdrawing from the bloc but instead want to tap the
vast resources in this region that PTA has not managed to," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
The EAC secretary general also highlighted the need to address
critical issues such as modalities for a harmonized monetary
policy and the free movement of people across national borders.
</P>
<P>
Heavy debt burden, poor commodity prices and threat to the
infant industries are among the serious economic problems facing
the region.
</P>
<P>
And above all, there is the challenge which comes from the
emerging regional groupings in Europe, North America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Such groupings are imposing trading conditions that restrict
the entry of goods from East Africa to their markets," said
President Moi, highlighting the need for building a strong
economic bloc in the East African region.
</P>
<P>
"African continent will only survive through total cooperation
among their states," said Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary General of
the Organisation of African Unity at the launching of the EAC
secretariate in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
And to survive, East Africa must be on its way to regional
economic integration.
</P>
<P>
Now, it is.

</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Three decades ago, the founding
fathers of the independent states of East Africa established a
regional bloc in a hope to turn it into a political federation.
</P>
<P>
The dream shattered. In 1977, the East African Community
collapsed owing to the ideological disagreement, political
mistrust and open hostility among Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
But today, the region is ushered into a historical era when a
new generation of leaders revive their regional integration
efforts by forming the East African Cooperation (EAC).
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania's northern city of Arusha on Thursday, an accord
of regional integration was signed by President Denial arap Moi
of Kenya, President Yoweri Moseveni of Uganda and President
William Mkapa of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
But will the history repeat itself?
</P>
<P>
"We must not repeat the mistakes that led to the collapse of
the East African Community, because this is the last chance of
our unity," President Moi announced as he inaugurated the new EAC
secretariate.
</P>
<P>
The view is shared by his counterparts in Uganda and Tanzania
who, recalling the bitter experience 20 years ago, now believe
that "the way ahead for the region is via economic integration".
</P>
<P>
"They are putting aside their political differences and
focusing on the common economic interest of their people," said
an observer.
</P>
<P>
"It is a brand new effort of enhancing their joint bargaining
power which they believe would lead to their economic growth
now," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Arusha agreement, areas of the regional
cooperation include trade, industry, health, science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
Plans are underway for the three countries to have their
annual budgets issued on the same day, to allow use of each
other's currency, and to harmonise their tariffs and restrictive
trade regulations.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the ECA secretariat said the three states are
also hoping to sharing common services such as railways, harbors,
airlines, and posts and telecommunications, just as were enjoyed
by the defunct East African Community.
</P>
<P>
The move was welcomed by ordinary citizens in the region.
</P>
<P>
In the tourist resort of Arusha, people flocked to the street
to welcome visiting presidents from Kenya and Uganda and hailed
March 14 as the "D-Day for East African Unity".
</P>
<P>
"We are sharing a common national language, a similar colonial
experience, a common lake and cordial relations. There is no
reason for us to be isolated form each other," said a Kenyan
tourist in Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Kremlin Agrees on Non-military Chechen Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 15 (Xinhua) -- All the members of the Russian
Security Council agreed today to settle the Chechen crisis without
the use of force, or by exclusively political methods, the
Presidential Press Service said.
</P>
<P>
The afternoon meeting, which was chaired by President Boris
Yeltsin, considered "a complex plan to surmount the Chechen
crisis," the Press Service said, adding that the plan has been
crafted proceeding from the proposals earlier submitted by a
governmental commission and a presidential council group.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the differences in the shades of the positions, all
those involved in the discussion were unanimous on the main
points," the Press Service said.
</P>
<P>
It noted: "First, conditions have matured for a radical shift
in the Chechen settlement policy towards non-force, exclusively
political methods of settlement. Second, the devised plan
corresponds with national security requirements."
</P>
<P>
The key elements of the approved plan will be unveiled by the
Russian President after the plan is finalized, taking into
consideration the observations made at today's meeting, the Press
Service said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Yeltsin said he will
soon address the nation, telling the details of the plan aimed at
ending the war which started in December 1994.

<HEADLINE> GM Union Workers Strike Enters 11th Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) --Some 111,550 workers of the
General Motors Corp. (GM) have been idled as a 3,000 workers'
strike at two brake-making plants in Ohio entered the 11th day
today.
</P>
<P>
The strike started by the United Auto Workers union (UAW) in
Dayton, Ohio on March 5 has crippled all but one of GM's 29
assembly plants in the Northern American region due to ran-out of
auto parts. The UAW union went on strike in protesting against
GM's plans to assign more than 100 future jobs to an outside
supplier. The local strike has since escalated into a major wrest
between the union and the GM, the largest auto-making company in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Some economists warned that if the strike lasts through the
rest of this month, it could begin to affect the whole country's
economic growth, probably eroding the first-quarter gross domestic
product (GDP) by as much as 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Both sides held negotiations, but failed to find solutions to
the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the GM has begun filing protests with state
unemployment departments, arguing that the laid-off workers
because of a strike in Ohio are ineligible for benefits.
</P>
<P>
"Since GM is assessed the cost of state unemployment
compensation, we don't believe we should finance a strike against
ourselves," a GM spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
GM stated that the company would challenge benefit payments to
any United Auto Workers union member it has laid off in 14 states
because of the strike by 3,000 workers at the two brake plants in
Dayton.
</P>
<P>
The strike has forced the automaker to close most of its car
and truck assembly plants and to lay off workers at dozens of
other parts plants.
</P>
<P>
UAW workers at the GM usually file for state unemployment
benefits during a strike and the company pay for the cost. In
addition, under the UAW's national contract with GM, laid-off
workers also qualify for supplemental benefits paid by the
company. The combined benefits equal 90 percent or more of
workers' base take-home pay. The striking workers are not eligible
for either type of payment, but receive strike pay from the union
of about 150 dollars a week.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Province Lost Communication Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The communication links between
Zaire Province of Angola and other places in the country has been
off for three years, leaving local governments very worried.
</P>
<P>
The roads which connected Zaire Province with the capital
Luanda and other provinces has been impassable for three years,
because on the roads mines were planted and bridges were
destroyed by the civil war.
</P>
<P>
The links between the province and other areas have to be
conducted by air and sea, which has driven prices of necessities
up and blocked free flow of people and goods.
</P>
<P>
Zaire Province, located in the northwest coast of Angola and
covering more than 40,000 square kilometers, is the second
biggest oil producing area of Angola and is of great strategic
importance to the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the worried local governments have
repeatedly appealed the central government to take measures to
solve the problem as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Sinister Forces At Work In Kwazulu/Natal: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 15 (Xinhua)-- Dark and sinister forces are
at work in South Africa's Kwazulu/Natal, fuelling violence
between the African National Congress (ANC) and Inkatha Freedom
Party (IFP), President Nelson Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to about 300 traditional leaders at a meeting at Zulu
King Goodwill Zwelithini's Kwakhangela Palace at Nongoma, the
South Afircan President seriously criticised political leaders
who spoke lightly about violence in the province, saying dark and
sinister forces are actually inciting behind the ANC and IFP.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting of Amakhosi (traditional chiefs), which was
also attended by IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and King
Zwelithini, was a preliminary meeting of a planned peace Imbizo
(a national gathering of Zulus) to bring an end to violence in
the strife-torn province.
</P>
<P>
Mandela told the apparently hostile crowd although he had the
highest respect for Buthelezi, the chiefs would be making a
serious mistake if they raised Buthelezi above the king.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said Buthelezi would never succeed in uniting the
people of Kwazulu/Natal without the king.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela's remarks drew some apparently angry
responses and loud jeers from individuals in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
Both the ANC and IFP were guilty of violence in Kwazulu/Natal,
said the president, adding at least 20000 people had been killed
in the province since fighting broke out between the two
organisations in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi, also Chairman of Kwazulu/Natal house of traditional
leaders, said the political exchanges between the IFP and ANC in
Kwazulu/Natal were extremely acrimonious, therefore violence was
inevitable in the province.
</P>
<P>
However, no decision was taken on a proposed Imbizo at the
meeting. It had been hoped before-hand that a date for the
planned Imbizo would be set at the meeting.

LONDON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets ended mixed
Friday, with German shares surged strongly and other European
bourses fell on fear that current round of lower US interest rates
could be over following the releasing today of strong US
production figures.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt DAX-30 index closed up 1.3 percent at 2458.23
points after investors went on a buying spree prompted by talk of
a possible demerger of the chemical and drugs company Hoechst and
news of a merger that will make the Metro group one of the world's
biggest retail chains.
</P>
<P>
But in London, shares dropped by one percent on the latest
strong US industrial production data.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the data may suggest the U.S. economy is on the
verge of overheating, which would certainly result in a US rate
hike.
</P>
<P>
French shares closed down 0.63 percent, also depressed by a
fall in Wall Street on the US industrial production data.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares
finished 37 points lower at 3,644.8.

The DAX-30 index ended up 31.74 points at 2,458.23.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian PM Calls For No Further Delay in  International Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Prime Minister Hasan
Muratovic today called on the international community to provide
economic assistance to his country without further delay.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the information conference
on reconstruction programs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Muratovic
revealed horrifying statistics about the war damage to the
country.
</P>
<P>
The 42-month-old war inflicted 80 billion U.S. dollars of
destruction and damage to the housing and industrial facilities in
Bosnia, reduced to 1 percent the population still engaged in
production, shrank the output to 2 percent of the pre-war level
and rendered 80 percent of people dependent on humanitarian aid,
Muratovic said.
</P>
<P>
"Our society is on the verge of collapse" due to the war, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Muratovic put forward five areas which urgently need
international assistance -- the rehabilitation of housing and
accommodation for refugees; financing of pensions, medical care
and support for orphans and the disabled as well as other social
needs; building of infrastructure; creation of jobs; and mine
clearing.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian prime minister expressed dissatisfaction to the
international community over the slow arrival of financial
assistance to his country, saying that "we need economic
assistance immediately and without delay."
</P>
<P>
"There will not be real peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina unless
economic recovery starts immediately, unless refugees return and
unless people can buy goods," Muratovic said.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the World Bank, Bosnia needs
1.8 billion dollars for this year's reconstruction projects, of
which only 500 million has been promised. But of the promised
money, only 380 million was "firmly available" by March.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference, the first one in Sarajevo since the end
of the war, has attracted representatives from 38 countries and 14
international organizations.
