<HEADLINE> Iraq Nearly Completes Oil Contracts Under UN Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amr Mohammed
Rashid said Friday that Iraq has concluded oil contracts worth 95
percent of the total sums allocated for food and medicine under
the third phase of the Iraqi-U.N. oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Rashid told a news conference that Iraq has concluded 29
contracts with world oil companies, 23 of them have been approved
by the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Under the third phase of the oil-for-food program, Iraq is
allowed to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil to buy food,
medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its people in another
six-month time.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iraqi-U.N. Memorandum of Understanding signed
in 1996, 1.3 billion dollars out of the 2 billion dollars will be
earmarked for the purchase of food and medicines, some of the rest
will go to U.N. Special Commission in charge of eliminating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, and some will be used to compensate
the victims of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The oil minister said that the processes of loading Iraqi oil
to the world markets continue in accordance with the approved
contracts via the Iraqi Al-Bakr port and the Turkish Ceyhan port.
</P>
<P>
Rashid added that Iraq is ready to meet any future increases in
the capacity of the crude oil export in case of any increase in
the sum of the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is suffering from a devastating economic embargo imposed
by the United Nations after its invasion of Kuwait seven years
ago.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Two Largest Banks to Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Bank of Canada and the
Bank of Montreal announced early Friday that they will merge as
equal partners to better compete globally.
</P>
<P>
Senior Canadian government officials are said to be reviewing
the initiative, and are expected to give a nod to the proposed
merger.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Bank of Canada is currently Canada's biggest bank,
while the Bank of Montreal is the third largest.
</P>
<P>
With the merger, "we will have the financial resources,
technology and skills to help Canada remain a global leader in
financial services," said John E. Cleghorn, chairman and chief
executive officer of the Royal Bank, in making the announcement.
</P>
<P>
"The merger is a Canadian response to the sharply rising level
of global competition in the financial services market," the two
banks said.
</P>
<P>
It "will help Canada retain a healthy, globally competitive
financial services industry worthy of a leading economic nation,"
they noted.
</P>
<P>
With the combined market capitalization of 38 billion Canadian
dollars (26.2 billion U.S. dollars), the new bank would rank in
the top 10 in North America and the top 25 in the world.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, shareholders of the Royal
Bank will receive one common share of the new bank for each common
share held, while the Bank of Montreal shareholders will receive
0.97 of a common share of the merged entity for each common share
held.
</P>
<P>
This would result in Bank of Montreal shareholders owning 45.1
percent of the new bank, with Royal Bank shareholders owning 54.9
percent.

<HEADLINE> UK Miners' Historic Win May Cost Govt Huge Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Six ex-miners won a legal battle
on Friday to prove their chest diseases were caused by coal dust
-- leaving the government with a 1 billion-pound (1.6 billion U.S.
dollar) bill.
</P>
<P>
Six out of eight retired miners who brought a test case in
London's High Court against their former employers, the
nationalized company British Coal, were awarded initial
compensation of between 2,400 and 9,000 pounds (4,000 and 11,000
dollars). Two failed because of lack of medical evidence.
</P>
<P>
The cases will set a precedent for another 162 claims already
lodged and thousands of others to be processed.
</P>
<P>
The judgement could lead to the largest damage payout ever seen
in the UK of well over 1 billion pounds altogether.
</P>
<P>
Legal action in the current cases began in 1990, but
compensation claims could date back to 1947 when the coal industry
was nationalized.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers believe thousands of miners were exposed to excessive
levels of coal dust, many developing chronic chest conditions such
as bronchitis and emphysema.
</P>
<P>
"This is legal history. It will lead to the highest
compensation bill ever for a single British employer running into
hundreds of millions of pounds (dollars)," Tom Jones, a lawyer who
represented one of the men, said.
</P>
<P>
British Coal, once the largest employer in Europe with a
million miners, ceased to exist when Britain's then Conservative
government privatized the coal industry in 1994. Any compensation
bill would be picked up by the government's Department of Trade
and Industry.

<P>
OTTAWA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Canada's retail sales dropped
1.2 percent in November to 19.5 billion dollars (13.4 billion
USD), following a modest increase in October, Statistics Canada
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The decline was broadly based across almost all retail sectors
and all provinces," the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
A number of possible factors may be responsible for the drop.
Some retailers suggested that the winter weather played a role in
consumers putting off spending.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the interest rates, the weakening of the
Canadian dollar and turbulence in stock markets may have also
contributed to the drop.
</P>
<P>
Canada's retail sales have generally been rising since early
1996, strong advances were posted from the fall of 1996 to the
fall of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pakistan Tries to Achieve Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 23 (Xinhua) -- To get the nation out of a
persisting food crisis and achieve food self-sufficiency as soon
as possible, the Pakistani government has been providing new
impetus to agriculture, which accounts for about 25 percent of the
country's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has announced
some new agricultural policies since it came to power in February
last year, under which import tariff on plants and machinery meant
for agricultural use is removed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, land for agricultural use will be leased to foreign
companies for 30 years, extendable for a further period of 20
years. And no ceiling has been imposed on land for registered
agricultural companies.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to encourage farmers to improve the output of
various crops, the government will increase support prices for
agricultural products and secure easy and enhanced supply of
credit, availability of better-quality seeds and adequate supply
of fertilizers and unadulterated pesticides.
</P>
<P>
Supply of water for irrigation will also be improved and funds
for farming machines and extension services will be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
As an agricultural country, Pakistan was food self-sufficient
in the 1980s and was even called "the barn of South Asia."
However, the performance of its agriculture has been disappointing
in the past few years and the country now has to import food every
year to meet domestic needs.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996-97 fiscal year, Pakistan's economy declined to
the lowest level in its history and agriculture was the
worst-affected sector, which recorded a growth rate of less than 1
percent compared with 5.3 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The low growth rate of agriculture was the result of a
4.5-percent decline in the production of all major crops except
rice, which fortunately reached a record level of 4.31 million
tons as against 3.96 million tons a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Shortage of food items like flour and sugar occurred during
1996-97, due partly to a sizable decline in their production and
partly to the failure of the authorities concerned to foresee the
situation and thus avert it by arranging adequate stock.
</P>
<P>
In the current season, the sowing of wheat has been delayed due
to lack of planning by the authorities concerned in some flood-
and rain-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
But the government is still expecting a bumper harvest as the
area under wheat has increased this year by 28,329 hectares to
623,229 hectares thanks to the provision of credits to small
farmers by the government.
</P>
<P>
Even if the wheat harvest in 1998 reaches the projected 19
million tons, the country will still have to import about 3
million tons at a cost of about 500 million dollars to meet
demand. And the government has approved the import of 4 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the production of rice looks promising and is
expected to be around 4.6 million tons.
</P>
<P>
For the last 10 years, Pakistan has been importing more and
more wheat, from 600,000 tons in 1987-88 to 4 million tons in
1996-97.
</P>
<P>
According to Sattar Lalika, minister for food and agriculture,
the Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan has disbursed 9.057
billion rupees (about 206 million U.S. dollars) to farmers in the
first half of the current fiscal year starting from July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In compliance with the instruction of Prime Minister Sharif to
"grow more wheat," the bank has reportedly drawn up a credit plan
to help farmers maximize wheat production.
</P>
<P>
Declaring the year of 1998 as the "wheat year," the Pakistani
government is striving to achieve food self-sufficiency next year.

LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Nine people were arrested by
Northern Irish police on Friday for alleged involvement in recent
killings in the British divided province.
</P>
<P>
Six people detained in south Belfast and the other three were
being questioned about a murder attempt on a Roman Catholic man
who was seriously wounded as he left work in north Belfast on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Eight men, six Catholic Romans and two loyalist Protestants,
have been killed in an upsurge of sectarian revenge attacks since
an extremist Protestant guerrilla group leader was gunned down on
December 27 in the Maze prison in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The widespread killings have since plunged the fragile Northern
Ireland peace process into crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local reports said a "significant" quantity of
explosives were found at a house in loyalist Shankill Road in
south Belfast. A man was arrested for the storage of the
explosives.

<HEADLINE> Rival Cypriots Exchange Info on Missing Persons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot representatives on the divided Cyprus island met here
Friday to exchange information on the location of graves of
missing persons.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. auspices, the meeting between Greek Cypriot
representative Takis Christofpoulos and Turkish Cypriot
representative Rustem Tatar took place at the Ledra Palace Hotel
situated in the U.N.-controlled buffer zone in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time the two sides exchanged information on
missing persons in a bid to make headway in resolving this
humanitarian issue, which constitutes a main aspect of the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement to reporters after the 45-minute-long
meeting, U.N. Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave Feissel
said the meeting is the implementation of an agreement signed on
July 31, 1997 by Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulates that "the two leaders agree to
provide each other immediately and simultaneously all information
already at their disposal on the location of graves of Greek
Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot missing persons."
</P>
<P>
Feissel also noted that the two sides "agreed to meet again
soon to discuss the preparation of arrangements leading to the
return of the remains of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot
missing persons in question."
</P>
<P>
Christopoulos described the meeting as "important" as it is
the beginning of the implementation of the July agreement.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Tatar said "I think both sides are sincere and we
will proceed."
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Greek Cypriot side handed over
information on 200 Turkish Cypriots missing cases and the Turkish
Cypriot side disclosed information about 400 missing Greek
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
Turkish Cypriot-nominated north since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island following a
failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,619 Greek Cypriots and Greeks were listed as
missing after the 1974 Turkish invasion. The Turkish Cypriot side
listed some 500 as missing since communal clashes erupted on the
island in 1963.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends to Extend Mandate of UNIFIL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today recommended to extend the mandate of the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for a further period of
six months until July 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said during the
past six months, the situation in southern Lebanon remained
volatile and continued to give cause for serious concern.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said the level of hostilities rose and
the increase in the number of civilians who were killed or
injuried is particularly worrisome.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said UNIFIL had obtained a commitment from the
Israel Defense forces to respect the safety zones around UNIFIL
positions and received assurances from the Islamic resistance
that they would not operate in the vicinity of UNIFIL positions.
Nevertheless, there were also cases in which armed elements
conducted operations in the vicinity of United Nations positions.
</P>
<P>
Annan said UNIFIL has continued its efforts to limit the
conflict and to protect the inhabitants form fighting. Its
contribution to the stability and the protection it is able to
afford the population of the area remain important.
</P>
<P>
He, therefore, recommended that the Security Council extend
the mandate of UNIFIl for another period of six months.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL, which was established in 1978, is aimed to monitor
Israel's troops withdrawal from southern Lebanon and restore
Lebanon's control over the area.

<HEADLINE> Situation Returns to Normal in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Situation in Harare city center
returned to normal today following three-days of food riots that
disrupted business in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The city was calm with most commercial enterprises which
include banks and shops operating as usual.
</P>
<P>
However, the police still maintained a huge presence at
strategic points and sites which were looted during the riots
that went on from Monday to Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The riots were sparked by recent price hikes of commodities by
an average 20 percent. The International Socialist Organization
claimed to be behind the riots.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government said in a statement on Friday that
there had been no deaths or shootings since the deployment of
soldiers to help police restore law and order.
</P>
<P>
A weekly "Independent" paper said the riots claimed eight
lives.
</P>
<P>
The government said the deployment of soldiers and police in
areas affected by riots had helped bring back the situation to
normal.
</P>
<P>
Most shops, schools, colleges and businesses in the capital
which had closed during the riots were now open as a result of
the security measures, it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, " Anyone receiving threats to close
business should remain calm, continue operating and report such
threats to the police in their areas. The defense forces will
remain deployed until the situation normalizes to their
satisfaction." The statement said 2,300 arrests had so far been
made.

Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert Friday morning. He said tenders would
be issued without delay to begin building about 6,500 housing
units in Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently trying to allay mounting concerns by
right-wing hardliners who fear that the government would stop the
Har Homa construction under strong U.S. pressure.
</P>
<P>
The controversial Har Homa project last March sparked
widespread protests and condemnation from the Palestinians and the
Arab world, virtually bringing the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process to a halt.
</P>
<P>
Following almost one-year non-stop building, workers have
completed the first-stage construction of infrastructure work,
paving roads and laying pipelines. But tenders have not been
issued for beginning the genuine construction of the housing
units.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has been pressuring Israel to have a
"time-out" the work in Har Homa and other settlements as a
goodwill gesture to the Palestinians in a bid to advancing the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
A group of rightist activists recently tried to bring a convoy
of construction vehicles to the site in Har Homa to demand for
accelerating the work. After being prevented from reaching the
site, they have been planning to gather several hundred supporters
for another major demonstration later this month.

<HEADLINE> Leaders of CBSS Adhere to Regional Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The heads of the governments
from 11 nations in the Council of Baltic Sea States (CBSS) today
ended the two-day second summit with a declaration, the Interfax
news agency reported from Riga, Latvia, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration the prime ministers confirmed their
adherence to regional cooperation, thinking that will enhance the
formation of a stable, democratic and prosperous Europe without
dividing lines.
</P>
<P>
The declaration says they welcomed the Luxembourg meeting of
the European Union which had made a decision to start the
preparations for the inclusion of Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and
Estonia, as well as the coming into force of a Partnership and
Cooperation Agreement between Russia and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The declaration emphasized the importance of fighting organized
crime and illegal migration and called for the signing of
appropriate agreements between countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
The conference of the Council supports the early joining of
Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and Estonia to the World Trade
Organization, regarding it as an important contribution to
economic cooperation and attraction of new investments in the
region, the declaration says.
</P>
<P>
The 11 prime ministers called on the Council to keep the member
nations posted on the expansion of the European Union and on
cooperation with Russia.
</P>
<P>
The leaders emphasized the need to cooperate with Poland,
Russia and the former Soviet republics on the southern Baltic
coast in planning regional cooperation projects.

<HEADLINE> Israel Blasts Arafat's Letter on Covenant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel blasted Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat Friday for playing "tactic" by presenting
U.S. President Bill Clinton a letter assuring that the
Palestinian Covenant has been revised.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who is in Washington for meetings with Clinton, gave
the letter to the U.S. president on Thursday, specifying the
provisions of the charter calling for Israel's destruction have
been annulled by the Palestinian National Council in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, media adviser to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, said the letter was not enough, adding the
Palestinian side in fact has not genuinely revised the charter,
because only the convening of the Palestinian National Council
could do it.
</P>
<P>
"The letter presented by Chairman Arafat to President Clinton
about the Palestinian Covenant is, I'm afraid, another exercise
of evasion," Bar-Illan said in an interview with Israeli state
television Channel I.
</P>
<P>
"The only way the Palestinian Covenant can be repealed or
changed is through convening of the Palestinian National Council,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel is not asking the Palestinian side to draft
a new charter but only to remove the articles calling for
destroying Israel. Israel has been listing the revision of
Palestinian Covenant as a precondition for carrying out the
long-delayed second redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Britain, which is holding the rotating president of the
European Union, on Friday expressed support to the Palestinian
side by attacking Israel for creating new hurdle to the peace
process on the covenant issue.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett said in London
that Britain regarded Arafat's assurance was sufficient, judging
by the letter on the covenant sent to British Prime Minister Tony
Blair recently by Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett, who visited Israel and the Palestinian self-rule
territories last week, said it was not sensible for Israel to keep
making demand on the covenant issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, commenting on Netanyahu's meetings with Clinton in
Washington this week, Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said
the U.S. has not changed its position that it is up to Israel to
define the scope of further redeployments.
</P>
<P>
He said Netanyahu has presented Clinton with Israeli positions
that further redeployment would only be carried out without
harming Israeli national interests and on condition that the
Palestinian side fulfills its commitments.

<HEADLINE> Price Slide Spells Pain for Oil Producers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Abu Dhabi, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The slide in world oil prices
could spark a financial crisis for many members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which have
based their budgets on higher prices.
</P>
<P>
According to an economic newsletter here Friday, oil producers
"will have to come to grips with the unpleasant prospect that the
current oil price slide could, in the absence of prompt action to
restrain supply, turn into something a good deal more serious than
a temporary downturn."
</P>
<P>
The Middle East Economic Survey said "if that were to be the
case, the financial pain of such an eventuality would well be
traumatic."
</P>
<P>
Since reaching a high point of around 21 U.S. dollars a barrel
in October last year, world oil prices have tumbled to some 15
dollars a barrel this month.
</P>
<P>
"At these levels, prices are well below the reference oil
values employed for the 1998 budgets of a number of key OPEC
countries which are likely to find themselves in a grave financial
trouble if the present situation persists or deteriorates," said
the newsletter.
</P>
<P>
It cited the Iranian budget, which was based on an assumed oil
price of 17.50 dollars a barrel and forecast an estimated total
revenue of 17.46 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iran has now cut its oil price base to 16 dollars a barrel, the
newsletter said. The level was still higher than current prices for
Iranian crude.
</P>
<P>
The newsletter said it appeared that OPEC had "probably
overstepped the mark" with its November decision to raise the
output ceiling to 27.5 million barrels per day (bpd) from 25.03
million bpd.
</P>
<P>
The decision had failed to curb output from those producing
above their quotas and unleashed additional volume from those who
had been producing below quota but had spare capacity to meet the
new levels, the newsletter added.

"We attach great importance to the forthcoming technical

<HEADLINE> Trial of S. African Ex-President Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The trial of former South
African president P. W. Botha for his failure to testify before
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) has been postponed
to February 23.
</P>
<P>
About 400 African National Congress (ANC) demonstrators and
some 20 supporters of Botha gathered outside the George Regional
Court in Western Cape this morning when the 82-year-old former
National Party (NP) leader arrived for court hearing.
</P>
<P>
Botha was summoned to appear in court earlier this month for
ignoring a third subpoena from the TRC last month to appear in
its hearing on former State Security Council, of which Botha was
in charge in height of the Apartheid.
</P>
<P>
After a brief court hearing of only 22 minutes, Botha told a
press conference that he stood by all those who had executed
"lawful commands" from the former government led by him in its
struggle against the "revolutionary communist onslaught against
our country".
</P>
<P>
During his 11 years in power, as prime minister from 1978 to
1984 and then state president until 1989, Botha enacted emergency
laws to crack down on anti-apartheid groups.
</P>
<P>
He said the TRC seems to have "ignored and forgotten" that
"onslaught", which was conducted "in all avenues of life and
consisted of the most violent acts against the civilians of our
country".
</P>
<P>
He said he was not prepared to apologize for his government's
"lawful actions" to curb the "violent onslaught".
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the white-based parties, the Freedom Front and the
Conservative Party, and some members of the former NP cabinet
were present in the court.
</P>
<P>
If Botha pleads not guilty in the February 23 hearing, the
case will go to trial on April 14.

JOHANNESBURG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Namibia and Botswana have
failed to reach an agreement on Botswanan troops' withdrawal from
a disputed island in the Caprivi region, sources reaching here
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, a meeting of the Namibia-Botswana Joint Commission,
established for settlement of the border dispute, has proposed
that the two countries set up a joint technical body to look into
the demarcation of boundaries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting at Katima Mulilo, provincial capital of Namibia's
northeastern province of Caprivi, agreed that the technical body
would be set up in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
It was also agreed that Namibian villagers cultivating fields
on Situngu Island be allowed to continue, irrespective of the
technical body, the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
Botswana Minister of Presidential Affairs, Ponatshego
Kedikilwe, assured farmers on the island that Botswana troops
will not harass them.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Botswana soldiers had occupied Situngo
Island and had harassed Namibian farmers who had crops planted
there.
</P>
<P>
Last week the Namibian government urged people of the country
to "remain calm and refrain from taking unwise steps" before the
Situngu Island dispute with Botswana was resolved.

<HEADLINE> UAE Expects 5.5 Percent GDP Growth in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) planning minister expected the country's 1998 gross domestic
product growth at about 5.5 percent due to its increased oil
output.
</P>
<P>
According to local press Friday, Sheikh Humaid bin Ahmad al
Mualla said "I project the 5.5 percent growth rate in 1998 on the
back of our increased oil production under the new OPEC
(Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) ceiling."
</P>
<P>
UAE was allocated a 2.336 million barrels per day (bpd)
production quota at the Jakarta OPEC meeting in December from a
previous 2.161 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
The new UAE quota was part of an overall increase in OPEC's
production with its ceiling now topping 27.5 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
The new ceiling triggered a price crisis in wold oil
market. This month prices tumbled by 3 dollars to around 15
dollars a barrel, the lowest level since mid-1994.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Humaid said he expected things to change in next few
months "as a result of increased oil sales despite the current
signs of weakness."

MOSCOW, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin had tete-a-tete talks in Riga with German Federal
Chancellor Helmut Kohl Thursday night on economic problems, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported Friday from Riga, Latvia.
</P>
<P>
Both the leaders are staying in Latvia to attend the second
meeting of the Council of Baltic Sea States (CBSS), which ended on

</P>
<P>
At the meeting they focused on the Russian cooperation with the
European Union and the existent limits on the Russian goods access
to Western markets.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin expressed hope that the EU commission will
recognize Russia as a country with the market economy at its
meeting of January 26, and that will enable Russia to become a
member of the World Trade Organization quicker.
</P>
<P>
The Russian premier said "Germany is our leading partner in
Europe. It is a partner that has been working on our market for
long and is carrying out major projects in Russia."
</P>
<P>
On the recently signed U.S.- Baltic Partnership Charter
Chernomyrdin said "it is the business of the Baltic countries what

</P>
<P>
He meanwhile mentioned that the three Baltic states refused to
accept the Russian security guarantee proposal, saying Russia will

<HEADLINE> Arafat Dismiss Israeli Withdrawal Offer as "Peanuts" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasir
Arafat on Friday blasted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's very limited pullback from the West Bank, describing
it as unacceptable peanuts.
</P>
<P>
"What he is offering is peanuts. It cannot be accepted," Arafat
told a news conference before he leaves Washington after winding
up talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu offered a very modest pullback during his talks with
Clinton on Tuesday and it was said the size he agreed to cede to
the Palestinians was under 10 percent of the occupied land of the
West Bank. And even this unsignificant withdrawal he said would
not be carried out until he was satisfied with security measures
to be taken by the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat demanded that 60 percent of the territories should
be turned over by the Israelis, apart from 27 percent already
under the control of the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
When asked about two sessions of talks with Clinton, Arafat
said they were "successful, important and positive." He also
thanked Clinton for his mediation efforts and said he hoped to
"break the deadlock" of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is trying to revitalize the stymied
peace process in the Middle East, telling the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders that "we need some results soon."
</P>
<P>
The next move probably will be talks in Europe between
Netanyahu and Arafat brokered by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright. And at that trilateral meeting, Albright would again try
to convince the Israeli and Palestinian leader to accept a Clinton
formula for the settlement of differences between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Albright said on Thursday at a news conference that Clinton had
decided on a strategy of urging a phased Israeli troop withdrawal
timed to Palestinian actions against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"We've introduced the concept of parallel processes of
implementation of these commitments," she told reporters.

Fiat Auto S.P.A. said Friday it would invest more than 250
million Rand (50 million U.S. Dollars) in the production of Fiat
cars in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a media briefing here, Fiat Auto S.P.A. president
and chief executive Roberto Testore expressed confidence that his
company was going to hold its own in a market be-deviled by a
subdued performance.
</P>
<P>
Fiat sold 8,000 units in 1997 and a similar performance was
expected this year.
</P>
<P>
Fiat Uno is the group's best known model in South Africa at
present.
</P>
<P>
The group also manufactures Iveco commercial vehicles and the
new Holland tractors which take up more than 40 percent of the
market share in the tractor business.
</P>
<P>
"We will spend most of 1998 preparing for the launch of the
Fiat Palio and the Alfa 156. I have the confidence that the car
will do well judging by the reception we got on the other Fiat
models," Testore said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Expects Details on Plane Grounded in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has been
trying to get full details about a South African cargo aircraft
forced down in Angola for days, foreign affairs spokesman Marco
Boni said in Pretoria Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has been officially communicated to us. Our
ambassador, Richard Mampane, is still in the process of
ascertaining the exact details of the incident," Boni said.
</P>
<P>
Angolan military sources were on Thursday quoted as saying
that a DC-4 plane carrying mining equipment and other freight
from South Africa to central Angola's Andulo, one of the two
headquarters of the rebel forces -- the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The aircraft was forced down by an Angolan Mig-fighter in the
southern Angolan town of Menongue, and eight South Africans on
board were being held in a military camp.
</P>
<P>
They said the privately owned plane contravened a travel and
air ban the United Nations imposed on UNITA Last year for
violating a peace accord that ended 19 years of civil war in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
Boni said he could not confirm reports that eight South
Africans were aboard, but he noted that people ignoring the U.N.
ban would have to face th Angolan legal process.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the first time that we have issued this kind of
warning," he said.

PARIS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were killed and six
missing in an avalanche which came down on 32 people, including 26
children, Friday in Orres in the Alpes mountains in eastern
France, local television and press media reported.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers found 26 people by 18:00 local time (17:00 GMT),
including the seven dead, and are looking for the six still
missing, the reports quoted the prefectural government of
Hautes-Alpes as saying.

<P>
A group of 40 people left for the mountains in the daytime on a
sport class, but eight of them lost the group and thus escaped the
avalanche, said Agence France-Presse.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Qatar's Economy Records Dynamic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Qatar's gross domestic
product in 1997 was estimated to grow by 15.5 percent to reach
some 10.8 billion U.S. dollars, compared with 9.1 billion dollars
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
A report of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) obtained here
Friday attributed the increase to a sharp rise in the country's
oil production.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, Qatar was allocated an oil output quota of 378,000
barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
But the IMF estimated Qatar's real oil production at 590,000
barrels per day in 1997. The rise in oil production, together with
last year's high oil prices which averaged 19.03 dollars a barrel,
earned the country an extra 1.3 billion dollars in revenue.

<HEADLINE> Kagame's proposal to End Prisons' Burden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Vice-president, Major
General paul Kagame has come up with a proposal to solve the
burden imposed on the government by the big number of genocide
suspects crammed in the country's prisons.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the Rwandan community in Belgium Wednesday,
Kagame who doubles as Defense Minister, said it is a challenging
task for the government to continue to feed genocide suspects, a
report from the Rwandan News Agency in Kigali sent to Xinhua here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Rwandan prisons accommodate over 100,000 genocide suspects
today," Kagame pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"On them, we cannot continue to shoulder this burden and
organizations assisting us are getting wary," he emphasised.
</P>
<P>
The personal proposal to urgently get out of this crisis put
forth by General Kagame would be to identify notorious criminals,
the masterminds, and to trial and execute them in public.
</P>
<P>
The criminals of the second category, notably the executioners
of the plan of extermination of Tutsis, would be also identified
and confined to an area where they can be subjected to public
works.
</P>
<P>
Other criminals, including those who were instigated to commit
massacres would be handed to traditional courts that would handle
their cases.
</P>
<P>
This proposal will be submitted to Rwandans for a popular
prescript, he underscored, but did not say when.

<HEADLINE> French Extreme-Right Promotes Selective Family Aid Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The French extreme-right National
Front (FN) party is promoting a selective family aid policy by
creating an aid exclusively for French and European families with
new-born babies in an FN-administered city.
</P>
<P>
The FN decision is immediately condemned by government,
non-governmental groups and both left and right politicians as a
"discriminatory" measure aimed at luring votes in the
forthcoming regional and cantonal elections to be held in March.
</P>
<P>
A free-masons group Friday said the FN decision is
unconstitutional and violates the rule of the European Union,
while the Minister of Justice Martine Aubry called it "shocking"
and "shameful."
</P>
<P>
Calling the policy as one of "national preference," the FN
announced on Thursday that the southern city of Vitrolles will
provide the families with new born-babies but having at least one
French or western European father or mother 5,000 francs (830 U.S.
dollars) of family aid.
</P>
<P>
Vitrolles is run by Catherine Bruno, an FN politician, whose
husband is the number two of the party Megret Bruno.
</P>
<P>
The FN also proposed Friday to extend the policy to the Central
region of France, if FN candidates are elected in regional
elections there.
</P>
<P>
The FN president Jean-Marie Le Pen said Friday that he has long
hoped that the policy should be adopted by FN-run cities, and said
that it is based on the principle of his party that French money
should be used for French families.
</P>
<P>
"It is the French families who need to have many children, not
foreign families," he said.

<HEADLINE> African Self-Reliance Urged in Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ARUSHA, Tanzania, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime
Minister Fredrich Sumaye today urged African countries to enhance
their capability to prevent and resolve conflicts instead of
waiting for outside interference.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye was speaking on behalf of President Benjamin Mkapa at
the closing here of an international workshop on African Conflict
resolution.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of present conflicts on our continent are
essentially of our own making -- whether internally within one
country, or across African borders. Hence their solution will be
realized to a large extent by focusing on the domestic or
regional scene," said Sumaye.
</P>
<P>
"Africans cannot today abdicate responsibility for the
conflicts in or between their countries," the prime minister
noted.
</P>
<P>
"Today very few conflicts can fully and justifiably be
explained in terms of extra Africa interference in African
affairs. And after 40 years of independence, we can only have
ourselves to blame if we continue to be influenced by the legacy
of colonialism."
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said peace initiatives undertaken by African bodies
like the Organization of African Unity have been successful at
various levels.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, what is really important is the fact that at
last Africa is taking charge and responsibility for its conflicts
and their resolution.
</P>
<P>
He called for regional solutions and mechanism for conflict
prevention, management and resolution.
</P>
<P>
"Finding regional solutions to regional conflicts is an
especially important strategy in dealing with African conflicts.
At the regional level we understand each other better -- sharing,
as we do history, cultural values and temperaments.
</P>
<P>
"It is easier for regional leaders to sit down together and
hammer out solutions anchored in the region and supported by our
continental body and the international community at large," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that such solutions should not infringe upon
the territorial integrity of a country or countries involved in a
conflict.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized a concerted regional stance on regional
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"In addition there is the question of developing the capacity
to monitor, evaluate and coordinate the implementation of agreed
solutions to regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"This remains a great weakness."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister called for the elimination of
"misconceptions" of rights and duties of individual citizenry or
of individual nations.
</P>
<P>
"There are cases where one ethnic group thinks it has the
right -- even birth right -- to rule because of reasons of
history or of numerical size," he said, apparently referring to
the tribal clashes in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
"This of course, is not the essence of liberty and such people
need to be disabused of these notions."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that many conflicts in Africa arose out of
these misconceptions or misplaced expectations and called for
good governance and the establishment of democracy in African
countries.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the causes of conflicts were multi-faceted
but the most important cause is the pursuit of social, political
and economic ambitions through unfair means.
</P>
<P>
"We often attribute conflicts to ethnic, racial, historical,
religious, economic and cultural factors. But these factors,
causative as they may appear, do not sufficiently explain why
some conflicts are more intractable than others, or why they
occur in some places and not in others.
</P>
<P>
"Not infrequently these factors are used only as smoke-screens
behind which socio-political and economic ambitions are pursued
often in the most undemocratic and unacceptable manner."
</P>
<P>
The three-day workshop, which was joinly organized by the
Tanzanian Foreign Ministry and the Mwalimu Nyerere Foundation,
attracted some 200 diplomats, peace-makers, scholars, and
officials from international and regional organizations and
non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The participants exchanged experiences and lessons in conflict
mediation and discussed the role of civil society and women in
peace-making processes.

<HEADLINE> Oman Launches Campaign Against Expatriate Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Oman has begun to implement a
program to increase the size of indigenous workforce in 1998, the
Omani news agency monitored here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Omanization campaign was launched earlier this month under
Oman's Sultan Qaboos Bin Said's order of providing employment to
at least one member of each Omani household, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Oman's new Minister of Social Affair and Labor Sheikh Amrer bin
Shuwain al Hosni said his ministry had "immediately started
implementing the royal directive" with priority for jobs being
given to member of Omani families receiving social security
benefits.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry has issued new rules and procedures
permitting the recruitment of foreign labor only for companies
involved in trading and contracting.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Amrer said the aim of the campaign, which was considered
too aggressive by some economic experts, was to limit expatriate
labor strictly to the requirements of the labor markets.
</P>
<P>
Private sector was the first to be involved in the campaign.
Sheikh Amrer said the Omani government wants to increase the
number of Omanis in the private sector to 350,000 by the year 2000
from the current 250,000.
</P>
<P>
Oman currently employed 500,000 foreigners in government and
private sectors.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said before the launch of the move that Oman has
warned illegal foreign workers to leave by March 31 or face
penalties.
</P>
<P>
Oman is the sixth and the last Gulf Arab state to deport
illegal expatriate workers. The United Arab Emirates led the
expulsion campaign in the region in 1994 and was followed by Saudi
Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The campaign to flush out illegal foreign labors was prompted
by a high unemployment rate among the six Gulf Arab states, which
was estimated at more than 15 percent.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Denies Involvement in Violating Angolan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
Friday denies any involvement in the January 20 incident which
has violated Angola's air space.
</P>
<P>
A South African private airplane was forced down Tuesday near
Menongue, a city in southwestern Angola by the Angolan air force
for transporting cargo for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Reddy Manpane, South African ambassador in Angola, read to the
press here Friday the declaration by its government, which
expresses its worries over the incident which has violated the
U.N. Security Council resolution to impose air embargo on UNITA,
pledging its support for the resolution made for peace in Angola.
</P>
<P>
According to the declaration, the South African government
will take stricter measures to safeguard the implementation of
the U.N. resolution, adding that such incidents should be
seriously dealt with by both the United Nations and countries in
the region.
</P>
<P>
With regard to whether South Africa could exert control on its
private aviation companies, Manpane said it is difficult to
control all the planes since there are altogether 263 airports in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Some of the planes apply to fly to Botswana, but turn out to
end in Angola or the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is
difficult to manage, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Manpane believed that all planes violating Angola's space must
be punished and that the eight people detained on the plane
should be responsible for their crime.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigation show that the DC-4 plane is a
private South African plane grounded on its way to the central
Angolan city of Ondulo to transport cargos for the former rebel
movement UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the eight people on board are from South Africa, the
other one is from Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
Currently the case is under investigation by Angola's Ministry
of Internal Affairs.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Muslims Celebrate Jerusalem Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Lebanese Muslims
across the country Friday turned out for rallies to celebrate the
annual Jerusalem Day, the official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The day, which falls on the last Friday of Muslim's fasting
season of Ramadan each year, was initiated by late Iranian
spiritual leader Ayatollah Khomeini to voice support for the
Palestinian struggle against Israeli occupation of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem, a city holy to Christians, Jews and Muslems, is at
the center of disputes between Israel and the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, general secretary of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, warned at a mass rally
in Beirut's southern suburbs that Israel is attempting to build a
big Jerusalem and judaize it.
</P>
<P>
"Israelis have been working on judaization of Jerusalem since
the first day when it was invaded by them. Over the past two
years, or since the conclusion of the Oslo accord, Israelis have
seized 36,500 square meters around the holy city in an attempt to
build a big Jerusalem," he said.
</P>
<P>
He accused Israel of trying to separate and isolate the city
from all Palestinian cities in the West Bank from the north to the
south and intensify efforts to build Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Saying the reason for that is the halt of Palestinian's
rebellion, he criticized Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for
"surrendering to the Israelis."
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah is spearheading a guerilla war against the
Israeli occupation troops and trying to oust them from south
Lebanon. It has always been against any peace-making with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Besides Beirut, Muslims in Lebanon's other cities, such as
southern port city of Tyre and eastern area Belbek, also took part
in the celebrations.

MAPUTO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A Mozambican minister said
Friday it takes 17 to 30.4 billion US Dollars for the SADC
countries to restore and expand national and regional telecom
network in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Paulo Muxanga, Mozambican Minister of Transport and
Communications, made the statement here at a meeting of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) ministers of
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
According to Muxanga, it takes 14.4 billion Dollars to
increase regional telephone rate from the present 3.5 percent to
9.4 percent; and 25.2 billion Dollars to reach 14 percent. The
estimate does not count in Seychelles and the Democratic Republic
of Congo which were recently admitted.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the world's average telephone rate is 12.5 for
per 100 persons.
</P>
<P>
The minister cited the lack of fund and professionals as the
cause for slow development in the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
Muxanga called for more investment in the industry and the
participation of private sectors in the investment.
</P>
<P>
Friday's meeting focused on issues such as fiber cable system,
national policy on telecommunications and regional strategic
cooperations.

<HEADLINE> Football Referee May Be Wrong Sometimes: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Criticisms of football referees'
eyesight by fans may contain a grain of scientific truth
sometimes, according to a study published today.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from Spain have discovered that because of the way
the eye focuses, the eye of the assistant referee, formerly known
as the linesman, sometimes cannot keep pace with the feet of a
footballer.
</P>
<P>
Dr Jaime Sanabria and his colleagues, from the Fundacion
Jimenez Diaz in Madrid, looked at the problem with the help of a
referee from the Spanish Royal Football Federation.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the medical journal Lancet, they said that the
assistant referee has "an erroneous image of the initial positions
of the players at the exact moment the pass of the ball began."
</P>
<P>
The off-side rule requires the assistant referee to judge where
the attacker was at the exact moment when the ball was passed to
him by one of his own side.
</P>
<P>
But researchers found that eye takes 250-300 milliseconds to
focus an image on the tiny spot in the center of retina known as
the fovea which "sees" best.
</P>
<P>
In that time, an attacker and defender who started in the same
horizontal line on the pitch can be as much as 4.5 meters apart.
</P>
<P>
The result is that the referee will "see" an attacker and
defender running apart when, in fact, they are level.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Set to Fight Dynamite Fishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
is planning a fresh attack on illegal fishing with explosives in
Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism, Zakia Meghji,
said her ministry is investigating allegations that blast sounds
are heard by residents between 8 am and 2 pm every day in the
Magogoni Ferry and Mji Mwema of the city here, according to a
report from the Guard paper.
</P>
<P>
Meghiji said dynamite fishing is prohibited in the Indian
Ocean and all lakes of the country. A campaign to battle dynamite
fishing since July 1 last year has been going on well.
</P>
<P>
For example, she said, dynamite fishing in the Kunduchi area
in Dar es Salaam, which also scared tourists, has been put under

<P>
Between July and November last year, the Tanzanian police and
Tanzania People's Defense Forces (TPDF) arrested 102 suspects and
impounded seven tons of fish in Dar es Salaam, Coast and Tanga
regions. During the crackdown, 45 gas cylinders, three outboard
engine boats and 10 canoes were confiscated.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the newspaper that 23 million shillings
(about 36,000 U.S. Dollars) have been put aside for the ministry
and the TPDF to battle dynamite fishing specially.
</P>
<P>
Meghji, however, said that lack of modern facilities such as
patrol boats have weakened the campaign. The ministry is looking
into the possibility of acquiring a modern boat, she added.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky's Attorney Criticizes Investigator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky's attorney said today U.S. independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's investigation of his client "squeezed" Lewinsky to
get information about her alleged sexual affair with President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the way the investigation has been conducted,"
William Ginsburg told ABC's "Good Morning America." "Repeatedly
during discussions with the office of the prosecutor we have been
squeezed."
</P>
<P>
"They've even made threats to involve her parents who, as far
as I know, know nothing about the situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ginsburg's criticism came a day after Starr defended
controversial techniques used in the case, reported to have
included hidden devices to record a conversation Lewinsky had with
Linda Tripp, her former colleague in whom she had confided.
</P>
<P>
Ginsburg complained about Starr's method for questioning
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
"Right off the bat we talk about stings and wires and traps,"
Ginsburg said. "I'm not happy with that at all, especially when
you're dealing with a 24-year-old girl. It's not nice."
</P>
<P>
He said Starr, apparently after receiving tapes of Tripp's wire
conversations with Lewinsky, "lured" his client to a hotel in
Northern Virginia and questioned her for hours without an attorney
being present.
</P>
<P>
"That should frighten anyone who is involved in the process
here in America.... That's very, very sad, isn't it? They did not
give her permission to call her attorney and I wasn't there."
</P>
<P>
Ginsburg also called on Starr to allow him to listen to the
tapes of the conversation between his client and Tripp.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard those tapes, I don't have the information that
the press has. I have heard quotes from the tapes. I wonder why
the office of the independent counsel won't let me listen to the
tapes and comment on them?"
</P>
<P>
Ginsburg, citing attorney-client confidentiality, would not
comment directly on whether or not Lewinsky had a sexual affair
with Clinton as has been alleged.
</P>
<P>
Ginsburg said Lewinsky and Clinton had, as far as he knew, only
a working relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
He also denied comment on reports that Clinton's friend Vernon
Jordan tried to get Lewinsky to lie about the alleged affair that
was said to have begun in 1995 when she was 21.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky was originally scheduled to give a deposition today in
the Paula Jones sexual harassment case against the president, but
U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright postponed it indefinitely
late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky's attorney had indicated earlier that he would seek to
postpone his client's deposition. Lewinsky previously submitted an
affidavit in the case and denied any affair with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
USA Today reported today that Lewinsky said in her affidavit,
"I have the utmost respect for the president, who always behaved
appropriately in my presence. I have never had a sexual
relationship with the president."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday Clinton continued to deny allegations of an affair,
saying, "The allegations are false, and I would never ask anybody
to do anything other than tell the truth."

<HEADLINE> US: Iraq's Position on Arms Inspection Unacceptable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's position on the
issue of the arms inspection is unacceptable, Bill Richardson,
ambassador of the United States to the United Nations, said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Richardson made the remarks after Richard Butler, the executive
chairman of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in
charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, briefed
the Security Council on his latest visit to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The report is deeply disturbing, deeply negative and
unacceptable. The United States feels very strongly that there
should be full and unfetered access to all sites," Richardson told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq's response can be described in one word: `defiance,'
defiance of the Security Council's resolutions, defiance of UN
arms teams and defiance of the international community. Thus we
find it unacceptable," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the next few days, we will consult with our allies on the
next steps. We want to resolve the issues diplomatically, but we
will not rule any option out," he added.
</P>
<P>
Butler visited Iraq from January 19-21 when he held three
rounds of talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz. Their
talks yielded no progress on the issues of arms inspection.

<HEADLINE> E.U. Envoy to Start Shuttle Diplomacy on Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ARUSHA, Tanzania, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Aldo Ajello, European
Union envoy for the Great Lakes region, will meet with Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni and Ethiopian Premier Meles Zenawi next
week on how to speed up the peace process in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Ajello disclosed the news to Xinhua on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
After exchanging views on the issue with the Burundi Foreign
Minister during a three-day international workshop on African
resolutions to!conflicts ending here Friday, he noted that the
date of this year's regional summit on Burundi is yet to be
fixed.
</P>
<P>
"The Burundi peace process is on the track," the envoy said,
adding that leaders in the Great Lakes region are making efforts
to bring all parties inside the tiny central African country to
the negotiations table as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Issues like constitution, army and judicial systems are
expected to be high on the agenda at the negotiations which are
much likely to open this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ajello said the sanctions imposed by the Great
Lakes nations on Burundi were reduced sharply throughout last
year, implying that once the negotiations start, the regional
leaders would finally officially lift the one-and-a-half-year
ban.
</P>
<P>
"The sanctions are never against (Burundi President Pierre)
Buyoya personally," he claimed, adding the ban is always aimed at
pressing all the parties involved to start dialogue and
negotiations which may lead to the establishment of a government
of transition.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya took power in a coup in 1996, three years after the
civil war was sparked by the murder of the country's first
president Melchior Ndadaye, which claimed about 150,000 lives
since.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe very strongly in sanctions from which it is
the people who suffer, not the regime," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke highly of the increasing ability and flexibility
of African countries to deal with their own problems through
joint efforts by various regional peace-broking mechanisms under
the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
"We (the EU) are encouraged by African countries' efforts to
find their own solutions to their own problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The western countries are not prepared anymore to intervene
in African affairs. They don't want to spend money or risk their
lives," he added.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Sentenced to Death for Killing CIA Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. judge sentenced a
Pakistani citizen to death today for killing two Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) employees outside CIA headquarters near
Washington five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Mir Aimal Kasi, 33, opened an assault rifle at motorists stuck
in morning rush hour traffic on January 25, 1993, killing CIA
communications worker Frank Darling, 28, and CIA analyst and
physician Lansing Bennett, 66.
</P>
<P>
Circuit Court Judge J. Howe Brown, speaking in the heavily
guarded courthouse in Fairfax County, 20 miles (32 km) west of
Washington, said he accepted the jury's recommendation that Kasi
be executed for the shooting spree on January 25, 1993.
</P>
<P>
The six-man, six-woman jury that convicted Kasi of capital
murder in November had recommended the death penalty. In Virginia,
judges have the final say on sentencing but rarely depart from a
jury's decision.
</P>
<P>
Kasi, who was captured last June in Pakistan after four years'
run and brought to the United States for trial, told the court
that his action was a retaliation for U.S. policies that he said
hurt Islamic nations.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Fairfax Circuit Court Judge J. Howe Brown, Kasi
reiterated his political motives. "This is the result of a wrong
policy toward Muslim countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not expect any mercy from the court or from the
United States. "I don't expect any justice or mercy from your
country or this court," Kasi said.

BAGHDAD -- Iraq said Saturday that it will drop the quota
system of oil products including gasoline and gas to citizens
which was introduced last November in preparation for a possible
U.S. military action.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a Cabinet meeting under President
Saddam Hussein here, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Iraq introduced the quota system following the standoff between
Iraq and the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on removal of the
Iraqi mass destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iraq expelled U.S. members of the U.N. inspection teams, saying
they were spies, while Washington threatened military action. The
tension was eased after Russian mediation. (Iraq-Oil-Sales)

KUWAIT CITY, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait declared Saturday

chicken from Hong Kong and other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Sultan Al-Khalaf, deputy director general of the

<P>
He said the suspension of the imports was necessary to prevent
possible spread of the disease.

<P>
But he confirmed that the measure was precautionary because no

<HEADLINE> Azerbaijan Wants Peaceful Solution to Nagorno Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Azerbaijan advocates a peaceful
settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Azerbaijan's
President Geidar Aliyev said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev made the point with Yegor Stroyev, chairman of Russia's
Federation Council (Upper House), who arrived in Baku after
leaving Armenia's capital city of Yerevan Friday, Moscow reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The president also called on the outer Caucasian countries,
Azerbaijan and Armenia to restore their peaceful relationships.
</P>
<P>
Russia could play a more active role in mediating the conflict
between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Aliyev said. He hoped the
Federation Council of Russia would do its best in this issue.
</P>
<P>
Baku was opposed to Russia providing Armenia with weapons, as
well as to Russia setting up military bases in other countries of
the Commonwealth of Independent States, especially in outer
Caucasian countries, Aliyev pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev said he could not understand why there were still so
many Russian troops in Armenia and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev said that during his visit in Yerevan, Armenian
President Levon Ter-Petrocyan reiterated his intention of solving
the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict on the basis of the Minsk Group
plan, which had been mediating the conflict under the auspices of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev indicated that Azerbaijan took a similar stand with
Armenia on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1997 two-stage settlement plan of the Minsk Group,
Armenian troops will first partially withdraw from the
Nagorno-Karabakh region. Then, after the complete withdrawal is
finished, consideration will be given to a highly autonomous
status of the region within Azerbaijan territory.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Spokesman on Sino-Vietnamese Border Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao today clarified the border dispute between
China and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese side has taken note of the remarks made on
Jan. 19 by a spokesman for Vietnam's Foreign Ministry and a
leading official of Quang Ninh Province of Vietnam concerning the
land border dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese side built a herringbone dam on a boundary river
in Dongzhong section in the disputed area between the two
countries and raised and reinforced the dam since last August to
artificially change the alignment of the boundary river, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to jeopardizing Chinese interests, Zhu said, China
had to build a retaining wall to protect cultivated land and avoid
soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese have taken into consideration the interests of
Vietnam in building the project, a sloping dam to release
floodwaters, he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that, although the Vietnamese side
unreasonably obstructed and disrupted the normal construction of
the project, China has always exercised restraint and tried to
seek a proper settlement to the issue through friendly
consultations.
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, Zhu said, the Vietnamese spokesman and the leading
official of the province made unwarranted reproaches of the
Chinese side and tried to mold public opinion by publicizing and
complicating the border dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese view is that the Sino-Vietnamese border is tranquil
in general, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that any problems emerging on the long land
border between the two countries can be properly resolved through
existing channels as long as the two sides proceed from
Sino-Vietnamese traditional friendship and observe the spirit of
seeking truth from the facts and friendly consultations.
</P>
<P>
China will, as always, make unremitting efforts to this end,
Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Deregulates Domestic Oil Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said Saturday that it will
drop the quota system of oil products including gasoline and gas
to citizens which was introduced last November in preparation for
a possible U.S. military action.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a Cabinet meeting under President
Saddam Hussein here, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Iraq introduced the quota system following the standoff between
Iraq and the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on removal of the
Iraqi mass destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iraq expelled U.S. members of the U.N. inspection teams, saying
they were spies, while Washington threatened military action. The
tension was eased after Russian mediation.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said the quota system was part of the alternative measures
in anticipation of a potential military strike against the Iraqi
oil refineries. Iraqis received 10 liters of gasoline a day for
each car.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Vice-Premier Tariq Aziz also briefed the Saturday cabinet
on the results of the recent meetings held here by UNSCOM chief
Richard Butler on the removal of the Iraqi mass destruction
weapons.

<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and other leaders today extended New Year's greetings to
non-Communist Party figures and those with no party affiliations.
</P>
<P>
On a forum to mark the forthcoming Chinese Lunar New Year here,
Jiang, who is also General Secretary of the Communist Party of
China Central Committee (CPC), called on those present at the
forum to unite more closely and hold high the great banner of the
Deng Xiaoping Theory to strive for the promotion of reform,
opening-up and modernization and the reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
With China's reform having entered a crucial stage, the
president said, the CPC is endeavoring to open up a new prospect
for the reform, opening-up and modernization.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CPC will continue to learn Marxism, Leninism,
Mao Zedong Thought and, especially, Deng Xiaoping Theory, as well
as knowledge necessary to China's modernization to prepare for all
kinds of challenges.
</P>
<P>
The Party will continue to resort to people's wisdom and
strength in its efforts to build socialism with Chinese
characteristics, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that both CPC members and non-Communist Party ones
should keep close contact with the practice of reform, opening-up
and modernization and adhere to the principle of doing everything
according to China's conditions.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee
of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, presided over the forum.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from some non-Communist parties highly praised the
achievements the Chinese people had made under the leadership of
the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, and voiced
their determination to work for the accomplishment of the tasks
set forth in the 15th CPC National Congress held last year.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Ruling Party Proclaims Presidential Bet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine ruling Lakas-NUCD
party on Saturday officially proclaimed its presidential and vice
presidential candidates, and the senatorial ticket in the May 11
general elections.
</P>
<P>
At the party's national convention, Philippine President Fidel
Ramos declared his choice Jose de Venecia, speaker of the House of
Representatives, as the Lakas' presidential bet.
</P>
<P>
Senator Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, formerly a presidential
aspirant, was announced as the governing party's vice presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who is chairman of the ruling party, also named the
party's 12 senatorial candidates, most of whom are incumbent
cabinet members including Finance Secretary Robert de Ocampo.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's election law, these incumbent cabinet
members will have to resign soon after filing candidacy with the
Commission on Election (Comelec).
</P>
<P>
Ramos had been given the blanket authority by the ruling party
last November to choose the Lakas presidential and vice
presidential candidates in order to prevent the party from
breaking up.
</P>
<P>
Ramos urged the electorate to choose Lakas bets because of "the
accomplishments of the present administration in terms of
fulfilling its campaign promises and commitments."
</P>
<P>
He assured the people that the administration party's
candidates will carry on the economic reforms and other track
records of the Ramos administration.
</P>
<P>
But according to a recent opinion poll conducted by an
independent pollster, Jose de Venecia's approval ratings still
lagged far behind Vice President Joseph Estrada, the presidential
candidate of the main opposition party -- Struggle of Patriotic
Filipino Masses.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, a formerly popular movie star, has been leading many
surveys due to the support from ordinary masses. His running mate
is Senator Edgardo Angara.
</P>
<P>
Besides Estrada and de Venecia, there are two other proclaimed
presidential contenders -- former defense secretary Renato de
Villa and Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim.
</P>
<P>
In the coming weeks, at least two more presidential hopefuls,
including Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago, are expected to
declare their candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Under the election law, the country's presidential, vice
presidential, congressional and local elections will be held
simultaneously on May 11.

PARIS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- At least 11 people were killed Friday in Orres in the French
Alps when 32 racket ramblers were carried away by an avalanche
which they themselves set in motion. The group included 26 kids
from Yvelines, Paris. The heavy snow which accumulated last
weekend in the Alps was the origin of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
-- An outburst of revelations are being made by the American
media about the private life of President Bill Clinton after the
eruption of the new scandal involving him with a former White
House intern, Monica Lewinsky. According to the U.S. television
network CBS, Lewinsky provided in her taped conversation with her
friend, a former White House employee, the names of four other
women with whom Clinton had sexual relations -- including those of
three other interns at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The sex scandal originating from an alleged liaison between
U.S. President Bill Clinton with a young intern, whom he could
have asked to lie to the justice, is continuing to extend. The
White House, which is in a state of siege, has been incapable of
countering an outburst of revelations about the private life of
the president, four days away from a major speech, the State of
Union, that Clinton is supposed to make in front of the Congress.
</P>
<P>
-- President Jacques Chirac began on Saturday a three-day
state visit to India. In an interview with le Figaro, Indian Prime
Minister Inder Kumar Gujral estimated the visit as a "good
opportunity for investment" by French businesses in India.

<HEADLINE> 4 More Private Banks in Indonesia to Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Four more private banks in
Indonesia are merging in a bid to strengthen their operation
capacity, Antara News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The four banks, namely Bank Umum Nasional, Bank Bukopin, Bank
Tugu and Bank Duta, signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the
merger here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of Bank Duta Muchtar Mandala said after the
signing ceremony that the merged bank could become reality in late
June 1998, and will have combined assets of 21.2 trillion rupiah
(one U.S. dollar equals 12,000 rupiah now) and total equity of
1.395 trillion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
He said the merger establishes a strong bank that can serve the
public in the global era.
</P>
<P>
This is the second merger of private banks in the country. On
January 18, five private banks had decided to merge into one in
order to cope with the increasing globalization of financial
services.
</P>
<P>
At the end of October last year, the Indonesian government
closed 16 insolvent private banks aimed at making the banking
sector more healthy.
</P>
<P>
On December 31, the government also announced a plan to merge
four state banks into one and provide foreign banks of
international reputation with the opportunity to become
shareholding partners.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has about 200 private banks and about 50 percent of
them are regarded as unhealthy banks with various financial
problems.

<HEADLINE> Government Departments, Factories Move out of Historic City (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-seven Suzhou city
government departments have moved out from downtown buildings to
the suburbs to protect the 2,000-year-old city in east China's
Jiangsu Province, which is famous for its traditional gardens and
beautiful scenery.
</P>
<P>
The move, as well as relocating 160 factories, is aimed at
reviving Suzhou's traditional flavor, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
"Only by such moves, instead of protecting single relics, can
the whole layout and style of the historic city be preserved,"
said Guo Zhan, director of Cultural Relics Protecting Department
with the State Bureau of Cultural Relics.
</P>
<P>
According to Guo, 99 cities all over the country have been
listed as historic cities under state protection since the 1980s,
including Suzhou.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Chinese government for the first time applied
for historic cities to be added to UNESCO's World Heritage
List. The candidates included two small cities -- Lijiang in
Yunnan Province and Pingyao in Shanxi Province, and one big city
-- Suzhou.
</P>
<P>
"Actually we chose part of it -- the traditional gardens --
instead of the whole Suzhou city, " Guo said, "That did not mean
that we were reluctant to choose the city as whole. We were afraid
that the condition of the whole city was not good enough."
</P>
<P>
According to Guo, experts from the World Heritage Committee who
unanimously agreed to add the traditional gardens in Suzhou to
the list strongly urged the Chinese government to expand the
area's protection.
</P>
<P>
"Some even proposed to inscribe the whole ancient town of
Suzhou, the so-called 'Oriental Venice,' on the World Heritage
List," he said.

<HEADLINE> Government Departments, Factories Move out of Historic City (2) </HEADLINE>

<P>
"The moving out of government departments and factories is just
part of the local effort to preserve the traditional style of the
city as a whole," Guo said.
</P>
<P>
Founded in the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC), Suzhou
first served as capital of the Wu State. It had been ruined and
rebuilt time and again in the following 2,500 years, never losing
its status as a local economic and political center.
</P>
<P>
Long famous for its beautiful scenery and traditional gardens,
the city's pollution problems began to increase in the 1950s with
a rising population and more factories.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problem, the city government moved 160 factories
outside the city and closed half of the remaining 60. The only
ones left were those non-polluters with a folk flavor such as
embroidery and traditional music instrument workshops.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city invested some 30 billion yuan to build 53
residential sections outside the city, each with a floor space of
at least 50,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
To date, the city has restored 800 ancient lanes and 163 small
bridges, dredged the 35-kilometer ancient waterway, and put up
labels on 200 ancient buildings and 500 old trees.
</P>
<P>
"What Suzhou has done is to set an example for other historic
cities to conserve cultural relics in the light of rapid economic
development," Guo said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that many historic cities are losing their
traditional flavor because of economic changes.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Public Security
issued an emergency circular here today cautioning people to be
alert against fire during the Spring Festival holiday beginning
Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
The circular said there were 16 big fires across the country in
the last two months causing 122 deaths and injuring 55 people. The
economic loss was 28.66 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Spring Festival is usually a high-risk time for fires because
of the increased use of electricity and gas as well as
firecrackers and fireworks set off in holiday celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The circular asked fire-fighting departments to conduct
thorough checks in public places such as hotels, restaurants,
department stores and dance halls to reduce potential fire
danger. In large gatherings such as lantern shows,
fire-extinguishing facilities and equipment should be in place and
ready for use, the circular stated.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 24 (Xinhua) -- King Fahd Ibn Abdul Aziz of
Saudi Arabia Saturday received a letter from Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The letter was delivered by Iranian Ambassador to the kingdom
Mohammed Rida Nouri during a meeting with Fahd in Mecca, the news
agency said, adding that the contents of the letter were not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides "reviewed bilateral relations
and discussed issues on the international and Islamic arena."
</P>
<P>
A thaw has set in the Saudi-Iranian ties since last year,
especially after Khatami assumed office last August.
</P>
<P>
Khatami has since repeated Iran's readiness to improve
bilateral relations and make joint efforts to maintain regional
security and stability, which has been responded by Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The past year saw exchange of visits by senior officials of the
two countries, including Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi's
visit to Saudi Arabia and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul
Aziz to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran became tense after
Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979. Saudi Arabia accused Iran of
exporting Islamic revolution and supporting the Shiite Muslims in
the kingdom, which is dominated by Sunni Muslims.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Chinese Citizens Prefer Traditional Festivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Traditional celebrations,
especially Spring Festival, are more popular among most Chinese
citizens than public holidays, a survey has shown.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by Beijing Horizon Market Survey and
Analysis Company, interviewed 5,000 citizens 18 or older in 10
leading Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
Following Spring Festival, National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival
are the holidays that Chinese citizens say they like the most.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with the opening up of China, Western festivals such
as Christmas, Valentine's Day and Mother's Day are celebrated by
some Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Public holidays, such as International Labor Day and
International Children's Day, do not rate as highly with Chinese
citizens.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that traditional Chinese festivals are
more popular among the elderly, while Western holidays are
comparatively popular with the younger generation.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Rejects Yeltsin's State Symbols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Duma, the lower
house of parliament, rejected a bill Friday for the adoption as
permanent national symbols, the anthem and flag, proposed by
President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass news agency reported the presidential measures were,
in the first reading, backed by 107 deputies, while 203 deputies
voted against them, as did seven in abstentia, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Duma also refused to approve a measure on the anthem
championed by Communist parliament members, which proposed to
re-introduce the post-Soviet anthem written by Alexander
Alexandrov in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
The white, blue and red tricolor flag, the double-headed eagle
and the melody composed by Mikhail Glinka, known as the Patriotic
Song, have been in use since 1993 when Yeltsin introduced them by
decree.
</P>
<P>
The decree was not legally binding because it lacked a formal
acceptance by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Communist deputies, who dominate the Duma, opposed the
presidential bill, saying that the tricolor flag had been used by
Russian traitors in World War II, and that the double-headed eagle
was ambiguous in its significance.
</P>
<P>
They proposed in a Duma session last April to re-introduce the
post-Soviet anthem, the hammer and sickle flag and the former
Soviet Russia emblem.
</P>
<P>
In the Friday meeting, the Duma reviewed only the anthem in the
Communists' measure.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, a bill must win a two-thirds
majority in the Duma, as well as a three-fourths majority in the
Federation Council (the upper house), to be approved.

<HEADLINE> Labor Ministry Urges Coal Mines to Improve Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Labor today
issued an urgent circular to coal mines across the country urging
them to take effective measures to enhance safety in operation
during the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
The circular said that, compared with the previous year, the
overall number of accidents in China's coal mines decreased in
1997, but there was a sharp rise in the number of major and
extremely serious accidents.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that last year the coal mining sector had 102
major accidents that each claimed more than 10 lives and killed a
total of 2,028 miners. The major accidents were up by 21.42
percent and deaths by 29.83 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst record in the coal mining industry since the
founding of New China in 1949," the circular noted, adding that
three major accidents each killing at least 10 people had happened
already this year.
</P>
<P>
The labor ministry demanded that all coal mines and their
competent departments try to remove potential dangers that could
lead to accidents, improve safety regulations, analyze and draw
lesson from various accidents of 1997, and take effective measures
to ensure mining safety throughout 1998.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also urged local governments at all levels to halt
illegal mining operations by unlicensed small coal mines, as well
as the production of licensed mines without basic safety
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
"Labor departments across the country should also intensify
their supervision over safety in operation in coal mines, and
investigate every accident seriously," the circular concluded.

about the danger of mines.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Ambassador to Angola Tamara Golan said here today

</P>
<P>
The Israeli volunteers who have a good anti-mine knowledge#,

</P>
<P>
There are many landmines in Angola and mine clearance is a
long-term work, she said, adding that it is necessary to offer
Angolan people, especially the childern with the information
about landmines.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, which will last for 12 months, is the biggest
anti-mine campaign involving foreigners since the 1994 Lusaka
Peace Protocol, Golan said.
</P>
<P>
Angola claims to have over 10 million mines deployed during
the three decades of anti-colonialism and civil wars throughout
the country and only about 7,500 mines have been cleared in the
past three years.
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Beginning For China's Relations With Britain, France (1) by Zhang Rongdian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has been active
diplomatically with visits by Britain's Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook and France's Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, giving China
increasing importance in the international arena and making it a
force to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
This is Cook's first visit to China since the Chinese
government resumed exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on
July 1, 1997. China and Britain worked together for a smooth
transfer of power and stable transition, clearing away political
barriers between the two countries and turning a new page in
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, in his meeting with
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng on June 30, 1997, said
that the two countries could usher in a new chapter of bilateral
relations and a new starting point.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Cook said that Britain hopes for a fresh
beginning in Sino-British relations and wishes to engage in
wind-ranging cooperation with China under new circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side welcomed the positive attitude of the British
government toward advancing bilateral relations and its
suggestions and proposals for bilateral cooperation and high-level
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Friendly and cooperative ties between China and France have
moved ahead thanks to joint efforts since the two countries issued
a joint communique on normalizing relations in January of
1994. During French President Jacques Chirac's visit to China last
May, President Jiang and Chirac signed a joint statement
announcing the establishing of a comprehensive partership geared
to the 21st century, laying a foundation for bilateral ties.

<P>
President Chirac said that new thinking and perspectives are
needed in French and Western European policies on China, and
that France will continue to promote a wide range of bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Hubert Vedrine, who is the first cabinet member of the new
French government to visit China, said on the eve of his visit
that France wishes to develop its relations with China and that
the Socialist government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin attaches
as much importance to developing relations with China as does
Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
China's Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held
separate discussions with Cook and Vedrine on bilateral ties and
regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, in his meeting with Cook, expressed the belief that
Cook's China visit will help increase mutual understanding between
the two countries and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told Vedrine that Sino-French relations are going
smoothly and have a promising future, and that China is willing to
work with France to further develop bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Local observers say that, with the increase in global
multi-polarization, increased dialogues and cooperation between
China and the two European nations will serve the long-term
interests of the three, increase cooperation between Asia and
Europe, and benefit world peace, stability and development.

<HEADLINE> China's Government Providing Drinking Water for Eastern Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is
working to ease the drinking water shortage for 400,000 people in
the city of Xuzhou in Jiangsu Province before the Spring Festival
(January 28) by using underground water sources and diverting
water from the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Local water was seriously affected by pollution of the
Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, which became worse at the beginning
of the month. The provincial government has allocated funds for
new drinking water sources and the city government has ordered
major industrial water consumers to control their intake.
</P>
<P>
The city has also sent fire trucks out twice a day to provide
water for local people who do not have enough water for daily use,
and water companies' wells are being fullly used. Companies that
have their own wells and supplies have agreed to make them
available to city residents.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the canal has been used mainly for navigation
in recent years and its water quality is not very good. Nearby
Jiangsu Province has started diverting water from the Yangtze into
the canal to dilute the pollution.
</P>
<P>
Last September's drought meant the city had to get water from
the canal, intensifying the pollution problem, according to a
study by the State Environmental Protection Agency and the Water
Resources Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Some paper mills along the upper reaches of the canal, in
Shandong Province, discharged waste water into the canal, causing
long-term pollution, the study found.
</P>
<P>
The head of one of the mills and a deputy-director of an
environmental protection agency in the city of Linyin in Shandong
who were responsible for the pollution have already been dealt
with, says Liu Zhihong, a member of the State Environmental
Protection Agency's Water Office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shandong and Jiangsu have temporarily closed down
paper mills that are sources of pollution, and water quality in
the canal has improved since these steps were taken, but further
action is needed before it really can be used by locals, a Xuzhou
Environmental Protection Agency official says.
</P>
<P>
The city's waterworks, which used to provide 300,000 tons of
water a day, can now only supply five tons for the city's
residents.

HONG KONG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-four AIDS cases were
reported in 1997 in Hong Kong, bringing the total number of AIDS
cases to 309, the Department of Health announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The department said that a total of 181 persons were found
positive for the HIV antibody test last year, bringing the
cumulative total number of reported HIV infections to 957.
</P>

<P>
The ratio of reported male to female infections is four to one.
Over 80 percent acquired the infection via sexual contact, the

HONG KONG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Passengers are reminded by

Cathay Pacific Airways, the largest of the three international

The newspapers quoted Henry Mok, manager of the Cathay Pacific
Airports for customer services, as saying: "We are seeing a trend
towards passengers carrying more hand baggage and the airlines
need to introduce stringent controls and guidelines."

The trend "poses a direct safety risk to passengers and crew

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Looking To Buy Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Most Chinese, even now, are
used to the idea of living in housing provided by their work unit,
but are becoming aware of the fact that their unit may no longer
be offering free housing.
</P>
<P>
This means that they have to get ready to buy and more Chinese
are taking an interest in buying a house of their own, especially
since China's housing reforms are increasing and are expected to
mean greater development of the real estate market.
</P>
<P>
The key point in this is increasing individual demand and
promoting commercial housing, according to the Construction
Ministry. So, the governor of the People's Bank of China, Dai
Xianglong, recently announced that some 100 billion yuan (about
12.5 billion U.S. dollars) will be used for housing loans this
year, in a bid to encourage the purchases.
</P>
<P>
The bank is encouraging all commercial banks to provide loans
for mortgages that are long-term, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that housing is an immediate problem for most
ordinary Chinese and the market is one solution and a way to
contribute to rapid and smooth economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The country's housing market has been picking up after being in
a slump for two years, and some municipalities like Shanghai and
Tianjin, and provinces like Shangdong and Jiangsu have been
encouraging people to buy.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 58.7 percent of the housing sold from
January to November of 1997 went to individual buyers, a
year-on-year increase of 27.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
China will have more policies to help residents, based on their
income, and will continue the Comfortable Housing Project, whose
purpose is to help low-income people.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of residential housing built in 1996 was 310
million sq.m., or 8.7 sq.m. per person.
</P>
<P>
Some industry insiders predict that private housing will become
part of the mainstream of the real estate sector, as the glut of
hotels, offices, and luxury buildings looms.

HONG KONG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Tung Chee Hwa visited
the Stanley Barracks Saturday to deliver his Spring Festival's
greetings to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Garrison stationed
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tung was welcomed by the PLA Commander Liu Zhenwu and the
Political Commissar Xiong Ziren when he arrived at the barracks
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive toured the quarters and a culture

reading, enjoying music, and doing exercises. Historic exhibits,
calligraphy works, paintings and light weapons are displayed at
the center.
</P>
<P>
Tung told the PLA officers and soldiers Saturday that they have
contributed to the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong since the
Garrison started to be responsible for the defense of Hong Kong on
July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The PLA Garrison has set up a very good image in Hong Kong and
is welcomed by the SAR government and the people, said Tung. He
noted that the troops have strictly observed military rules and
the Basic Law, the SAR's constitutional document.
</P>
<P>
He also took the opportunity to send greetings to the Garrison
as the traditional Chinese Lunar New Year, which falls on January
28 this year, is drawing near.
</P>
<P>
Commander Liu Zhenwu expressed his thanks to the SAR government
and the Hong Kong people for their kindness and support to the
army.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive was accompanied on the hour-long visit by
acting Secretary for Administration Michael Suen, Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang, Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung,

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is considering the
proposals sent by India to operationalize the mechanism of
addressing all the outstanding issues including Kashmir between
the two countries, a Foreign Office spokesman said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly press briefing here, the spokesman said
that "we have received some proposals from India which deserve
thorough consideration." However, he did not elaborate the
proposals.
</P>
<P>
He said non-operalization of the agreed mechanism is the main
hurdle to the resumption of talks.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of talks between the foreign secretaries of the
two countries depends on when New Delhi comes back to the
situation in last June," when the two foreign secretaries agreed
on a mechanism to address the eight outstanding issues including
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
However, he reiterated Pakistan is committed to dialogue with
India and, "There should be no doubt about it."

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Traditional Chinese medicine
doctors in the northern city of Tianjin have found a
way to treat gangrene in a diabetic's foot.
</P>
<P>
Gangrene is one of the serious complications of diabetes, and
often accompanies hepatic and renal dysfunction and other
problems.
</P>
<P>
The hospital's Doctor Yang Zhaogang has also used long needles
and acupuncture to cure prostate disease, which has been effective
in 89 percent of the cases.
</P>
<P>
Western and traditional Chinese medicines were both thought to
be unable to cure the disease, but Yang has been using the therapy
since the '60s, and has been praised by Chinese experts. The long
needle can reach specific acupuncture points deep below the skin.

<HEADLINE> Iran Regards US Extraterritorial Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official said
Saturday that the U.S. extraterritorial sanctions against other
countries violated international norms and laws.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the Asian-African Legal
Consultative Committee (AALCC) Seminar on Extraterritorial
Application of Domestic Jurisdiction, Iranian Deputy Foreign
Minister for international affairs and AALCC President Javad Zarif
said that the economic sanctions imposed on Cuba, Iran and Libya
were examples of a post-cold war trend to use U.S. economic
power to achieve diplomatic ends.
</P>
<P>
He said that the extraterritorial sanctions violated the
principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of states,
non-intervention, self-determination and the rights to
development.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton and D'Amato Acts, which explicitly seek to
overthrow the Cuban government and change the Iranian domestic
and foreign policy, clearly violate the universally accepted
principle of non-intervention in internal and external affairs of
other states and principle of territorial sovereignty, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Territorial sovereignty is an essential foundation of
contemporary international relations," he said, "without respect
for sovereignty, there will be no internationally accepted norms
and rules of conduct."
</P>
<P>
Zarif said that the imposition of extraterritorial sanctions
against third parties interrupts economic cooperation and trade
relations among sovereign states, and extraterritorial application
of national laws such as Helms-Burton and D'Amato Acts which aim
to restrict the right of the peoples of the target states
violates their right to self-determination.
</P>
<P>
The United States announced the Helms-Burton and D'Amato Acts
in 1996, threatening to impose sanctions against companies of
third countries which have economic cooperation with Cuba and
Iran. The acts were universally condemned, even by the
U.S. western allies.
</P>
<P>
"The imposition of sanctions is permissible only by the United
Nations under Chapter VII of the Charter in order to give effect
to Security Council decisions with respect to maintaining or
restoring international peace and security," Zarif said.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen experts from nine members of the 44-state AALLCC
attended the two-day seminar. The AALCC secretariat will deliver
the result of the seminar to the 37th AALCC Session scheduled to
be held in New Delhi in April.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Becomes Northwest China's Fishery Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The land-locked Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region in northwest China yielded 22,940 tons of
aquatic products in 1997, a record high.
</P>
<P>
The region has become an important fishery base and aquatic
products distribution center in northwest China, with more than 60
percent of the products sold to its neighboring provinces and
autonomous regions such as Gansu, Qinghai, Shannxi, Xinjiang,
Inner Mongolia and Tibet, said Huang Quanfu, director of the
regional bureau for aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
Situated on the plain at the Great Bend of the Yellow River,
Ningxia has favorable natural conditions for fishery development such
as a large number of lakes and long sunshine time.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the region has made efforts to turn
low-lying saline-alkali land into fishponds. Currently, its
fresh-water breeding area has increased to 10,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Beside the traditional Yellow River carp, grass carp and silver
carp, other aquatic products such as soft-shelled turtle, bullfrog
and shrimp have also been bred there.
</P>
<P>
"Farmers are encouraged to get rich by engaging in fresh-water
breeding," Huang said. In Yinchuan along, the regional capital,
there are now more than 3,400 households that are specialized in
this business.

<HEADLINE> China Seen as "Safe Island" in Asian Financial Crisis  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- China is able to maintain
itself a "safe island" in the Asian financial crisis and,
moreover, contribute to eventual financial stabilization in the
region, said a senior government official today.
</P>
<P>
China can not be utterly insulated from the impacts of global
economic turbulences as it has implemented a policy of opening to
the rest of the world, said Bao Kexin, Director-General of the
Department of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations of the State
Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
"But overall, the prospects are good," Bao told Xinhua in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis, which started in July last year
with the sharp devaluation of the Thai currency, the baht, has
snarled Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, the Republic of
Korea, Hong Kong and Japan, with effects rippling to many parts of
the world.
</P>
<P>
Bao explained that China's persisting favorable balance of
international payments and its rapidly expanding foreign exchange
reserves have combined to greatly increase its power to counter
various risks.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that China has registered surplus on the
current account for four consecutive years, while its foreign
trade surplus reached a record high of 40.3 billion US dollars in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Also last year China utilized overseas investment in the amount
of 51.9 billion US dollars, resulting in a fairly large net inflow
on the capital account. Its foreign exchange reserves reached
139.9 billion US dollars by the end of 1997, the second largest in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Bao said the countries with the largest level of currency
devaluation in the Asian financial crisis have one thing in
common: sustained current-account deficit in their balance sheets
for international payments.

<HEADLINE> China Seen as "Safe Island" in Asian Financial Crisis  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once capital inflow slows down or stops, capital flight will
ensue and the double effects of the two, exacerbated by
confidence crisis, will result in payment difficulties and
currency devaluation, Bao said.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that China has largely stood out of the financial
turbulence mainly because its exports have not been affected
significantly, its economy has maintained appropriately rapid
growth, its level of foreign debt is well below the
internationally recognized safety limits, and overseas investment
in China has continued to expand.
</P>
<P>
They note that exports of Southeast Asian nations will enjoy
price competitiveness in a period of time as a result of cheaper
currencies, something that has affected China's exports of some
products.
</P>
<P>
But due to limited overlapping in exports and disparity in
import and labor costs between China and those countries, currency
devaluation in the region will have limited impacts on China's
overall exports, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that China's exports in the fourth
quarter of last year grew 32.9 percent on a yearly basis, in a
contrast to a 15.5 percent rise in imports.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Xiaohua, chief economist of the State Statistical Bureau,
said that the Chinese economy has embarked on a healthy track of
"high growth and low inflation" and is expected to grow by 8-10
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the situation of ample supply of both production and
consumer goods, imports will go down if exports drop, and this is
a general rule that has been proved in the recent years, Qiu said.
</P>
<P>
"From the perspective of macro economics, trade deficit is
unlikely at a time when the overall savings rate is much higher
than that of investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bao said that encouraged by China's increasingly open policy
and improving infrastructure and investment environment, overseas
investors are keen on the huge China market of 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
Though investment from Southeast Asian countries has slowed
down, overall overseas investment in China will continue to grow
robustly this year, he said.

LONDON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The British Foreign Office is planning an intensive
publicity campaign in the run-up to the World Cup to try to
deter British football fans without tickets from swarming
into French cities where the English and the Scottish teams
are due to play.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Senior members of the Royal Family will gather in
London next month to discuss the legacy of Diana, Princess
of Wales, at what should be the most wide-ranging internal
conference on the future of the monarchy for many years.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton's advisers are sharply
divided on how best to contain the growing scandal over
claims that he urged a former White House worker to lie
about an alleged affair.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- A catholic was murdered in north Belfast Friday night,
two hours after the Ulster Freedom Fighters raised hopes
that it was calling an end to its new campaign of violence.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- The British government Friday launched a new Internet
service for victims of Gulf War illnesses. John Reed, the
armed forces minister, has promised that +every piece of
information that is revealed to me+ will be released to the

<P>
In another analysis, China's foreign debt situation in general
is good, with all the major indices tracking the health of its
foreign debt level all well below internationally accepted
standards.
</P>
<P>
China's debt-servicing ratio, or the ratio of repayment of debt
principal and interest to foreign exchange income of the same
year, is 11.8 percent, compared with the commonly recognized
standard of 20 percent. The debt ratio, which is the result of the
outstanding value of a country's foreign debt divided by its gross
domestic product, stands at 14 percent, far below the average for
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
Short-term debt accounts for just 12 percent of China's total
foreign debt, valued at 118.6 billion US dollars at the end of
last June.
</P>
<P>
Last year China took a series of measures to open wider to the
outside world and stimulate domestic consumption, such as lowering
interest rates and the general level of tariff duties and allowing
some foreign trade companies to open foreign-exchange accounts.
</P>
<P>
Bao said that these measures, taken under the backdrop of
financial instability in many other parts of Asia, indicate that
the Chinese government is confident of its economic prowess and
international payment ability.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, these measures will also play a positive role in
eventually cooling the Asian financial crisis, restoring the
international economic order and boosting global economic growth,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Pieter Bottelier, a senior advisor to the World Bank's vice
president for East Asia and Pacific Region, said here earlier this
month that China is a stabilizer in the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"China is an important positive factor in helping stabilize the
financial situation in Asia. Without it, the situation would have
been even worse," said Bottelier, former chief of the Bank's
resident mission in China.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Resumption of Tajik Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran has expressed welcome to
the resumption of the peace talks between the Tajik government and
opposition after a week-long standoff, Iran's official news
agency IRNA reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Iran welcomes the resumption of the talks and it is encouraging
that neither side of Tajikistan has allowed the process of
national reconciliation to be damaged, said Iranian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi voiced Iran's support for the peace-seeking efforts
of the Tajik government and Islamic movement.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the move as a sign of commitment of either side to
national reconciliation, stability and development and a major
step to promote economic development and reconstruction of the
war-torn Central Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Tajik opposition suspended its work in the
National Reconciliation Commission to protest government's failure
to respect a peace agreement signed last year.
</P>
<P>
The commission is working for the implementation of the
agreement, under which the government has promised to offer 30
percent of the government posts to the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Iran, one of the guarantors of the agreement, has shown great
concern about the decision of the Tajik opposition.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi has urged the neighbors
of Tajikistan and concerned world organizations to make efforts to
save the peace process.
</P>
<P>
With the efforts made by U.N. representative Gerd Dietrich
Merrem and some countries, the Tajik opposition has agreed to
resume its work at the National Reconciliation Commission.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Mine Union Happy With Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Mine Workers Union of Zambia (MWUZ)
has expressed its happiness with the on-going privatization of the
country's mining industry.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted MWUZ President Paul Kafumbe as saying
that the union is happy that the government has put a lot of care and
caution in the privatization of the mines.
</P>
<P>
He told a MWUZ conference in Livingstone in southern Zambia that
adequate consultations and explanations have been done with the
investors over the future cooperation with new managements.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the government for making it a condition the new
investors recognize the MWUZ as the sole representative
and negotiating organ of mine workers.
</P>
<P>
Kafumbe said the privatization of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
(ZCCM), the only mining corporation in the country, should not only
increase production but also provide opportunities for more
jobs for workers.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to consider putting a union representative
on the boards of directors to enable the union to intervene and put in
their decisions at the highest level to protect the interests of
workers.
</P>
<P>
On the political front, he said that MWUZ stressed the importance of
the rule of law, separation of powers and dialog as pillars of
democratic governance.
</P>
<P>
As a union it condemns undemocratic means of wrestling power, he
said. The ballot and meaningful dialogue are the best means of
strengthening Zambia's young and vibrant democracy, the union leader
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Revenue Collection Rise 9.71 percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's revenue collection
in the first half of the current fiscal year rose by 9.71 percent
to 62.65 billion taka (1.39 billion U.S. dollars) as compared with
the previous corresponding period, the National Board of Revenue
(NBR) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, the actual collection from July to December in the
current fiscal year beginning July 1 fell short of the target of
68.03 billion taka (about 1.5 billion dollars), the NBR said.
</P>
<P>
The NBR listed a number of reasons for the shortfall, including
a drastic decline of import duty following the fall in imports,
labor unrest at the Chittagong Port, the slowdown in industrial
production, huge losses in revenues resulting from large-scale
cross-border smuggling.
</P>
<P>
If these problems are not solved, the revenue target of 150
billion taka (about 3.31 billion dollars) for the current fiscal
year could not be met, the NBR warned.

<HEADLINE> Autumn Grain Purchases In Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province has purchased 2.3 billion kg of autumn grain from local
farmers, sources have reported, even though the province was
hit by severe drought last year, resulting in decreased output.
</P>
<P>
To keep farmers enthusiastic and to help increase their income,
the provincial government has adopted price protection measures in
accordance with the province's conditions.
</P>
<P>
The province's Agriculture Development Bank branch has prepared
4.7 billion yuan for autumn grain purchases, and local governments
have increased supervision of grain purchases. Various areas have
tried to see to it that there is adequate capital for grain
purchase, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning farmers had a rise of 300 yuan in their income last
year despite the drought. This has been attributed to the
province's increased investment in agriculture and concentration
on cereals, aquatic products, cash crops, and livestock.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Beats Kournikova in Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Martina Hingis of Switzerland
made a narrow win over Anna Kournikova of Russia today at 1998
Australian Tennis Open in Melbourne, Australia.
</P>
<P>
Kournikova may be the pin-up girl of women's tennis but Hingis
remains the world No. 1 although it nearly ended today.
</P>
<P>
The two teenagers staged a thrilling third round clash before a
packed center court with Hingis eventually prevailing 6-4, 4-6, 6-4
after just over an hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
While the victory keeps the world No.1 on course for a second
successive Australian Open crown, the match showed that the gap
between the 17-year-old Swiss and the host of challengers for her
crown is narrowing.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time 16-year-old Kournikova had taken a set
off Hingis and at times the Russian rattled her with her power
from the back court.
</P>
<P>
In their two previous meetings Kournikova had been thrashed by
Hingis, losing 6-3, 6-2 in last year's Wimbledon semi-finals and
before that 6-1, 6-3 in the third round of the French Open.
</P>
<P>
Kournikova made 53 unforced errors in all in today's game,
nearly double Hingis' total of 27 but could be happy in the
knowledge that Hingis at least had to work up a sweat to beat her
this time.

of the United States stormed into the fourth round of the
Australian Open in Melbourne today after he beat hapless Italian
Andrea Gaudenzi 6-2, 6-2, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
Lighter, faster and fitter than he has been in two years, the
1995 champion Agassi broke Gaudenzi in the first game of the match
and sped to a 4-0 lead, quickly setting the tone.
</P>
<P>
Agassi has worked strenuously in the gym and on the court over
the past six months and has lost about eight kilograms.
</P>
<P>
And now he sees the results his confidence is building daily.
</P>
<P>
"Even today's match was just a reward for a lot of hard work,"
Agassi said.
</P>
<P>
"It all feels good to me. I have been literally looking forward
to playing, competing and trying to win."
</P>
<P>
The news today was not so gratifying for Australian Andrew Ilie
who was shut out by Chile's No.9 seed in their third round
encounter.
</P>
<P>
Ilie, a qualifier ranked 282, had yet to drop a set in the
tournament but today came up against too classy an opponent.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of
crude palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week all
stronger.
</P>
<P>
CPO physicals started the week on a soft note. However, it
rebounded from Tuesday onward.
</P>
<P>
January South ended the week at 2,500 ringgit (about 555.55
U.S. dollars) per ton, 150 ringgit (about 33.33 U.S. dollars)
higher from last week's closing of 2,350 ringgit (about 522.22
U.S. dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
A crop report for January by private forecaster Ivan Wong
released this week sparked some support in the market but the data
only managed to lift the price on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wong projected palm oil output for January to go down by 18.3
percent to 510,000 tons over December and also forecast palm oil
stock for end-January at 705,000 tons and exports in January at
660,000 tons.
</P>

(KLTM) surging following a further weakening of the ringgit which
fell to 4.5100/400 against the U.S. dollar at the close this week.
</P>
<P>
After a downtrend on the first trading day of the week due to
the rebound of the ringgit, the metal went on the uptrend for four
consecutive days following strong buying interest.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Take New Austerity Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Ministry of Planning
and Investment (MPI) has announced its intention of cutting
investment projects of provincial and central governments, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry noted that no more money is to be made available
for the purchase of expensive office equipment.
</P>
<P>
It said the cut was part of a determined government effort to
exercise thrift this year.
</P>
<P>
In a circular issued earlier this week, the MPI said individual
ministries of the central government and provinces should
re-consider their own proposed list of projects intended for
government investment and include only those which were considered
essential.
</P>
<P>
Ministries and provinces should submit their proposed
investment plans for this year to the MPI next month for
consideration on a case by case basis because limited investment
could not cover all proposed projects.
</P>
<P>
As part of the government's call for thrift, the MPI said it
would no longer grant finance to administrative government
agencies for the purchase of air conditioning systems, lifts and
other expensive interior equipment.

<HEADLINE> Idea of Digging Kra Isthmus Canal in Thailand Revived </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Officials and businessmen in
Ranong, south Thailand, have revived the proposal to dig a canal
at Kra Isthmus between the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Shipping through a canal between the two waters can save time
and costs, promote investment and boost tourism, according to a
Bangkok Post report Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed 100-km-long project, about 500 km southwest of
Bangkok, will cost 500-600 billion baht (10-12 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The project has been deliberated by parliament 11 times over
the past few decades, but no decision has been made to launch it,
because of the enormous cost.
</P>
<P>
The public and private sectors of Ranong have decided to
request the government to make a study of the canal plan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Could Lose 1 Million Jobs From Asian Crisis: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit could
shoot up by over 100 billion U.S. dollars and lose more than 1
million jobs over the next two years as a result of the Asian
currency crisis, a labor-backed think tank said.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Policy Institute said today that California, New
York, Texas and North Carolina would be the hardest hit, but all
50 states would suffer job losses as plunging Asian currencies
make products from those countries cheaper in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The recent collapse of Asian currencies and financial markets
will have severe economic consequences for the United States," it
noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. deficit in merchandise trade, running close to 200
billion dollars in 1997, could increase by 100 billion to 200
billion dollars over the next two years with a resulting loss in
jobs of between 1.1 million and 2.1 million, according to the
study.
</P>
<P>
The institute's report entitled "American Jobs and the Asian
Crisis" pointed out that while the adverse unemployment effects
from a swelling trade deficit could be offset by aggressive
interest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve, but it was not
clear how the Fed would take a fast reaction.
</P>
<P>
The EPI study projected that a 100 billion dollar increase in
the merchandise trade deficit would result in 1.05 million lost
jobs, 726,134 of them coming from manufacturing industries.
</P>
<P>
Among the hardest hit industries would be industrial machinery
and equipment, including computers, with a loss of 168,734 jobs;
electronic equipment, including telephones and other
telecommunications products, 122,026 lost jobs; apparel and
textiles, 64,694 lost jobs; and transportation, covering autos and
aircraft, 47,787 lost jobs.
</P>
<P>
The states with the biggest job losses would be California,
126,681; Texas, 65,024; New York, 63,555; and North Carolina,
50,063, the institute said.
</P>
<P>
Many economists have cut down their growth forecasts for 1998
to around 2.5 percent, down from the 3.7 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Three Foreign Firms to Open Plants in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 23 (Xinhua) -- President Jose Maria Figueres
said on Friday that three foreign firms will open plants in his
country. That could mean some 700 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
The three firms are Photocircuits, of New York, which
manufactures integrated circuit cards, and a subsidiary of Dover
Corporation, also of New York, and EMC Technology, which produces
electronic parts for satellites and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Photocircuit will build a plant in a duty-free zone in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
Dek USA, a Dover Corporation subsidiary, will give technical
support to companies in the country that use its equipment.
</P>
<P>
EMC will start building a plant to produce electronic
components for telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
Figueres has launched a vigorous campaign to attract
investments from high technology firms. The biggest success of the
campaign was a decision made last year by Intel -- the biggest
microchip manufacturer of the world -- to install a plant in the
country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Doubles Deportation of Mexican Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 23 (Xinhua) -- United States immigration
authorities deported 2,000 undocumented Mexican children and
adolescents last year, a 100 percent increase over the 1996 figure.
</P>
<P>
This was reported Friday by the director of the Center for the
Attention to Border Minors of Mexico, Jose Ibarra, who said that
655 of the 2,000 undocumented minors reported were assisted by
his institution located on the border city of Ciudad Juarez of the
northern Mexican state of Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
The director said that most of the deported who resided in the
interior of the country received lodging from the Mexican
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Patricia Cabrera, spokeswoman for the System for the Integral
Development of the Family, said some of the minors who have been
returned to Mexico and remained in Ciudad Juarez tried again to
enter the neighboring country by being engaged in illegal
activities including theft.
</P>
<P>
She explained that on the basis of studies on the deported
minors, the major causes that make those minors leave their homes
are vagrancy, curiosity, disintegration of the family, and the
desire to earn money to help their families.
</P>
<P>
Cabrera said that through its programs, the institute is trying
to taking the minors out of the streets and convince them to
return to their homes.

WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's cabinet voiced their full belief in his innocence
despite allegations of his affair with a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet members pledged themselves to remain focused on
their work.
</P>
<P>
After an hour-long Cabinet meeting with Clinton to discuss
State of the Union address scheduled for next Tuesday, four

Clinton discussed briefly the enveloping crisis at the start of

</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Education Secretary
Richard Riley, Commerce Secretary William Daley and Health

Albright said Clinton told them "the allegations are untrue,
that we should stay focused on our jobs, and that he will be fine."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Veteran Deputy to People's Congress in Tibet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A 66-year-old woman, Gyain Kong,
who was re-elected as deputy to the People's Congress of Nedong
County in Tibet, for the ninth time, said she feels great pride,
and will speak on behalf of the people who elected her.
</P>
<P>
Gyain Kong, who is known for her intelligent proposals and her
willingness to represent the ordinary folk, said that a growing
number of deputies are ready to speak out on behalf of the people
and to air their views about the government. During her previous
term at the Eighth People's Congress, she submitted over 30
proposals, all of which were adopted by local government.
</P>
<P>
In the past, she was hired as a laborer by a landowner. Before
1951, she recalled, she got down on her knees to beg the man who
owned serfs for any little thing her family needed and was often
refused.
</P>
<P>
A day she will never forget is March 2, 1963 when the First
People's Congress of Nedong County was held, and all sorts of
people dressed in clothes reserved only for major festivals rushed
out to the streets and started dancing and drinking.
</P>
<P>
They surrounded the deputies, who had pieces of red cloth
pinned to their clothing, giving them Hadas and raising toasts to
them. This went on for three days and nights, as people celebrated
a festival of their own, she explained.
</P>
<P>
The first proposal Gyain Kong submitted concerned unreasonable
grain prices set by the relevant government departments, and
within two days, the problem was solved.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China kept its word, and they became the
masters of their own destiny, one of the Tibetans who drank that
evening told Gyain Kong at her residence, in celebration of the
successful proposal.

<P>
LHASA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Tibet, as well as the rest of the
country, suffered from enormous setbacks during turmoil of the
Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).
</P>
<P>
"People are free to do anything they want, and the deputies to
the People's Congresses could not play their roles well," Gyain
said, "it seemed very democratic then, however, it is destructive."
</P>
<P>
Since the third plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China held in late 1978, Tibet has witnessed
unpresidented progress in all aspects of life.
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, people have a better understanding of their power,
and know how to express their views through legal means," added
Gyain, "as a result, they are stricter in choosing their deputies
to the people's congress."
</P>
<P>
Gyain attaches great importance to the opinions of the voters,
and habitually seeks advices from them.
</P>
<P>
"Most deputies to the First People's Congress of the Nedong
County could not write and read," said Gyain, "however, lots of
deputies to the Ninth People's Congress have graduated from
universities or professional schools."
</P>
<P>
"Though 66 already, I am attending the night school," she said,
"as I hate to be lagged behind the time."

<HEADLINE> More Thai-Malaysia Cooperation in Dealing Separatists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Thai army commander-in-chief
Gen. Chettha Thanajaro said there would be more cooperation
between Thailand and Malaysia in a crackdown on separatists active
in southernmost Thai provinces.
</P>
<P>
Chettha said on Friday that in the future Thai security forces
would be able to make "hot pursuits" of separatists into
Malaysia's border areas, the Bangkok Post reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on terrorism conducted by separatists who
want to set up an independent Muslim state in Southern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
During the last two months, over a dozen bomb attacks were made
at schools, bridges, police posts and other public places.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, three separatist suspects were arrested.
They reportedly belong to the New Pattani United Liberation
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Thai authorities will make continued efforts to arrest the
remaining members of the separatist movements to restore lasting
peace to the south, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the problem was not over with the arrest of the three,
because the bomb attacks were not the work of a single person.
</P>
<P>
"It's an organized movement and we cannot solve the problem by
just arresting a few people," Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
The separatists, who make Malaysia their sanctuary, often cross
the border into Malaysia after carrying out a terrorist act in
Southern Thailand, the newspaper quoted a Thai intelligence
official as saying.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Standing by Affidavit, Lawyer Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A lawyer representing Monica
Lewinsky said on Friday the former White House intern is "at this
time" standing by a sworn affidavit that she did not have a sexual
relationship with President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Sworn and signed on January 7, and submitted to lawyers
handling Paula Corbin Jones's sexual harassment suit against
Clinton, the affidavit contradicts secretly-recorded tapes in
which Lewinsky claimed to have had sexual relations with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has repeatedly denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
In the affidavit, Lewinsky stated, "I have the utmost respect
for the president, who always behaved appropriately in my
presence. I have never had a sexual relationship with the
president."
</P>
<P>
She said in the affidavit, "He did not propose that we have a
sexual relationship. He did not offer me employment or other
benefits in exchange for a sexual relationship. He did not deny me
employment or other benefits for rejecting a sexual relationship."
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky's longtime family attorney, William Ginsburg, when
answering reporters' questions, said, "She will stand on the sworn
affidavit at this time."
</P>
<P>
Many people in Washington were waiting to hear what Lewinsky
would say in her deposition, which had been scheduled for Friday,
but was indefinitely delayed by U.S. District Judge Susan Webber
Wright.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky was reportedly considering invoking her Fifth
Amendment right to decline to answer questions from Jones's
attorneys at the deposition.
</P>
<P>
The tapes in which Lewinsky claimed to have had an affair with
Clinton were recorded with a hidden device by Lewinsky's alleged
friend, Linda Tripp, who has tried previously to serve as a
whistle-blower in the Clinton White House.

<HEADLINE> China Exports 27 Million Tons of Coal Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- China Coal Import and Export
Group (CCIEG) exported 27.48 million tons of coal in 1997, 1.54
million tons more than that of 1996, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Wang Changchun, chairman and president of
the CCIEG, as saying that the company exported 280,000 tons of coke,
an increase of 60.9 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
It also exported machinery, electronic equipment and other
commodities valued at 12.2 million U.S. dollars, up 19.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The company's total foreign trade volume was 1.19 billion
U.S. dollars last year, of which the exports made up 1.03 billion
U.S. dollars. It made 400 million yuan of profits in the past
year, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
The company made great efforts to overcome difficulties brought
along by a stagnant international coal market and decreased coal
import by overseas customers in the wake of the Southeast
Asia's financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the company would export more coal by taking more
effective measures in the next three years. The company will tap
new markets in South America and South Asia while cementing its
traditional market shares in Japan, the Republic of Korea and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
It will also start its own fleets to ship coal for export and
will rely on the newly-built Nanning-Kunming Railway to export
more coal to South Asia and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
By the year of 2000, the CCIEG is expected to export 40 million
tons of coal, representing 80 percent of the country's total
planned coal export.
</P>
<P>
With China National Coal Industry Import and Export Co as its
core, the CCIEG was officially established by merging four other coal
companies in August 1997 and is responsible for doing most of the
country's coal export and import business.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Launch Campaign to Save Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will
encourage people to use less water in a three-month campaign aimed
at preparing the country for an expected severe drought this year.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, which is to begin in February, would help educate
people on how to use water sparingly in most practical ways, said
Pinit Charusombat, deputy interior minister overseeing the
Provincial Waterworks Authority (PWA), the local press reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Pinit hoped the campaign would reduce water consumption by over
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
This would minimize the impact of the expected water shortage
resulting from prolonged dry spells in many areas last year.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the success of the campaign, Pinit said he and PWA
officials would make house calls which aim to increase the
public's awareness about water conservation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- China's homebound passenger
volume is approaching its peak as the Year of Tiger is just four
days away, Niu Mi, director of Beijing Spring Travel Office was
quoted as saying by today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"The number of people leaving Beijing by air and train or buses
for the Spring Festival increased from 297,000 on January 8, when
the year's spring travel period stated, to 417,000 on Tuesday,"
Niu said.
</P>
<P>
The figure is expected to surge today and tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 pairs of outbound and return trains had been added
to alleviate the spring travel congestion in Beijing, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Between January 8 and 22, a total of 5,265 flights flew to or
left Beijing Capital International Airport, transporting more than
602,900 passengers, Wang Hongbo, an official with Air China,
China's flagship carrier, said.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed: "Tickets for most airlines have sold out." And the
airport terminal building was crowded with anxious passengers.
</P>
<P>
A total of 7.6 million passengers was expected to travel by air
during the 50-day spring travel period, sources from the Civil
Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said.
</P>
<P>
Based on meticulous market research, the administration has
added 4,256 extra flights or charters to help resolve any
bottleneck in the air.
</P>
<P>
"Air China will dispatch more flights to cover destinations in
the country's southern coastal areas and the Southeast Asia
region," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that as more passengers chose to spend the festival
abroad, his company had planned more flights heading for Bangkok
and Singapore from tomorrow to February 2.
</P>
<P>
Since last November, price cuts in China's air companies have
ranged from five percent to 40 percent, sources from the CAAC
said.

<HEADLINE> PGR on Probe of Chiapas Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Attorney General of the
Republic Office (PGR) of Mexico published Friday a report on the
progress made in the investigation of the massacre of 45
indigenous persons in Acteal, Chiapas, which occurred last
December 22.
</P>
<P>
A communique from the PGR says that the investigation of the
killings in the village of Acteal, in the Chenalho municipality,
continues its course, and reiterates that the PGR will apply the
law to all the persons who have some responsibility in the case.
</P>
<P>
The document says that at least 60 persons from several
communities of the Chenalho municipality attacked with firearms a
group of persons, members of the "Las Abejas" (the Bees) group,
who had settled in a camp in the Acteal village.
</P>
<P>
It adds that 20 of the dead persons were women, four of them
pregnant, 18 minors, and seven adult men. 43 of the corpses had
injuries caused by firearms, and two died of skull fractures.
</P>
<P>
The PGR said that at least 15 firearms of several calibers were
used in the massacre, among them five rifles of 7.62 milimeter
bore, better known as "goat's horn."
</P>
<P>
The PGR has detained so far 60 persons, of which 50 were sent
to the disposition of district judges in the state of Chiapas,
where they heard a notification of formal prison. Those persons
remain at the "Cerro Hueco" penitentiary in Tuxtla Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
Three other detained persons, who are minors, are in the Center
of Diagnosis and Treatment of Minors.
</P>
<P>
The local Public Attorney General Office did not find enough
reasons to incarcerate the remaining seven persons, so they were
released under the reservations of the law.
</P>
<P>
Of those processed, 48 are private citizens and two are former
public officials (Jacinto Arias, Chenalho acting mayor, and Felipe
Vazquez, public security commander).
</P>
<P>
The PGR press communique says that all the cases in which
participated witnesses or alleged responsible, were made following
the law and human rights.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Not to Issue Horse Race Lottery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has no plan of building
a horse race course, said an official with the Beijing Welfare
Lottery Issuing Center.
</P>
<P>
Yan Feng, director of the center, rebutted reports that the
center will support issuance of a horse racing lottery, according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Horse racing for betting purposes is not allowed on the Chinese
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Yan made the remarks in response to some rumor reports that a
subsidiary of US-based company, Chancellor, will partner Beijing Dadu
International Jockey Club Co. to open a horse race course and to
issue a lottery in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The reports, released through the Internet since last May, were
accompanied by photocopy of a letter of intent signed by Yan's
center in 1993 and the Beijing Zhida Development Co., a major
shareholder of Dadu. The letter was about the two sides'
cooperation on lottery issuing.
</P>
<P>
"The letter was invalid because it did not get approval from
the Issuing Center of China Social Welfare Lottery," Yan was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yan's center has informed Zhida last September that the letter
of intent has been officially canceled.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Dadu said it does not have any connections with
Chancellor and its subsidiaries, according to Yan.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Dadu has not opened for business yet. With
the ban on horse race gambling, the company, although holding the
name "jockey club", cannot hold horse race even if it does open,
Yan was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Vice President Denounces U.S. Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican Vice President
Rodrigo Oreamuno denounced Friday the warning made by the U.S.
State Department about the dangers of traveling in Pavones area of
Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
Oreamuno said some national and foreign media have interviewed
citizens residing in Pavones, as well as foreign tourists, and
they have testified that everything is normal in Pavones of Costa
Rica.
</P>
<P>
"All of them say they feel secure and tranquil, and friendship
is in the air," underscored the Costa Rican Vice President.
</P>
<P>
"We consider it unfair and biased for the Department of State
to warn its citizens against visiting the area."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. warning was made after a U.S. national was killed in
Pavones, next to the Panamanian border last year.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to make the U.S. government change that
attitude," said Oreamuno.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican government has repeatedly denounced the
position of the U.S. government.

FUZHOU, January 24 (Xinhua) -- More and more residents in east
China's Fujian Province have had their own houses since 1997.
</P>
<P>
The total floor space of commercial housing sold from January
to November last year hit one million square meters, up 14
percent over the same period of 1996, according to the provincial
statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Bureau officials said the individual demand for commercial
houses is expected to continue to rise this year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 10.2 billion yuan (1.27 billion
U.S. dollars) was invested last year in Fujian's real estate
market, up 9.3 percent over the same period of 1996. Of that
total, 9.5 billion yuan was poured into the construction of
commercial housing, an increase of 1.8 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
The stable growth of investment in the province's real estate
market may indicate the recovery of the industry, said sector

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Region of China to Increase Grain Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, which had good grain harvests for three
consecutive years, plans to increase grain production by 400,000
tons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The region reported 16.61 million tons of grain in 1997,
550,000 tons more than 1996, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, the regional government will give priority
to the application of 10 agricultural techniques, including hybrid
seed and plastic sheeting for maize growing.
</P>
<P>
The plan is encouraging, considering a predicted decline of
China's grain output in 1998, as agriculture has already faced
pressure arising from low prices for grain last year,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China produced 492.5 million tons of grain, almost the
same amount of grain as it did in 1996.

<HEADLINE> China's Talent Shortage Could Pose Development Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- China could face a talent
deficiency due to its aging population and rapid economic growth,
according to a survey conducted by China's Association of Senior
Citizens.
</P>
<P>
Among more than one million people who have acquired senior
professional titles, the ones below 45 years old account for only
6.3 percent; and those younger than 35, 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, more than half of China's senior engineers,
researchers and agricultural technicians will go into retirement,
which could result in a talent scarcity for a long period of time,
the survey said.
</P>
<P>
"The insufficiency of human resources is partly caused by the
Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), which inflicted an interruption
upon the training of a generation of intellectuals," one expert
said.
</P>
<P>
Many intellectuals have gone abroad and stayed in foreign
countries, which also exacerbated the problem. The number of
Chinese students who studied abroad from 1978 to 1996 was 270,000,
and fewer than one-third returned to China, the survey said.

<HEADLINE> Aquatic Products Industry in Guangxi of China Growing Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The aquatic products industry in
southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has undergone
rapid expansion because of controlled exploitation and protection
of fishery resources, officials say.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that production of the region's aquatic
products in 1997 reached 1.9 million tons, a 7.3 percent
increase over 1996, ranking ninth in the country. Its aquatic
products last year was valued at 10 billion yuan (1.25 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
And the per-capita consumption of aquatic products in the
region rose from 7.7 kilograms in 1990 to the present 23
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the region exported more than 20,000 tons of aquatic
products, earning 50 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
So far, the region has 20,000 fishing boats with 600,000
employees and a fish-breeding area of about 200,000 hectares. And
more than 35 aquatic products processing factories have been
built, with an annual processing capacity of 100,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The coastal cities of Beihai, Qinzhou and Fangchenggang
produce 1.3 million tons of aquatic products every year, worth six
billion yuan (770 million U.S. dollars). The output of sea fishing
accounts for 70 percent of the region's total aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the fishing industry will become a driving
force for the local economy.
</P>
<P>
The region is projected to increase its aquatic products by
250,000 tons a year during the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000) period, according to the officials.

<HEADLINE> Football Referee May Be Wrong Sometimes, Study Suggests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Criticisms of football referees'
eyesight by fans may contain a grain of scientific truth
sometimes, according to a study published today.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from Spain have discovered that because of the way
the eye focuses, the eye of the assistant referee, formerly known
as the linesman, sometimes cannot keep pace with the feet of a
footballer.
</P>
<P>
Dr Jaime Sanabria and colleagues, from the Fundacion Jimenez
Diaz in Madrid, looked at the problem with the help of a referee
from the Spanish Royal Football Federation.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the medical journal Lancet, they said that the
assistant referee has "an erroneous image of the initial positions
of the players at the exact moment the pass of the ball began."
</P>
<P>
The off-side rule requires the assistant referee to judge where
the attacker was at the exact moment when the ball was passed to
him by one of his own side.
</P>
<P>
But researchers found that eye takes 250-300 milliseconds to
fucus an image on the tiny spot in the center of retina known as
the fovea which "sees" best.
</P>
<P>
In that time, an attacker and defender who started in the same
horizontal line on the pitch can be as much as 4.5 meters apart.
</P>
<P>
The result is that the referee will "see" an attacker and
defender running apart when, in fact, they are level.

Lavrov said monitoring would be essential even after the
lifting of sanctions. This made it important to avoid any steps
which would risk losing its UN monitoring system in Iraq and which
would risk disruption of relations between Iraq and the United
Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador implicitly rejected any military solution to the
latest crisis between Iraq and the United Nations over UN arms
inspection teams access to all sites.

<HEADLINE> US Oil Firms Feel Weight of Falling Crude Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Lower crude-oil prices
weighed down the fourth-quarter earnings of some of the major oil
companies in the United States and the impact may extend to 1998,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Companies such as Chevron and Texaco showed good performances in
the fourth quarter of 1997 but others faired not so well, according
to their latest quarterly reports.
</P>
<P>
Amoco, for example, reported lower earnings, hurt by lower
margins in its petroleum products unit and a drop of 33 percent in
its chemicals unit income.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the continuing sharp decline in oil and natural
gas prices may apply downward pressure on oil companies in their
first quarter earnings and may imply difficulties in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that some firms are performing well now in
their refining and marketing units, this is not going to be enough
to make up for their weaker exploration, production and chemicals
earnings, they said.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have dropped some five dollars a barrel to the
current levels approaching 15 dollars a barrel since last November
as there have been growing concerns about shrinking demand from
Asia and rising output from the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil futures plunged
Thursday to the 45-month low.
</P>
<P>
The nearby March crude-oil contract, the futures contract
nearest to physical delivery fell 32 32 cents to 16.04 dollars a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
In overnight trading the contract dropped 45 cents to 15.91
dollars a barrel, the lowest level since April 1994.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Iraq Standoff Unacceptable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said today the face-off with Iraq over weapons
inspections was "unacceptable" and should not be allowed to
continue.
</P>
<P>
"The situation as Chairman (Richard) Butler (chief U.N. weapons
inspector) described it is unacceptable.... This is not going to
be something that can last much longer," she told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the United States was waiting for Butler's report
to the U.N. Security Council today on his latest trip to Baghdad
seeking to resolve the standoff.
</P>
<P>
After that, "we are going to be consulting with our allies and
other members of the Security Council on next steps," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that the Iraqi regime continues to be out
of compliance" with Security Council's demands imposed after the
1991 Gulf War, she said.
</P>
<P>
"As we have all said, we would prefer to have a diplomatic
solution. The president (Bill Clinton) made that clear. But we are
not ruling any options out," she said. "Again as the president
said, something is going to give in this situation sooner or
later." But Albright declined to give any deadline for that.

GENEVA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland has promised an
extra-budgetary contribution of 1.44 million Swiss francs (about
1 million US dollars) to the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD).

</P>
<P>
"UNCTAD is very gratified by this latest instance of generous

enhance the expertise of developing countries in investment issues
and to develop their legal and administrative infrastructure in
this field.

<HEADLINE> German FM Urges International Aid for Serb Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel today said that he has proposed an international action
program to help the Bosnian Serb Republic after the election of a
moderate government there last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today, Kinkel said that the election of
the new Serb government had offered "a great chance to make 1998 a
year of reconstruction, return of refugees and self-sustained
stability in Bosnia."
</P>
<P>
In order to encourage the Serb government to fulfill its
pledges to implement the Dayton peace agreements, Kinkel said he
had urged the European Union to swiftly release the already
pledged financial aid to the Serb Republic and to consider further
help.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Kinkel had proposed to the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund to come up with their contributions to
the Serb entity.
</P>
<P>
On the part of Germany, the Foreign Ministry would provide
about 400,000 marks (about 200,000 U.S. dollars) to help set up
ministries of the Serb new government, Kinkel said, adding that
more financial aid from the German government and political
foundations were also being considered.
</P>
<P>
The German foreign minister also noted that of the remaining
250,000 Bosnian refugees in Germany, about 180,000 were from the
Serb Republic. The repatriation of those refugees would only make
great progress when reconstruction got under way in the Serb
Republic, he said.

<HEADLINE> Mix of Cheap Drugs Could Cut Heart Attacks: Researchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A combination of aspirin and
warfarin is at least 60 percent more effective at preventing heart
attacks than either drug taken alone, British researchers said
today.
</P>
<P>
A study of 5,500 men aged between 45 and 69 at high risk of
disease found that the two drugs taken together reduced the
occurrence of a first heart attack by a third.
</P>
<P>
The result of the seven-year trial, supported by the UK Medical
Research Council, was published in the medical journal The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
It found that over a year, if 1,000 high-risk men were given
the combined treatment, then five heart attacks would be avoided.
</P>
<P>
If the same number were given aspirin or warfarin alone, then
three heart attacks would be avoided. If no treatment was given,
there would be 13 heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary in The Lancet, Professor Freek Verheugt,
cardiologist at the University Hospital of Nijmegen, the
Netherlands, said that the trial "clearly indicates that there are
other and less expensive drugs for reducing the incidence of heart
attacks."
</P>
<P>
However, he added that a recommendation that everyone should
take aspirin is not advisable because the incidence of heart
attacks in the general population is so low and the drug does
carry some risk of stomach irritation and bleeding.

<HEADLINE> US Gov't Records 13.6 Bln Dlr Budget Surplus in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. federal government
recorded a 13.6 billion U.S. dollar budget surplus in December,
the Treasury Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The big surplus helped slim the deficit for the first three
months of fiscal 1998, which started in October to just two-thirds
of the deficit accumulated during the same period of the previous
budget year.
</P>
<P>
December's surplus compares with an 18.5 billion dollar deficit
in the previous December. The budget shortfall for the first
quarter of the fiscal year, was 39.7 billion dollars, down 33
percent from the corresponding period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
That puts the 1998 deficit on track to come in under last
year's 23-year low of 22 billion dollars. President Bill Clinton
is scheduled to submit his 1999 budget to Congress on February 3.
Government officials believe it will mark the first balanced
budget in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
In December, receipts totaled 168 billion dollars, compared
with spending of 154.4 billion dollars. The biggest spending
categories were interest on the public debt, 67.7 billion dollars;
Social Security, 35.6 billion dollars; the Department of Health
and Human Services, including Medicare and Medicaid, 33 billion
dollars; and the military, 25.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
For the first quarter of the fiscal year, receipts totaled
386.4 billion dollars, up 11.7 percent from a year ago. Spending
totaled 426.1 billion dollars, up 5.1 percent. Corporate tax
receipts were up 21.5 percent to 51.2 billion dollars and
individual income tax payments 10.7 percent to 176.3 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Down on Weak Dollar, Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
sustained their recent losses and ended the week in the negative
ground, undermined by fallout from the Asian turmoil and a weak
dollar and Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index finished a thin trading session 71.7
points or 1.36 percent down for the third day in a row at 5,181.4,
81.7 points lower on the week.
</P>
<P>
London had confined its losses to about 25 points until the
opening bell in New York, but soon extended its fall as the Dow
was hit by a sell program.
</P>
<P>
Weakness in the March FTSE future also weighed on sentiment
here.
</P>
<P>
Oils lost ground after disappointing results from some of the
US oil giants, with British Petroleum and Shell falling 4.24 and
3.97 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index in Frankfurt closed floor trading at 4,237.31,
up 17.06 points. But volumes were thin as investors seemed loath
to commit ahead of the weekend, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
In later screen-based trade the IBIS DAX index ended down 16.61
points at 4,222.16.
</P>
<P>
French shares in Paris finished the session 22.44 points lower
at 2,966.15, a fall of 9.94 from last week, as share prices were
depressed by the weaker dollar and profit-taking at the end of the
monthly account.

<HEADLINE> Greece Decides to Scrap Article 19 of Citizenship Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Greek cabinet decided today
to abolish article 19 of the citizenship code enabling the state
to strip members of ethnic minorities of their citizenship when
they leave the country with the intention of not returning.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that a draft
law would soon be tabled in Greece's parliament approving the
cabinet's decision.
</P>
<P>
The provision, he said, had in fact become inoperative because
only 70 persons lost last year their Greek citizenship in
accordance with the provision.
</P>
<P>
The article had come into force by virtue of a legislative
decree in 1955, and 60,000 people had since lost their Greek
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greece's Interior, Public Administration and
Decentralization Minister Alekos Papadopoulos said today that
article 20 of the same code which enables the state to strip
persons of their citizenship for espionage would remain in force.

WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- An Indiana nurse was
arrested Thursday on charges of giving deadly injections to
patients, the United Press International said in a report today.
</P>
<P>
Cheryl May, 32, was arrested as a result of investigations on
dozens of deaths at three nursing homes in Fort Wayne County where
May worked.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a nurse who worked with May told police
she once suggested a deadly injection for a whining patient.
Police have confiscated a bottle of a morphine-containing drug
Roxanol from the nursing station where May worked at Courtland
Health and Rehabilitation Center.
</P>
<P>
Last month a former licensed practical nurse was arrested on
similar but unrelated charges for six deaths at a hospital in
Clinton, Indiana.

<P>
Reports quoted authorities as saying that Orville Lynn Majors
Jr. may have given lethal injections to as many as 165 patients
over a 22-month period.

UNITED NATIONS, January 23 (xinhua) -- The United Nations
Economic and Social Council today decided to hold its first
high-level special meeting to improve cooperation with the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be held on April 18, close to the semi-annual

step by the council in implementing a May 1996 General Assembly
resolution aimed at revitalizing the United Nations in the
economic, social and related fields.
</P>
<P>
By that resolution, the assembly decided that in order for the
council to improve its link with the international financial and

Woods institutions. The idea was to enable the council to benefit
from the presence of ministers and other leaders in the world.
