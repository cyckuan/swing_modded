<HEADLINE> U.S. Spending on Construction Up in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Construction spending in
the U.S. rebounded by 0.9 percent in August, the U.S. Commerce
Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that residential, nonresidential and
government spending on construction totaled 562.1 billion dollars
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in August.
</P>
<P>
The spending in July was also revised to a fall of 1.1 percent
other than a decline of 1.4 percent announced earlier.
</P>
<P>
The increase in construction in August was the largest since a
1.4 percent gain in last April and also the fourth advance in the
past six months.
</P>
<P>
Residential outlays, including remodeling projects, were
unchanged at a 244 billion rate after falling for three straight
months.
</P>
<P>
Spending on single-family homes, about 30 percent of total
construction spending in the U.S., inched up 0.1 percent for a
second straight month.
</P>
<P>
The slow increase in the interest-sensitive single-family
market resulted from a higher interest rates. Thirty-year,
fixed-rate mortgages have averaged 8 percent in August, an
increase of 1 percentage point from 7.03 percent in last January.
</P>
<P>
Spending on multifamily projects such as apartments and
condominiums, which are not as sensitive to interest-rate changes,
rose 3.4 percent following a drop of 14.4 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Nonresidential spending, about one-fourth of the total, jumped
by 3 percent to a record 139.5 billion dollars rate, up from 135.5
billion in July when it fell 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Government outlays, held back in recent months by budgetary
cutbacks, fell 0.2 percent to an annualized 138.7 billion dollars
after falling 0.7 percent in July.

<HEADLINE> Press Hails End of Sanctions, Economists Less Optimistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Daily newspapers published in
Belgrade Wednesday all hailed the United Nations' decision to lift
sanctions against Yugoslavia, but economic analysts warned that
little will change until the "outer wall" of the sanctions
collapses.
</P>
<P>
The outer wall refers to the denial of Yugoslavia's access to
the U.N. General Assembly and international financial institutions
such as the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Headlines in the special edition of the Belgrade daily,
Politika, said the U.N. Security Council had unanimously,
definitely and formally lifted the economic sanctions against
Yugoslavia on Tuesday, after four years and four months.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed on May 30, 1992 for Yugoslavia's
alleged involvement in the Bosnian civil war. On November 22,
1995, one day after the Dayton accord was reached, the
U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 1022 to suspend the
sanctions as a reward for Belgrade's important role in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 1022 was the basis for last night's vote to lift the
sanctions, Politika said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, the sanctions were to be definitely
lifted 10 days after the elections in Bosnia were successfully
held on September 14. But the U.N. decision was delayed until the
Bosnian elections were verified last Sunday by the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
In a headline, Politika also quoted Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic as saying that the lifting would help achieve stable
peace and an overall economic and social development in the
country devastated economically by the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other dailies in Belgrade also splashed front page
stories and editorials, welcoming the U.N. decision.
</P>
<P>
As newspapers hailed the U.N. decision as a historic move
allowing the country to return to the international community and
recover its economy, Yugoslav economists warned that the economy
could not be quickly revived with the "outer wall" of sanctions
still in place.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is composed of Serbia and
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
Economists said little could be achieved if the country didn't
get credits and investment from outside.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Leaves for Controversial Africa Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's pro-Islamic Welfare
Party (RP) Chairman and Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan left
here today for his controversial trip to Egypt, Libya and Nigeria
against the advice of foreign ministry officials and even some
important men from his own party.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News reported today that the concern is that his
visit to Libya and Nigeria is considered by the West as acts of
defiance.
</P>
<P>
The junior coalition partner True Path Party (DYP) has
expressed its own opposition to this visit by refusing to send
any ministers in the delegation of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Mehmet Agar (DYP) has strongly opposed the
visit, saying that he would refuse to sign the government decree
authorizing them.
</P>
<P>
This is Erbakan's second trip abroad. The first one in August
included Iran which the United States is trying to isolate.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has its own problem with Libya, which owes Turkish
contractors 350 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Turkish State Minister and close aide of Erbakan Abdullah Gul
told reporters Tuesday that Erbakan's visit to the Moslem
countries of Africa, and particularly to Libya would yield
important economic benefits to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Gul said that Libya was a country where Turkish contractors
had undertaken projects worth 14 billion dollars so far and were
currently engaged in building contracts totalling 2.5 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Sermet Atacanli said
on Monday that Erbakan's trip to Egypt, Libya and Nigeria was
aimed at developing economic ties with those countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Defence Minister
Moven Mahachi has said Africa does not have the capacity to
manage an all-African force and the idea has already been
rejected by the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Mahachi told reporters on Tuesday that his government had
always been against the setting up of a continental army.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot form an all-African army because African countries
cannot embark on such an exercise. Charity begins at home. We
should find ways to look after our own armies before we can form
a continental force," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to recent press reports which said the
United States Assistant Secretary of State, George Moose, was in
Africa last week soliciting troops commitments from Botswana,
Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and
Zimbabwe for an all-African force.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Forces Placed on Emergency Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean armed forces were
placed on an emergency alert this afternoon after Pyongyang
threatened to retaliate over the killing of its soldiers in South
Korea last month, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said tonight.
</P>
<P>
However, the JCS said that the army had not yet raised its
normal vigilance status of "Watch Condition 3" to the next higher
level, "Watch Condition 2."
</P>
<P>
The emergency alert was ordered by President Kim Young-sam when
he talked with Defense Minister Lee Yang-ho over the phone.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kim was briefed on the outcome of the meeting between
representatives of the United States Forces Korea (USFK) and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in the truce village
of Panmunjom this morning.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the DPRK representative threatened to take
retaliatory steps against South Korea for killing a group of DPRK
armed people last month. Pyongyang said the group had to go ashore
in South Korea because of engine trouble in their submarine during
a routine training mission.
</P>
<P>
The representative said that serious consequences would occur
in the foreseeable future as a result of the deaths.
</P>
<P>
But he did not specify what the "serious consequences" might
be, adding that the "consequences" would be announced later.
</P>
<P>
South Korea insisted that the group of 26 DPRK armed people had
"infiltrated" into Kangnung County, Kangwon Province, from a
grounded submarine in the East Sea (Sea of Japan) on September 18.
</P>
<P>
It said that the case was not an "inadvertent incident that
occurred during routine training" as the DPRK said, but was a
"carefully premediated act of provocation."
</P>
<P>
During the past two weeks, 11 of the 26 DPRK soldiers were
found to have killed themselves, 11 were killed by South Korean
troops and one was captured alive. Three others are reportedly
still at large.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has asked the south to return the submarine as well as
its crew, but the request was turned down by Seoul.

WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher met here today with Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy and Palestinian negotiators Nabil Shaath and Yasser
Rabbo in search for a formula to renew Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The meeting followed almost all-night talks between U.S.
Mideast coordinator Dennis Ross and Israeli and Palestinian
officials.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the talks is a statement that could be

flagging negotiations between the two sides after the emergency
summit of Israeli and Palestinian leaders in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Christopher "is trying to bridge some of the differences," said
one senior American official who asked not to be identified. He
was referring especially to a dispute over Israeli troops in the
West Bank of Hebron and Israel's opening of a new entrance to a
tourist viewing tunnel that winds near the Temple Mount and its
Muslim and Jewish holy sites.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the discussions overnight, these talks are at a
very intensive stage. But very serious issues remain. There is a
lot of hard work ahead today but the Secretary is determined to
push forward," U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria, Panama Admitted into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization
(WTO) today decided to admit Bulgaria and Panama as members.
</P>
<P>
The decisions came after a meeting of the WTO General Council
at which the schedules of tariff concessions on goods and
commitments on services of the two countries were approved.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria, whose membership application has been under
consideration since 1986, will be the first transition economy
from Central and Eastern Europe, which was not a GATT member, to
be admitted into its successor, the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was
replaced by the WTO on January 1, last year.
</P>
<P>
With the admittance of Panama, Latin American countries will be
fully represented on the world trade body.
</P>
<P>
Technically, Bulgaria and Panama still have to have their
admission protocols ratified by their parliaments before they
formally become WTO members.
</P>
<P>
The world trade watchdog will grow to a 127-member body later
this month if two other countries, Chad and Gambia -- both were
GATT members -- formally join the organization as scheduled.

<HEADLINE> French Delegate for New Caledonia Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- France's inter-ministerial
delegate for New Caledonia, Yves Cabana, has resigned amid a
dispute between the French government and the independence
supporters of the South Pacific archipelago, the prime minister's
office said today.
</P>
<P>
Central to the dispute is disagreement over the exploitation of
nickel ore.
</P>
<P>
Cabana, 37, represented Paris in negotiations with two groups
in February 1995 -- the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front
(FLNKS), which supports independence from France, and the Rally
for Caledonia in the Republic (RPCR), an anti-independence body.
</P>
<P>
He was nominated in May that year as inter-ministerial delegate
in charge of negotiating with FLNKS and RPCR over the future of
the colony, which will hold a referendum in 1998 on whether to
choose independence or not.
</P>
<P>
His nomination was strongly opposed by the FLNKS, which said
his name was "too much linked with the failures of past
negotiations" between it and the French government. FLNKS has been
fighting for independence for about a decade.
</P>
<P>
While accepting Cabana's resignation, Prime Minister Alain
Juppe has sent a letter to FLNKS's president Rock Wamytan.
</P>
<P>
The letter promised to arrange talks between the government and
FLNKS in mid-October on the exploitation of a nickel ore in the
north of the archipelago, said Dominique Bur, the governor of New
Caledonia.
</P>
<P>
The FLNKS had asked the French government to allow it to
exploit part of the ore in the northern area of the archipelago,
which is administered by FLNKS and economically poorer than the
southern part.
</P>
<P>
The ore is now largely owned by the French state company
ERAMET, which had rejected the request by FLNKS.
</P>
<P>
The FLNKS wants to jointly launch a nickel factory with the
Canadian company Falconbridge.
</P>
<P>
Bur said the French government "reaffirms its resolute support"
to this project, which it regarded as "a response to the problem
of development of northern New Caledonia and the central question
of the re-balancing (in economic development) of the territory".
</P>
<P>
The French Overseas Territories Minister, Jean-Jacques de
Peretti, who has nominated Gilbert Carriere to replace Cabana,
would attend negotiations between representatives of ERAMET and
FLNKS, he added.

<HEADLINE> HK Governor Delivers Last Policy Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Governor of Hong Kong Chris
Patten delivered his fifth and last policy address to the local
Legislative Council here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In his annual address, which is titled "Hong Kong: Transition,"
Patten reviewed the development of Hong Kong from the last century
to the present day, especially in the past decade. He said that
China's success is Hong Kong's opportunity and Hong Kong has
benefited from China's economic reforms and opening up.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that since the Sino-British Joint Declaration
on the Question of Hong Kong was signed in 1984, Hong Kong's GDP
has almost doubled in real terms. The fiscal reserves have
increased almost six-fold, exports by almost 330 percent in real
terms, and investment by over 120 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that the plenary sessions and many expert group
meetings held by the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group this year
have resulted in agreement or consensus on a number of important
issues.
</P>
<P>
But, he noted, there remains a significant amount of work to be
completed, including the transfer of government, legal matters,
immigration issues and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Patten pledged that he and his government will give assistance
to the Chief Executive Designate of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), but claimed that he will not assist
the establishment and operation of the Provisional Legislative
Council.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British Hong Kong government today also
published a series of reports, including "Policy Commitments,"
"Progress Report" and "Legislative Program," which have listed
more than 40 proposed ordinances for the Legislative Council to
approve in the next nine months.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported that many of the citizens are disappointed
with Patten's address.
</P>
<P>
Many people doubted about Hong Kong government's claimed
achievements in the past year, for they are far from people's
expectation.
</P>
<P>
Some local newspapers said that there is nothing new or
improvement in Patten's policy address.

<P>
GENEVA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin boosted St. Petersburg's bid to stage the 2004
Olympics after visiting the headquarters of the International
Olympic Committee Wednesday in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin met with IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and
then joined Samaranch for a tour of the Olympic Museum, saying
winning the games would be worldwide affirmation of Russia's
"irreversible" efforts to become "a normal, civilized society".
</P>
<P>
He rejected suggestions that hosting the games would prove an
economic burden.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin also told reporters that St. Petersburg's bid
would run into stiff opposition.
</P>
<P>
"It will not be easy for the IOC to choose," he was quoted as
saying. "There are a lot of things that have to be taken into
account.''
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency said Chernomyrdin was confident that
St. Petersburg would win.

<HEADLINE> France to Renounce Use of Land-mines at Ottawa Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- France will renounce the use of
land-mines at an international meeting in Ottawa on the banning of
land-mines to be held this week, and it will reduce its arsenal of
land-mines, said French government spokesman Alain Lamassoure
today.
</P>
<P>
"The president of the republic is delighted with the role of
motor engine played by France in the movement towards the total
ban of this scourge," he said at a meeting of government
ministers.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that France would support the conclusion of
an international treaty which would be "legally binding and
technically verifiable" to ban the use of land-mines in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Eighty to 100 million land-mines are dispersed in 64 countries
around the world, killing 1,000 people and mutilating 2,000 each
year when there is no war operations going on, said the French
government.
</P>
<P>
Lamassoure said that France has stopped producing land-mines
and has imposed a moratorium on exporting land-mines since 1986.
</P>
<P>
"In Ottawa, France will solemnly indicate that it renounces
the use of anti-personnel land-mines, except in the case of
absolute necessity imposed by the protection of its troops in the
framework of a military operation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that France is studying the possibility of
replacing the old land-mines with a new type of land-mine, which
can destroy itself within a period of time.

<HEADLINE> EC/World Bank Reports: Bosnian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The pace of reconstruction in
post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina has accelerated markedly,
according to a new report from the European Commission (EC) and
the World Bank for the on-going 1996 Annual Meetings of the Bank
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
In their first status report to the donors, the EC and Bank
said that, eight months into the reconstruction effort, there is
much progress to report on the ground in the collaborative effort
between the Bosnians and the international community to rebuild
the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The two institutions jointly held two donor conferences in
December 1995 and April 1996, during which received 1.89 billion
U.S. dollars pledged assistance. The study shows that most of the
proposed assistance has been translated into commitments for
specific programs. Some 880 million dollars is under
implementation. Of this total, an estimated 558 million dollars
has been disbursed for critical reconstruction and related
activities, tripling the disbursement rate of the first six
months. A further some 500 million dollars could be tendered or
contracted by the end of this year, bringing the total under
implementation to nearly 1.4 billion dollars, or about 75 percent
of 1996 pledges.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that pushed by the reconstruction efforts,
during August the first train in four years departed from Sarajevo
for the port of Ploce on rehabilitated rail lines. In the same
month, the Sarajevo airport opened to commercial air traffic.
Repairs are underway on two key bridges which will regularize a
major road link between Sarajevo and Mostar. Rehabilitation of
three principal power generation plants and four main transmission
lines is also underway. District heat installations in 32,000
flats in Sarajevo are being renovated in preparation for the
coming winter. Some 3,000 head of livestock have been imported.
Commerce is picking up, due to in part some donor-funded lines of
credit to small businesses. Besides, essential social support
supplements are being made monthly to over 400,000 needy citizens.
</P>
<P>
The EC-World Bank report lists four sections that will be
required to maintain the accelerated development pace which
include some 647 million dollars in firm commitments still awaits
tendering, it is time now for donors to budget for 1997 needs,
donors should coordinate more actively in their programs with each
other and ensure an active role for the government through
sectoral task force and as the reconstruction effort matures,
providing for sustainability of investments over the medium-term
will be key issue.

<HEADLINE> Labor Takes Action to Promote Women's Representation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLACKPOOL, ENGLAND, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Party said
today that the fair representation of women in positions of power
"is essential to ensure that the needs of the whole society are
properly considered in decision making".
</P>
<P>
Labor is the first major political party in Britain to have
taken action to promote equality for women at all levels of its
organization.
</P>
<P>
"The operation of the quota requiring equal representation of
women and men at all levels has gradually transformed and enriched
the party organization," said a statement released by the Party's
Annual Conference.
</P>
<P>
In previous years the great majority of conference delegates
were men but now the rules ensure a better balance between the
sexes. Every second delegate from a local party must be a woman.
</P>
<P>
According to the new rule, if a constituency party sends one
male delegate one year, it must send a female delegate the next.
This year 320 delegates are men. 425 are women.
</P>
<P>
"This is desirable in itself, but it is also likely to make the
party more attractive to women voters, whose support is crucial to
our electoral success," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In many countries, the statement said "progressive parties are
taking action to promote women's representation in parliament.
Labor is determined to carry through this change in Britain."
</P>
<P>
The party strongly reaffirmed its commitment to achieve equal
representation for women at all levels of government, the
Parliamentary Labor Party, the Scottish Parliament, Welsh
Assembly, English Regional Chambers and local government.
</P>
<P>
The Party therefore decided to create the National Executive
Committee (NEC) Working Committee on Parliamentary Selection,
whose aims include the development of measures to promote
representation of both women and ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
The Party's Annual Conference calls upon the Committee to bring
forward urgent proposals to further improve the representation of
women in parliament, taking account of international experience
and Labor's commitment to update the Sex Discrimination Act.

PARIS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- A French national has been newly

being detained by SPLA in southern Sudan for several months, said
French foreign ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt today.

10 years.
</P>
<P>
But a SPLA spokesman in Nairobi said in July that Klem
volunteered to work for the SPLA as a radio operator near the
border area between Sudan and Zaire, because he was fed up with

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan peace process is
"at a roundabout which leads to war or peace," Angolan President
Eduardo dos Santos said here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while opening the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) Summit.
</P>
<P>
He said the Angolan peace process is at a critical moment
although great achievements have been made since a peace accord
was signed in Lusaka, Zambia, two years ago by the two warring
parties in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
It is only after peace is procured that Angola can join
hands with other southern African countries in promoting
development, the president observed.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the summit will play an important
role in bringing about peace to Angola.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the SADC countries to hold a
summit in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state or government of all the 12 SADC countries
except Tanzania are discussing peace and stability in the region
at the summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit is expected to be concluded late today. enditem

<HEADLINE> Syria Warns Israel against Taking Path of Confrontation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Shara warned Israel on Wednesday against taking the path
of confrontation, saying that it will prove to be very costly.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 51st General Assembly, Farouk al-Shara
specified two main dangers of seeking confrontation by Israel with
Arab countries in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, he stressed that Israel can start a war whenever it
chooses, but it cannot end it as it chooses.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps many Israelis are unaware that all the wars they have
fought since October 1973 up until April 1996 have achieved
nothing for them except human and political losses and even
international condemnation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he emphasized that confrontation runs against the
will of the international community, which calls for the
achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"Israel knows that the Arab, including at the summit level,
have opted for peace as their strategic option. In this stand they
were supported by the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, the
summit of the European Union and the summit of the Group of Seven
industrial countries," he said.

WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today delayed his planned meeting at the White House with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat and King Hussein of Jordan as their senior aids were trying
to resolve Israeli-Palestinian differences, the White House said
this noon.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher began meeting this
morning with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Palestinian
negotiators Nabil Shaath and Yasser Abed Rabbo in an effort to
bridge some of the differences dividing Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters that
Christopher was still consulting with the senior Israeli and
Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
"The recommendation is that they not wander over here until
they do some more work," McCurry said., adding that Clinton was
"on standby and waiting to see what kind of progress they make."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the morning, U.S. officials said that Clinton would
have a meeting with the leaders of Israel, Palestine and Jordan
this noon and an announcement would be made early this afternoon
about the result of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
McCurry even refused to rule out the possibility that the
summit talks would continue beyond Wednesday.

DAMASCUS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the Democratic Front

Secretary General of the DFLP Nayef Hawatmeh told Xinhua that

Hawatmeh said that Netanyahu refused to set any date for the
redeployment of the Israeli occupation forces in the city of
Hebron, which has been delayed since March, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also failed to set a date for the final-stage
negotiations on the status of Jerusalem, he added.
</P>
<P>
"So we think that the Washington summit would be of no avail."
</P>
<P>
The Syria-based DFLP is generally considered the third largest
group in the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) after
Arafat's Fatah faction and the Popular Front for the Liberation of
the Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Hawatmeh said that the Netanyahu government is continuing
Judaizing Jerusalem and is constructing new Jewish settlements in
the West Bank, Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights. He noted that the
Israeli government's practices would give rise to Palestinian
uprisings.
</P>
<P>
Such uprisings, Hawatmeh said, would continue until a complete
Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories is
accomplished and until the Palestinian people's right to
self-determination is secured.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the U.S. policy toward the Middle East, Hawatmeh
said that by holding the Washington summit, the American
administration insists on acting unilaterally in the Middle East,
while "dismissing any role to be played by Russia, China, the
EU and states in the region."
</P>
<P>
Hawatmeh called on the international community to denounce the
U.S. policy because it is prejudiced in favor of Israel.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, he expressed again his intention to return to
the occupied Palestine, saying that "I have called on all
Palestinian leaders to return to occupied Palestine."
</P>
<P>
"As for me personally, I asked in January, 1996 to be allowed
to return to the occupied Palestine, and former Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres announced he would allow me to do so. But so
far neither Israel nor Arafat have made practical step toward
opening the door for me to return to the occupied Palestine."

CAIRO, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified gunmen shot and

<HEADLINE> US Helps Palestinians Analyze Israeli Bugs In Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 2 (Xinhua) -- American experts are helping
the Palestinian Authority to analyze bugs believably installed
before Israeli troop withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, reported The
Jerusalem Report, an Israeli English biweekly.
</P>
<P>
The search is going on in Gaza for more Israeli bugs,
following the recent discovery of at least a half dozen listening
devices attached to underground telephone cables within the Suraya
compound -- which houses the main headquarters of the Palestinian
police and security forces, PA President Yasser Arafat's elite
Force 17 guard unit, Amin al-Hindi's General Intelligence
Service, and a prison.
</P>
<P>
It also houses a phone exchange that services all of the city
of Gaza.
</P>
<P>
According to the report quoting a source inside Suraya,
U.S. experts are working with Palestinian colleagues to determine
whether they were designed only to tap telephone calls or were
capable of picking up conversations taking place within the
Suraya building and perhaps even further afield.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authorities have declined to comment, but foreign
diplomatic sources confirm Palestinian charges that the devices
were placed by the Israelis before they left Gaza. The Suraya
served as Israeli army headquarters before the withdrawal in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made when members of the PA engineering
corps dug underground to investigate a malfunction in the
telephone system. The devices were booby-trapped. An officer was
killed trying to remove the first one, just a few meters
outside the telephone exchange room.

NAIROBI, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations aid workers
flew out of Mogadishu to the Kenyan capital of Nairobi today as
aid agencies suspended relief operations in the Somali capital to
protest against the kidnapping of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after the Somali Aid Coordination Body,

</P>
<P>
Other aid groups outside the U.N. system said they would also
halt operations but no details were given so far.
</P>
<P>
"This means the closure of normal operations such as water and
sanitation programs, vaccination and training workshops, at least
in the short term," said a U.N. spokesman based in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The aid groups are protesting against the kidnapping of U.N. aid

<HEADLINE> SADC Summit Committed to Promoting Peace in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing Heads of State and
Government Summit Meeting of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) was committed to stepping up the peace process
in Angola, foreign envoys said here today.
</P>
<P>
The summit would also enable the international observers
missions, which group the United States, Russia and Portugal, as
well as the U.N. peace mission in Angola, to play a more positive
role in promoting peace in the country, said U.S. Ambassador in
Luanda Donald Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
Steinberg told a press conference during the meeting that
whether Angola could achieve peace and national reconciliation at
an early date is vital to the regional stability in southern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the U.N. Security Council's special meeting focused
on the Angolan peace process, scheduled for November 11, would be
"frank" in reviewing the recent developments and helping bridge
more direct dialogues between the rival parties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. envoy criticized Jonas Savimbi, leader of
the former rebel movement, National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), for not attending the SADC summit
which was held for the first time in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state or government of all the 12 SADC member
countries except Tanzania have gathered in the Angolan capital of
Luanda to discuss peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
In opening the summit earlier today, Angolan President Eduardo
dos Santos said the Angolan peace process is "at a roundabout
which leads to war or peace."
</P>
<P>
He warned that the peace process is at a critical moment
despite the achievements made since the signing of the Lusaka
Peace Accord in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
"It is only after peace is procured that Angola can join hands
with other southern African countries in promoting development,"
said Dos Santos, hoping the SADC summit would play a more
important role in bringing about peace to Angola.
</P>
<P>
The summit is expected to be concluded late today.

WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said here today that the two-day emergency summit of Israeli and
Palestinian leaders failed to settle their major explosive
differences but both sides agreed to continue their peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks at a White House press conference

<P>
"I wish we would have resolved everything in two days," Clinton
said, acknowledging that the summit felt short of his hopes.

"They were not able to resolve their differences here," said
the U.S. president who initiated the summit following bloody
clashes between Israelis and Palestinians in the last week.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton noted that the Israeli and Palestinian leaders
had agreed to remain "partners in peace, understand that it is
vital to take each other--take into account each other's needs and
concerns, and realize the importance of removing the frictions
between them."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Perot to Appeal Debate Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Reform Party presidential
nominee Ross Perot will argue on appeal that a federal judge
missed the "heart" of the case when he denied an injunction that
would have included him in the presidential debates, one of his
lawyers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan rejected a Reform Party
request for an injunction on Tuesday against the bipartisan
Commission on Presidential Debates and the Federal Election
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission has denied Perot a spot in the two October
debates between President Bill Clinton and Republican challenger
Bob Dole, saying he has no "realistic chance" to win.
</P>
<P>
Perot lawyers had asked Hogan to order the commission to allow
Perot to take part in Sunday's scheduled debate, or to block the
debate if he is denied access.
</P>
<P>
A panel of the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals is
scheduled to review Hogan's decision on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a constitutional case and the district judge treated
it like an administrative case," said Perot lawyer Jamin Raskin.
</P>
<P>
In his decision, Hogan "made it seem like we wanted the federal
court to do the job of the FEC," Raskin said. "Our point is that
the FEC regulation (turning over the debates to the commission)
delegates public power over free speech rights to a private
corporation. That is the heart of this case."
</P>
<P>
Raskin and other Perot lawyers contend that the commission made
up of five Democrats and five Republicans is a "state actor," even
though under FEC regulation it is a private corporation.
</P>
<P>
The commission receives tax-exempt contributions from
corporations and is essentially an arm of the government, Perot
lawyers said, and therefore under Supreme Court precedent have no
right to restrict the Reform Party candidate's speech in a public
forum.
</P>
<P>
The appeal hearing is scheduled before D.C. Circuit Judges
Laurence Silberman, A. Raymond Randolph and Judith Rogers.
</P>
<P>
If the appeal goes against the Perot camp or is not quickly
decided, Raskin said, the Perot legal team will ask Chief Justice
William Rehnquist to intervene.

<HEADLINE> EC Proposes Second Phase of Textiles Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission(EC)
said today that it had agreed on its proposal for integrating
textiles products into normal GATT disciplines in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The EC proposal covers 24 different categories of product
ranging from ski-suit to swim-wear. Of these categories 19 are
presently covered by one or more important quotas.
</P>
<P>
The list of products to be integrated into the GATT system
includes gloves, wool and non-woven fabrics, carpets, women's
suits, ski-suits, corsets, stockings, tents and mattresses.
</P>
<P>
Once a product has been integrated, it will no longer be
possible to maintain quotas on that product against any supplier
from a WTO country.
</P>
<P>
It will also no longer be possible to introduce quotas on that
product by using the ATC's(Agreement on Textiles and Clothing)
specific safeguard clause, and exports will no longer be subject
to licensing requirements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EC recognized that the proposal did not contain
the "most sensitive items" presently under restriction.
</P>
<P>
Under the Uruguay Round, all WTO (World Trade Organization)
countries agreed to phase out protection on textiles and clothing
products over ten years(1995-2005), in four different stages.
</P>
<P>
While the ATC requires the EU to "integrate" in the second
stage 17 percent of textiles and clothing imports(by volume, with
1990 as the reference year), the categories "integrated" under the
proposal would in fact cover 17.84 percent of EU imports,
according to the EC.
</P>
<P>
The EC said that today's proposal, marking the second stage,
aimed to open markets at a gradual rate and to help EU industry
adjust over time and reflected sensitivity towards employment in
the EU textiles sector.
</P>
<P>
The EC proposal will be sent directly to the Council of
Ministers where a decision will have to be taken before the end of
the year in order to meet the ATC requirement of notifying the
list of products before 1 January 1997.

Zimbabwe has a per capita income of 500 Dollars, Namibia 2,800
dollars and Botswana 3,000 Dollars, said the ZAM Chairman.
</P>

He said the best way to address the situation is to export value
added products, particularly manufactured goods because the goods
manufactured in Zambia has become more competitive and can find

WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said here today that Israeli and Palestinian leaders had failed at
a two-day Washington summit to settle their differences, but the
two sides will continue peace talks beginning Sunday with an
American mediator.
</P>
<P>
"Please, please give us a chance to make this thing work in the

Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of Israel, and King Hussein of Jordan sitting somberly
behind him.
</P>
<P>
"I wish we would have resolved everything in two days," Clinton

not able to resolve their differences here," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What they did agree is to start (negotiations) immediately on
a full-time basis with the priority on speed and a priority on
Hebron," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian talks on a so-called "final settlement"
opened in May but have made little progress. Among the issues on
the agenda are the future of Jerusalem and a Palestinian demand for
statehood.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's decision to open a second entrance to a tunnel that
winds along the Temple Mount, the site of Jewish and Muslim
shrines, sparked a bloody violence last week in the region,
leading to more than 70 deaths.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the dispute was discussed but no agreement was
reached. But he said the leaders realized the violence must cease
in the region.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Palestinians insisted on an immediate
Israeli redeployment in Hebron, but Netanyahu refused the demand
and insisted the agreement on the town reached three years ago be
renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
The two sides talked through the night. U.S. State Department
spokesman Nick Burns described the talks as "quite tough, quite
intensive."

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced today that the Law
Enforcement Forces confiscated 82 tons of narcotics in the first
half of this Iranian calendar year which started on March 20.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the Law Enforcement Forces said that
two-thirds of the narcotics were seized in Sistan-Baluchestan and
Kerman provinces as well as in the southern parts of Khorassan
province.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Iran confiscated about 150 tons of narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Iran has executed more than 4,000 drug traffickers since 1988
and there are about 12,500 foreign smugglers in Iranian jails.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Iran passed a strict anti-drug law, which empowered
the Iranian authorities to execute the smugglers who were caught
with more than 30 grams of heroine or five kilograms of opium.
</P>
<P>
Drug issue is regarded as one of the main social problems in
the country since Iran is one of the best transits for drug
dealers and is close to the "Golden Crescent" in the border
area between Afghanistan and Pakistan, one of the biggest
drug-producing centers in the world.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Foreign Minister
Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka today appealed to the international
community to avail necessary resources to augment efforts of
developing countries in order to protect the environment and
realize sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the general debate of the current session of the
U.N. General Assembly, he said that throughout the world, space
was being taken up for development purposes by the expanding
population.
</P>
<P>
"Inappropriate land practices run counter to conservation of
natural resources. Precious species are becoming either endangered
or extinct," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Kenya had adopted policies designed to preserve the environment
as a common heritage for mankind while resisting all pressures
against conservation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has recently initiated major innovative
steps that will ensure the protection of the ecosystem for the
enjoyment of future generations, including public awareness,
environmental education and the Great Rift Valley Conservancy
Program, he said.

UNITED NATIONS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador today called on
the United Nations to act as an important catalytic element in
promoting economic development, particularly for the poor
countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the general debate of the current U.N. General
Assembly session, Luis Valencia Rodriguez, permanent
representative of Ecuador to the United Nations, noted that in the
era of rapid globalization and interdependence of the world
economy, the world body should foster close cooperation among all
nations so as to create a favorable climate for sound economic
development.
</P>
<P>
This, however, should be achieved on a genuine interdependence,
completely removed of all symptoms of hegemony and dependence, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations must continue its role as an important
catalytic element in the process of economic and social
development of developing, underprivileged and marginalized
countries," he observed.
</P>
<P>
Today, he said, the gap between developed and developing
countries persists to have unacceptable increasing dimensions.
Poverty is affecting more than one fifth of the world's
population, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Encourages Farming Sector, Says Moi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 2 (Xinhua) -- President Daniel arap Moi said
today his government is working on incentives to encourage
productivity and increase yields in the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, the president said, the Kenyan Government
is at present working on a paper entitled "agricultural sector
investment program."
</P>
<P>
Opening the Nairobi International show here, President Moi
said agriculture provides employment to over 85 percent of
Kenya's work force while contributing substantially to Kenya's
foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
President Moi said the incentives are to meet challenges in
Kenya's economy.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Kenya's first challenge is that the
agricultural production depends almost entirely on rain water.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Kenya has only 25 percent of arable land while the
rest is arid and semi-arid, the president said, adding "on
average we produce 30 million bags of maize (2.7 million tons)
each year which is equal to our annual consumption."
</P>
<P>
This calls for more concerted efforts to increase production
to keep pace with the growing population, Moi said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 2 (Xinhua) -- In sharp contrast with
Palestinians, Israel is overjoyed with the just-concluded
Washington summit, hailing it as a victory for Israel, reported
Israel Radio tonight.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danni Naveh said that the results of
the summit were a great success for the Israeli government because
all the demands Israel held onto had been accepted.
</P>
<P>
However, in reaction to the results of the summit, Hannan
Ashrawi, Member of the legislative Palestinian Council and
Minister of Higher Education, described the meeting as
"disappointing."
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi, who was spokeswoman of Palestinian delegation to the
Madrid Middle East peace conference in 1991, said that despite all
the efforts, it is a failure, according to CNN.
</P>
<P>
She added that now the saga ended without any achievement and
its implications for the peace process are "ominous, very ominous."
</P>
<P>
In Washington, President Clinton announced that Israeli and
Palestinian leaders had failed in a two-day Washington summit to
settle their differences. But he said the two sides will step up
peace talks beginning Sunday with an American mediator.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said emergency talks between Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu resulted in
progress, but not as much as he had hoped.

<HEADLINE> Farm Engineers Urged to Modernize Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural engineers
in the sub-Saharan Africa have been called upon to modernize
agriculture and make it more efficient in order to improve the
standard of living of the people in the region.
</P>
<P>
The call was made in Arusha, northern Tanzania today by Prime
Minister Frederick Sumaye when opening the first international
conference of the Southern and Eastern Africa Society of
Agricultural Engineers (SEASAE).
</P>
<P>
The conference deals with issues related to development and
environment and looks into how the agricultural engineers can
protecting environment in the region.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the standard of agriculture in the
region, employing 60 percent of the population and providing 40
percent of marketed products, is still done in a primitive way
except in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He told the conference delegates that more than 80 percent of
Tanzanian farmers are still using hand hoes.
</P>
<P>
"The primitive implements and tools coupled with poor
agricultural husbandry practices cannot get us anywhere," he
said, challenging the engineers to work to improve the situation.
</P>
<P>
He said the technology used in handling almost each and every
crop 40 years ago is basically being employed or has just
slightly been improved today.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye gave such crops as coffee or cotton for example,
saying, "sisal is harvesed as it was done 40 years ago."
</P>
<P>
On environmental protection, the prime minister challenged the
engineers to increase the use of science and technology in order
to effectively utilize and conserve renewable natural resources.
</P>
<P>
"We need to come up with innovations which will exploit our
varieties of topography, soils, climate and biodiversity to
ensure viable and competitive agricultural industry, whether
small-holder or large scale," he said.
</P>
<P>
The conference has been organized by the Tanzania Society of
Agricultural Engineers (TSAE) and is attended by over 70
participants from countries of the region and some
representatives from European and Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
SEASAE is a non-governmental organization (NGO) which started
in 1993 and is aimed at increasing the utilizaion of agricultural
technology in the region.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Anti-Crime Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Thursday signed a series of anti-crime bills, including a
measure to help stop the spread of methamphetamines.
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed the law in a Rose Garden ceremony designed to
stress efforts against crime and drugs, both hot issues in this
year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The president said the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control
Act will help authorities respond quickly to an upsurge in
methamphetamine use, which law enforcement officials say is now
the fastest-growing drug problem in the West and Southwest of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "We have to stop meth before it becomes the crack
of the 1990s."
</P>
<P>
Methamphetamine -- also known as meth, crank, speed or ice --
is a mixture of ephedrine, which is used to treat stuffy noses,
and other chemicals found in gasoline, rubbing alcohol,
pool-cleaning supplies or drain cleaners.
</P>
<P>
It can be inhaled, smoked, injected or swallowed, often
creating delusions, paranoia and aggressive behavior.
</P>
<P>
The methamphetamine legislation lets authorities seize
chemicals used to make the drug. It also increases penalties for
trafficking in the chemicals and for possessing equipment needed
to make the drug.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also signed three other anti-crime measures and a
proclamation declaring October as National Domestic Violence
Awareness Month.
</P>
<P>
The other measures establish a national FBI database to track
sex offenders who have been released from prison, authorizes 221
million dollars for programs to treat and prevent child abuse and
helps families of law enforcement officers killed in the line of
duty after May 1, 1992 to foot the costs of college education for
their children.

<HEADLINE> UN Weapons Official Receives Nine Explanatory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A top U.N. weapons monitor has
received nine explanatory documents from the Iraqi side
concerning Iraq's past weapons programs before his departure from
here today at the end of a four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Charles Duelfer, an American who is deputy chairman of the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq, said seven of
the letters dealt with chemical weapons, while one concerned
biological weapons and one focused on missiles.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that his present round of talks with the
Iraqis were "positive," adding that "I think we both now
understand where our work stands with some clarity."
</P>
<P>
However, the UNSCOM deputy chief said, "there are still
serious problems which remain, and I have discussed those with
the government of Iraq. I also discussed problems which include
gaps" in Iraq's declarations concerning its weapons.
</P>
<P>
Duelfer did not go into details but said "these are serious
issues in each of the biological, chemical and missiles areas."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the missing information on Iraq's past weapons
programs were "serious enough for us to consider them
important."
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said Wednesday
at the United Nations that his country is not concealing weapons
of mass destruction or related documents and said U.N. suspicions
of hidden material "emanate from American and British intelligence
services and their agents."
</P>
<P>
Duelfer said that there will be unspecified numbers of
U.N. inspectors to visit Iraq in the future to continue the
verification work of the final declaration Iraq provided the
UNSCOM last summer on its past weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his wish to complete the UNSCOM's task in
Baghdad as soon as possible, but said "we will not be forced to
make a premature judgement concerning the disposition of these
weapons."
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Duelfer, who arrived here Sunday and was
originally scheduled to leave Wednesday, held three rounds of
talks with Iraqi officials including Oil Minister Amir Mohammed
Rasheed who is charged with leading Iraqi teams to talks with
the U.N. inspectors.

CHENGDU, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Three engineers critically
injured in a car accident in southwest China's Sichuan Province
owe their lives to the swift flight of Chinese army helicopter
crews.
</P>
<P>
Cao Minghua, chief engineer of the China Shipping Industrial
Company, and two of his colleagues, Wu Aiguo and Ji Qingkang, were
seriously wounded when their car skidded on a slippery and steep
road on October 1.
</P>
<P>
They were on their way to Songpan, an outlying county in
northern Sichuan famous for its vast area of grassland.
</P>
<P>
Because of the relatively poor local medical facilities their
lives were in great danger.
</P>
<P>
At the request of their company, the Military Area Command of
Chengdu, capital city of Sichuan, sent two helicopters to Songpan
on October 2.
</P>
<P>
Without any ground control assistance, or clear weather
information, the helicopters successfully landed on a road outside
Songpan and air-lifted the wounded engineers to Chengdu, where
they received emergency treatment in a major hospital.
</P>
<P>
According to hospital sources, all the engineers are now almost
out of critical condition today.

MOSCOW, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
told his security chief Alexander Lebed today that there was no
reason for him to resign over the appointment of a new national
security adviser.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency reported that during a 30-minute

surgery, Lebed expressed his disagreement over the recent
appointment of Yuri Baturin to head a committee on senior military
appointments.

<P>
Baturin is regarded as a hardliner on the Chechen issue, while
Lebed is Moscow's chief negotiator with the Chechen separatists.
Lebed signed a key peace accord with the Chechens in August.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin confirmed that Baturin's appointment was well founded,
and noted that there were insufficient grounds for Lebed to raise
the question of resignation in that connection.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin urged Lebed to continue fulfilling his duties and to
work more persistently with the government.
</P>
<P>
As for the Chechen peace process, Yeltsin stressed the
importance of continuing negotiations with the separatists, adding
that talks with rebel leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev must be
conducted "with subtlety and intelligence."

</P>
<P>
Russia and the former Soviet central Asian republics are
worried about the fast advance of the Taliban fighters who seized
Kabul on Friday, and were advancing towards the southern borders
of the CIS.
</P>
<P>
Tajik's Rakhmonov believes the conflict in Afghanistan poses a
potential threat to central Asia and the world at large, and only
through peaceful talks can stability be achieved in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Russia is especially worried about the Tajik-Afghan border
where it has stationed about 25,000 troops to help patrol the CIS
frontier.
</P>
<P>
The border has become the site of frequent clashes between the
pro-Moscow Tajik government in Dushanbe and Afghan-based Islamic
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan in 1979 but withdrew 10
years later after failing to suppress resistance by the Islamic
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Taliban militia executed former President
Najibullah, a Soviet puppet, after they seized Kabul last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The summit was proposed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Tuesday. The president, who is waiting for a heart surgery, asked
Chernomyrdin to contact leaders concerned in central Asia.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Provide Clean Drinking Water Throughout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government is
planning to provide clean drinking water to all the people living
in the country by the year 1999, a senior government official said
today.
</P>
<P>
As part of its efforts to attain the goal, the government has
earmarked 2.29 billion rupees (about 40 million US dollars) for
various drinking water projects throughout the country in the
current 1996-97 fiscal year (July-June), Housing and Physical
Planning Minister Balaram Ghartimagar told parliament.
</P>
<P>
The government has already directed the country's all 75
districts to prepare district profiles on drinking water in order
to work out strategies on future project arrangements, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that there is a program for purifying the
contaminated water in the Kathmandu area.
</P>
<P>
On the proposed Melamchi water diverting project for Kathmandu,
the minister said that the project would be finalized soon as
talks are underway with the neighboring countries and
international donor agencies.
</P>
<P>
The Melamchi project is aimed at bringing water to the capital
city from the Melamchi river, about 30 km northeast of Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project including approach roads, dams,
tunnels and a water processing center, with an estimated cost of
10 billion rupees (180 million dollars), would be completed within
five years, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Melamchi drinking water project would significantly relieve
the pressure of water supply in Kathmandu, especially during the
dry season, normally from September to June next year.

XUZHOU, October 3 (Xinhua) -- China Central Television (CCTV),
the country's leading TV operation, has one more base for location
shooting of its historical TV plays -- a "Han Dynasty City" in
Xuzhou, a famous ancient city in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Han Dynasty was the second feudal dynasty in Chinese history,
starting in 206 B.C. and ending in 220 A.D.

</P>
<P>
It consists of 17 buildings, which include an imperial palace,
residence of the prime minister, a bell hall, and private
libraries, all in typical architectural style of the Han Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
A TV serial about Liu Bang, the first emperor of the Han
Dynasty, is now being shot in "Han Dynasty City".
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that Xuzhou is the hometown of the
ancient emperor.

<HEADLINE> France to Set up File of Blood Testing Reagent Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- France will set up a complete
registration file of blood reagent makers being bought by French
blood testing centers to detect AIDS, hepatitis B and hepatitis C,
to better guarantee security in blood transfusion, French state
secretary of health Herve Gaymard said today.
</P>
<P>
The French government will issue two ordinances in a few days
which are aimed at "a more complete evaluation of the
effectiveness" of the blood testing mechanism and "guaranteeing
the total reliability of each set of blood product"before it goes
to the market, he said.
</P>
<P>
The measure is taken after the withdrawal in March of the
Albott Laboratory AIDS testing method from European blood testing
centers, after four HIV-positive patients were declared
HIV-negative by testing results of the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
The scandal caused a scare in Britain where 20,000 people
declared HIV-negative by the method were obliged to test AIDS
tests again.
</P>
<P>
In France, the French Blood Agency said that Albott method had
caused no blood contamination, although an inquiry has been
launched by the government on 45 blood donating centers to see how
many of them used to use such a method.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Leader Defends Military Pact Signed with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan today defended a military pact Turkey signed with Israel
earlier this year, saying that it did not mean an alliance
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said after meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
here that the agreement was a way to ensure maintenance for
Turkish aircraft, in which there are "very complicated" equipment
that can be obtained only from the United States or Israel.
</P>
<P>
"This is a commercial deal," he told reporters, stressing that
Turkey has strong relations with the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
He added that the pact with Israel would end as soon as
Turkish technicians acquired the skills needed to service
Turkey's aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The military pact has aroused strong criticism in the Arab
world and fears that Israel could use Turkish airspace to attack
neighboring Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said that his talks with Mubarak covered Turkey's
relations with all Islamic countries including Syria.
</P>
<P>
The visiting prime minister said that the talks also dealt
with Turkish-Egyptian cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, who arrived in Cairo Wednesday evening for a two-day
visit to Egypt, also met with his Egyptian counterpart Kamal
el-Ganzouri today for talks on boosting economic and trade
relations between Turkey and Egypt. A number of government
ministers from both sides attended the talks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first leg of Erbakan's three-nation tour which
will also take him to Libya and Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Massive Black Hole Proven at Center of Galaxy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A German science team says it has
proved the existence of a black hole in the center of the Milky
Way galaxy, a local journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
The black hole, which is several million times the mass of the
Sun and sucks in gas and stars, has been identified by
calculations by Andreas Eckart and Reinhard Genzel, of the Max
Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, near Munich. They
measured the "proper motions" of the stars around the putative
black hole over a five-year period.
</P>
<P>
These showed that the velocities of the stars declined the
further they were from the center, just as would have been
expected if they were in orbit around a black hole, said the
science journal, Nature, published here today.
</P>
<P>
The velocity data also supported the idea that the stars were
in circular orbit, pulled into shape by the enormous mass at the
center. First results suggested that these stars were moving at
1,600 kilometers per second.
</P>
<P>
The mass of the object around which they were rotating was 2.4
million times the mass of the Sun. Since there was no object
remotely of this size visible in the center, the only conclusion
was that it must be a black hole.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Necemettin
Erbakan today criticized what he called Israel's provocative
actions in Jerusalem, saying that these actions could undermine
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak here,
Erbakan told reporters that Israel's opening of a tunnel near
Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem was unacceptable to Turkey and the
whole Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Islamic holy places in Jerusalem belong to
the Islamic world and its more than one billion Moslems.
</P>
<P>
"These actions and provocations can only harm the Middle East
peace process," he said. "Opening a tunnel under these holy sites
is rejected by the Islamic world."
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, who arrived in Cairo Wednesday evening on a two-day
visit to Egypt, also expressed his disappointment with the outcome
of a four-way summit in Washington.
</P>
<P>
He said the summit, which ended Wednesday, did not produce what
was wanted from it.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day summit, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat failed to reach any
agreement over outstanding issues. The two only agreed to resume
immediate peace talks with priority on discussion of an Israeli
pullback from the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton called the summit in an effort to
restart peace talks following an outbreak of violence in
Palestinian territories, triggered by the opening of the
tunnel. Jordan's King Hussein also attended the summit.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first leg of Erbakan's three-nation African
tour. He is also to visit Libya and Nigeria.

<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to gradually
increase its financial input into science and technology during the
Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The State Council of China, the country's top administrative
body, today made public in Beijing a Decision on Deepening Reforms
of China's Science and Technology System During the Ninth
Five-Year Plan Period.
</P>
<P>
It demands that financial departments at all levels across the
country invest more money in the country's science and technology
research.
</P>
<P>
"The increase of science and technology research funds at all
places should be higher than the growth of local financial
income," stated the State Council decision.
</P>
<P>
It also mapped out several concrete measures for the raising of
scientific funds:
</P>
<P>
-- Enterprises should expand their technological development
funds, which can be calculated into their production costs;
Relevant departments should try to collect as much research funding
as possible by various means, and encourage enterprises to adopt
technical renovations;
</P>
<P>
-- Loans for science and technology research projects should
take a larger proportion in state planning, and state policy
banks should offer special loans for the application of important
science and technology research results;
</P>
<P>
-- To promote the application of scientific results, a venture
investment system should be developed;

<HEADLINE> Polish Woman Poet Wins Nobel Prize for Literature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Polish poet and critic Wislawa
Szymborska has won the 1996 Nobel Prize for Literature, the
Swedish Academy announced today.
</P>
<P>
The Academy said she won the laurel for poetry which "with
ironic precision allows the historical and biological context to
come to light in fragments of human reality."
</P>
<P>
Szymborska, born in 1923 in a small town near Poznan, has been
living in Cracow since 1931. She studied Polish literature and
sociology at the Jagellonian University between 1945 and 1948.
</P>
<P>
In 1945 she made her debut with the poem "I seek the word." She
continued to publish poems in various newspapers and periodicals
immediately after the war.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1957, she has published a handful of slim but powerful
collections of poems, a few volumes of book reviews and a number
of highly esteemed translations of earlier French poetry,
especially baroque poetry and Agrippa d'Aubigne," said the Academy.
</P>
<P>
Her poetry could be found translated into many European
languages, and also into Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese and Chinese.
</P>
<P>
She won the City of Cracow Prize for Literature in 1954, the
Polish Ministry of Culture Prize in 1963, the Goethe Prize in
1991, the Herder Prize in 1995 and the Polish Pen Club Prize in
1996.
</P>
<P>
She is the fourth Pole and ninth women to win the Nobel Prize
for Literature.
</P>
<P>
The Literature prize is the first declared in the 1996 Nobel
season. This year, each Nobel Prize carries a cheque for 7.4
million Swedish kronor (about 1.1 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Nobel Prize was established in the will of Alfred Nobel, a
Swede who invented dynamite and died in 1896. The prizes, along
with diplomas and gold medals, are presented to the winners every
year on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.

BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A 16-year-old girl from Nanjing,
capital city of east China's Jiangsu Province, has become the
first deaf child enrolled by a Chinese university.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Tingting, a middle school student from Nanjing, recently
has been accepted by Liaoning Normal University in northeast
China. Zhou has been invited to study in the Special Education
Program of its Education Department, according to the Yangcheng
(Guangzhou) Evening News which is available here.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the university has won special approval of both
the Liaoning Provincial Education Commission and the State
Education Commission, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Zhou lost her hearing through illness when she was only 18
months old. Nevertheless, her father did not lose hope and decide
to teach her "by special means".
</P>
<P>
When she reached the age of eight, the deaf girl could already
recite circumference equations to 1,000 decimal places. When she
was 11, Zhou published a science fiction collection -- "From Deaf
Girl to Child Prodigy", which seemed to be stories about herself.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this girl has great academic potential, and we are
quite confident that she will become a qualified student of our
university," a teacher from the Normal University was quoted as
saying.

HONG KONG, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's unit trust
industry registered net sales of 154.71 million US dollars in
August, the highest monthly net inflows recorded year to date,
according to the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association (HKIFA).
</P>
<P>
This boosted the year-to-date net inflows to 627.77 million US
dollars, nine times that of the corresponding period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The net inflows in August accounted for about 40 percent of the
 gross sales, which was at 391.16 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Lo, chairman of HKIFA, said that it was the highest
net-to-gross ratio recorded this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is very encouraged to note that the industry
continued for the second consecutive month to attract strong
inflows.
</P>
<P>
He said that this may be related to the fact that the US
Federal Reserve decided to leave interest rates unchanged at the
August OMC meeting. This helped boost most of the bonds and
equities sectors.
</P>
<P>
In terms of net sales, the single Asian countries sector was
preceded by Hong Kong equity funds and bond funds. Hong Kong
equity funds came first with 41.92 million US dollars. This is the
first time this year that Hong Kong equity funds led in net
sales.

<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A meeting to mark the 40th
anniversary of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas
Chinese (ACFROC) was held today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Extending congratulations, Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen,
said the ACFROC was an organization that was formed and has
developed in line with the construction pace of new China.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance and the leadership of the Communist Party of
China, ACFROC has made untiring and effective efforts in advancing
the country's socialist revolution and construction over the past
four decades, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Especially in the new historical era, he added, the majority of
returned overseas Chinese, the overseas Chinese and their
relatives devote themselves to China's political and economic
lives with great patriotic enthusiasm, and have made remarkable
achievements for the country's reform and opening-up as well
as modernization drive, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China will resume the exercise of its sovereignty over
Hong Kong and Macao in 1997 and 1999, respectively, and
significant progress will be made in the country's reunification.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, he went on, adding that
to put an early end to the separate situation between the two
sides of the Taiwan Straits is the popular will and a general
trend of the times.
</P>
<P>
In this great historical procedure, the All-China Federation of
Returned Overseas Chinese shall shoulder its historical tasks, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Qian also voiced his hope that ACFROC will continue to carry
forward its fine traditions, unite on a still broader basis with
returned overseas Chinese, overseas Chinese and their relatives,
and make more contributions to the reunification of the motherland
and the rejuvenation of China.
</P>
<P>
Yang Taifang, chairman of ACFROC, also gave an account of the
achievements his federation has made in serving overseas Chinese
and China's construction over the past 40 years, especially after

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- China is to set up a new
research system for its national defense science and technology in
the closing years of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
The system will have both military and civil values and serve
both peaceful and national defense purposes.

<P>
The target was set in a Decision on Deepening Reforms of
China's Science and Technology System During the Ninth Five-Year
Plan (1996-2000) period, made by the State Council, China's
central government, and released here today.
</P>
<P>
The decision said the new research system to be established is
in line with the demands of a socialist market economy, as well as
China's military strategy in the new era.
</P>
<P>
To build such a system, the document noted, the current
situation of national defense science research must be greatly
changed, with the research team of national defense science and
technology to be simplied and optimized. State financial support
should be devoted to those research institutes and higher
education schools with a good foundation, high quality, and high
creativity, it said.
</P>
<P>
It also urged for better management of national defense
research funds, the introduction of a competitive mechanism into
the national defense research, and the adoption of a strict
contract system for research projects.
</P>
<P>
It also called for speeding up the application of national
defense research findings in production, and the development of
high-tech products and related industries.
</P>
<P>
It noted that compatibility of military and civil technologies
should be stressed and much improved.

</P>
<P>
"There is no special agenda for the meeting," he said.

regional and bilateral issues, including the issue of two disputed
islands off the coast of Borneo.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have overlapping sovereignty claims to
Sipadan and Ligitan, two small islands between the Malaysian state
of Sarawak and the Indonesian province of East Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia wants the dispute taken to the International Court of
Justice, while Indonesia prefers to have it settled through the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono said Soeharto and his entourage, including Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas, are not scheduled to meet any other Malaysian
officials.

BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists and
technicians are to focus their efforts on solving major problems
in national economy and social development, and developing
high-technology to promote economic growth in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Under a decision made by the State Council today, most of the

</P>
<P>
The new system calls for a mechanism that closely intergrates
research, development, production and marketing. Productive
enterprises, universities, colleges and research institutions
should join efforts in technological development, with the
enterprises playing the leading role. Research institutions and
universities should form the main force in scientific research and
related social services. And science and technology should
contribute more to the national economy, the decision said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Satisfied with Washington Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman today expressed satisfactions with the outcome of the
Washington summit called to revive the peace process following
last week's clashes between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a condolence visit to the family of a border
police officer killed during the clashes, Weizman said he is full
of hope that the Washington summit will manage to move forward the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Weizman pointed out that under the current complicated
situation in the region, the result of summit was "reasonable."
</P>
<P>
"When people do not talk, they shoot," said the Israeli
president, "If the negotiations continue, a solution for the
problems is possible."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the situation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
remain quiet today, with the exception in Hebron, where stones
were thrown at Israeli soldiers this morning, when the curfew on
the West Bank town was lifted for several hours to allow residents
to buy food.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israel Radio reported that Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai this morning approved moving some of
the tanks deployed in the West Bank back to their positions.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai also ordered to begin easing the restriction imposed
in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli defense minister is scheduled to hold further
security consultations today on the situations following the
conclusion of the Washington summit.
</P>
<P>
Following last week's violent confrontation, U.S. President
Bill Clinton invited leaders of Israel, Jordan, Egypt and the
Palestinian National Authority to the Washington summit, in an
attempt to save the peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak did not accept the
invitation because the Israeli government refused to make any
concessions in calming down the situation ahead of the summit.
</P>
<P>
The violent confrontations, which were triggered off by the
opening of the Hasmonean Tunnel in Jerusalem's Old City, were the
most serious clashes in the last ten years, and had left more than
70 dead and hundreds of others wounded.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Wednesday following the conclusion of the
two-day summit, Clinton said while the crisis has not be
resolved and the parties remained far apart, the talks had
succeeded in returning them to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced that he was dispatching special Middle East
coordinator Dennis Ross to manage the talks that are to take
place at the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
As one of the few results of the summit, Israel and the
Palestinians agreed to hold round-the-clock negotiations,
starting on Sunday, on Israel's redeployment from the disputed
Hebron and security matters.

<HEADLINE> New Research Casts Doubt On "Life On Mars" Findings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- New research casts doubt over
NASA's life on Mars findings, claiming NASA' evidence can be
produced by non-living processes.
</P>
<P>
The new research, published in the science journal Nature,
today, suggests that tiny, sausage-shaped features in chalk found
in a Mars meteorite -- one of several strands of evidence cited
for alien life -- might have been made by basic chemical
processes, and did not reveal the presence of "nanobacteria," as
claimed by the NASA team in August.
</P>
<P>
Evidence that inorganic chemistry can form "living" structures
came from a study of stromatolites, which are formed from layers
of sediment and range from microscopic to huge features visible
from satellites, and can date back to the dawn of life, 3.5
billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
Early algae and bacteria grew in mats and mounds in shallow
water. If the surrounding mud was rich in carbonates, it was
thought the mats often fossilized into stromatolites. They were
the commonest form of fossil in rocks over 550 million years old
and have been used as a record of early life on Earth.
</P>
<P>
But John Grotzinger and Daniel Rothman of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, showed that
such structures could have formed purely by physical processes.
</P>
<P>
They converted images of stromatolite slabs into a digital form
and analyzed them mathematically. They found that a non-living
model of surface growth could simulate the appearance of
stromatolites, notably their so-called fractal geometry where one
motif was repeated at ever smaller dimensions.

<P>
Rothman said their discovery did not rule out the role of
living things. But if there were no traces of microbes, "you
should be jolly careful," he added.

ULAN BATOR, October 3 (Xinhua) -- China has appealed the world
to pay more attention to meteorology and to narrow the gap between
developed and developing countries in the science.
</P>
<P>
The development of meteorological and hydrological sciences in
developing countries falls far short of demand, and the gap
between rich and poor nations in this area should be narrowed,
China told an Asian meeting of the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO).

Member states of the WMO should exchange free of charge
meteorological and hydrological information and technology, said
Zou Jingmeng, head of the Chinese delegation to the 10-day meeting
in Ulan Bator.
</P>
<P>
He asked that the meteorological interests of developing
countries should be given priority.
</P>
<P>
China's stance won wide approval of the participants. The
meeting, which ended today, attracted more than 70 delegates from
19 Asian WMO members.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak's Top Aide Warns Against Continuation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
political advisor, Osama el-Baz, has warned that a continuation of
the Israeli prime minister's policies would lead to a revival of
the vicious circle of violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published today by the English-language
Al-Ahram Weekly, Baz described Benjamin Netanyahu's policies as a
"combination of ideological rigidity ... and lack of experience."
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian demand that Netanyahu announce timetables for
honoring his peace commitments drove the prime minister to change
his mind about attending a proposed peace-saving summit in Cairo,
Baz told the weekly.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that Egypt proposed the summit in an
effort to save the peace process following clashes between Israeli
troops and Palestinians, triggered by Israel's opening of a tunnel
near the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He said it was not true that Netanyahu had refused to come to
Cairo, in response to an invitation by Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, for talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak issued the invitation after Netanyahu appealed to him
in a telephone conversation to step in to calm the Palestinian
revolt, Baz said.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis "very much wanted" Egypt to hold the summit, but
changed their minds after learning that Egypt was asking for
"certain requirements in order to guarantee the success of the
conference," the Egyptian official said.
</P>
<P>
Baz described the Egyptian demand as "only natural," saying
that Egypt "wanted Israel to accept timetables containing certain
dates for the implementation of their obligations."
</P>
<P>
"We said that you (Israel) are under certain obligations, and
in Cairo you must announce that you are committing yourself to
carrying out these obligations," Baz was quoted by the paper as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said in the interview that Netanyahu was encouraged to
change his mind after finding out that "the American
administration was willing to host the meeting if Egypt declined
to host it."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu attended a four-way Middle East summit which ended in
Washington Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The summit, attended by U.S. President Bill Clinton,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Netanyahu and Jordan's King
Hussein, failed to reach agreements on any outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
The only outcome, if any, of the summit was that Arafat and
Netanyahu agreed to resume immediate Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks with priority on discussion of an Israeli pullback from the
West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak stayed away from the Washington summit, saying that he
was displeased with Israel's attitude and actions against the
Palestinians.

HONG KONG, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A joint maritime search and
rescue exercise was held in the Pearl River estuary today to test
the search and rescue strength of Guangdong, Macao and Hong Kong
in handling accidents at sea.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, codenamed "Maritime SAREX96" and jointly
organized by the Guangdong Provincial Marine Emergency Search and
Rescue Center, Macao Marine Department and Hong Kong Marine
Department, involved rescue craft, a helicopter and launches from
Zhuhai, Macao and Hong Kong.
</P>

The exercise started when a high-speed ferry sailing from Hong
Kong to Macao is presumed to have collided with another vessel and
50 staff members of the Civil Aid Services simulated the injured
passengers on the ferry.
</P>
<P>
Macao tasked three rescue craft while Guangdong provided one
rescue craft from Zhuhai for the operation. Meanwhile, Hong Kong
dispatched two Marine Police launches and a helicopter to evacuate
the passengers.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Hong Kong Marine Department said: "With
more people traveling between Hong Kong and the Pearl River by
sea, it is necessary to conduct regular exercises in this busy
waters to check the alerting, communications and responses of the
search and rescue resources in Zhuhai, Macao and Hong Kong."

<HEADLINE> KDD to Link Asia-Pacific Cables to Domestic Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- KDD said today it plans to link
large-capacity, fiber-optic, undersea communications cables in the
Asia-Pacific region and lay a new 8,500-kilometer cable to hook
them up to the domestic network.
</P>
<P>
The move by Japan's international telecommunications giant is
intended to cope with expected strong growth in communications in
the Asia-Pacific region due to greater use of multimedia
equipment, the company said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Using its fiber-optic technology, KDD plans to lay the cable,
called Japan Information Highway, in a loop to encircle the
Japanese archipelago to start operations in mid-1999, it said.
</P>
<P>
The KDD plan calls for laying the cable around Honshu, Shikoku
and Kyushu main islands in the Japanese archipelago and landing it
at some 20 domestic locations including Hokkaido and Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
To connect the cable with domestic telecom networks, KDD has
launched a feasibility study on how to use inland transmission
circuits with nine regional telecom firms which are affiliated
with regional electric power utilities, KDD said.
</P>
<P>
Employing the optical wavelength multiplexing technology with
very broadband optical amplifiers developed by KDD's laboratories,
the submarine cable is expected to have a capacity of more than
100 gigabits per second of information, equivalent to some 1.2
million telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
The cable will also have the "self-healing" function meaning it
will be able to instantly and automatically restore itself from a
failure to ensure a high degree of reliability, KDD said.
</P>
<P>
KDD expects the cable to become the hub of telecommunications
in the Asia-Pacific region as it will be linked to international
undersea cables such as TPC5-CN, SEA-ME-WE3, APCN, R-J-K, it said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Japan will be able to play a greater role as the
communication hub in the region to meet international telecom
needs among the United States, Southeast Asia, Europe and Russia,
KDD said.

<P>
PARIS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
visited this morning the 1996 Paris World Automobile Saloon which
features 880 types of newest automobiles from around the world.
</P>
<P>
The show, which opened Wednesday, is expected to receive more
than 1 million visitors during the 11-day event..
</P>
<P>
Juppe started the tour of the exhibition labyrinth at the stand
of the PSA Peugeot Citroen group which is next to that of the

</P>
<P>
He also visited the stands of the Michelin car company and
those of foreign companies including Ford, Opel, Fiat, BMW and
Volvo, and ended his visit with a close look at the products of
equipments producers such as Valeo, Ecia and Bertrand Faure.
</P>
<P>
The bi-annual exhibition, held in a park at the Porte de
Versaille in southern Paris, is displaying cars of 880 trade marks
with 476 foreign brands from 31 countries, including China.
</P>
<P>
In the number one hall of the exhibition, cars of special
designs are being displayed by 63 car producers, including a
Mercedes-Benz F200 which looks like a space vehicle, and
electrically powered cars like Electrique Citroen.
</P>
<P>
The Berlingot cars with five to seven seats, which cater for
big families, are also given great importance by Renault, Citroen,
Peugeot, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Ford and Fiat.

Club of France in 1898 when it held the first international car
exhibition in Paris displaying 232 cars and drawing 140,000
visitors.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was followed by two bigger international
displays of cars in 1901 and 1902, which were dominated by the

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sets up Special Council on Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria may re-affirm its
ownership of the Bakassi Peninsula with the soon creation of the
Bakassi Council regardless of its dispute with Cameroun over the
oil-rich territory.
</P>
<P>
The council is among the 183 new ones whose creation was
announced on Tuesday by Nigerian Head of State General Sani
Abacha in a broadcast in celebration of the country's 36th
independence anniversary.
</P>
<P>
It may be officially announced this week that Bakassi Council
will be created with headquarters at the southeastern town of
Abana, press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
But the extent of the new council may be subject to final
delineation of boundaries between Cross Rivers and Akwa Ibom, the
two states neighboring Bakassi in southeastern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Bakassi is used to be administered by Akpabuyo Council in
Cross Rivers State.
</P>
<P>
According to analysts, Nigeria's decision to create a separate
council for Bakassi is interpreted as a tactical step to promote
the solution of the peninsula problem and creat a sense of
belonging for the indigenes who are constantly harassed by
Camerounian gendarmes.
</P>
<P>
In his independence day broadcast, General Abach spoke at
length about Bakassi, calling Cameroun to realize ''ultimate
solutions will be found in dialogue and peaceful negotiations"
since it is a ''brotherly country that traditionally enjoyed warm
and cordial relations'' with Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Cameroun have clashed repeatedly over the oil-rich
Bakassi peninsula for two years. A mission from the United
Nations has just ended its visit to the two countries for
investigation aimed at helping resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The dispute is also pending before the International Court of
Justice, whose provisional ruling on March 15 called on both
countries to observe the ceasefire they reached in Togo and to
desist from any action that could prejudice the rights of the
other in respect of a final judgement.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Reactions to Washington Summit Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the other side, the comments on the outcome of summit from
Palestinian politicians have been mostly negative, branding the
two-day meeting a failure.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Zahar, spokesman for the Islamic Resistance Movement,
Hamas, said that he is now "expecting the resumption of attacks
against Israelis from Hamas and from the Palestinian people."
</P>
<P>
Mayor of the West Bank town of Hebron Mustafa Natcheh said the
peace process is on the way of collapse, as the Washington summit
ended with no significant results in solving the main disputes
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In the Gaza Strip, Hasan Asfour, a senior Palestinian
negotiator, blamed "Israeli intransigence" for the "failure" of
the summit, and warned of trouble.
</P>
<P>
"What happened in Washington was an American attempt to absorb
the anger and reaction of Palestinians and to give the appearance
of success," Asfour said.
</P>
<P>
"But the summit has failed because of Israeli intransigence
which requires high political alertness from the Palestinian and
Arab side," he added.
</P>
<P>
Praise for Palestinian Authority (PA) President Yasser Arafat
has come from Hanan Ashrawi, PA higher education minister, who
said Arafat stood firm on Palestinian principles and will return
home proudly.
</P>
<P>
Following last week's violent confrontation between Israel and
the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Clinton invited
Netanyahu and Arafat, as well as Jordanian and Egyptian leaders,
to the summit, in an attempt to save the peace process.
</P>
<P>
But, President Mubarak did not accept the invitation, because
the Israeli government refused to make any concessions in calming
the situation after the confrontation with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The violent confrontation, which was triggered off by the
opening of the Hasmonean Tunnel, was the most serious clashes in
the last ten years, and had left more than 70 dead and hundreds
of others wounded.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Wednesday following the conclusion the
summit, Clinton said while the crisis has not be resolved and the
parties remained far apart, the talks had succeeded in returning
them to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced that he was dispatching special Middle East
coordinator Dennis Ross to manage the talks that are to take
place at the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
As one of the few results of the summit, Israel and the
Palestinians agreed to hold round-the-clock negotiations, starting
on Sunday, on Israel's redeployment from the disputed Hebron
and security matters.

<HEADLINE> HK Press Disappointed at Patten's Final Policy Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Local Chinese newspapers
showed general disappointment in Chris Patten's fifth and final
Policy Address put forward Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Oriental Daily News said in a commentary today that no new
policy on society, people's livelihood, infrastructure and many
other sectors was put forward in the last Policy Address, entitled
"Hong Kong: Transition". The report turned to be an outlet for the
last Governor to release his pent-up sense of frustration over the
past few years in governing the colony, said the paper, which
boasts the largest circulation in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Many papers attacked Chris Patten, who in his Policy Address
set out 16 benchmarks by which, he hoped, the world would judge
the success of post-1997 Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao's commentary said that after 1997 the matter of
Hong Kong is China's internal affairs, in which no country should
intervene. Oriental Daily News criticized that Chris Patten is
utterly irresponsible to forward these benchmarks, which are
"strongly biased". Tin Tin Daily said that the checklist of 16
worries reflects the typical sentiment of colonial rulers, who try
to carry on their influence after handover.  Hong Kong Daily News
pointed out that the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic
Law have explicitly ensured that the 16 questions of Chris Patten
would be no worry.
</P>
<P>
Some papers also criticized that Chris Patten only paid lip
service at the last stage of transition to offer assistance to the
Chief Executive of the future Special Administrative Region. Hong
Kong people would doubt his sincerity in cooperation since he
continued to slam the provisional legislature in his latest Policy
Address, said the Hong Kong Daily News.
</P>
<P>
Local Chinese papers urged the last governor not to stir up
any more trouble in Hong Kong during his final nine-month
administration. Sing Tao Daily said that the nearer it approaches
1997, the stronger the hope that Hong Kong people pin on smooth
transition, nobody wants to see more trouble boil up at the
crucial moment.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Not Affected by Withdrawal of Trade Privilege </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said today it will
not be affected when the United States withdraws the Generalized
System of Preferences (GSP) accorded to the country because most
of the GSP benefits are being enjoyed by American firms here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia will lose its GSP privileges by January 1, 1997, the
US Embassy here said in a statement today.
</P>
<P>
The GSP is a trade privilege accorded by developed countries to
developing countries through reduction of duties for exports from
the developing economies into the markets of developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, most of the GSP privileges are enjoyed by their (US)
 companies which invest here and later export the goods back to
their own countries," Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
was quoted by the Malaysian national news agency Bernama as saying
at a news conference after a social function at Gurun, Kedah
state, some 400 kilometers northwest of here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the GSP withdrawal would not affect Malaysia so
much because Malaysia was not too dependent on the US market.
</P>
<P>
"We do not intend to sell cars, motorcycles or electrical goods
to the US. Our market in the East with Japan and China is
growing... so if there is a withdrawal the effect is minimal,"
the prime minister was quoted as saying.

BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Above 92.6 percent of China's
rural and urban residents now have access to hospitals or medical
service as close as a 30-minute bike-ride or a walk.
</P>
<P>
The country's medical resources have improved by a big margin
since the founding of the New China in 1949, according to today's
"Health News".
</P>
<P>
The number of Chinese in every 10,000 people who have access to
medical services in hospitals went up ten-fold from 1953 to 1995,
it said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, people got medical treatment or services at least 2.19
billion times and over 50 million people had a stay in hospitals,
compared with 150 million times and 2.32 million people in
hospital in 1953.
</P>
<P>
The average stay per person in hospital has shortened since
1993. Patients have stayed for 14.7 days in hospitals above the
county level and five days in clinics in rural areas in 1995, the

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Reactions to Washington Summit Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 3 (Xinhua) -- As the Washington summit,
called to reactivate the peace process following last week's
clashes, ended Wednesday, reactions here to the outcome of the
summit have been mixed.
</P>
<P>
"The results of the summit are a great success from the point
of view of the Israeli government," said cabinet secretary Danny
Nevah, adding that all Israeli demands "were accepted."
</P>
<P>
Tourism Minister Moshe Katsav said the summit was an
appropriate end to last week's violence and that he was pleased
that decisions had not been made on substantial issue, but instead
these topics would be discussed in negotiations beginning on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition party, Labor Party, hoped that Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to open Marathon
negotiations with Palestinians was not merely another delaying
exercise.
</P>
<P>
Noting that "an exchange of words is always preferable of to an
exchange of bullets," a Labor Party statement said Netanyahu's lack
of understanding and political savvy had exerted a high price, the
lives of 15 soldiers and the wounding of dozens others.
</P>
<P>
The National Religious Party, Netanyahu's main coalition
partner, expressed full support for the premier, saying that he
had kept his "commitment to the fundamental interests for the
people of Israel."
</P>
<P>
Right-wing party Moledet member of the Knesset (Israel's
parliament) Benny Elon also praised Netanyahu for "his success
in the summit."
</P>
<P>
"Since the state's founding, we have succeeded on every
military front and failed on every political front," Elon said,
"Benjamin Netanyahu may be the first prime minister to also
succeed on the political front."
</P>
<P>
However, Yossi Sarid, head of the left-wing Meretz party,
sharply criticized Netanyahu, blaming him for gambling the fate
of the State of Israel in the Washington summit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli newspapers expressed satisfaction with the
results of the Washington summit.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post said that for Netanyahu, refusal to
make immediate concessions, despite U.S. and Palestinian
insistence, was a matter of principle, not expediency.
</P>
<P>
The Hebrew daily Yediot Ahronot said that the summit ended
the only way possible, with some breathing spaces, during
which another effort would be made to save the Oslo peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
The Ma'ariv newspaper pointed out that U.S. President Bill
Clinton has extradited Netanyahu from a difficult situation
resulting from the opening of the Hasmonean Tunnel in Jerusalem's
Old City.
</P>
<P>
However, Ha'aretz said in a commentary that the summit
indicated that the U.S. position, as a super mediator, had been
shaken, particularly by the absence of Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper added that the U.S. will now have to take
measures to preserve its place as the mediator in the Middle
East affairs.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Welcomes Dialogue With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and the Commonwealth seem
to soften hardline postures as both sides expressed readiness to
continue talks to resolve the crisis between them.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Foreign Affairs Ministry said Wednesday that the
Nigerian government welcomed the outcome of the meeting of the
Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) held in New York
between September 8 and 29, agreeing on continued dialogue with
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Although details of the outcome of the meeting are yet to be
known, a statement from the ministry said: ''Nigeria notes in
particular cmag's recognition of the need for continued dialogue
aimed at resolving the differences between the Commonwealth and
Nigeria in accordance with the spirit of conclusion of the
meeting held in London between the two parties in June.''
</P>
<P>
Re-affirming its invitation to the CMAG for a visit to Nigeria
at a mutually agreed date, the statement reaffirmed the
"commitment of the Nigerian government to constructive
dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
A meeting between Nigeria and CMAG earlier scheduled for last
August in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, was not held because of the
disagreement over the terms of reference of the visit by CMAG.
</P>
<P>
While CMAG wanted to meet with some political detainees and
other interest groups in Nigeria, Nigeria insisted that
discussion would only be held with government officials.
</P>
<P>
CMAG was set up in November last year as a follow-up to the
suspension of Nigeria from the Commonwealth as punishment for the
hanging of nine Ogonu minority leaders on murder charges,
including writer Ken Saro-Wiwa.
</P>
<P>
The committee's mandate is to monitor human rights situation
in Nigeria and the transition to civil rule program of the
military government, and recommend the lifting of the suspension
or the imposing of further sanctions if necessary.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting between a 17-member Nigerian delegation and
CMAG held in London last June, CMAG decided to put off further
sanctions against Nigeria because the country had made some
progress in improving its human rights record and implementing
its democratization plan.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Trade Deficit Hits 15 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's exports suffered
another setback last month, pushing the accumulated trade deficit
to nearly 15 billion U.S. dollars in the first nine months of this
year, according to the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry here today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry tentatively put the country's exports in September
at 9.83 billion dollars on a customs-cleared basis, down 10.4
percent from the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
September was the third consecutive month of negative growth in
outbound shipments and the largest margin since the 19.5-percent
fall in January 1985. The minus growths were 4.8 percent and 6.5
percent in July and August respectively.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's imports fell 2.1 percent to 11.37 billion dollars
in September, the second month of decline this year after June
which recorded a 1.1-percent decline.
</P>
<P>
The September trade figures brought the total exports for the
first nine months of this year to 94.84 billion dollars, while
imports totaled 109.8 billion dollars, resulting in a trade
deficit of 14.96 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
If the current trends continue, South Korea's trade deficit
this year will approach 20 billion dollars, surpassing the
government's 18-billion-dollar projection, a ministry official
said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country's trade deficit stood at 10.06 billion
dollars, up 58.7 percent from the 6.34 billion dollars registered
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Exports increased 30.3 percent from 1994 to 125.06 billion
dollars in 1995, the fastest yearly growth pace since the
36.2-percent growth recorded in 1987, while imports grew even
faster at 32 percent to 135.12 billion dollars, the highest since
they shot up 35.8 percent in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Says He Runs Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today that he still controls the country despite health
problems and that his political opponents should better get down
to work than call on him to step down.
</P>
<P>
"Do not hurry to change the portraits," Yeltsin said in a radio
address to the nation this morning.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "there is the president in the country and he
is a working president."  However, he admitted that preparations
for his upcoming heart surgery "take a lot of time."
</P>
<P>
"I am informed about what is happening in the country. A
strong team of professionals help me. They are mostly the renewed
(presidential) administration and the renewed government," Yeltsin
said, adding that he also hopes for cooperation with the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The main task for the legislature at present is to pass the
1997 budget, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president expressed his support to national
security chief Alexander Lebed in efforts for the Chechen
settlement, and said that it was necessary to restore the
governing bodies and the economy in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
"My aide, Alexander Lebed, fulfilled my instruction and stopped
combat activities," Yeltsin said, noting: "Now it is time to
restore the governing system and the economy of Chechnya. But
initially it is necessary to define the status and the composition
of the bodies of power in Chechnya. And then to solve the issue
of financial assistance. These are the priority tasks which I put
before Lebed."
</P>
<P>
Expressing deep concern over the situation in the armed forces
caused by underfinancing, Yeltsin promised that it would be
improved in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"I am very concerned over the situation in the armed forces,"
he said. "I discussed it with the Defense Minister and I talked
about it on Tuesday with (Prime Minister) Viktor Chernomyrdin.
This Friday he will hold the first meeting of the Defense
Council. That meeting should yield concrete decisions."
</P>
<P>
"I take that issue under special control," Yeltsin said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Spokesman Expresses Indignation over Japanese LDP Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Shen Guofang expressed "strong indignation" over the
decision of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) here today.
</P>
<P>
Shen was asked by correspondents to comment on a report that
the LDP listed the "realization of paying official respects to the
Yasukuni Shrine by the Japanese prime minister and cabinet
members" and the "Diaoyu Islands belonging to Japanese territory"
as part of its election platform in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that "we are very indignant about the wrong decision
made by the LDP of Japan".
</P>
<P>
He said that everyone knows that the Yasukuni Shrine is for the
souls of militarists like Hideki Tojo, and that the Asian
countries and people who suffered from Japanese aggression have
always opposed any visit paid by a Japanese prime minister or
other government leaders to the Shrine.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, Shen went on to say, wrong
actions by the Japanese side on the historical issue have
seriously hurt the feelings of people of many countries, including
the Chinese, who have suffered greatly from Japanese militarism.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Japanese LDP's wrongful action in the
historical matter this time is bound to arouse indignation again
among Japan's Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Shen expressed the hope that Japan will sincerely examine that
part of history to regain peoples' trust and take the road to
peace and development.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the Diaoyu Islands, Shen reiterated that
China's stance is clear-cut and firm, and that any action by the
Japanese side cannot, even in the slightest degree, shake China's
determination about its sovereignty over the Diaoyu
Islands.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Food Security in Asia Faces Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- While Asia records the fastest
economic growth in the world, its food security is facing serious
challenges.
</P>
<P>
It sounds unbelievable, but it is the reality Asia has to face.
</P>
<P>
It is true that the region's economy is still growing at a
relatively fast pace this year, despite export slowdowns in some
countries. The Asian economic growth so far this year has been
tracked at 7.1 percent, down from the 7.9 percent recorded in
1995, according to the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Next year, the economic situation could be better, the bank
said, growth could crest at 7.3 percent as South Korea, Malaysia,
Thailand and other high-growth countries ease from economic
overdrive.
</P>
<P>
However, as Asia's economic performance is being called a
miracle, its food security is really worrisome, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The food security is defined by the United Nations as the
availability and accessibility of food that is nutritionally
adequate in terms of quantity, quality and variety to all people
at all times.
</P>
<P>
Then how is the food security situation in Asia today?
</P>
<P>
Figures provided by the Food and Agricultural Organization
(FAO) and other research institutions indicate: 16 out of every
100 Asians lack food, 512 million Asians remain chronically
under-nutritional, 19 countries in Asia are listed by the United
Nations as "low-income food deficit nations".
</P>
<P>
Worse still, land degradation, cropland losses and over
exploitation of natural resources are posing threats to the food
security, and the situation could deteriorate, if the issues fail
to be addressed soon, analysts warned.
</P>
<P>
The biggest challenge to Asia's food security comes from land
degradation, which is caused by wind and water erosions,
desertification and other forms of degradation, experts said.
</P>
<P>
A global assessment made by the FAO, the U.N. Environmental
Program and the U.N. Development Program shows that eight
countries in South Asia have been losing 10 billion US dollars
annually due to land degradation, or 7 percent of their total
agricultural output.
</P>
<P>
The most severely affected in Asia is Iran, where about 94
percent of agricultural land is damaged to a moderate or strong
degree, and some eight million hectares of cropland in Iran have
been lost due to severe salination, says the Worldwatch Institute
in a report.
</P>
<P>
In Mongolia, 35 to 50 tons of top soil have been lost per
hectare over the last 30 years due to wind erosion.
</P>
<P>
Water erosion has degraded 43 million hectares in Indonesia,
and another 13.6 million hectares in the Philippines. Soil
fertility decline has been observed in over 3.2 million hectares
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that among the adverse effects of land degradation
are increased landlessness, lower and less reliable food supplies,
and reduced crop yield.
</P>
<P>
Economic boom has also contributed to the disappearance of
cropland. FAO regional representative A.Z.M. Obaidullah Khan said
that roads, shopping malls and factories are burying prime
farmland in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in some parts of Asia, the economic boom has
undermined ecological underpinning, which in turn is threatening
food security in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to reports by research institutions, reduced fish
catches from 18 over-exploited fishing groups are shifting unmet
protein demand onto over-burdened farm sectors in the region.
</P>
<P>
In Asia today, the reports said, chemicals contaminate over 200
million hectares of cropland, water supplies have dipped to a
third of their 1950 levels, and deforestation rates remain roughly
double the 1980 levels.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that all these factors will reduce by half the
remaining uncropped land in South Asia in the next 20 years while
uncropped land in East Asia is expected to shrink by roughly one
third.
</P>
<P>
To improve Asia's food security situation, they said, Asian
governments must address the challenges through policy changes and
effective actions.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, they warned, more and more Asians will be ill-fed or
lack food in the coming years.

Michael Arnold, chief negotiator of Hong Kong, said that the
agreement provides a proper legal footing for the smooth

He believed that the agreement will also enhance opportunities

So far, Hong Kong has completed negotiations on separating Hong

<HEADLINE> Seed Production Base in Northwest China Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Xiba Village, in northwest
China's Gansu Province, which is surrounded by desert, used to be
the last place one would expect to see vegetables, but it now
produces 7,000 kg of vegetable seeds annually.
</P>
<P>
All of these are sold overseas, giving the village 430,000 yuan
in profits last year and are expected to bring in one million yuan
this year.
</P>
<P>
There are now 16 seed production bases similar to Xiba in
Jiuquan (Chinese for "Wine Spring") covering more than 200 ha of
land. Jiuquan is considered an ideal seed cultivation base because
of the sunshine, temperature changes, and high quality snow water
from the Qilian Mountains, according to Li Qi, a manager of the
Jiuquan Seed Company.
</P>
<P>
The industry did not even get started until the early 1980s,
when a first batch of 620 kg of sweet melon seeds proved
satisfactory to an American company, which later became a repeat
customer. Now, businesses from France, the Republic of Korea,
Japan, Hungary and Taiwan have set up seed joint ventures in
Jiuquan.
</P>
<P>
The region has exported more than 30,000 kg of seeds annually
since 1991, becoming the largest seed production and export base
in China.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Train Bosnian Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Defense Minister
Syed Hamid Albar said today his country will soon help train the
Bosnian army.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian government has requested for the assistance, he
said, adding he would ask the Malaysian defense advisor in Zagreb
to submit a report on the form of training assistance required.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see whether they need other forms of training apart
from training the Bosnian military instructors," he was quoted by
Malaysia's official news agency Bernama as saying in Johor Baharu,
about 370 kilometers southeast from this capital city.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, whose soldiers are serving in Bosnia-Herzegovina as
part of the Implementation Force (IFOR), is prepared to provide
the training as it was also involved in the training and equipment
program conducted by the United States for the Bosnian army, by
contributing 10 million US dollars, Syed Hamid told reporters
after the formation of Malcon III at a military camp there.
</P>
<P>
Malcon III comprises 34 officers and 708 other members who are
expected to leave for Bosnia in December.
</P>
<P>
On how long the Malaysian Contingent (Malcon) will serve in
Bosnia, Syed Hamid said no firm decision had been taken on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton Agreement, the mandate is to end on December
26 but Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic wants Malaysian troops
to remain in his country even when IFOR troops are reduced in
future.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid also said his ministry would seek to maintain the
Malcon strength at 1,533 members as it was an appropriate size to
implement duties effectively in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> "ASEAN 10" for Better Southeast Asian Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The realization of "ASEAN
10" will mark an end to the region's fractured and turbulent past
and a unity of Southeast Asian countries in a common cause for a
better individual and collective future, Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said here today.
</P>
<P>
Unlike before when members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) sought their destinies separately, they have
now found the wisdom and statesmanship to unite in a peaceful
common cause for a better individual and collective future for
Southeast Asia, he said at the opening of the first meeting of the
30th ASEAN Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Hoping the final phase of this historic reconciliation should
not be slowed down, Abdullah, who is the current chairman of the
committee, said although the enlargement of ASEAN's membership to
include all the 10 countries in the region would pose new
challenges for the grouping, its resilience and pragmatism would
enable it to adapt quickly to the new reality.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, which was accorded observer status last July, has
submitted a formal application for full ASEAN membership while
Cambodia and Laos are set to join ASEAN during its annual foreign
ministers meeting in Kuala Lumpur next year.
</P>
<P>
At present, ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said ASEAN countries which are already well ahead in
the liberalization of their economies should assist those that are
struggling to open up.
</P>
<P>
He said both the Common Effective Preferential Tariff and the
ASEAN Free Trade Area must be accommodative enough so that new
members of the grouping could have a "breathing space" to make
adjustments to their economies.
</P>
<P>
The recent ASEAN economic ministers' decision to evolve an
ASEAN Investment Area, an important element of the integration
process in ASEAN, would facilitate investment and capital flow
within the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone (SEANWFZ)
treaty, Abdullah said the Cabinet yesterday decided that Malaysia
would immediately ratify the treaty which was signed by the ASEAN
Seven and its future members -- Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar --
during last year's 5th ASEAN Summit in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said with an expanded membership and the increase in
the number of dialogue partners, the Standing Committee should
conduct a thorough review of ASEAN's dialogue relations process.
</P>
<P>
There must be efforts to strengthen the ASEAN identity and
awareness using various means, such as the proposed establishment
of the ASEAN University Network and the possibility of setting up
an ASEAN Satellite Channel, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day Standing Committee meeting is being attended by
some 40 delegates.

PARIS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The Washington summit ended Wednesday evening with a shaking
of hand between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, without reaching any concrete
agreement on the relaunching of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a declaration read in the presence of Arafat, Netanyahu and
King Hussein of Jordan, U.S. President Bill Clinton announced the
resumption next Sunday of non-stop negotiations between Israel and
Palestinians in the border checking point of Eretz. U.S. Middle
East envoy Denis Ross will also attend the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
-- Six years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it is still
unthinkable for most Western Berliner to marry an Eastern Berliner
and vice versa. Among the 16,383 marriages registered last year
in the reunified Berlin, only 562 were those between a Western
Berliner and an Eastern Berliner, which is a 3 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Before the holding of a French-Italian summit in Naples on
Friday, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi Wednesday answered a
gesture of appeasement by President Jacques Chirac about the
quarrel between the two countries over the devaluation of the
Italian currency lire. Prodi told le Figaro that "the talks by
Chirac were referring to the performance of the lire that belonged
to the past. I want to say that the lire of today is very
different from that to which he had alluded."
</P>
<P>
Chirac had sharply criticized the "competitive devaluation of
lire" which he said had cost more damages to France's textile
industry than exports of Southeast Asian countries. He also
expressed his doubt over the capability of lire to enter the
European Monetary Union by January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
-- The third millennium will bring its gift of revolution to
our daily life. According to an inquiry by le Figaro in the field
of automobile production, the car of the year 2000 will neither
ressemble that imagined in science fictions nor like those
presented at the world car exhibition in Paris today. Scientists
are especially interested in "hybrid" cars, which will have the
classic motor and electric battery which is sufficient for their
running in the cities.

<HEADLINE> East China To Spend More On Pollution Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, September 3 (Xinhua) -- By the year 2000, spending on
environmental protection in east China's Fujian Province will
account for 1.5 percent of the GDP, a senior official reports.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the expenditure accounted for 0.7 percent of the
province's GDP.
</P>
<P>
To reach the goal, the provincial government will set aside 20
million yuan annually from its budget starting this year, the
official, who is in charge of environmental protection, said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the provincial government has called on the whole
of society to increase investment in environmental
protection. Trade and industrial departments are required to use
at least seven percent of their expenditures for pollution
treatment facilities, and the municipal governments must spend 25
to 30 percent of the urban construction funds on environmental
protection facilities.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, the province will put emphasis on the
treatment of the Minjiang River areas, emissions from the
construction materials and porcelain industries, organic waste
discharged by the shoe industry, and dirt discharged by the cement
industry.

<P>
SINGAPORE, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Singapore police have formed
up special squads to tackle over-stayers, illegal immigrants and
foreign criminals, especially those among foreign workers here,
the Straits Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said that squad officers are trained specially to handle
these cases. Some are sent to the Police Academy to learn foreign
languages such as Thai. They also learn about the cultures,
practices and festivals of certain foreign communities.
</P>
<P>
Equipping them with these extra skills would allow them to work
undercover at construction sites and gather intelligence more
effectively, Police Commissioner Tee Tua Ba was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said such squads are needed because in recent years,
immigration offenses and crimes committed by foreigners have
continued unabated.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 foreigners were arrested for entering or
remaining in Singapore illegally in the first half of this year.
There were 3,119 arrests in all, compared with 2,492 in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 900 foreigners were nabbed for crimes
such as armed robbery, molest, vehicle thefts, shoplifting and
possession of weapons between January and June this year, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> China Quickening Pace of Poverty Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- To narrow the gap between the
rich and the poor, China's inland areas have begun campaigns to
help people escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, Gansu Province in the northwest, has
built more than 160 large and medium-sized water control projects
and turned large stretches of rain-eroded wasteland into fertile
farmland, producing 1.7 million tons and helping eight million
people live better lives.

within three years, 100,000 hectares of terraced fields and
irrigated farmland in the northwestern part of Luliang Prefecture,
which has 15 poor counties with a population of 1.45 million.

Plastic sheeting will be used on about 100,000 hectares of
farmland and cash crop fields in cold areas to produce more grain
and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
In east China's Jiangxi Province, more than 1,200 government
officials have been sent to 18 poverty-stricken counties, which
have a combined population of 2.46 million people, to help local
residents make more money.
</P>
<P>
Local governments in Jiangxi have built 1,310 kilometers of
highways and 1,260 bridges in the poor counties, and 667 schools
and drinking water projects for 928 villages.
</P>
<P>
In aiding the poor, they have focused their efforts on helping

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today launched its
first national motorcycle made by the National Motorcycle and
Engine Corporation, Modenas.
</P>
<P>
Launching the motorcycle at Gurun, Kedah state, some 400
kilometers northwest of here this morning, Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad named the 110cc national motorcycle
"Kriss", according to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Modenas, a joint venture with Japan's Kawasaki Heavy Industries
Ltd. and Nissho-Iwai Corporation, will initially produce
four-stroke motorcycles in two models, one with an electric
starter and the other with kick-start.
</P>
<P>
The motorcycles will roll off the assembly line in three colors
-- red, blue and green, and will be on sale from next month.
</P>
<P>
The company, which conducted a pilot production in June, has
projected to produce 100,000 to 150,000 units in its first year of
operation with a targeted turnover of 400 million ringgit (about
160 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Modenas expects to increase its turnover to 1.2 billion ringgit
(about 480 million US dollars) by 1998 when production trebles and
aims to eventually capture around half the 110cc motorcycle
market.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Wants Consensus on Myanmar's Entry into ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"There has to be an ASEAN consensus. We cannot run away from
that," Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told
reporters after opening the first meeting of the 30th ASEAN
Standing Committee here.
</P>
<P>
The minister's statement came in the wake of a news report that
ASEAN foreign ministers had unanimously agreed at their informal
meeting in New York recently to defer Myanmar's admission into the
grouping as a full member to give it more time to adjust itself to
be ready for the integration.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said the ASEAN governments had to be accountable and
be involved in making that decision.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar was given observer status in July and then it sent a
letter to Malaysia, the grouping's current chairman, in late
August officially applying for full membership next year.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah clarified that the ASEAN foreign ministers had decided
to defer Myanmar's entry into ASEAN because Thailand was not ready
to make a decision on it owing to its current domestic political
situation.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Myanmar's admission into the regional
grouping is expected to be discussed by the ASEAN foreign
ministers at their informal meeting during the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in the Philippines next month.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministers would make their recommendations to their
respective heads of government for a possible decision at the
ASEAN informal summit in Jakarta scheduled for November 30.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he believed that ASEAN's constructive engagement
policy had not been successful with Myanmar, Abdullah said one
could not take the situation in Myanmar and make an interpretation
that the policy has failed.
</P>
<P>
He said he had no knowledge of any ASEAN member states asking
for a review of the policy with regards to Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Asked about how soon Malaysia wants Myanmar to be accepted as a
full ASEAN member, Abdullah said it was still too early to make a
decision as Myanmar has just applied for admission.

<HEADLINE> Food Security Strategy Discussed in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Nepal would have to spend much
of its foreign exchange reserve importing food grains if the
growth of the country's agricultural production remains at the
present 2.3 percent in the next few years, agriculture officials
here said.
</P>
<P>
According to them, with the growth rate of the population at
2.5 percent, Nepal's food deficit will reach up to over 250,000
tons by 2002 which will cost the country some 60 million US
dollars every year.
</P>
<P>
To improve agricultural productivity through better land
management, use of fertilizer and irrigation is the only way to
ensure food security of the country in the near future, a senior
official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Opening a workshop on food production here, Minister of State
for Agriculture Prem Bahadur Bhandari stressed the importance of
sustainable and steady development of the agricultural sector in
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that agricultural yield is on the decline due to
various factors including deforestation, soil erosion, lack of
solution to farmers' problems and lesser use of advanced
techniques in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the workshop recalled that Nepal had been a
food exporter during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The three-day workshop, jointly organized by the Nepali
Agriculture Ministry and the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO), was aimed to find ways to increase food
production by utilizing available resources and technologies with
full participation of farmers especially under the FAO-sponsored
program in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
About 90 persons including government officials and those
associated with the agricultural sector were taking part in the
workshop.

BANGKOK, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has urged the European
Union (EU) to retain tariff concessions for some Thai farm
exports.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting here today, a Thai foreign trade department
official, Boontipa Simaskul, discussed tariffs with EU
representatives, urging the EU to keep tariff concessions for some
Thai farm products under the generalized system of preferences
(GSP), which the EU will revise effective as of January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a letter delivered to the EU representative office here
today, Chucheep Harnsawat, commerce minister in the Thai caretaker
government, also asked the EU to include Thailand on the list of
countries that would continue to receive GSP benefits.
</P>
<P>
The minister also requested that the EU grant tariff concession
quotas to five Thai exports -- frozen shrimp, canned crab meat,
fish, vegetables and fruit.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that starting next year, tariff on Thai frozen
shrimp exports will double from the present 4-5 percent to 8-9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Thai shrimp exporters say they would face greater difficulties
finding new markets to replace the EU, which imported 188 million
US dollars' worth of Thai frozen shrimps last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A Thai tapioca company is
planning to build a power plant in Rayong province to use biogas
out of Tapioca waste water treatment to generate electricity to
supply a new industrial park.
</P>
<P>
The 140 megawatt power plant planned by Kaset Pattana Tapioca
Co. will be fired 50 percent by tapioca biogas and 50 percent by
fuel oil, a report said here today.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Japan Airlines (JAL) reopened its
weekly direct flight between Narita in Tokyo and New Delhi today
after it halted flights between Japan and India in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The resumption came in line with a series of moves by the
Japanese airlines to open flights between the two countries
because Japanese businesses are expanding into the Indian market.
</P>
<P>
All Nippon Airways (ANA) opened two weekly flights between
Osaka and Bombay on September 5 and is also due to open two weekly
flights between Narita and New Delhi via Bangkok on Friday.
</P>
<P>
JAL will also resume a weekly flight between Osaka and New
Delhi on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
JAL and ANA presidents said these actions reflect expectations
that the number of Japanese travelers to India will increase
following the growth of Japanese business activities there, thanks
to India's open economic policy.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Moves to Develop Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is planning to create a
special investment zone in the northeast to shift more investment
to the country's poorest area.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan drafted by Thailand's Board of Investment
(BOI), the special investment zone will cover 12 of Thailand's
poorest provinces with 1,140 projects to be launched within the
zone during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The provinces are Kalasin, Sakon Nakhon, Nakhon Phanom,
Mukdahan, Amnat Charoen, Yasothon, Ubon Ratchathani, Si Sa Ket,
Roi-Et, Surin, Maha Sarakham, Buri Nam.
</P>
<P>
More businesses, like animal husbandry, bakeries, production of
fish sauce, beverages, earthenware, cement, cosmetics, detergent
and bricks, will be eligible for privileges in the new zone.
</P>
<P>
The special zone would offer more privileges for investors than
other investment zones in the country, including corporate income
tax exemption for the first eight years and 50 percent reduction
for the following five years.
</P>
<P>
Investors in the zone will also enjoy an eight-year exemption
on machinery import duties and a 90 percent reduction on import
taxes of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
The minimum investment requirement for any business in the zone
is reduced to 20,000 US dollars from 40,000 dollars, the minimum
requirement for the number of employees employed by a company is
relaxed to 50 from 100.
</P>
<P>
Thai caretaker prime minister Banharn Silpa-Archa, who chairs
the BOI, Wednesday also said that besides tax breaks, the
government will provide basic infrastructure to support the plan.
</P>
<P>
BOI Secretary-General Staporn Kavitanon said that the board
will start to form the zone next year if the new government
approves its plan.

<HEADLINE> Gas Exploration in Andaman Sea Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A US-French-Norwegian energy
consortium will soon start to explore for hydrocarbons in a Thai
section of the Andaman Sea, according to energy industry sources.
</P>
<P>
The Unocal-Total-Statoil group will carry out the exploration
project under a concession agreement signed with the Industry
Ministry of Thailand in June for a budget of more than 1.2 billion
baht (48 million US dollars) over the next six years.
</P>
<P>
The petroleum and gas prospecting activities will cover a total
area of 48,000 square kilometers in the sea about 50 kilometers
west and southwest of the southern resort island of Phuket.
</P>
<P>
The group is upbeat about the prospects for finding gas in the
concession blocks, where traces of hydrocarbons were discovered
over the past two decades, but until now multi- national oil firms
have not attempted follow-up exploration.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, Unocal discovered natural gas in the area,
but the find was deemed to be "sub-commercial" because there was
no market for natural gas at that time and the firm was looking
for oil.
</P>
<P>
Interest in that area rekindled again this year as natural gas
is the fuel of choice for electrical power generation, according
to Unocal's Thailand president Brian Marcotte.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Remain Firm Against Yen in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar remained steady
just below the 112-yen mark in Tokyo early today after having
topped the 112-yen mark at one time in London and New York
overnight.
</P>
<P>
The dollar, which rose to a 32-month high of 111.92 yen in
Tokyo Wednesday on strong buying by Japanese investors, was
changing hands at 111.86-89 yen at 9 a.m., almost unchanged from
Wednesday's quote of 111.85-95 yen in New York.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency remained firm against the German mark and the
Japanese yen due to a wide interest rate gap among the three
countries, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Traders forecast that the dollar would soon break the 112-yen
mark for the first time since January 24, 1994, when it climbed to
112.39 yen.

<HEADLINE> Reform Boosts Cuba's Farm Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's agricultural production
went up by 20 percent in the 1995-1996 season, due to drastic
reform programs launched in the past three years, according to
newly released official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The nation's output of sugar and tobacco rose to 4.4 million
tons and 720,000 quintals respectively in the 1995-1996 season, up
33.6 percent and 30 percent respectively over the previous season.
</P>
<P>
Potato output also rose to 7 million quintals this year, a new
record in Cuban history.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural boom was attributed to the reform programs
Cuba adopted in recent years. Cuba launched a series of reform
programs in 1993, aimed at rejuvenating its ailing agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Cuba transformed most of its sugar cane plantations into basic
cooperative production units, which were granted greater autonomy
in production.
</P>
<P>
In the basic production units, the income of the farmers is
linked with their performances and the output of the units.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the Cuban government established agricultural and
livestock markets to allow farmers to sell their surplus products
after fulfilling their contracts with the government.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government also approved a law on foreign investments
last year, giving special privileges to foreign businesses that
invest in the nation's agriculture.
</P>
<P>
To stablize rural population, the Agriculture and Sugar
Ministries have been building thousands of houses for farmers. The
government also set up rewards for families, especially the young
people, who voluntarily go to far-off regions to work on farms.
</P>
<P>
Those measures have helped to rejuvenate Cuba's agricultural
production and contributed to the island nation's social stability
and sustained economic growth. In the first six months of the
year, Cuba's gross domistic product grew by 9.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Protect Forest and Water Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, Ukraine, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian government
will take all possible measures to strengthen the protection of
the country's forest and water resources, Ukrainian First Deputy
Prime Minister Vasily Durdinets said today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a government meeting chaired by
Durdinets, according to the Ukrainian National Information Agency.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that both poor fire-fighting techniques and the
impotence of the local governments' work led to frequent bush
fires, which have caused enormous economic damage to the country.
</P>
<P>
To protect forest and water resources is a top priority for
Ukraine, Durdinets stressed at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the forest areas destroyed by
fire since early this year are four times as much as that of the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Some supplementary measures have been adopted at today's
meeting, including setting up a fire-fighting air force and
utilizing the cut-down military expenditure to improve the
equipment of the fire-fighting units.
</P>
<P>
As for the protection of water resources, the government
decided that a national drinking water project is to be launched
to ensure that all citizens will drink clean water.
</P>
<P>
The government has reportedly asked the authorities concerned
to work out a draft law on drinking water as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> New Power Plants to Be Built in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Westinghouse company of
the United States is soon to conclude its final technical study on
the construction of four power plants in this country.
</P>
<P>
A group of Westinghouse experts will arrive here next week to
conduct the study, according to company sources.
</P>
<P>
Westinghouse and its local partner, the Power Investment Group,
have planned to construct three plants in the Banteay Meanchey
province in northwestern Cambodia and another one in the Takeo
province in the south.
</P>
<P>
The new power plants are expected to bring five to six
megawatts of extra power to the northwestern power grid and add
five megawatts to the southern grid.
</P>
<P>
The approval for the technical study, to be signed by Cambodian
Industry Minister Pou Sothirak, is the final step before the
Cambodian government seals the build-operate-transfer deal with
the American company.
</P>
<P>
Apart from analyzing the construction and operation cost of the
power plants, the inspection team will have to assess the safety
of the construction sites which may be infested by land mines in
the Mongkol Borei region.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic-Izetbegovic Meeting to Shore up Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic flew to Paris today to meet his new Bosnian counterpart
Alija Izetbegovic to advance the peace process in the former
Yugoslavia following Bosnia's general election on September 14.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, slated for Thursday and set up by U.S. official
Richard Holbrooke two weeks ago, is aimed at ensuring the
implementation of the Dayton peace agreement and ironing out any
difficulties that could still occur after the elections, a Western
diplomat told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The first general election in Bosnia since the end of the near
four-year war there last December was certified by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on Sunday,
thus paving the way for the lifting of sanctions against
Yugoslavia, made up of Serbia and Montenegro, and for better
relations between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat, who declined to be identified, said one positive
outcome of Thursday's meeting between the two former rivals might
be an agreement on establishing diplomatic relations between
Bosnia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
By signing the Dayton accord in Paris last December, Yugoslavia
and Bosnia recognized each other but have yet to formally
normalize relations and set up embassies in each other's capitals.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic has said his country would fully
normalize diplomatic ties with Bosnia once the governing
institutions in that country, legitimately elected by the people,
were established.
</P>
<P>
With the election over and new authorities in place,
international sanctions against Yugoslavia were lifted last week
after four years. That has opened up new opportunities for trade
and other forms of cooperation, local media said.
</P>
<P>
Mutual recognition will imply recognition by Yugoslavia and
Bosnia of each other's borders. Such a step would be of great
importance to Bosnia which broke away from the former Yugoslavia
in early 1992.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic, who exerts strong influence within Bosnia's Bosnian
Serb leadership because of his economic support, was instrumental
in keeping Serb hard-liners on the peace track before the
September 14 election. His role will be as important in the
future.
</P>
<P>
"If Milosevic wants to continue warming up relations with the
West, he has to force the Bosnian Serbs to remain a part of
Bosnia as favored by the Muslims, although it will be a long time
before the multi-ethnic country can function smoothly," said
another Western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on
Tuesday, lifting sanctions against Yugoslavia that were imposed in
May 1992.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States said it would oppose Yugoslavia
rejoining the United Nations and other key international financial
organizations unless Belgrade fulfills other commitments in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Paris meeting is being held because the two presidents need
each other, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic is eager to improve ties with Bosnia to keep the
Dayton agreement on track so that Yugoslavia can join the
international institutions and obtain badly-needed loans to
restart its economy, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic wants his former adversary to rein in the Bosnian
Serb leaders who desperately want to split from Bosnia and set up
their own state, he said.
</P>
<P>
Without pressure from Belgrade and the international community,
the Bosnian Serbs could certainly block the normal functioning of
the new central government in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The strained relations between Yugoslavia and Bosnia have eased
over the last few months.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president of the Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation, Ejup
Ganic, paid an official visit to Belgrade in July, and Yugoslav
Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic headed an economic
delegation to Sarajevo the following month and signed a number of
economic agreements.
</P>
<P>
The summit in Paris on Thursday will give the Yugoslav and
Bosnian presidents the opportunity to discuss economic and trade
cooperation including the resumption of flights between Belgrade
and Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no peace in the Balkans if the leaders of
Yugoslavia and Bosnia fail to join hands in building peace and
solving the thorny issues that lie ahead," said one official.

<HEADLINE> Cuba, Britain to Expand Anti-Drug Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Cuba and Britain are to beef up
their joint anti-drugs efforts after signing a memorandum of
understanding on customs matters here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Britain will provide technical assistance,
customs management and training in the enforcement of customs laws
and the punishment of crime, such as commercial fraud and illegal
traffic of merchandise and drugs.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Pedro Ramon Pupo Perez, Republic of
Cuba General Customs director, and Thomas Sackville, the visiting
British undersecretary of state at the Home Office.
</P>
<P>
Pupo Perez said British support had led to higher efficiency in
fighting international drug trafficking. He said drug use was not
a problem in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
But Cuba was being used as a transit point for drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Sackville said he was satisfied with the achievements of the
Cuban government in combating international drug trafficking,
which "reflects Cuba's clear and absolute commitment to fighting
drugs."
</P>
<P>
Official sources reported there have been 41 operations against
international drug trafficking in Cuba this year, in which
more than 2.5 tons of cocaine, marihuana and heroin were
confiscated.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 persons were arrested, 63 of them are foreigners,
according to the official sources.

<P>
PARIS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac in
a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
today praised the "efforts by the Italian government to meet the
condition for a single currency", according to presidential
spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
Chirac criticized Italy's currency policy on Tuesday by
describing the devaluation of the Italian lira as having caused
greater damage to the French industry of textiles compared with
the competition by Southeast Asian-made textiles.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's criticism intensified the French-Italian relations
over the past two days.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that Chirac and Prodi had a "very
successful" telephone discussion and that France is willing to
maintain its friendly relations with Italy.
</P>
<P>
Colonna told reporters that France wishes to see that the
Italian currency returns "at a reasonable level" to the European
currency system.
</P>
<P>
She explained what France had criticized was the past approach
of the Italian currency policy. France appreciates the huge
efforts made by Italy in veering off the devaluation of lira.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that her country has fallen victim to
competition-triggered devaluation of currencies which is not
confined within the textile sector.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Registers Surplus in Food Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Argentina registered a
3.633-billion-dollar trade surplus in food products during the
first six months of the year, 17 percent over that of the same
period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The surplus resulted from 4.131 billion dollars in exports and
only 497 million dollars in imports, the Food Industry Union
(UNIDA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The increase in exports during the first half of 1996 is
explained by the growth in the sales of food stuff to Chile, the
European Union, and the Asian countries, as well as by better
prices, said UNIDA.
</P>
<P>
Food exports during the six months increased by 14 percent,
while imports dropped by 7.7 percent. The drop was caused by
shrinking domestic demand, added UNIDA.
</P>
<P>
It was projected that the nation's trade surplus for the food
sector will reach 7.7 billion dollars by the end of the year,
resulting from 8.7 billion dollars in exports and 1 billion
dollars in imports, UNIDA said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Netanyahu Fail to Resolve Difference But </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua ) -- The two-day summit talks
between Israeli and Palestinian leaders concluded here today
without resolving any of the toughest issues between the two
sides, but they agreed to continue negotiations on implementing
their interim accords.
</P>
<P>
"I wish we would have resolved everything in two days," said
U.S. President Bill Clinton at a White House press conference
after the intensive talks between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, acknowledging that
the summit felt short of his hopes.
</P>
<P>
"They were not able to resolve their differences here," said
the U.S. president who initiated the summit following bloody
clashes between Israelis and Palestinians in the last week.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton noted that the Israeli and Palestinian leaders
had agreed to remain "partners in peace, understand that it is
vital to take each other -- take into account each other's needs and
concerns, and realize the importance of removing the frictions
between them."
</P>
<P>
"The problems are still there, the differences are still
there," Clinton said. "But I believe there is a higher level of
understanding and a higher level of trust than existed before
these talks began," he added.
</P>
<P>
"They are also ready to renew and intensify negotiations on
implementing the interim agreement, with Hebron as the first
priority," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced that he was sending his peace envoy, Dennis
Ross, to the region to assist in the talks, which were to begin
Sunday. The long-delayed Israeli troop redeployment from the West
Bank city of Hebron is to be at the top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Arafat sat stone-faced, side by side in the East
Room of the White House with Jordan's King Hussein at the wrapup
of the talks.
</P>
<P>
But when they were leaving the White House, Netanyahu and
Arafat vigorously shook hands for several seconds.
</P>
<P>
Later, Netanyahu said at a news conference that the summit
"cemented the principle that the path to peace is through
negotiations and not through violence."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also said he and Arafat had established "a greater
degree of mutual trust."
</P>
<P>
He said that if lower-level negotiators don't resolve the
Hebron dispute, "Arafat and I will sit down until we solve it. We
agreed to do that."
</P>
<P>
But Nabil Shaath, a top aide to Arafat, said the summit's
failure was Israel's fault. "There is no agreement about anything.
President Clinton did his best to put the peace process back on
track, but the Israelis wouldn't let him," Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
One of the sensitive issues left unresolved was the Palestinian
demand that Israel close an ancient tunnel near Muslim and Jewish
holy sites in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the second entrance of the tunnel sparked last
week's violence that left 76 dead.
</P>
<P>
"There are very tough problems ahead," Secretary of State
Warren Christopher said at another news conference after the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said Sunday's negotiations would be conducted by
Dore Gold on the Israeli side and Abu Mazem for the Palestinians.
Both are senior advisers to their leaders.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav FM: Lifting of Sanctions Important for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan
Milutinovic said today that the lifting of the U.N. sanctions "is
an exceptionally important event" both for Yugoslavia and for the
entire region.
</P>
<P>
In an interview given to Belgrade Radio from New York,
Milutinovic stressed the contribution of Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic, saying he had been the architect of the peace
agreement which opened up the way for the lifting of the U.N.
embargo and the Dayton agreement would not have been possible
without him.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Tuesday to lift the
sanctions against Yugoslavia. The overall trade embargo, imposed
in May 1992, was suspended last November but has crippled the
Yugoslav economy.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic said Yugoslavia had joined the Dayton peace process
with great enthusiasm and optimism and all activities so far had
been based on the conviction that the right thing was being done.
</P>
<P>
"The world admitted this and concluded in a certain way in the
Security Council resolutions and in everything happening over the
past few days that Yugoslavia had been the pillar of the peace
process and that it would have been difficult to reach a peace in
these regions had it not been for Yugoslavia's role and principled
position," he said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which lifted the comprehensive embargo, does
not, however, release Belgrade's assets frozen abroad. The U.N.
Security Council also reserved the right to reimpose the sanctions
if the parties to last year's Dayton peace agreement fail to
adhere to the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic believed that Yugoslavia had "done much for our
country's credibility in the world and our neighborhood" and the
lifting of sanctions represented "the victory of our country's
peaceful and correct policy."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also noted that Yugoslavia still had much
to do and that a lot of efforts were needed for peace and
cooperation to fully reign in the territory of the former
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Group Offers More Loans for Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) today signed agreements to provide 10 million
U.S. dollars of loan and equity finance for Troika Dialog, one of
Russia's leading securities companies.
</P>
<P>
Troika Dialog will used the financing to expand its brokerage
and market-orientated activities.
</P>
<P>
The IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, and the largest
multilateral source of equity loan financing for private sector
projects in developing countries, has been active in Russia's
capital markets since 1993. It has become involved in the support
of key market institutions designed to enhance industry segments.
The corporation currently has investment commitments outstanding
to Russian enterprises totaling 235 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IFC's agreement came only three days after Russian First
Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Potanin and World Bank Vice
President for Europe and Central Asia Region Johannes F. Linn
signed here two loan agreements for a total amount of 159 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of the agreements, one is the capital market development loan
which is about 89 million dollars to support the development of
capital markets in Russia. The loan is designed to help improve
the regulatory infrastructure for capital markets and eliminate
informational and contractual uncertainties, thus reducing high
transaction costs.
</P>
<P>
The other is the energy efficiency loan of about 70 million
dollars to be used to finance the purchase of energy-efficient
equipment by major gas consumers in 10 municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Both loans were approved by the bank's Board of Executive
Directors in May this year.

<HEADLINE> IDB Provides Broad Menu of New Currency Options for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) today announced a major change in its
lending policy: the establishment of a single currency lending
facility that will provide a broad range of foreign exchange
options.
</P>
<P>
The new facility is the most significant change in the IDB
currency lending policy since it adopted a pooled currency lending
approach in 1982.
</P>
<P>
The new single currency facility (SCF) will provide IDB
borrowers with wider choices than before in designing the foreign
exchange risk composition of their IDB loan portfolio. Borrowers
will be able to receive loans denominated in one of four hard
currencies -- the U.S. dollar, the Swiss franc, the Japanese yen or
the Deutsche mark.
</P>
<P>
As another option, they may also continue borrowing based on
the IDB currency pool, which reflects a mix of U.S. dollars,
Japanese yen and European currencies.
</P>
<P>
All these alternatives will carry a variable interest rate,
adjusted biennially, that will be based on the average weighted
cost to the bank for each currency or for the currency pool.
</P>
<P>
Dollar lending under the SCF will be available on November 1 of
this year. Lending in the other three single currencies is
expected to begin in the third quarter of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Belgraders Welcome Lifting of Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 2 (Xinhua) -- With great relief and a broad
hope for a better life in the future, Belgraders welcomed the U.N.
decision Tuesday to definitely lift the sanctions imposed on
Yugoslavia 52 months ago.
</P>
<P>
"I am so much pleased to learn the U.N. resolution and hope
this will help boost Yugoslavia's economy that was devastated by
the unjust sanctions," 35-year-old Sanja Radovic, an engineer
working for a government company, told Xinhua on a Belgrade street
today.
</P>
<P>
"The hardest time has passed and we can look forward to a
better future," she said with smiles in her face.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Tuesday to lift the
sanctions against Yugoslavia. The trade and transport bans were
suspended last November, one day after a peace agreement was
reached in Dayton, Ohio, to end the three and half year bloody war
in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Zoran Mirovic, a 20-year-old university student, said that with
the complete lifting of sanctions, Yugoslavia now can devote
itself to economic development and return to the international
community.
</P>
<P>
"This is the reward to Yugoslavia's active role in the peace
process in the Balkan region," he told Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Jovanka Zebovic, 64, a retired worker, said she is happy to
hear the good news as this is very important for the economy and
for the people.
</P>
<P>
"It is also very important psychologically, as our people who
have suffered so much will now be encouraged to go forth and to
work harder," she said.
</P>
<P>
Radosav Pusic, a language professor, said he believes the
lifting of sanctions will pave the way for Yugoslavia to rejoin
international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, that does not mean everything is settled. "I
don't think the West would let Yugoslavia recover quickly from its
devastated economy. They always impose new conditions for the
Yugoslav people to meet."
</P>
<P>
Mirko Cvetkovic, 39, a shop assistant, said Yugoslavia is now
entering a new era as the resolution of problems can no longer be
deferred and sanctions can no longer be used as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come to start seriously resolving problems which
have accumulated over the four and a half years," he said, adding
he expects his own standard of living to improve gradually.
</P>
<P>
To those who are still living in the refugee camps in
Yugoslavia, the lifting of sanctions is also a huge relief.
</P>
<P>
Serbian Commissioner for Refugees Bratislava Morina said today,
"I am delighted the sanctions have been lifted, because it has
opened up the possibilities of an economic revival and the
creation of jobs for both Yugoslav citizens and its refugees."
</P>
<P>
In Yugoslavia, there are 650,000 refugees and displaced persons
fleeing from the territories of the former Yugoslav republics of
Bosnia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
"Only with a better situation in the Balkan region can we have
a hope of returning to our old home in Bosnia," said a Bosnian
refugee who lives with his relatives in Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> Lifting of Sanctions Confirms Yugoslavia's Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government said
today that the lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia was very
important and confirmed the country's positive role in the
regional peace process.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 1074 on the definite lifting of economic sanctions
against Yugoslavia, unanimously adopted by the United Nations
Security Council Tuesday, "is very important, because it marked
the decisive step toward a normalization of the situation in the
entire region," the government said in a statement to the local
press.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the measures it took to help preserve the country's
economic and social potentials and secure the lifting of the
sanctions imposed in May 1992, the government "can say with
pleasure that the most difficult period is behind us."
</P>
<P>
"Ahead is a period of work on general economic renewal and
Yugoslavia's full reintegration into the international community,"
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
When the sanctions were suspended late last year, the statement
pointed out, the federal government took a series of measures
regarding international organizations and institutions -- the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade
Organization, and others -- aimed at restoring Yugoslavia's
international position.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
comprised of Serbia and Montenegro, had established relations with
former Yugoslav republics, signed a series of bilateral agreements
with neighboring and other countries, and normalized relations in
the area of economic and other forms of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The definite lifting of the sanctions would doubtlessly step up
progress toward economic recovery and renewal of international
ties and cooperation, the government said.
</P>
<P>
"The federal government will continue with the constructive
policy and support to the full and efficient implementation of the
peace accord, with the objective further to fortify peace and
achieve the full normalization and stabilization of the situation,
and the successful economic and social development of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia," the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses US of Exercising Law of Jungle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf said today that by expanding the no-fly
zone in southern Iraq, the United States is exercising the law of
the jungle.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the 51st General Assembly session, Al-Sahaf said
the imposition of no-fly zones in the Iraqi airspace is a use of
armed force against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He noted that many countries oppose the U.S. action. It is a
unilateral decision that has nothing to do with the United
Nations, nor with Security Council resolutions on Iraq, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"I am wondering here: is a state entitled to forcibly impose
such a situation on another independent state, which is a member
of the United Nations, on the pretext of protecting its strategic
interests?" he said.
</P>
<P>
"Such act would cause the law of the jungle, rather than the
law of the Charter, to prevail in international relations," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that the United Nations, the General Assembly and
the Security Council reject the U.S. logic which, he said, is not
based on any international legitimacy nor any authorization by the
Security Council itself, and lift this injustice from Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Some Mutual Trust Established Through Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said after his summit meeting with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat today that they have established some mutual
trust, though they have not settled their explosive differences.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference this afternoon, the Israeli leader said,
"I think we've had a good start, because we established a greater
degree of mutual trust."
</P>
<P>
This was the first step to break down certain barriers that
were there of a lack of confidence in one another, Netanyahu said
after his two-day meeting with Arafat called by U.S. President
Bill Clinton following last week's bloody violence in the Middle
East that led to more than 70 deaths.
</P>
<P>
The violence was sparked by the new Israeli leader's decision
to open a second entrance to a tunnel that winds along the Temple
Mount, the site of Jewish and Muslim shines.
</P>
<P>
"I think the most important one is to cement the principle that
the path to peace is through negotiations and not through
violence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he stressed that there was a need to rebuild
security in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We've made it very clear that we are committed to the
redeployment in Hebron. We said it continuously, and we said it
again," he said. "We're prepared to do it, but in such a way as to
avoid a breakdown that would collapse the peace process not only
in Hebron, but altogether."
</P>
<P>
He said that this will require intensive negotiations on Hebron
and on security.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he and Arafat have decided to have their
senior people engaged in the negotiations starting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also noted that his two days of meeting with Arafat
would give them a new beginning that he hoped would achieve
progress in the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Officials Hail Lifting of Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb official Momcilo
Krajisnik said today that the lifting of the U.N. sanctions
against Republika Srpska and Yugoslavia Tuesday was a "historic"
decision.
</P>
<P>
The lifting of the sanctions means that all interested parties,
including the international community, had begun to fulfill their
obligations stemming from the Dayton accords, Krajisnik, former
Serb parliament speaker and now a Serb member of Bosnia's
three-member presidency, told the Serb state radio in Pale, the
capital of Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a
resolution lifting the sanctions against Yugoslavia and the
Bosnian Serb Republic, which were imposed in May 1992.
</P>
<P>
"The lifting of the sanctions will restore confidence in the
international community, and will also obligate us to continue
implementing the peace accords," the Serb official added.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Republika Srpska President Biljana Plavsic said the
report that the sanctions had been lifted could be described as
pleasant, because the decision was effective immediately and
unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Republika Srpska would not give any cause for the sanctions to
be reimposed, the Serb state radio quoted the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Republika Srpska Vice Premier Milomir Draganic, who
is in charge of the economy, said the lifting of the sanctions had
made Yugoslavia and Republika Srpska equal with the other members
of the international community.
</P>
<P>
Their return to world processes would depend on the ability of
their leaders and businessmen, Draganic added.
</P>
<P>
Republika Srpska's Socialist Party President Zivko Radisic said
in the largest Serb city of Banja Luka that with this decision,
the international community had corrected its mistakes made in
1992 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
"The lifting of the sanctions has created a new climate for the
operation of the economies of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
and Republika Srpska, as well as for their full integration in the
international community," Radisic said.

<P>
LAGOS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Twelve people were killed in
Nigeria's celebration on the creation of six new states in the
west African country which also resulted in many casualties.
</P>
<P>
In Gusau, capital of the new Zamfara State separated from the
original northwestern Sokoto State, two persons died and several
others were injured after falling from moving vehicles, according
to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
In Gombe, capital of the new Gombe State born from the
original eastern Bauchi State, celebrations have resulted in the
death of 10 people with several others injuried, said the
reports.
</P>
<P>
Wild celebrations spread in the new states with fuel stations
offering free gas and restaurants giving free food. Some
residents even smashed their radio sets in excitement upon
hearing of a new state for them, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
On October 1, Nigerian Head of State General Sani Abacha
announced the creation of six new states and 183 local
governments as part of the political transitional plan, according
to which Abacha's military administration would hand over to an
elected civilian government in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the new states were created to satisfy the
needs of different ethnic and regional groups in Africa's most
populous country.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Reactions Follow Party Registration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 2 (xinhua) -- The result of the party
registration announced on Monday by the National Election
Commission of Nigeria (NECON) has caused mixed reactions from the
political associations bidding for a role in the country's future
political stage.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the five groups that have been registered as
political parties expressed gratitude to NECON, while chieftains
of those whose application has been turned down showed
disappointment or even resentment to the decision.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Ibrahim Mantu, leader of the United Nigeria Congress
Party (UNCP) which scored the highest among the 15 political
associations seeking registration, commended NECON for a job well
done.
</P>
<P>
He said UNCP has done everything humanly possible to meet
NECON's requirement, adding that the inherent lesson in the
registration was that "in politics, we must make concessions."
</P>
<P>
He rejected insinuations that the registered parties are
pro-military, insisting that they are neither pro-military nor
pro-government but pro-democracy.
</P>
<P>
Kenny Martins, the national secretary of the National Center
Party of Nigeria (NCPN), another of the five parties registered,
said the leadership of his party was delighted "to have our
efforts rewarded after a hard work."
</P>
<P>
He commented that the electoral body was "fair and objective
in its assessment of the strength of the associations."
</P>
<P>
Leaders of those unregistered associations, however, reacted
differently.
</P>
<P>
Jolly Tanko Yussof, head of the National Democratic Labor
Party said he had no comment on any issue for now, while chief
Greg Mabadiwe of the All Nigeria Congress said his group has
taken its fate with philosophical calmness.
</P>
<P>
Others, however, behaved more passionately.

<HEADLINE> Help to Developing Countries Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from
developing countries today called on the United Nations to help in
coordinating the South-South cooperation and transferring
financial assistance and technology from the developed to the
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Given its strength and prestige, the United Nations is able and
need to play a useful role in this process, Vietnamese Foreign
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said while addressing the general debate
of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The international organization should concentrate first on the
regions in difficulty and on the key and practical issues, he
said. The United Nations system can considerately assist the
countries of the South to overcome their disadvantaged position.
</P>
<P>
The official also mentioned projects of the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) in Viet Nam and the Mekong basin.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out that the available means become ever more
scarce and natural resources more depleted. In a fierce
competition for development, countries are forced to concentrate
their resources on domestic needs to restructure the economy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
International cooperation, especially financial assistance and
technology transfer from the developed to the developing
countries, is indispensable, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the general debate, Dioncounda Traore, foreign
minister of Mali, called special attention to Africa, which, he
said, finds itself with extremely limited medical and educational
resources and over-burdened by enormous debt.
</P>
<P>
The current international economic situation is marked by a
growing imbalance between developing and developed countries, he
said. Greater measures are needed to relieve the developing
countries' external debt, he added.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Calls Mideast Summit Good Start for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher said here today that the two-day Mideast summit
in Washington made a "significant and important" beginning for
further peace talks, though President Bill Clinton announced
earlier that the summit failed to settle explosive differences.
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly true that no single summit can entirely change
an atmosphere or resolve all the substantive issues that lay on
the table," Christopher told a news conference after the summit
ended this afternoon. "But we did make a significant and important
beginning," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We'll continue to be involved as our administration has made
the pursuit of peace in the Middle East a top priority,"
Christopher stated.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said at a White House news conference that the two
parties will continue their talks beginning on Sunday with the
American mediating.
</P>
<P>
The summit between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjiamin Netanyahu was called by President Clinton
following last week's bloody violence in the Mideast that led to
more than 70 deaths.
</P>
<P>
The violence was sparked by Netanyahu's decision to open a
second entrance to a tunnel that winds along the Temple Mount, the
site of Jewish and Muslim shines.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said that President Clinton succeeded in bringing
the two leaders to Washington for face-to-face talks to resolve
their difference.
</P>
<P>
"Getting them together was itself a breakthrough" under such
difficult atmosphere, he said.
</P>
<P>
While stressing that the two sides need to restore mutual trust
and confidence between them and this could not happen overnight,
Christopher said there was an urgent need to get the parties to
intensify their negotiations on a range of issues relating to the
interim agreement and make possible the implementation of the
accord.
</P>
<P>
He said the two parties have committed to go back to the
negotiations on a continuous and intensive basis for the first
time since the formation of the new Israeli government.

<HEADLINE> Irish Prime Minister Meets Chancellor Kohl in Dublin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
held talks with visiting German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Dublin
this afternoon and the two leaders exchanges views on the fight
against drug trafficking and the coming special European Union
(EU) summit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after meeting with Bruton, Kohl
said, "I do believe that the citizens of Europe expect us to show
great determination in combating crime and particularly organized
crime, the mafia and drugs mafia in particular."
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who arrived in Dublin today for his first official visit
to Ireland, stressed that the EU special summit to be held in
Dublin Saturday would allow EU leaders to have a frank exchange of
views on the progress of the Inter-Governmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
"We will use the meeting as a preparation for more important
work to be done at a more substantive formal council session near
the end of this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the enlargement of the EU, Kohl said that the enlargement of
the 15-nation bloc "is also in our interests, political, economic
and cultural and Warsaw, Budapest and Prague are just as much as
an integral part of Europe as Berlin, Paris and Dublin."
</P>
<P>
Bruton, whose country is the current EU presidency state, said
that the outcome of his exchange of views with Chancellor Kohl
would "raise the sights and increase the ambitions" of the coming
EU special summit.
</P>
<P>
Thursday is the anniversary of Germany's reunification in 1990
and Kohl is expected to host a Unity Day reception in Dublin
before leaving for home.

<HEADLINE> Regional Leaders Urge Angolan Peace As SADC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The summit meeting of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) closed here today
as regional leaders urged prompt summit peace talks in a bid to
step up the Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique released after the meeting, the SADC
leaders were concerned over the delayed implementation of the
1994 Lusaka Peace Accord and urged early talks between Angolan
President Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi, leader of the
former rebel movement of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The one-day SADC summit, held for the first time in the
Angolan capital of Luanda, was mainly focused on issues
concerning the Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
The regional leaders said the two rivals, failing to agree on
a couple of issues including the formation of a unified national
army and a government of national unity and reconciliation,
should meet at an earliest possible date to remove the obstacles
stalking the way to national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, President dos Santos warned that the Angolan
peace process is "at a roundabout which either leads to war or to
peace."
</P>
<P>
The SADC leaders, apparently disappointed at the absence of
Savimbi at the summit, urged UNITA to abide by their commitment
to step up the peace process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
They also called on the international community to materialize
their aid promises to the war-stricken country to help facilitate
the repatriation of the UNITA troops, warning that war in Angola,
once broken out, would threaten peace and stability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Top leaders from 10 out of the 12 SADC member countries,
except Tanzania and Malawi, attended the summit.
</P>
<P>
They included President Nelson Mandela of South Africa,
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, President Ketumile Masire of
Botswana, the host Angolan President, President Joaquim Chissano
of Mozambique, President Sam Nujoma of Namibia, President Fredric
Chiluba of Zambia, Prime Minister B. Dlamini of Swaziland, Prime
Minister P. Mosisili of Lesotho and Deputy Prime Minister P.
Berenger of Mauritius.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, IMF Strive to Resolve Issue of Oil Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) today agreed to ask a joint
energy commission to set an accepted oil price in Africa's
largest oil producing country.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Finance Minister Anthony Ani was quoted by the
official News Agency of Nigeria as saying in New York today the
two sides have different stances over the right prices of the
country's oil products.
</P>
<P>
Ani, who is leading a Nigerian official delegation to the
ongoing annual meeting of the World Bank and IMF held in New
York, denied the IMF's accusation that the Nigerian government
has been subsidizing the oil sector.
</P>
<P>
He said the IMF did not take into consideration in its
calculation the value fuel oil, wax, bitumen, among other
by-products of oil.
</P>
<P>
And the proposed commission would take into consideration
factors that the IMF ignored in its calculations, he added.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the minister announced deregulation of Nigeria's
interest rate as part of the reforms aimed at boosting the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
A free-market interest system would soon be introduced with
the 21 percent cap on interest rate removed, said Ani, adding
that the merging of the country's dual exchange rates and the
removal of fertilizer subsidy will soon be implemented.
</P>
<P>
He added the Central Bank also planned to introduce a "minimum
exchange rate" as the basis of all interests offered by the
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister announced the government's freedom of
lending plan which means Nigeria's commercial banks would be free
to make loans to anybody or any economic sector without being
approved by the Central Bank.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay Opposes Unilateral Measures Against Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay Foreign Minister
Alvaro Ramos-Trigo today criticized extraterritorial application
of domestic legislation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the general debate of the 51st session of the U.N.
General Assembly, he said that the practice undermined not only
the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other
states but also that of freedom of trade -- the very essence of
the World Trade Organization when a country extended application
of its laws beyond its own national frontiers.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to be against the unilateral application for
political purposes of measures of an economic, trade or financial
nature directed against a state, measures whose usefulness to the
rapid and peaceful transition of a pace towards democracy it has
not been possible to demonstrate," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the countries with greater capacity to fulfill
their commitment of allocating at least 0.7 percent of their GDP
for development of the South countries.

LUANDA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela said today he hoped UNITA Chairman Jonas Savimbi would

Despite this, he said, the SADC leaders will not retreat, but
will make the greatest possible effort to ensure that peace would
be achieved in Angola.

The SADC leaders will devote further efforts to enabling
Savimbi, leader of the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA), to cooperate with them, Mandela promised.
