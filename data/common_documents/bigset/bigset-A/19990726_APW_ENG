<HEADLINE> Existing-Home Sales Hit Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans pushed existing home sales to a  
record high last month as they scrambled to lock in the best deals 
to beat slowly advancing mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
	June sales of existing single-family homes jumped 10.6 percent  
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.53 million units, the 
highest level ever, the National Association of Realtors reported 
Monday. All parts of the country saw sizable gains. 
</P>
<P>
	June's performance followed two consecutive months of sales  
declines and exceeded many analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists said they expect the most sales ever of existing  
homes in 1999, but they believe June's showing marked a peak, with 
a slowdown in housing activity in the offing in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month's big gain in used-home sales was attributed largely  
to consumer fears that mortgage rates will continue their upward 
climb, association officials and economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Home buyers were rushing to purchase in June before mortgage  
rates rise even higher,'' said Lynn Reaser, an economist with Bank 
of America Private Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``When buyers saw interest rates moving up this spring, they  
jumped off the fence and into the market,'' said Sharon Millett, 
the association's president. 
</P>
<P>
	But other factors also contributed. Consumers are feeling  
confident because the nation's economy is strong, unemployment is 
at a 29-year low, and the stock market has been posting record 
gains, economists said. And more financing options are available to 
lower-income people than existed just two or three years ago, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgage rates have been creeping up over the last couple of  
months. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 7.55 
percent in June, up from 7.15 percent in May, according to Freddie 
Mac, the mortgage company. The rate was 7 percent in June 1998. So 
far this year, mortgage rates have hit a low of 6.74 percent set at 
the end of January to a high of 7.71 percent set at the beginning 
of July. 
</P>
<P>
	With mortgage rates up and mortgage loan applications down, some  
economists said they expect a slowdown in housing activity in the 
coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that home sales have peaked,'' said Merrill Lynch  
economist Gerald Cohen. ``The backup in interest rates has caused a 
significant decline in mortgage applications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Lereah, chief economist with the Mortgage Bankers  
Association of America, agrees. ``The pipeline has dried up 
somewhat,'' he said, ``and when you look at home sales today, as we 
speak, they're slowing down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The big June jump in sales broke a two-month decline. In May,  
existing-home sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 
million units, a little worse than the 5.04 million units the 
association previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	And sales dropped in April to 5.25 million units from what was  
then a record 5.42 million units in March. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the biggest gains in sales were in the Northeast,  
rising 11.1 percent to an annual rate of 700,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
	The Midwest followed with a 10.9 percent increase to a rate of  
1.22 million units. Sales in the South rose 10.2 percent to a rate 
of 2.16 million, and in the West 9.9 percent to a rate of 1.45 
million units. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the national median sales price for existing homes  
rose 4.3 percent over June 1998 to $137,000, the Realtors 
association said. The median is the point where half the homes sell 
for less and half for more. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said even though the Federal Reserve, which raised  
interest rates June 30 for the first time in two years, gives 
little weight to existing homes reports, it could be viewed as a 
sign of too-strong growth that needs to be reined in by another 
interest rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
	``A surge like this in the face of sharply higher mortgage rates  
must fall on the tightening side of the Fed's ledger, even if only 
subconsciously,'' said First Union economist David Orr. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated  
that the central bank is prepared ``to act promptly and 
forcefully'' to raise rates again if inflation flares up. Mortgage 
rates, however, don't directly follow the Fed's actions so their 
movement can be hard to forecast.

<HEADLINE> Hispanics Mull Bush's Absence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Gathering in George W. Bush's home state, 2,000  
Hispanic-Americans gave Republican presidential candidate John 
McCain a standing ovation Monday and prepared for Vice President Al 
Gore's visit later this week. But the question rumbling through the 
meeting was: Where's Bush? 
</P>
<P>
	Not only is Bush governor of the host state for the National  
Council of La Raza convention, but he has enjoyed strong support 
among Hispanic voters here. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed,'' said La Raza President Raul Yzaguirre.  
``Some of our people are a little angry he didn't show up. Others 
are concerned he's taking us for granted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush campaign issued a statement Monday evening saying the  
governor was unable to attend the La Raza convention because he was 
in Maine with his family. Spokeswoman Mindy Tucker noted, however, 
that Bush had visited Hispanic communities during campaign trips to 
Michigan, California and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush believes it is important to reach out to  
Hispanic voters in all parts of the country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also was criticized after he declined an invitation to  
speak at a conference of minority journalists even though he was 
campaigning in the same city in which they were meeting. He 
arranged to drop by at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain was the only Republican presidential candidate to accept  
La Raza's invitation to appear. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona senator told the convention that he won more than 55  
percent of the Hispanic vote in his last election. ``I'm proud, but 
I'm not satisfied with that number. I want all their votes. Their 
support is my honor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressing for campaign finance reform as he actively courted the  
Hispanic vote, McCain said special interests and the ``pre-eminence 
of money over ideas'' run counter to the values of the Hispanic 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are the backbone of our country,'' he told the group.  
</P>
<P>
	Like Bush, Republican presidential rival Elizabeth Dole also  
said she had a scheduling conflict that prevented her from 
attending. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Democrats, Bill Bradley also cited a scheduling conflict;  
Gore planned to address the group Wednesday, a day after meeting 
with the Hispanic Caucus on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Navarrete, La Raza spokesperson, said this was the first  
time in recent memory that the governor of the state hosting the 
annual conference chose not to welcome the nation's largest 
Hispanic advocacy group to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always been a matter of course to invite the governor and  
have them talk to us,'' Navarrete said. ``We first invited him in 
December so it wasn't a surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has run into complaints before from minorities who claim  
that he's ignoring them. 
</P>
<P>
	He made a last-minute drop-in at the recent Unity conference of  
African-American, Latino, Asian and Native American journalists in 
Seattle after initially declining an invitation to speak, even 
though he was scheduled to be in Seattle at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also declined invitations to appear at the recent meeting  
of the League of the United Latin American Citizens in Corpus 
Christi, Texas and the National Association of Latino Elected and 
Appointed Officials in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact he has missed a lot of Latino events is  
troublesome,'' Yzaguirre said. ``If he's taking us for granted, he 
is misreading our community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some La Raza staffers pointedly noted that Bush made time for  
the Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremony for Nolan Ryan in 
Cooperstown, N.Y., on Sunday. Ryan pitched for the Texas Rangers 
and Bush was part-owner of the team.

<HEADLINE>  Shuttle May Have Leaked Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -- Photographs taken seconds into  
space shuttle Columbia's launch suggest that hydrogen escaped from 
one or more cooling tubes in its right engine, the space agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a fuel leak could have caused the shuttle to shut down  
suddenly if more hydrogen had escaped, forcing the first-ever 
shuttle emergency landing, either in Florida or West Africa, NASA 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of the suspected malfunction and an unrelated  
electrical short five seconds into launch Friday, Columbia and its 
cargo -- the world's most powerful X-ray telescope -- safely reached 
orbit under the control of Air Force Col. Eileen Collins, the first 
woman to command a U.S. space flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspected problem will not affect the rest of the flight,  
said Wayne Hale, NASA's mission operations representative, because 
the three main engines are not used after propelling the shuttle 
into orbit. Columbia is scheduled to land in Florida on Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a concern for our mission anymore, but it will be a  
concern for future shuttle launches, and I know our engineers will 
be working very closely on this issue and trying to make sure we 
understand it,'' Collins said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilot Jeff Ashby certainly noticed the problems, but said they  
didn't detract from the experience of his first shot into space. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure it was any more challenging than any other ascent  
as far as the trip up to orbit. It was quite exciting for me on my 
first one,'' said during a news conference this morning. ``I felt 
like I was on the biggest part of the rollercoaster for eight 
minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins and her crew today continued to work on science  
experiments while ground controllers kept track of the free-flying 
Chandra X-ray Observatory, successfully executing the second of 
five rocket burns to adjust the telescope's orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale said as yet there is no proof of a hydrogen leak. But such  
a leak could have been the reason Columbia's engines shut down a 
second or two early during the 8 1/2-minute climb to orbit, leaving 
the shuttle seven miles lower than expected. Columbia's engines 
will be inspected after landing. 
</P>
<P>
	On a couple other shuttle launches, hydrogen has leaked from  
cracked tubes in engine nozzles, but at a smaller rate than appears 
to have happened this time, Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cooling tubes, if split, would have begun leaking one or two  
seconds before liftoff and continued throughout the ascent, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hydrogen flows through the more than 1,000 slender steel tubes  
in each engine nozzle, to cool the bell-shaped nozzle and to 
preheat the super-cold hydrogen fuel before it flows into the 
engine combustion chamber.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Releases New Windows Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft on Monday sent a select group of  
computer and software manufacturers the first test version of the 
planned successor to its Windows 98 operating system, a program 
code-named ``Millennium'' that's scheduled for release next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Windows 98, which Microsoft targeted for both home and  
business use, Millennium is aimed solely at the consumer and home 
market. Microsoft's strategy is to capture the business segment -- 
from small business applications to the largest corporate networks 
-- with its new Windows 2000 operating system, which it hopes to 
ship by the end of December. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Sanford, group product manager for Microsoft's Consumer  
Windows Division, said Millennium will try to soothe the primary 
gripe of Windows users: that it's just too complicated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Millennium is the first step in the process of attaining these  
goals, in really simplifying the home computer experience,'' 
Sanford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft originally planned to bring out a consumer version of  
Windows 2000, a high-powered operating system built on a different 
code base than Windows 98. But in April, Microsoft President Steve 
Ballmer announced that one more generation of Windows 98 would be 
made, one that would link personal computers to the vast new array 
of digital devices appearing in homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballmer said Microsoft eventually plans a consumer operating  
system based on Windows 2000, but probably not before 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer computer market has evolved in a different  
direction from business, with home users wanting inexpensive 
machines that nevertheless can handle rich graphics for games, 
high-quality audio, Internet browsing, and have the capacity to 
link with other computers, stereos, televisions and various 
electronic gadgets around the house. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballmer has said computer manufacturers have asked Microsoft for  
a version of Windows that can do all that, but still be based on 
standard technology so it will work with existing computer 
components that have fallen drastically in price. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether a new version of Windows likewise will drop its price is  
an open question. Sanford said no price has been set for Millennium 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``pre-beta'' version of Millennium being released Monday is  
just the framework for the program, with computer makers and 
software vendors being asked to evaluate it from a technical 
standpoint. Sanford said it's too early to say what particular 
features the new program will have. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really focusing on the underlying technology, the core  
plumbing and piping of the system,'' Sanford said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said one thing being strongly considered is dropping  
the code that supports MS-DOS, the 1980s-vintage operating system 
that made Microsoft's fortune. Although eliminating such support 
would prevent Windows from running old software, it would 
drastically improve performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is necessary for us to evaluate the pieces of legacy code  
currently in Windows and determine what, if any value they offer 
consumers,'' Sanford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Sanford would not give specifics, he did outline broad  
goals for Millennium: 
</P>
<P>
	--Support for digital media and entertainment. The popularity of  
music and video, digital photography and super-realistic games has 
exploded, and the program will let users take full advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	--Easy connection to the Internet.  
</P>
<P>
	--Home networking. Millennium will simplify connecting multiple  
computers in the home to share data and an Internet connection, and 
provide the means for connecting different ``intelligent'' devices. 
</P>
<P>
	--A notion called ``It Just Works.'' The idea is that from the  
moment a computer is turned on, it should perform without baffling 
or frustrating the user. Millennium would be able to diagnosis its 
problems and ``heal'' itself, run new hardware or software simply 
and automatically, and allow new users to operate a computer 
straight out of the box. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Microsoft gets the technical feedback from its testers, it  
will incorporate needed changes in future test versions, Sanford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Microsoft has not yet decided on a final name for the  
operating system once it's ready for sale.

<HEADLINE> More Organ Donation Leave Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal employees would be granted more paid  
leave for donating bone marrow or organs under a bill the House 
passed today. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, introduced by Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., calls for  
seven days of paid leave a year for bone marrow donations and 30 
days for organ donations in addition to sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Current law allows federal employees only seven days of paid  
leave for organ donation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seven days is usually an adequate period of time for recovery  
from bone marrow donation,'' said an explanation of the bill 
released by the House Republican Conference. ``However, recovery 
from organ donation can be lengthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since advances in technology have increased the number of people  
benefiting from organ transplants, ``It is important that Congress 
encourage citizens to consider becoming organ donors,'' said a 
report from the House Committee on Government Reform. 
</P>
<P>
	No one spoke against the bill during a short period of debate  
just before the House passed it by voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The least we can do for those who are giving so much of  
themselves is to give them time to rest and recover,'' said Rep. 
Judy Biggert, R-Ill., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cummings added: ``Experience has shown that an organ transplant  
operation and post operative recovery for living donors may take as 
long as six to eight weeks. Tragically, every day 12 people die 
while waiting for a transplant. Every 16 minutes another name is 
added to the waiting list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A similar bill was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Daniel  
Akaka, D-Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill passed the House in 1998, but the Senate did not act on  
it before adjourning for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 457.

<HEADLINE> Rift Widens in Switched-Baby Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENA VISTA, Va. (AP) -- In the year since the discovery that two  
babies were switched at birth at a Virginia hospital, relations 
between the two families involved have gone sour. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, they agreed that the little girls would stay with the  
families raising them. The biological families would get liberal 
visitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Things haven't worked out that way -- not much of a surprise to  
experts who have followed the case of 4-year-olds Callie Johnson 
and Rebecca Chittum. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is so complicated, even the courts and mental health  
professionals will have trouble figuring out what's best,'' said 
Nadine Kaslow, professor of family and child psychology at Emory 
University in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the families' pledge to work out custody and visitation  
amicably ``was too much to expect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spirit of cooperation that settled over the case at the  
outset has since been supplanted by a custody battle so bitter that 
one mother screamed as she was leaving court: ``That's my child and 
I want her home with me!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paula Johnson's outburst was the latest twist in a saga that  
began last summer when she asked her former boyfriend for more 
child support for their daughter, Callie. A blood test was done to 
make sure he was the father. But when the results came back, Ms. 
Johnson learned that not only was the man not Callie's father, but 
Ms. Johnson was not the girl's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out that Callie and another girl had been switched at  
the University of Virginia Medical Center shortly after birth. 
State investigators have failed to determine how it happened and 
several lawsuits are pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a day after Ms. Johnson got the test results, Callie's  
biological parents, Kevin Chittum and Whitney Rogers, were killed 
in a car wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	They had never learned that the girl they were raising, Rebecca,  
was not theirs. After the car accident, the parents of the deceased 
agreed to share custody of Rebecca, only to find out later that 
Rebecca was not their biological granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	When the truth finally came out, the two sides met in August  
1998, and Ms. Johnson said at the time: ``Everyone was just 
wonderful. These are people you can feel very close to, even 
without this ordeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The relationship didn't last, and Ms. Johnson petitioned for  
custody of Rebecca. She also wants to keep Callie, while the other 
side wants to stick to the original agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy and Brenda Rogers, who are helping to raise Rebecca, leave  
little doubt they blame Ms. Johnson for the rift but won't go into 
specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	``My days of speaking to Paula are over,'' Tommy Rogers said in  
an interview Sunday at his Buena Vista home. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson's lawyer, Ken Mergenthal, would not allow his client  
to be interviewed. He said grandparents with differing agendas 
caused the rift. He said the Rogerses and the Chittums were 
bickering, and Ms. Johnson didn't like Rebecca being in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, it's not clear whether Callie knows what is going on.  
As for Rebecca, Brenda Rogers said the little girl is doing fine 
and has been told nothing about the switch. 
</P>
<P>
	``She just knows her mommy and daddy are in heaven,'' Mrs.  
Rogers said. ``Eventually, when she gets older, she will know the 
truth.''

<HEADLINE> Shire Deal May Lead to More Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Roberts Pharmaceutical Corp. and Shire  
Pharmaceuticals Group, two drug makers who specialize in developing 
and selling brand-name drugs acquired or licensed from other 
companies late in the research process, are combining in a $1 
billion deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Shire's acquisition of the Eatontown, N.J.-based Roberts could  
create a new powerhouse among the handful of such specialty drug 
companies -- and continue consolidations in that corner of the 
pharmaceutical industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to see more and more such companies find merger  
partners,'' predicted analyst Hemant Shah of Warren, N.J.-based HKS 
&AMP; Co. ``As these companies get bigger, they need a bigger critical 
mass, products with bigger sales potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts and Shire said Monday the all-stock deal would bring  
``significant benefits'' to both companies, partly because the two 
have complementary product lines, research programs and marketing 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``By combining two of the fastest-growing specialty  
pharmaceutical companies, we feel we will create a thoroughbred in 
this industry,'' said John Spitznagel, chief executive officer of 
Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
	Shire, based in Andover, England, will exchange between 1.0427  
and 1.2802 of its American Depositary Shares for each share of 
Roberts stock, depending on Shire's price when the deal closes. 
American Depositary Shares are U.S. bank receipts issued for 
ownership of foreign stock. 
</P>
<P>
	ADR shares of Shire were down 4 percent in trading on the Nasdaq  
Stock Market Monday, dropping $1.12 1/2 to $25.87 1/2. Shares of Roberts 
were up $1.50, or 6 percent, to $26.50 on the American Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, which will keep Shire's name, headquarters and  
chief executive officer, would have revenues this year of about 
$380 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``This transaction is an important step toward Shire's goal of  
exceeding $1 billion in revenues by 2005,'' said Shire CEO Rolf 
Stahel. ``The merger will significantly broaden and diversify our 
revenue base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts sells drugs for low blood pressure, an abnormal blood  
clotting disorder and ulcerative colitis. Its most promising 
products under development include a narcotic pain killer, a nasal 
spray for preventing nausea after chemotherapy, and an implantable 
drug for prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13-year-old Shire, the more-profitable of the two companies,  
sells drugs for osteoporosis, epilepsy and attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder. It increasingly is trying to develop its 
own drugs from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
	Shire expects a substantial restructuring charge in the fourth  
quarter, but analysts don't anticipate major job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``There'll be some, but more on the executive and administrative  
level,'' said Alex Zisson, a pharmaceutical analyst with Hambrecht 
&AMP; Quist in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Zisson called the merger with Roberts ``a continuation of a  
trend we've seen earlier this year, (with) two or three of the 
plums already taken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That trend includes such deals as Warner-Lambert Co. acquiring  
much-smaller Agouron Pharmaceuticals, Abbott Laboratories buying 
Alza Corp., a research-based drug company, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson 
buying Centocor, one of the nation's top biotech firms.

<HEADLINE> Lyons Co-Defendant Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The last co-defendant in the federal case  
against the Rev. Henry Lyons, the leader of one of the nation's 
largest black church organizations, was sentenced Monday to 18 
months probation for not reporting Lyons' crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Brenda Harris, a former planner for the National Baptist  
Convention USA and Lyons' one-time mistress, also was sentenced to 
75 hours of community service and fined $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so sorry that I allowed myself to become involved with a  
married man. I am so sorry that I broke the law,'' Ms. Harris told 
U.S. District Judge Henry Adams. ``And I am sorry that I let down a 
God I love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She pleaded guilty in April to misprision of a felony, which  
means she failed to inform police when a crime was being committed. 
As part of a deal with prosecutors, charges of money laundering and 
bank fraud were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	According to sentencing guidelines that considered Ms. Harris'  
lack of criminal past, the most she could have received was six 
months in prison and a $5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons was convicted in February on state racketeering and theft  
charges for bilking $4 million from companies doing business with 
the convention. He also was convicted of taking nearly $250,000 
from the Anti-Defamation League that was to help rebuild burned 
black churches. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons is serving 5 1/2 years in state prison. Last month a federal  
judge sentenced him to four years and three months behind bars on 
bank fraud and tax evasion charges, but that term will be served 
concurrently with the state sentence.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Would Cut NASA 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pushing a $93.8 billion spending  
bill through a House panel would cut NASA's budget by 10 percent 
and trim some housing and climate programs below President 
Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the legislation, approved Monday by voice vote, the  
National Aeronautics and Space Administration would get $12.3 
billion for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The space agency got 
$13.7 billion this year, and Clinton requested $13.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The international space station, one of NASA's highest-profile  
projects, would receive $2.4 billion, $100 million more than this 
year but just half the increase Clinton sought. The bill would deny 
the president's $150 million request for future missions of the 
Earth observing system, which studies climate, and trim $75 million 
from future Mars exploration missions while cutting Clinton's 
request for the space shuttle by $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about gutting space exploration,'' said NASA  
Administrator Daniel Goldin. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's chief author said the measure's allocations for many  
programs reflected the GOP's continuing efforts to live within 
stringent two-year spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. James Walsh, R-N.Y., chairman of the House Appropriations  
Committee subcommittee writing the bill, said he would ``make every 
effort to address these difficulties'' later this year -- when the 
legislation is likely to be part of budget negotiations with 
administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is only the beginning of the process,'' Walsh said.  
``We're at about the bottom of the third in a nine-inning ball 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top Democrat on the subcommittee, Rep. Alan Mollohan of West  
Virginia, called the NASA cuts ``enormous, devastating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To stay within spending limits, the subcommittee would designate  
$3 billion in veterans health-care spending and $2.5 billion in 
disaster assistance to be emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Under budget law, that means those items would be exempted from  
spending limits. Clinton had proposed making the disaster spending 
an emergency, but not the veterans' money. 
</P>
<P>
	They also claimed savings by reducing the Tennessee Valley  
Authority's ability to borrow by $3 billion -- borrowing the agency 
is not expected to need anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves illustrated the problems Republicans are having  
staying within those spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide $7.3 billion for the Environmental  
Protection Agency, $100 million above Clinton's request but nearly 
$300 million below this year. But within that total, it would 
provide $115 million for climate change technology -- a favorite of 
Vice President Al Gore -- just half the administration's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans would provide $18.3 billion for veteran's health  
care, $1 billion more than this year and Clinton's original 
request. Gore said Monday that the administration was now seeking 
an additional $1 billion as well amid pressure from veterans' 
groups for more spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also provides $26.1 billion for the Department of  
Housing and Urban Development, $2 billion less than Clinton 
requested but $2 billion more than this year. Money for inner-city 
development and aid for public housing renters would be cut below 
Clinton's requests. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo criticized the cut as  
striking ``a terrible blow against families and communities in 
need, ensuring that those left behind on America's road to 
prosperity will fall even further back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the GOP-dominated Senate voted to restore a rule it  
abandoned four years ago that will make it harder to use spending 
bills to change laws. The near party-line vote to renew that rule 
was 53-45. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of the rule in recent years made it easier for  
Democrats to slow work on spending bills and force debate -- and 
often votes -- on patients' rights and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The only defections were Sens. Max Baucus, D-Mont., and Daniel  
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who voted to restore the rule, and Kay 
Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who voted 
against it.

<HEADLINE> Pharmacy Discounts Hepatitis C Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A pharmacy that has had to turn away hepatitis  
C patients who couldn't pay $1,400 a month for the only treatment 
available has started selling the drugs itself at half the price. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher's Specialized Pharmacy Services, a drug store in  
Pittsburgh, began selling its version of the drugs this month. 
Until now, they had to be purchased from Madison, N.J.-based 
Schering-Plough Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``How would you like to have a disease and have insurance and  
still not be able to afford the drug?'' said Don Kerrish, one of 
the three druggists who own the pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hepatitis C is spread by blood and affects an estimated 3.9  
million people in the United States. It can lead to chronic liver 
problems, including cirrhosis and cancer. There is no vaccine 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough's treatment, known as Rebetron, consists of  
Ribavirin, which simply helps another drug, interferon, fight the 
virus. The company uses a type of interferon called Intron A, the 
only type approved for use with Ribavirin for treating hepatitis C. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher's is selling Ribavirin for $225 a month and, separately,  
an interferon not made by Schering-Plough for $420 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The pharmacists said they have received about 10 calls a day  
from potential patients since they started the sales July 9. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the Food and Drug Administration is letting both sell  
their drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Klein, an activist with the Hepatitis C Action and  
Advocacy Council, said Schering-Plough packages the drugs together 
just to make more money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doctors and patients need to have the access and flexibility  
to make the choices they deem appropriate, not the drug company,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough's president of U.S. marketing, Richard Zahn,  
denied the accusation: ``I think we're a company that cares about 
patients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough has asked the FDA to look into whether Fisher's  
is violating federal guidelines. By promoting the drugs, the 
pharmacy is moving toward manufacturing, which is not allowed, 
Schering-Plough claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerrish said the pharmacy is meeting federal regulations and  
selling safe drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough says its treatment -- which earned $248 million  
in the 12 months ending May 1999 -- is the only one proven to work. 
However, the company says it is effective in only about 40 percent 
of the people who take it.

<HEADLINE> Global Debt Relief Program Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- International financial leaders should agree  
in September on a program to provide debt relief to the world's 
poorest nations, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said today. 
</P>
<P>
	He said nothing, however, about selling some of the  
International Monetary Fund's gold reserves to help finance the 
effort, an idea running into mounting opposition in Congress and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to a development conference at the IMF, Summers said  
the world's wealthiest nations had to find ``an appropriate way to 
finance this relief that would win broad international support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month in Cologne, Germany, President Clinton and fellow  
world leaders unveiled an initiative to help ease the crushing debt 
burdens of the world's poorest countries, most of them in 
sub-Sahara Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is important now is that we take the extra momentum that  
the Cologne commitments afford -- to strengthen and accelerate these 
efforts and integrate them into a single package by the fall,'' 
Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the international community ought to reach  
agreement on such a program at the annual meetings'' of the 
182-nation IMF and its sister organization, the World Bank, at the 
end of September. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a ``historic opportunity to accelerate (debt relief)  
efforts and help these countries finally build an attractive 
environment for private investment and market-led growth,'' Summers 
said. ``We should not and must not allow that opportunity to go to 
waste.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the question of financing the $27 billion debt relief  
program ``raises some difficult issues.'' He referred to a proposal 
for the IMF to sell 310 metric tons of gold, about 10 percent of 
its total reserves. The sale would yield $2.7 billion at current 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nonetheless, I am confident that working together, we can find  
a way to do this in a way that can command broad support,'' Summers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, he said the Clinton administration was looking at  
alternatives to financing debt relief for 41 heavily indebted 
countries after several key members of both the Senate and House 
said sale of IMF reserves could weaken already depressed gold 
prices and hurt countries in Africa that rely on gold mining for 
export revenue.

<HEADLINE> McNabb Absent as Eagles Open Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- The quaint college campus was in place,  
quiet for the summer and ready for Andy Reid to begin the daunting 
task of rebuilding the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	One key component was missing, though: Donovan McNabb.  
</P>
<P>
	McNabb, the No. 2 draft pick expected to lead the Eagles out of  
one of the their darkest eras, was absent and unsigned Sunday as 
rookies reported for training camp at Lehigh University. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb did not join first-year players and selected veterans at  
a team meeting Sunday night. Reid, in his first year as coach, said 
McNabb and other unsigned players would be fined if they missed any 
practice time. 
</P>
<P>
	It marked the first time the Eagles had unsigned rookies at the  
start of camp since Jeffrey Lurie bought the team in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not allow the signings to be a distraction,'' said  
Reid, hired to replace Ray Rhodes after Philadelphia went 3-13 last 
season. ``We will go forth with those players that are on hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles signed second-round pick Barry Gardner to a five-year  
deal, fourth-round pick John Welbourn to a three-year deal and 
sixth-round pick Cecil Martin to a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Four draft picks remained unsigned when Reid convened his first  
official meeting as coach Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid expected about 30 players on the field today for practice,  
but didn't know when McNabb or the other unsigned rookies would 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter whether it's Donovan or whomever,'' Reid  
said. ``Any time a player misses a practice, it's a problem. I've 
talked to you about the quarterback position before. That's an 
important position. It doesn't help his progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb is listed as the backup quarterback to Doug Pederson, a  
31-year-old career third-stringer whom Reid has picked as the 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb's agent, Fletcher Smith, and Eagles executive vice  
president Joe Banner have said that voidable years and a buyback 
clause are the sticking points in negotiations. The Eagles don't 
want voidable years, while Smith is looking to include them after 
three or four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is believed to be considering a seven-year offer worth  
about $50 million, including a signing bonus of up to $12 million. 
Reid talked with Banner on Sunday and characterized negotiations as 
``productive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Both sides want this to work,'' Reid said. ``They're going to  
exhaust the ends here to make this happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banner characterized the contract as about 60 percent finished.  
Still, he acknowledged that McNabb would miss practice time even if 
he signed late Sunday night. McNabb's contract will be 20-30 pages 
long when it's finished. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm optimistic, but I don't want to give the impression that I  
think it's imminent,'' Banner said. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb's absence placed added pressure on Pederson, a free agent  
from Green Bay who showed up on time at the team's training 
facility. Veterans report to camp Wednesday, and the team holds its 
first full-squad workout with Reid as coach Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookies hold their first workout today with or without McNabb,  
the former Syracuse quarterback picked after the Cleveland Browns 
chose Tim Couch.

<HEADLINE> Corn, Soybeans Plummet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Corn and soybean futures fell sharply Monday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade as the Midwest's weather outlook improved. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, coffee and natural gas futures advanced.  
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans posted steep declines as a line of  
thundershowers moved through key Midwest growing states, providing 
much-needed moisture to crops that baked last week under 
temperatures in the mid- to upper-90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters now are calling for cooler temperatures later this  
week and say additional rainfall should help relieve crops from 
recent heat stress. 
</P>
<P>
	While crop conditions have deteriorated, farmers still are on  
track to harvest bumper crops. The Agriculture Department reported 
after trading had ended that crops weathered the heat relatively 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 70 percent of the nation's corn crop remained in good to  
excellent condition, down only 2 percentage points from a week 
earlier. And 65 percent of the soybean crop was in good to 
excellent condition, also down only 2 percentage points from a week 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Production of what is expected to be a record soybean crop and  
the third-largest corn crop on record will add to large inventories 
left over from last year's harvest as export demand only now begins 
to recover from Asian economic turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn for December delivery, representing prices after the fall  
harvest, fell 8 cents to $2.16 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans fell 
19 1/2 cents to $4.62 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures rose modestly on the Board of Trade of the City  
of New York after Colombia revised downward its June export 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices rose in dull trading in continued reaction to a report  
released late last week from Colombia's National Coffee Federation, 
which revised final June exports to 809,000 bags weighing 132 
pounds each. 
</P>
<P>
	That is nearly 22 percent lower than export figures from the  
same period a year earlier, and underscored that crop production 
has declined. Still, inventories of gourmet arabica beans in 
warehouses controlled by the Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange remain 
high. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains were limited by expectations that Brazil's arabica crop  
will not receive damaging frost in coming days. Coffee prices 
generally have tracked with forecasts that increase chances of 
frost during the Southern Hemisphere's winter. Brazil is the 
world's largest coffee producer. 
</P>
<P>
	While Brazil's crop is not of the grade certified for delivery  
to exchange warehouses, its coffee often is mixed with 
higher-quality beans. 
</P>
<P>
	September arabica coffee rose 1.25 cents to 96.05 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas futures rose a fourth session on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange as hot weather across the eastern half of the 
country forced utilities to generate more power for consumer air 
conditioning and fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas and electricity futures have moved sharply higher as  
temperatures in the 90s had more Americans seeking cooling relief. 
</P>
<P>
	August natural gas rose 1.4 cents to $2.542 for each 1,000 cubic  
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Other energy futures retreated as investors squared positions  
ahead of Tuesday's release of weekly inventory data. September 
crude fell 11 cents to $20.52 a barrel; September heating oil fell 
0.31 cent to 51.92 cents a gallon; September unleaded gasoline fell 
0.36 cent to 60.95 cents a gallon.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stocks Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets slumped across the board  
Monday, dragged down mainly by worries about a possible rise in 
U.S. interest rates and continuing tensions between China and 
Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 43.10  
points, or 0.25 percent, to 17,491.34. It was the Nikkei's fourth 
straight decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese stocks continued a string of losses that has seen them  
drop 5.6 percent in the last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have been taking advantage of a rally by the Nikkei  
earlier this month to sell shares they had bought more cheaply to 
guarantee themselves a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said such defensive selling is likely to continue until  
investors see new signs of strength in Japan's anemic economy. 
Attention will be on unemployment data for June and Sony Corp. 
earnings, both due out this week. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 116.44 yen,  
down 0.30 yen from late Friday in Tokyo but still above its late 
New York level of 116.55 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks closed sharply lower for a second straight  
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, fell 227.18 points, or 1.7 percent, to 12,866.52. On 
Friday, the index had slumped 275.36 points, or 2.06 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers attributed the fall to worries that U.S. interest rates  
will rise next month following a warning last week by Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that he will ``act promptly'' at 
the first hint of inflation in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong market was also dragged down by political tensions  
between China and Taiwan over Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui's 
assertion that the island is a separate state. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian shares also tumbled, with the key index losing 5.3  
percent on growing concerns over domestic politics and the slump in 
regional markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index fell 33.019 points,  
to 592.721. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean shares slumped as jitters over Daewoo Group's  
financial troubles continued to plague market sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 32.02 points, or 3.5  
percent, to 872.94. On Friday, the index had tumbled 7.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Kim Woo-choong, the head of Daewoo, pledged to  
faithfully carry out restructuring to retain trust from markets and 
investors because of concerns the group could drag down the entire 
economy.

	Stocks Lower; Dow Closes Down 47.80  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The continued threat of higher interest rates  
pushed stocks lower in listless trading today, inflicting the 
steepest damage on highly priced technology stocks. At the close, 
the Dow Jones industrial average was down 47.80 at 10,863.16, 
having surrendered a modest gain at midday. The blue-chip index 
fell 298.88 points, or 2.7 percent. Broader stock indicators were 
lower as well. Nervous investors have begun to believe that the 
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates as early as next month in 
an effort to hold off inflation. The Nasdaq composite index fell 
72.71 to 2,619.71.

	European Stocks End Lower  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed lower today, with banking  
shares falling amid anxiety over global interest rates. Concern 
about rising U.S. interest rates has cast a shadow over world stock 
markets since last Thursday, when U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan said the central bank will act ``promptly and 
forcefully'' if inflation resurfaces and unemployment continues to 
drop. Banks which ended the day lower included ABN Amro, which 
closed down 10 cents at 21.05 euros. Paribas fell 5.60 euros to 
96.50 euros, BNP fell 3.90 euros to 71.10 euros, while Societe 
Generale shares ended down 6.90 euros at 152.00 euros.

	Late Payments-Mortage Link Ignored  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Only two in five Americans understand that if  
they chronically fail to pay bills on time they will have a major 
problem getting a home mortgage, according to a survey released 
today by mortgage giant Fannie Mae. Company officials called the 
lack of awareness a barrier to homeownership at a time when other 
obstacles, such as inability to save money for a down payment and 
racial discrimination, are diminishing and Americans are buying 
homes in record numbers. Some experts blame soliciting by the 
credit card industry and the easy availability of credit in general 
for the apparent lack of understanding of the consequences of a bad 
credit record. A Fannie Mae spokesman said the company was 
preparing a consumer education initiative in cooperation with other 
mortgage industry participants.

	Existing Home Sales Hit Record  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans pushed existing home sales to a  
record high last month as they scrambled to lock in the best deals 
to beat slowly advancing mortgage rates. June sales of existing 
single-family homes jumped 10.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 5.53 million units, the highest level ever, the 
National Association of Realtors reported today. All parts of the 
country saw sizable gains.

	NTL To Acquire Cable &AMP; Wireless Unit  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Fresh from clinching a nearly $10 billion deal  
with Cable &AMP; Wireless Communications PLC, NTL Inc. suggested today 
it might seek a second acquisition that would secure its position 
as the dominant player in Britain's consolidating cable industry. 
NTL has agreed to buy the residential operations of Cable &AMP; 
Wireless Communications in a step that would make it the country's 
biggest cable operator. CWC shareholders still must approve the 
acquisition, which the two companies announced today. The action 
appeared to thwart efforts by rival Telewest Communications PLC to 
strike a deal of its own with CWC. Telewest is currently Britain's 
largest cable company, followed closely by CWC and then NTL.

	EU Official Warns Britain on Euro  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The European Union's top finance official used his  
final speech in office today to warn that Britain's decision to 
stand aloof from the single European currency threatens EU unity 
and risked tragic consequences for British politicians. 
Yves-Thibault de Silguy said Britain's decision not to join the 11 
EU nations that adopted the euro Jan. 1 left it marginalized in 
Europe's financial decision-making, while the pound sterling 
suffers from exchange rate volatility buffeted between the euro and 
the U.S. dollar. He said exchange-rate uncertainty put British 
companies at a disadvantage.

	Global Debt Relief Program Urged  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said today  
international financial leaders should agree in September on a 
program to provide debt relief to the world's poorest nations. He 
said nothing, however, about selling some of the International 
Monetary Fund's gold reserves to help finance the effort, an idea 
running into mounting opposition in Congress and elsewhere. Summers 
said the question of financing the $27 billion program ``raises 
some difficult issues.'' Last month in Cologne, Germany, world 
leaders unveiled an initiative to help ease the debt burdens of the 
poorest countries, most in sub-Sahara Africa.

	Drug Co. Shire To Acquire Roberts

<P>
	EATONTOWN, N.J. (AP) -- British drug maker Shire Pharmaceuticals  
Group plans to acquire Roberts Pharmaceutical Corp. in a stock deal 
worth about $1 billion. The two specialty pharmaceutical companies, 
which develop and sell medicines licensed or acquired from other 
companies rather than doing basic drug research, said late 
yesterday that the merger would bring both companies ``significant 
benefits.'' The two have complementary product lines, research 
programs and marketing operations. Shire, based in Andover, 
England, will exchange between 1.0427 and 1.2802 of its American 
Depositary Shares for each share of Roberts stock, depending on 
Shire's price when the deal closes. American Depositary Shares are 
U.S. bank receipts issued for ownership of foreign stock. Roberts

<HEADLINE> Marin Beats Ulihrach in Croatia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UMAG, Croatia (AP) -- In a day of upsets, Juan Antonio Marin of  
Costa Rica ousted defending champion Bohdan Ulihrach of the Czech 
Republic from the Croatia Open in the first round Monday, 3-6, 6-4, 
6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Ulihrach, seeded sixth and ranked 42nd in the world, won the  
last three games to win the first set, but Marin dominated the rest 
of the match. 
</P>
<P>
	Marin this week reached his best ATP ranking, No. 68.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Rainer Schuttler of Germany upset a two-time French  
Open champion, Spaniard Sergi Bruguera, 7-6 (7-4), 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-seeded Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia struggled to defeat  
ATP's No. 584, 18-year-old Lovro Zovko of Croatia, 7-5, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Alberto Portas, ATP's 87th player, didn't have much trouble  
defeating fellow Spaniard Alberto Berasategui 6-4, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first set, Berasategui led 4-3 and had a service break,  
but then failed to win any subsequent game. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Ruud of Norway was losing 1-2 in the first set against  
Arnaud Di Pasquale of France, but then won nine consecutive games 
to make it 6-2, 4-0, and won 6-2, 6-1.

<HEADLINE> Fouls Aplenty in NBA Summer Leagues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Barely 10 seconds had ticked off the clock in a  
summer league game between Philadelphia and New York on Monday when 
the Knicks were whistled for their first foul. 
</P>
<P>
	Four seconds later, they were called for another. Nineteen  
seconds after that came another, and 12 seconds later, yet another. 
That's four fouls in 45 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough for me, because every time I touch somebody, they  
call a foul,'' said Knicks first-round draft choice Frederic Weis, 
who said it was much more physical last year when he played in, of 
all places, France. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Europe, you can push, even kill somebody, and there's no  
foul,'' said Weis, who was called for three fouls in the first 196 
seconds on Monday. ``After I learn how you play defense here, I'll 
be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pace eventually slowed, and the players adjusted to what the  
officials would allow. But there were still 76 fouls in the 
40-minute exhibition, about twice the rate of a typical NBA 
regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to differentiate between aggressive play and  
rough play,'' said referee Dick Bavetta, who is monitoring four 
summer leagues to see how the league's new crackdown on physical 
play is working out. ``We will allow aggressive play. We will not 
allow rough play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new guidelines were instituted this summer after a panel of  
coaches, general managers, players and owners brainstormed over 
ways to improve the quality of the game. The consensus: Cut down on 
the pushing and grabbing that make it impossible for the offensive 
player to make his move. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to let scorers score,'' said Boston Celtics coach  
Rick Pitino, who served on the panel. ``I'm for more scoring. I 
don't want to see five-point quarters; I want to see freedom of 
movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bavetta puts the rules in four different categories.  
</P>
<P>
	-- *Post play*: Any attempt by the defensive player to ``dislodge  
or displace'' the offensive player from his position will be 
considered a foul. 
</P>
<P>
	-- *Cutting*: When the defender uses his shoulder, forearm or  
anything else to ``reroute'' the offensive player trying to cut 
through the middle, it will be called a foul. 
</P>
<P>
	-- *Screens*: The offensive player setting a screen must give the  
defensive player a chance to go around. In other words, no moving 
picks. 
</P>
<P>
	-- *Off-ball contact*: Clutching and grabbing to prevent the  
``fluid movement'' of the offensive player is a foul. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a work in progress,'' said Bavetta, who is in his 25th  
year as an NBA official. ``But players are smart enough to adjust. 
And it's not as if it was a surprise to anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rule changes have been publicized, and each team in Boston  
was given a talk before each game. Bavetta also spent four hours 
Sunday night teaching the officials what they should be looking 
for. 
</P>
<P>
	Bavetta will report back to the league, which will decide  
whether to continue the experiment in the exhibition season. Then, 
there could be more tinkering before the regular season starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it might take a little while for individual players to  
adjust their games to a more fluid style. And some teams that have 
tailored their rosters towards a physical style could be in for a 
major overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	If the rules stick, that is.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the league is committed to going in this direction,''  
said Boston general manager Chris Wallace, whose team played a 
50-minute first quarter in when the rules were being tested in Los 
Angeles earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a while to filter out. This is what summer  
leagues are for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy, for one, would like things to go  
back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think NBA players are going to be asked to play like  
that. You don't want the best athletes in the world to try to play 
with no contact,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's OK in the summer leagues with Frederic Weis. But I don't  
think people want to pay to see Allan Houston sit on the bench with 
two touch fouls, or Tim Duncan.''

<HEADLINE> Former NFL Player Killed by Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Demetrius DuBose, a former football player for  
Tampa Bay and Notre Dame who fell on hard times, was fatally shot 
by police who chased him down after he fled a burglary scene, 
police officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubose, 28, a former linebacker for the Buccaneers, was shot  
several times Saturday. Officers said he charged them while waving 
their nunchukas, a weapon that consists of two wooden sticks joined 
at the ends by a short chain or rope. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose fled when officers tried to question him outside a  
Mission Beach home that had been burglarized. Officers said they 
tried to stop him by spraying him with mace, but he ran. They 
caught him, scuffled and he got away again. 
</P>
<P>
	When they caught him a second time, they struggled with him. He  
grabbed the weapons of both officers and started swinging the 
nunchukas, Lt. Glenn Breitenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The officers believed that they were about to be assaulted in  
a dangerous manner with weapons that could kill them, and they 
fired,'' Breitenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said DuBose seemed drunk or drugged. An autopsy was  
conducted Monday. Results of toxicology tests were not expected for 
a few weeks, Breitenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two officers who shot DuBose were removed from field work  
pending an investigation, Lt. Tom Orden said. Their names were not 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Notre Dame players were surprised to hear what happened.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think it would end like this,'' said John Carney, a  
kicker for the San Diego Chargers who played at Notre Dame a few 
years before DuBose, but knew him through mutual friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tragic. He had a lot going for him,'' Carney said. ``I  
knew people reached out to him, but he was a hard guy to reach. He 
didn't want the help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose, whose last address was Mammoth Lakes, Calif., played for  
Notre Dame from 1989 to 1992. He was a second-round draft pick of 
Tampa Bay in 1993 and played four seasons with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is so uncharacteristic,'' said Jerry Angelo, Tampa Bay's  
director of player personnel. ``If anything went bad in his life, 
it had to have come after football for it to get to the depths it 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Wyche, who coached DuBose for three years at Tampa Bay, said  
DuBose was let go because he wasn't a good player, not because of 
anything that happened off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``He talked about (how) if it didn't work out, he'd do the next  
thing and take it on just as hard. He was just a positive guy,'' 
Wyche said. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose signed with the New York Jets as a free agent in 1997,  
but was cut during training camp four months later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how you go from being a (second-round) pick from  
Notre Dame to getting shot to death for burglary,'' said Chargers 
guard Aaron Taylor, who also played with DuBose at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor had heard that DuBose was practically destitute, but few  
people saw him after he left New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would be like a `Demetrius sighting' -- he'd just  
disappear, then show up one day, for a night, then boom, he'd 
disappear. A buddy said, `God, the guy looked like he was sleeping 
in his car or something,''' Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, DuBose was arrested in South Bend, Ind., after he  
became belligerent at a nightclub. When an off-duty police officer 
working at the club ordered him to leave, DuBose allegedly grabbed 
a pipe from an overhead sprinkler system -- flooding the club with 
some 1,600 gallons of water. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged with resisting address, disorderly conduct and  
possession of marijuana.

<HEADLINE> Serb Independent Radio To Be Aired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbia's leading independent radio  
station soon will return to the air with a new name and a new 
frequency, the editor in chief said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	B-92, the most popular independent radio in Serbia, was shut  
down by the government of President Slobodan Milosevic four months 
ago -- shortly after the beginning of NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia. 
The authorities subsequently clamped down on other independent 
media and government opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	The station's editor in chief, Sasa Mirkovic, said B-92 will  
resume programming in about a week using one of the frequencies of 
Belgrade's Studio B radio and television station. The frequencies 
are controlled by the capital's opposition-led municipal council. 
</P>
<P>
	The new station will be called B 2-92 and will initially  
broadcast for 12 hours daily, said Mirkovic. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the station will legally be part of Studio B, but will  
include all journalists from the former B-92 and will have full 
editorial freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate reaction from the authorities on the  
possibility of a rejuvenated B-92. Serbia has a highly restrictive 
media law enabling the government to fine and shut down media it 
considers to be working against the state interest. 
</P>
<P>
	B-92 had been highly critical of Milosevic's policies. It  
organized a network of independent, local radio and television 
stations in Serbia that have worked to end restrictions on the 
media in Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Woodstock Violence Blamed on Few </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- Although Woodstock '99 ended in fires,  
looting, vandalism and police being pelted with bottles and fruit, 
officials said the destruction was caused by a small segment of the 
concertgoers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This festival did not collapse into chaos,'' Oneida County  
Executive Ralph Eannace said during a news conference Monday. 
``This festival had a very serious problem for a few hours last 
night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Local officials refused to call Sunday's episode at the  
three-day festival a riot. Two state troopers were among seven 
people injured in the melee before authorities regained control of 
the festival site just before daybreak Monday. One concertgoer 
suffered a broken leg and back injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven people were arrested on charges of rioting, disorderly  
conduct and criminal mischief. The chaos involved a few hundred 
youths from among a crowd of about 150,000 at the time, State 
Police Superintendent James McMahon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those caught on the festival grounds at the former military base  
had a much different perspective as they watched an unruly mob loot 
and burn a row of 12 tractor trailers, set fire to a small bus and 
several portable toilets, overturn a car and destroy several vendor 
booths, ATM machines, light stands and a speaker tower. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands cheered them on.  
</P>
<P>
	``We felt threatened,'' said 52-year-old vendor Tom Fall, of  
Putney, Vt., who was packing to leave at midday Monday. ``This was 
supposed to be peace, love and harmony. I was at the first 
Woodstock. That was a disaster also, but there was no violence. 
This completely blew me away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The violence erupted as the Red Hot Chili Peppers played the  
festival's closing set. 
</P>
<P>
	State troopers were outside the festival grounds helping guide  
about 75,000 people who left during the day Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Security inside the festival was provided by a 1,250-person  
force that organizers said was not properly trained to handle a 
riot. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clintons To Visit NY's Finger Lakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton and Hillary Rodham  
Clinton, who is expected to seek a Senate seat from New York next 
year, will spend part of their summer vacation in the Finger Lakes 
region of the state, a spokeswoman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons will spend Aug. 30 to Sept. 3 in Skaneateles, a  
quiet resort town of 7,526 people on the north end of Skaneateles 
Lake just southwest of Syracuse, said Marsha Berry, the first 
lady's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons are heading back to Martha's Vineyard on Aug. 17  
for a fifth summer vacation. They plan to be there until Aug. 28 
when they will head to the posh Hamptons on the east end of Long 
Island for a series of fund-raising events staged by the Democratic 
National Committee. After the two days of weekend fund raising, 
they will head to the Finger Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Skaneateles is a 205-year-old village that was once a stop on  
the Underground Railroad that ferried slaves north to freedom 
before the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who has never lived or worked in New York, has  
formed a Senate exploratory committee to raise money for an 
expected Senate run.

<HEADLINE> Philips' Executive Losier Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Royal Philips Electronics NV's  
leading executive in North America, John Losier, has resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Philips said that Losier was leaving as  
president and chief executive of Philips Electronics North America 
effective Monday to pursue ``other interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dutch-based multinational electronics manufacturer gave no  
further explanation of the sudden departure. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Curran, the current chief financial officer of Philips  
North America, will succeed Losier. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips is one of the largest electronics manufacturers in the  
world, with sales of almost $34 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips Electronics has had a high turnover of leading  
executives since chairman Cor Boonstra took over in 1997. The head 
of its flagship consumer products division, Doug Dunn, left earlier 
this year.

<HEADLINE> No Free Lunches for PCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	There's a very wise -- though ungrammatical -- saying you ought to  
keep firmly in mind when considering the latest flurry of ``free'' 
personal computer offers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There ain't no such thing as a free lunch.''  
</P>
<P>
	On the surface, some of these offers look pretty good: You get a  
multimedia PC, with a 333-megahertz or better processor, fast 
CD-ROM or DVD drive, 56-kilobit modem, color monitor and 
multigigabyte drive. 
</P>
<P>
	So what's not to like? Consider these:  
</P>
<P>
	--One ``free PC'' offer obligates you to take a five-year  
subscription to an Internet service at prices ranging from around 
$30 to $50 a month, depending on the level of PC you select. The 
company will replace the PC after 30 months. But 30 months in the 
world of computer technology is like 30 years in the real world, so 
if being absolutely cutting-edge all the time is important, this 
might not be for you. 
</P>
<P>
	--Another offer requires an upfront payment of $1,087 for a  
three-year term with the right to cancel, but only if you contact a 
sales representative within the first 15 days; otherwise, there's 
an unspecified cancellation fee. There are other offers that also 
require payment in advance, which is a risky policy for the 
consumer. 
</P>
<P>
	--Another offer gives selected applicants a free PC, but the PC  
desktop is framed by ads and you must agree to use the PC for at 
least 10 hours a month for 30 months. Charge yourself the minimum 
hourly wage ($5.15) and those 300 hours of staring at ads cost you 
$1,545, which is on the pricey side of ``free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not to mention that the machines offered for free are often  
available at retail in the $500-$700 range. 
</P>
<P>
	What's driving this sudden fad is the search by Internet service  
providers for eyeballs they can sell to advertisers and the search 
by PC manufactures for new sources of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Internet providers, the target is the 60 percent or so  
of American eyeballs not now online. Someone is going to get them 
and they all have a favorite nominee. Once gotten -- and gotten for 
long terms -- they have a potentially very targeted audience to sell 
to advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	The PC manufacturers, engaged in a price war, are seeing profit  
margins rush toward the vanishing point. Bundling a machine with 
service over a multiyear contract is a way to generate new revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	If you intend to use your PC only to go online, one of the  
``free'' deals floating around out there might be OK for you. But 
take extra care to read all the details of any agreement you sign 
and understand that, except as you might be protected by your 
state's laws, paying upfront puts all the leverage in the hands 
holding the cash. 
</P>
<P>
	And if you must do it, choose a company that's been around for a  
while instead of one that flickered into existence on the Net and 
well might flicker out during the term of your contract. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Medicine Journal Forces Out Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The top editor of the New England Journal of  
Medicine has been forced out in a dispute over the use of its 
distinguished name to sell consumer newsletters and other 
publications. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer was asked to step down, friends say,  
because of his long-standing opposition to the Massachusetts 
Medical Society's practice of launching new magazines and 
advertising them as being from ``the publishers of the New England 
Journal of Medicine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They said Kassirer and other editors oppose tying the journal's  
reputation to consumer health letters and other magazines that have 
no real connection to the New England Journal's standards or 
editing. 
</P>
<P>
	The New England Journal, founded in 1812, is regarded by many as  
the world's most prestigious medical publication. Each week, it is 
a source of news about the latest breakthroughs in medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Massachusetts Medical Society, which owns the journal, said  
it will not renew Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer's contract as journal 
editor, a job he has held for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	``They decided that they were no longer interested in my  
continuing as the editor in chief,'' Kassirer said Monday. ``They 
told me that they wanted to end my tenure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Medical society officials said Kassirer's performance as journal  
editor was never questioned, and both sides said the society never 
interfered with his decisions about what to print. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an honest difference of opinion,'' said Frank Fortin,  
a medical society spokesman. ``We are trying to be responsive to a 
new world of medical publishing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Dr. George Lundberg was fired from the Journal of  
the American Medical Association, another of the world's most 
distinguished medical journals, for publishing a 1991 survey of 
college students on whether oral sex constitutes sex. The AMA 
objected to the timing of the publication to coincide with 
President Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Kassirer will give up his job Sept. 1. Several sources said the  
medical society is negotiating with Dr. Marcia Angell, the 
journal's executive editor, to fill in for Kassirer while a search 
committee looks for his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	During his tenure, Kassirer broadened the journal's coverage in  
many areas, including molecular biology, and put an electronic 
version of the journal on the Internet. The journal's circulation 
reached about 240,000, with an annual subscription costs $129. 
</P>
<P>
	While the journal is thought to contribute many millions to the  
medical society's budget each year, the society declines to reveal 
exactly how much. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquaintances said that during his entire tenure, Kassirer  
resisted the medical society's attempts to use the journal's name 
and logo to sell its newer publications. These include two consumer 
newsletters, HealthNews and Heart Watch, as well as Hippocrates, 
Journal Watch and AIDS Clinical Care, which are written for 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Robert J. Mayer of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in  
Boston, a part-time journal editor, said Kassirer's contract gave 
him veto power over any use of the journal's name and logo. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no black-and-white villains and good guys here,''  
Mayer said. ``There is just a philosophical difference. The journal 
views itself as an international treasure, and the Massachusetts 
Medical Society views it as their most outstanding product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kassirer also resisted suggestions that the journal move its  
offices from the Harvard Medical School library to the society's 
just-opened headquarters building in suburban Waltham. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Marshall N. Kaplan of New England Medical Center, another  
journal editor, said many at the magazine fear that ``somehow those 
who look at it as one part of a business will gradually destroy the 
primacy of the New England Journal without even knowing what they 
are doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Fortin said the society will do nothing to harm the New  
England Journal's reputation. ``It matters like very few other 
publications in America do,'' he said. ``We are very much aware of 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortin disputed parallels, which some drew, to the furor two  
years ago over the American Medical Association's abortive deal to 
endorse Sunbeam Corp. products.

<HEADLINE> Senate Begins Work on Tax Cut Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate takes up its version of a 10-year,  
$792 billion tax cut this week against an administration warning 
that President Clinton would veto even a compromise plan that 
lowers the cut by hundreds of billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	White House budget chief Jacob Lew told reporters today that  
Clinton is not open to splitting the difference between the GOP 
plan and his proposal to reduce taxes by some $250 billion. He even 
ruled out a $500 billion compromise offered by Sen. John Breaux, 
D-La. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president would veto a bill with $500 billion in tax cuts  
because it can't meet the tests'' of also strengthening Social 
Security and Medicare while boosting other domestic and defense 
programs without dipping into Social Security surpluses, Lew said 
at the National Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Two top administration officials, Treasury Secretary Lawrence  
Summers and National Economic Council chairman Gene Sperling, had 
the same message on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president will veto that $800 billion bill, the president  
will veto a $500 billion tax cut because it doesn't leave room for 
what's necessary,'' Summers said on CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the same program, Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said Republicans  
should put off sending their bill to Clinton for a certain veto. He 
suggested they wait until after the Labor Day recess and then 
negotiate a package combining a $500 billion tax cut with a 
Medicare bill that extends prescription drugs to Medicare 
recipients, an administration priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to stop talking to ourselves and start talking to  
each other,'' Breaux said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have indicated they are willing to give some on  
their tax package, but they call Clinton's proposal unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration says the projected budget surplus over the  
next decade -- nearly $3 trillion -- should go first to restoring 
solvency to Social Security and Medicare, bringing down the federal 
debt and boosting defense and education spending. A modest, 
targeted tax cut could come when those primary goals are met, it 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans say the Democrats would increase spending by  
more than $1 trillion. ``We think that is a ludicrous suggestion at 
a time when we have surpluses,'' Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, 
R-Texas, said on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' ``The rest should go back 
to the people who earn it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans stress they can devote three-fourths of the surplus  
to saving Social Security and Medicare and paying down the debt and 
still have nearly $800 billion for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats are saying that ``somehow them spending a trillion  
is great, (but) letting us give $800 billion back is somehow bad,'' 
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, argued on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill, expected to pass by week's end, has roughly the  
same amount in cuts as the House bill that passed last week on a 
nearly straight party-line vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures differ, with the Senate version lowering the tax  
rate on the bottom bracket from 15 percent to 14 percent and the 
House bill providing a 10 percent cut for all taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill raises the amounts that people could put into  
individual retirement accounts, while the House measure cuts 
capital gains taxes. Both reduce the so-called marriage tax 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with Senate passage, it's unlikely the House and Senate  
would settle on a common version and send a bill to the White House 
before lawmakers start their summer recess in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Waiting until they return in September would give GOP leaders  
time to assess feelings at home and decide whether to seek 
negotiations or invite a presidential veto that could become an 
issue in next year's elections.

<HEADLINE> Nets Rehire Three Assistant Coaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- A month after securing head coach  
Don Casey for the coming season, the New Jersey Nets announced 
Monday that the team has rehired the three assistants that Casey 
brought with him when he took over in midseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant coaches Eddie Jordan, Jim Lynam and Mike O'Koren  
``worked very well together last year, and I am enthused that they 
will continue their relationship with the Nets for the upcoming 
season,'' Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynam was a head coach in the NBA for 10 seasons, for the San  
Diego (now Los Angeles) Clippers, Philadelphia 76ers and Washington 
Bullets (now Wizards). He was also the Sixers' general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan played for Rutgers and then in the NBA for the Nets from  
1977-81. He started coaching as an assistant with the Sacramento 
Kings, becoming head coach for the end of the 1996-97 season and 
all of 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Koren, a three-time All-American at North Carolina, played  
seven seasons with the Nets and one with the Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey posted a 13-17 record after he was appointed interim coach  
on March 15 in the strike-shortened 1998-99 season, which began 
with a 3-17 record under head coach John Calipari.

<HEADLINE> McNown Negotiates With Bears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- It looks like it might be some time  
before Cade McNown is in a Chicago Bears uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Tom Condon responded Monday to the Bears' latest contract  
proposal by asking for the same deal he's wanted from the 
beginning, said Jim Miller, the Bears' director of business 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, the 12th pick in the draft, and Condon want a seven-year  
contract that could be voided after three years if the quarterback 
meets certain performance incentives. The Bears could buy back 
years four, five and six of the deal, but they would have to, in 
essence, negotiate a new deal and pay a second signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, who returned to Chicago to meet with Bears president Ted  
Phillips, told Condon his response was ``unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just negotiations. That's part of the business,'' said  
Mark Hatley, the Bears' vice president of player personnel. ``Tom 
knows we need Cade in here, and Cade knows he needs to be in here. 
We'll get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatley said he left a message for McNown, who is on the West  
Coast, but the quarterback hasn't called him back. Condon has not 
returned repeated phone calls from The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The voidable years have been the sticking point in the  
negotiations. The Bears have never done contracts that contained 
them, but Miller said the proposal the team made over the weekend 
contained ``an element of a voidable contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller also said the total worth of the package would have  
surpassed the five-year, $10 million deal signed by Torry Holt, the 
No. 6 pick in the draft. Holt's deal with St. Louis included a $5.4 
million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	If negotiations don't start moving quickly, the Bears'  
quarterback situation could be pretty bleak. They cut veteran Erik 
Kramer two days before training camp opened, and are left with four 
journeymen who have four NFL starts among them. 
</P>
<P>
	One option would be for the Bears to sign a veteran quarterback  
who could step in and start. Last year, when running back Curtis 
Enis missed almost all of training camp, Chicago signed Bam Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	``That really hasn't crossed our minds,'' Hatley said. ``We're  
planning on Cade being here.''

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King in Syria for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Fresh from a meeting with the leaders of  
the United States and Israel, Jordan's King Abdullah met with 
President Hafez Assad today for talks on the resumption of the 
Middle East peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	Syrian officials said Assad and Abdullah began their talks  
immediately after the king arrived in Damascus. Abdullah's visit -- 
his second to Damascus since assuming office in February -- had not 
been announced in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Syrian officials and the official media did not divulge any  
details of the talks, but Jordanian officials in Amman, the 
Jordanian capital, said Abdullah would brief Assad on his contacts 
with President Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah met Clinton and Barak on Sunday in Rabat, Morocco, at  
the funeral of King Hassan II, and discussed efforts to revive 
peace talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah's visit comes amid a diplomatic flurry aimed at  
reviving peace negotiations between Syria and Israel after a 
three-year deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
	Assad canceled a planned trip to Morocco for the funeral after  
Israel's foreign minister prematurely disclosed that there was a 
possibility of a Barak-Assad meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Syria has declared its readiness to reopen peace talks with  
Israel but insists that Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights 
be the basis for the resumption of talks. The Israelis say the two 
sides can bring their different interpretations to the negotiating 
table.

<HEADLINE>  Boxer Fernando Vargas Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- Fernando Vargas, the International  
Boxing Federation junior middleweight boxing champion, and four 
friends were arrested for investigation of assault, authorities 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas, 21, was visiting a woman at a home in Summerland about 4  
a.m. Sunday when another man arrived unannounced to visit her, said 
Santa Barbara County sheriff's Sgt. Bill Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	That man, whose name was withheld, and Vargas argued, then got  
into a fight. The brawl was broken up by Doug Rossi, 23, who was 
visiting the female roommate of Vargas' companion. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the unidentified man left the home after the  
fight ended. 
</P>
<P>
	About 5 a.m., four of Vargas' friends came to the home, forced  
their way into the room occupied by Rossi and beat him, Turner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies responding to a call for help from the house, spotted  
Vargas and his four friends heading south on U.S. 101, a few miles 
south of Summerland. 
</P>
<P>
	All five were booked for investigation of assault with a deadly  
weapon, conspiracy to commit a crime and burglary. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas' attorney released a statement late Monday denying any  
wrongdoing by the boxer. 
</P>
<P>
	``In fact, Mr. Vargas was the victim of an assault by two  
individuals and merely took action to defend himself,'' Gregory W. 
Moreno, Vargas' attorney said. ``We are convinced that this charge 
will quickly be rectified by the authorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno said Vargas would make a personal statement later.  
</P>
<P>
	Vargas and the other men, ages 20 to 28, were released after  
posting bail of $10,000 each, Turner said. Vargas was scheduled for 
arraignment Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossi suffered moderate injuries and was treated at Cottage  
Hospital, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas, of Oxnard, Calif., successfully defended his IBF junior  
middleweight title July 17 in a bout with Raul Marquez in Nevada. 
He earned $500,000 with the win, his 17th straight victory. The 
outspoken boxer has said he wants to unify the junior middleweight 
division and hopes to fight undefeated welterweight champion Oscar 
De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of the 1996 U.S. Olympic boxing team, Vargas emerged as  
a potential star in the sport in December 1998 when he stopped 
veteran Yory Boy Campas of Mexico to win the IBF junior 
middleweight championship. He won the bout only five days after his 
21st birthday and in his 15th professional fight.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars Face First Rookie Holdout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The Jacksonville Jaguars are facing a  
rookie holdout for the first time in their five-year history and 
team officials say if it begins, it could be a long one. 
</P>
<P>
	Executive vice president Michael Huyghue said Monday that the  
Jaguars and first-round draft pick Fernando Bryant, a cornerback 
from Alabama, are no closer to agreeing on a deal than they were 
when negotiations began two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is Bryant's wish for a four-year deal and the Jaguars  
insistence that the contract run for five seasons. Players report 
to training camp Thursday. Huyghue said there have been no recent 
shifts in the negotiations, but he is still hoping for a 
last-minute deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``But once you get to a holdout situation, then it gets a lot  
more difficult to capitulate,'' Huyghue said. ``You don't want to 
set a tone for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the Jaguars six first-round draft picks -- they had two in  
1995 and 1998 -- only one has missed any portion of training camp. 
That was Renaldo Wynn in 1997, and Huyghue insists he was signed 
before camp began and wouldn't have missed a minute were it not for 
a late airline flight on the first day of camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Money doesn't appear to be an issue in the Bryant negotiation.  
Because of the amount of money left in their rookie salary cap 
pool, the Jaguars seem locked in to offering the 26th overall pick 
about $840,000 for his first season and a signing bonus in the 
range of $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth year is the sticking point. The Jaguars want it as a  
hedge against free agency. Bryant doesn't want it because he can 
make bigger money more quickly if he has a successful first three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the player is a good player, he's going to be rewarded  
anyway,'' Huyghue said. ``That's always been our philosophy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant's agent, Jimmy Sexton, refused comment on the  
negotiations. He did say there was nothing new as of Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Sexton held rookie defensive back Jerome Woods out of  
the Kansas City Chiefs camp because of a similar dispute over 
length of contract. Woods ended up getting the four-year deal he 
wanted, but missed three weeks of camp and did not start his first 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant is projected as a possible starter, although he will have  
tough competition against last year's starters, Dave Thomas and 
Aaron Beasley, and last year's second-round pick, Cordell Taylor. 
The Jaguars also drafted two other cornerbacks lower in the draft, 
Jason Craft and Dee Moronkola, both of whom are signed. Deon 
Figures could also compete for playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	Each day of training camp Bryant might miss is made even more  
crucial because Jacksonville has a new defensive coordinator, Dom 
Capers, who is installing a new system. 
</P>
<P>
	``My driving force is always to get the player in camp on  
time,'' Huyghue said. ``But what this player will learn, is that 
for the sake of doing a good deal, I'm not going to be scared by a 
holdout.''

<HEADLINE>  Boxer Fernando Vargas Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- Fernando Vargas, the International  
Boxing Federation junior middleweight boxing champion, and four 
friends were arrested for investigation of assault, authorities 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas, 21, was visiting a woman at a home in Summerland about 4  
a.m. Sunday when another man arrived unannounced to visit her, said 
Santa Barbara County sheriff's Sgt. Bill Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	That man, whose name was withheld, and Vargas argued, then got  
into a fight. The brawl was broken up by Doug Rossi, 23, who was 
visiting the female roommate of Vargas' companion. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the unidentified man left the home after the  
fight ended. 
</P>
<P>
	About 5 a.m., four of Vargas' friends came to the home, forced  
their way into the room occupied by Rossi and beat him, Turner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies responding to a call for help from the house, spotted  
Vargas and his four friends heading south on U.S. 101, a few miles 
south of Summerland. 
</P>
<P>
	All five were booked for investigation of assault with a deadly  
weapon, conspiracy to commit a crime and burglary. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas' attorney released a statement late Monday denying any  
wrongdoing by the boxer. 
</P>
<P>
	``In fact, Mr. Vargas was the victim of an assault by two  
individuals and merely took action to defend himself,'' Gregory W. 
Moreno, Vargas' attorney said. ``We are convinced that this charge 
will quickly be rectified by the authorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno said Vargas would make a personal statement later.  
</P>
<P>
	Vargas and the other men, ages 20 to 28, were released after  
posting bail of $10,000 each, Turner said. Vargas was scheduled for 
arraignment Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossi suffered moderate injuries and was treated at Cottage  
Hospital, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas, of Oxnard, Calif., successfully defended his IBF junior  
middleweight title July 17 in a bout with Raul Marquez in Nevada. 
He earned $500,000 with the win, his 17th straight victory. The 
outspoken boxer has said he wants to unify the junior middleweight 
division and hopes to fight undefeated welterweight champion Oscar 
De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of the 1996 U.S. Olympic boxing team, Vargas emerged as  
a potential star in the sport in December 1998 when he stopped 
veteran Yory Boy Campas of Mexico to win the IBF junior 
middleweight championship. He won the bout only five days after his 
21st birthday and in his 15th professional fight.

<HEADLINE> State Surpluses Hit 19-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The booming economy, conservative revenue  
forecasting and prudent management have left states in their best 
financial shape in at least two decades, according to a survey 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 44 states that provided information to the National  
Conference of State Legislatures ended fiscal year 1999 a total of 
$33.4 billion in the black. 
</P>
<P>
	The number combines general fund ending balances with reserve  
funds and represents 9.4 percent of 1999 state general fund 
spending, the survey showed. That tops the previous high of 9 
percent in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCSL, a clearinghouse of information for states and their  
lobbying arm in Washington, has been conducting the survey since 
1978. The organization is holding it annual conference in 
Indianapolis this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also showed that state legislatures overall lowered  
taxes for a fifth consecutive year, approving a net cut of $5.5 
billion for fiscal year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The general fiscal conditions of our states is excellent,''  
said Dan Blue, a state representative from North Carolina and 
president of the NCSL. ``In fact, it's probably unprecedented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey indicated that of the 44 states reporting, 32 ended  
the 1999 state fiscal year with a balance exceeding 5 percent, the 
level Wall Street analysts recommend as prudent. Seventeen of those 
had balances exceeding 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen states deposited money in their rainy day funds or  
other reserve accounts, while 20 cut taxes specifically to reduce 
excess revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota cut taxes by more than 18 percent, and three other  
states -- Connecticut, Colorado and Missouri -- reduced taxes by 3 
percent or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two states of the 44 reporting -- Nebraska and South Dakota  
-- approved significant tax increases.

<HEADLINE> British Internet Firm Soars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Shares in Britain's largest Internet service  
provider soared 37 percent in value in feverish trading during the 
company's widely-anticipated stock market debut Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeserve PLC shares closed at 205.5 pence ($3.27) each on the  
London Stock Exchange, compared to their original offering price of 
150 pence ($2.37). Based on the closing price, the company had a 
market capitalization of $3.27 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, where the company made a simultaneous debut on the  
Nasdaq, American Depositary Receipts of Freeserve closed at 
$32.12 1/2, up more than 35 percent from its initial price of $23.67. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeserve is now Europe's largest publicly traded Internet firm.  
Freeserve didn't even exist a year ago, but it boomed with a 
simple, irresistible sales pitch: no connection charge, no monthly 
fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Dixons Group PLC launched Freeserve in September, it has  
signed up 1.2 million customers, rocketing ahead of America Online 
Europe to become No. 1 in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Britons have lagged behind Americans in their use of the  
Internet, but Freeserve's frenzied debut could spur other Internet 
companies to speed up their own plans to offer shares to the 
public.

<HEADLINE> Astronauts Ending Demanding Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Eager to come home, space shuttle  
Columbia's astronauts Monday began winding up a flight that proved 
to be more demanding than expected, right from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers are anxious to get their hands on Columbia, due back  
Tuesday night. They want to know whether hydrogen fuel was leaking 
from an engine during liftoff, as photographs suggest, and what 
caused a short circuit five seconds into the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Col. Eileen Collins, the first woman to command a U.S.  
space flight, had one last challenge ahead of her: a tricky 
nighttime landing. Space shuttles have landed in darkness only 11 
times out of 94 flights. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA said neither equipment problem will affect Columbia's  
return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait to get home and get back to a normal life  
again,'' Collins said in a TV interview that linked her with her 
airline-pilot husband. ``We do like to travel and I think being up 
here in the shuttle is the ultimate travel. It's a lot of work, 
though. I wouldn't exactly call it a vacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Youngs told his wife that their 3 1/2-year-old daughter,  
Bridget, missed her. ``She's had enough time with Dad,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the five-day mission ends late Tuesday as planned, it will be  
the shortest shuttle flight in nine years, excluding one cut short 
in 1997 by defective equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	That's all the time Collins and her crew needed to drop off the  
Chandra X-ray Observatory, with a few days left over in case of any 
problems with the telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra's release on Friday went smoothly, and the $1.5 billion  
telescope was in excellent condition in an orbit up to tens of 
thousands of miles high. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia's launch, by contrast, was delayed twice and then  
marred by more problems. The shuttle and five astronauts made it 
safely to orbit, though a slightly lower one, possibly because of 
leaking fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers suspect hydrogen fuel may have been seeping from one  
of Columbia's three main engines throughout Friday's 8 1/2-minute 
climb to orbit. If the leak had grown, the engine could have shut 
down, forcing an unprecedented emergency landing in Florida or West 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crew would have been ready to do whatever would have been  
needed,'' said Collins, 42, a former test pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Crew member Cady Coleman, asked Monday night about risk, said  
the telescope ``is worth every single thing it took us to get it up 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As you know in the space program, it is a risky business and  
we understand that,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Ruth Imitated at Hall of Fame Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- There was no doubt about this called  
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Doing his best Babe Ruth imitation, Gregg Zaun playfully pointed  
his bat toward right field, then cleared that wall on the next 
pitch Monday in the Hall of Fame game. 
</P>
<P>
	Zaun's home run highlighted the Texas Rangers' 11-9 win over the  
Kansas City Royals in the annual exhibition. The teams combined for 
a record-tying 10 homers in a game called after eight innings 
because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Zaun, a Rangers backup catcher who has not homered in 68 at-bats  
this season, became a fan favorite the instant he came on the 
field. When he entered to play right field in the fourth inning, he 
sprinted along the short fence and high-fived everyone he could 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
	And when Zaun came to bat in the fifth, the sellout crowd of  
9,773 started chanting, ``Call your shot! Call your shot!'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a taking a pitch, he did.  
</P>
<P>
	Zaun stepped out of the batter's box and aimed his bat. A moment  
later, he picked on a fastball from minor leaguer Jeff Austin and 
launched a line drive into the bleachers for a solo homer, causing 
the crowd to go crazy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe I did it,'' Zaun said. ``I just hope the guys  
on the other side didn't think I was trying to embarrass anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he threw it right down the middle for me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Austin, tagged for six home runs in six innings and the loss,  
didn't really say whether he grooved a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I threw a fastball and he hit it,'' said the Royals' top pick  
in the 1998 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The most famous called shot in baseball history -- so goes the  
story -- was hit by Ruth off Charlie Root in the 1932 World Series 
at Wrigley Field. Fittingly, that very bat is in the Hall, only two 
blocks from Doubleday Field, where Zaun connected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a gorgeous ballpark, a great town,'' Zaun said. ``Other  
than playing in the World Series, this was the best baseball 
experience of my life. That's what it's all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas hit a record seven homers, and the 10 combined home runs  
matched the Hall mark set by the Angels and Montreal in 1996. The 
teams took advantage of the field's compact dimensions -- 296 feet 
to left field and 312 to right. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Grabowski, promoted from the Class A Florida State League  
for the day, hit two solo home runs for Texas. He went 3-for-3. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great to come here and see the Hall of Fame and  
experience big league ball,'' Grabowski said. ``I had my parents, 
my brother and an aunt and uncle in attendance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael Palmeiro, who took a late-night tour of the Hall on  
Sunday night, also homered for Texas, as did Lee Stevens, Royce 
Clayton and Jason Romano. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Sutton homered, doubled and drove in four runs for Kansas  
City. Tim Spehr and Chad Kreuter also connected for the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers and Royals were picked to play in Cooperstown  
because of two of Sunday's inductees into the Hall -- Nolan Ryan and 
George Brett. They were both part of the pregame ceremonies, along 
with fellow Hall newcomers Robin Yount and Orlando Cepeda. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City and Texas last played in the Hall game in 1986, when  
the Royals lost 11-4 despite a home run by Brett. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Juan Moreno, a reliever at Double-A Tulsa, was the winner.  
... Mike Sweeney won the pregame home run derby. ... Juan Gonzalez 
did not play for Texas. He has a jammed right wrist. ... Rangers 
bullpen catcher Ken Guthrie replaced Ivan Rodriguez in the third 
inning and stayed in to catch. He went 1-for-4. ... The Famous San 
Diego Chicken took a stint in the first-base coach's box. He will 
soon donate his feathers to the Hall. ... The AL West-leading 
Rangers, who have won eight in a row, play Tuesday night at 
Baltimore. The Royals return to Kansas City to play Seattle.

<HEADLINE> New Study on Defibrillator Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- People with implanted defibrillators can walk  
through antitheft systems like those at stores and libraries 
without fear of getting an extra shock to the heart, researchers 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is absolutely no danger from a slow stroll through the  
gates, even if it takes 10 or 15 seconds,'' said Dr. Douglas Zipes, 
a professor of medicine at the Indiana University School of 
Medicine in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	However, if a person with a defibrillator takes longer, he or  
she could experience an unnecessary electric shock to the heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our advice: Don't lean, don't linger, don't worry,'' Zipes  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The research follows last year's warning by the Food and Drug  
Administration that electromagnetic fields emitted by metal 
detectors and antitheft systems can in rare instances interfere 
with implanted devices such as defibrillators and pacemakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study looked only at defibrillators and antitheft  
systems, not metal detectors. The findings were published in 
today's issue of Circulation, a journal of the American Heart 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The research was funded in part by a grant from an electronics  
company that makes antitheft systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Implanted defibrillators, which cost about $25,000 each, send  
electrical impulses to slow down or speed up a patient's heart, 
depending on what's needed. Pacemakers, at about $5,000 each, 
strictly speed up slow-beating hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers looked at 169 patients with implanted defibrillators  
and found no problems with a normal walk through the security 
gates. 
</P>
<P>
	But when patients stood within 6 inches of the antitheft systems  
for two minutes, seven of the 169 experienced problems with their 
implants that indicated they had or might have gotten an 
unnecessary shock. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 400,000 people have implanted defibrillators.  
</P>
<P>
	An expert not involved in the study, Dr. Lewis Lipsitz of Hebrew  
Rehabilitation Center for the Aged at Harvard Medical School, said: 
``It's reassuring and comforting that (defibrillators) will not be 
falsely triggered by common security devices that people walk 
through every day.''

<HEADLINE> NTL To Acquire Cable &AMP; Wireless Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Fresh from clinching a nearly $10 billion deal  
with Cable &AMP; Wireless Communications PLC, NTL Inc. suggested Monday 
it might seek a second acquisition that would secure its position 
as the dominant player in Britain's consolidating cable industry. 
</P>
<P>
	NTL has agreed to buy the residential operations of Cable &AMP;  
Wireless Communications in a step that would make it the country's 
biggest cable operator. CWC shareholders still must approve the 
acquisition, which the two companies announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The action appeared to thwart efforts by rival Telewest  
Communications PLC to strike a deal of its own with CWC. Telewest 
is currently Britain's largest cable company, followed closely by 
CWC and then NTL. 
</P>
<P>
	However, analysts said that further consolidation in the  
fragmented industry is likely, and NTL chief executive Barclay 
Knapp implied that talks about a potential combination between his 
company and Telewest were already under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an exclusivity agreement between NTL and CWC, NTL is  
barred from merging with or acquiring Telewest during the six to 
nine months it has to complete its purchase of CWC's operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once this deal is out of the way, I personally think it would  
be in the interest of NTL and NTL shareholders to look at a 
strategic dialogue -- indeed takeover -- of Telewest,'' said Ian 
Johnston, head of telecommunications research at U.S. investment 
bank J.P. Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston said Knapp ``intimated'' strongly at a meeting with  
analysts that a strategic deal is in the works that would somehow 
combine a newly enlarged NTL with Telewest. 
</P>
<P>
	An official close to NTL confirmed that Knapp made such remarks.  
The official spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``They now are in a good position to go to Telewest and dictate  
terms because Telewest has nowhere else to turn,'' added Steve 
Scruton, a senior analyst in London at HSBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Telewest said it had no comment to make on the day's  
developments. 
</P>
<P>
	Both NTL and Telewest have long expressed the view that Britain  
would best be served by a single cable operator, which would be 
better suited to compete effectively with British Telecom, the 
country's No. 1 telecommunications firm. 
</P>
<P>
	NTL's acquisition of CWC's cable systems was a big move in that  
direction. The deal would give NTL a total of 2.8 million telephone 
and television cable customers, more than any of its competitors in 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	NTL's offer consists of $4.5 billion in cash and 54.4 million  
new NTL shares, which were worth about $5.4 billion based on NTL's 
share price of $99.93 3/4 per share in afternoon trading Monday on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	NTL also said it will assume $3.0 billion in CWC debt.  
</P>
<P>
	Cable-and-Wireless Communications finished trading Monday at  
690.50 pence ($10.91) per share, down 1.2 percent from Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sure that our increased national coverage will make NTL  
more effective in competing against BSkyB and British 
Telecommunications and in developing new interactive TV and high 
speed Internet services,'' Knapp said. 
</P>
<P>
	BSkyB -- British Sky Broadcasting PLC -- is controlled by Rupert  
Murdoch's News Corp. media empire. 
</P>
<P>
	NTL will pay for the acquisition in part with funds from France  
Telecom, which announced Monday that it is investing $5.5 billion 
in NTL in an effort to expand its foothold in Britain. France 
Telecom's investment will make it NTL's biggest shareholder, with a 
stake of about 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	France Telecom chief executive Michel Bon said his company's  
investment in NTL is ``a unique opportunity'' for pressing ahead 
with its international strategy, which makes a top priority of 
expanding within Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	NTL expects the CWC acquisition to yield cost savings in  
equipment purchases and telephone charges and make it easier 
together with a greater ability to borrow funds.

<HEADLINE> Dow Loses 37; Nasdaq Drops 58 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were lower today as continued worries  
about higher interest rates pushed up bond yields and hurt 
technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 37.04 at 10,873.92, having surrendered a modest gain at 
midday. Last week, the blue-chip index fell 298.88 points, or 2.7 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower as well. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 6.84 at 1,350.10, and the 
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index was down 58.51 at 
2,633.89. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are clinging to fears that the Federal Reserve will  
raise interest rates as early as next month in an effort to hold 
off inflation. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who raised that 
possibility in Congressional testimony last Thursday, will address 
a Senate panel on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc.,  
said Greenspan appears to be laying ground for another modest rate 
increase, following the quarter-point increase imposed last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given his remarks, financial markets should tend not to be  
very surprised when the Fed moves to raise short-term rates in 
reaction to very robust economic or employment data.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later this week, the government will release the latest  
statistics on employment costs and on the gross domestic product, 
which could provide a clearer indication of whether inflation has 
encroached on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of higher interest rates has pushed bond prices  
lower, driving yields higher. The 30-year Treasury bond yielded 
6.04 percent by early afternoon after returning above 6 percent on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology shares were also mostly lower. Analysts say those  
stocks, which drove the Nasdaq to a string of records earlier this 
months, are now falling prey to profit-taking as investors try to 
lock in their gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, as higher interest rates begin cutting into corporate  
profits, technology companies are often the first to suffer. 
Investors often determine that their high valuations are a riskier 
bet, especially if they can secure solid, stable returns from 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft was off 2 1/8 at 88 1/8. America Online, which is battling  
several rivals over instant-messaging technology, fell 7 7/8 to 100 
1/16. AOL also lost ground as several top executives, including 
Chairman and Chief Executive Stephen Case, sold 4 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	On a summertime Monday, merger activity was relatively quiet,  
but new deals provided the market with scattered gains. Host 
Marriott Services Corp. rose 5 3/4 to 15 1/2 after Italy's Autogrill SpA 
said it will offer $529 million, or $15.75 per share, to acquire 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of nearly  
2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 485.07 
million shares at late afternoon, slightly behind Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 2.30 to 636.57, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 3.99 to 792.30. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 6.12 at  
442.26.

<HEADLINE> Bankers Trust Settles for $60M Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bankers Trust Corp. was sentenced Monday to pay  
$60 million in fines in a plea deal that settled criminal charges 
alleging the company boosted profits by pocketing unclaimed 
customer accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentencing by U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl came less  
than two weeks after three former bank executives were indicted on 
charges they converted $15.5 million in unclaimed customer funds 
and credits into bank profits. The scheme allegedly took place 
between 1989 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Bankers Trust had entered a guilty plea on behalf of  
the company to charges that it made false entries in bank books and 
records to create the profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The money from unclaimed customer accounts should have continued  
to have been held for the customers or been returned to states as 
abandoned property, according to a release from U.S. Attorney Mary 
Jo White. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Bankers Trust and Germany's Deutsche Bank merged,  
creating the world's largest commercial financial institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank said in a release Monday that it had already paid  
the $60 million fine. 
</P>
<P>
	It also said it was ``pleased to have these proceedings behind  
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the remedial measures taken by Bankers Trust  
prior to the acquisition, combined with Deutsche Bank's culture and 
controls, assure that the conduct which was the subject of the 
proceeding will not occur again,'' the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the fine, Bankers Trust has reversed and returned nearly  
all of the $19.1 million unlawfully recorded as the bank's income, 
prosecutors said.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Moves Into New Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The relocated NCAA opened for business  
Monday in a 140,000-square-foot headquarters so new that not even 
the boss has an office of his own yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Cedric Dempsey, the NCAA president, and about half of the  
association's 300-some employees were among the first wave to 
occupy the new building in White River State Park in downtown 
Indianapolis. The rest will report on Aug. 2 in the final stage of 
the move from Overland Park, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	The construction, which will include a new Hall of Champions,  
will continue through next spring. It is expected to be finished in 
time for the Division I men's basketball Final Four at the nearby 
RCA Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just was walking around the building, and I got a little  
frightened,'' Dempsey said. ``I walked up the stairs to see where 
my office was, and there's no office there. I was thinking, `I'm 
supposed to go to work. Where do I plug my computer in?' There's no 
place to even move to. Our walls aren't even up. But I know that's 
going to come in the next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey, Indiana Lt. Gov. Joe Kernan and Kim Derchak, the city's  
director of enterprise development, welcomed the staff at an 
orientation meeting and tour of the building Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of you are going to be working in an environment that is  
changing almost daily. We hope you will accept that environment and 
enjoy it,'' Dempsey told the staff. ``So bear with all the little 
things that may go wrong at your desk, in terms of all the 
inconveniences. For about the next six months, we're going to live 
in a construction zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than 100 of the NCAA employees were with the association  
two years ago, when a relocation committee voted 7-1 to move away 
from suburban Kansas City, the NCAA home since 1952. The National 
Federation of High School Athletic Associations, also based in the 
Kansas City area, later decided to move to Indianapolis and will 
occupy a section of the new NCAA headquarters until its own 
building is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real challenge to try to keep the service going, with  
the number of people we've lost,'' Dempsey said. ``We have a huge 
training effort to go through right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've moved a lot, so the move itself has not been as traumatic  
as it has been for a lot of people. But we have a number of staff 
people who have never lived anywhere except Kansas City, so there's 
always a lot of fear when you do that,'' said Dempsey, who already 
has bought a house on the northeast side of Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	He's not worried about the lack of a usable office yet.  
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, I'm going out of town all week anyway, going to  
different meetings. I'm on the road about 200 days out of the 
year,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> DC To Get Musuem Dedicated To Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- This capital, a city of museums, is going to  
get a new one all to itself. 
</P>
<P>
	With its rounded arches and classical columns, approached by a  
monumental stairway, the small building fits in with many 
Washington structures. Critics call it one of the handsomest. 
</P>
<P>
	A former library dedicated by President Theodore Roosevelt  
dedicated in 1903, it will reopen just a century later as the City 
Museum with a $15 million refurbishing of its 50,000 square feet, 
done by the Historical Society of Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The society now has a small collection in a Victorian mansion  
that once housed the family of brewer Christian Heurich. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally a city library, more recently the site at 8th Street  
and Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., has served as a library and 
architectural center for the University of the District of Columbia 
and as offices for the convention center that faces it. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Anthony Williams gave the society the key to the building  
and a 99-year lease this month. A new and larger convention center 
is already going up behind it and will open at about the came time. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all its statues and historic sites, this whole city is a  
museum,'' said Barbara Franco, the historical society's executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	She counts 71 museums -- 16 of them run by the Smithsonian  
Institution alone, counting the National Zoo. So she is planning it 
as an orientation center for visitors as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Civil war buffs know about Manassas and Gettysburg and  
Antietam, but they may not know that Washington was the scene of a 
battle itself, out Georgia Avenue at Fort Stevens -- that's where 
Lincoln came under fire,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The story goes that Oliver Wendell Holmes, then a young officer  
and later a famous Supreme Court judge, shouted ``Get down, you 
fool!'' as bullets began to fly past the tall figure in the 
stovepipe hat.

<HEADLINE> Rafter Replaces Agassi at No. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Patrick Rafter is the first Australian to be  
ranked No. 1 since John Newcombe did it 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter supplanted Andre Agassi at the top of men's tennis  
Monday, becoming the fifth player to hold the No. 1 ranking this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always thought that the years 2000 and 2001 will be his  
major two years,'' said Newcombe, Australia's Davis Cup captain and 
the winner of five grand slam events. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'll be the best player in the world. He mightn't be  
No. 1 the whole time, but he'll be the dominant player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Sampras, Carlos Moya, Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Tim Henman  
have also been No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter, the two-time defending U.S. Open champion is followed in  
this week's rankings by Sampras, Agassi, Kafelnikov and Tim Henman. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rafter may not hold the top ranking for long. Sampras can  
regain the No. 1 spot if he makes the final of this week's Los 
Angeles Open. Rafter is not playing that tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Once called a ``one-slam wonder'' by John McEnroe, Rafter has  
been consistent this year on various surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
	On clay, he reached the finals of the Italian Open and the third  
round of the French Open. On Wimbledon's grass he lost in the 
semifinals to Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
	This month he helped Australia beat the United States in the  
Davis Cup quarterfinals in Brookline, Mass., winning the deciding 
singles match against Todd Martin.

<HEADLINE> Late Payments-Mortage Link Ignored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Only two in five Americans understand that if  
they chronically fail to pay bills on time they will have a major 
problem getting a home mortgage, according to a survey released 
Monday by mortgage giant Fannie Mae. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials called the lack of awareness a new barrier to  
homeownership at a time when other obstacles, such as inability to 
save money for a down payment and racial discrimination, are 
diminishing and Americans are buying homes in record numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's home ownership rate rose to a near-record 66.7  
percent during the first three months of this year and did set 
records for blacks and Hispanics, reflecting low interest rates and 
low unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin Raines, Fannie Mae's chairman and chief executive  
officer, said the company's latest annual housing survey shows ``a 
vibrant mortgage marketplace'' marked by high levels of consumer 
confidence and satisfaction with the home mortgage process. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added, ``A shadow falling across the otherwise positive  
news is how many Americans don't fully comprehend the relationship 
between paying bills late, having bad credit, and experiencing 
difficulties in qualifying for a mortgage. This is a problem the 
mortgage industry needs to address.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alfred King, a Fannie Mae spokesman, said the company was  
preparing a consumer education initiative in that regard in 
cooperation with other mortgage industry participants. He declined 
to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey disclosure comes at a time when more people have been  
getting so deep in debt they have filed for bankruptcy. Despite the 
strong economy, the number of Americans filing personal 
bankruptcies last year reached a record 1.4 million, up more than 
300 percent since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts blame soliciting by the credit card industry and  
the easy availability of credit in general for the apparent lack of 
understanding of the consequences of a bad credit record. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to educate consumers ``must compete with the most  
aggressive marketing campaign in the world'' by credit card 
companies that send out billions of solicitations a year, said 
Stephen Brobeck, executive director of Consumer Federation of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob O'Toole, senior staff vice president at the Mortgage Bankers  
Association, said consumers' lack of awareness ``is obviously a 
growing problem.'' He said the group has developed brochures and 
high school courses to stress the importance of paying bills on 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	In Fannie Mae's nationwide survey of 1,812 adults, including 878  
who recently had gone through the mortgage process, 41 percent of 
respondents said being more than 90 days late paying utility bills 
three times or more in recent years would be a major problem in 
getting a mortgage. Thirty-two percent said it would be a minor 
problem while 18 percent said it wouldn't be a problem at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey showed that blacks and Hispanics are more likely than  
whites to understand the impact of paying bills late on one's 
credit record and ability to qualify for a mortgage. While 62 
percent of black respondents and 46 percent of Hispanics said late 
bill paying would be a major problem, while 38 percent of white 
respondents said so. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time the questions on bad credit were included  
in the annual survey, which also showed: 
</P>
<P>
	--Only one in four respondents said that having enough money for  
a down payment and closing costs was a major obstacle for them, 
compared with an average 47 percent in surveys between 1992 and 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	--Use of the Internet to finance or refinance homes has stayed  
about the same since 1996, with 21 percent of respondents saying 
they definitely or probably would try it, compared with 20 percent 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey's margin of error is plus or minus 2.9 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	Fannie Mae, which describes itself as the world's biggest  
financial services company that is not a bank, is a 
government-chartered corporation whose stock is publicly traded. It 
keeps some of the mortgages in its portfolio and packages others 
into securities for resale to investors.

<HEADLINE> `We Can Return and Be even Better' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The tiny American flag went up in the air each time  
he raced past in a technicolor blur. 
</P>
<P>
	But Linda Armstrong had no trouble picking her only child out as  
the parade of bicycle racers zoomed past. He was the one wearing 
the leader's distinctive yellow jersey -- le maillot jaune. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did everything so fast,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	That changed, if only for a few hours, after Lance Armstrong won  
the Tour de France. Just moments after being handed the trophy, he 
stepped off the podium, wrapped both arms around his wife and in 
the safety of her embrace, he sighed. 
</P>
<P>
	After three grueling weeks racing over mountains, across  
flatlands and away from doubt, Armstrong was less concerned with 
where he was going than where he had been. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this sends out a fantastic message to all the cancer  
patients and survivors around the world,'' Armstrong said. ``We can 
return to what we were before -- and be even better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last chapter of the best comeback in sports was written  
along the Champs-Elysees, the boulevard that cuts a swath through 
the heart of Paris and where, a half-century earlier, another 
contingent of Americans arrived with the cheers of the French 
ringing in their ears. 
</P>
<P>
	This time it was Armstrong, riding in the protective slipstream  
of his U.S. Postal Service teammates, coming to claim the 
championship of the 2,306-mile, 23-day-long Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	But the story of how he won the world's greatest bicycle race  
was about liberation, too. And about how a strong-willed Texan rode 
his way into the affections of a land that doesn't warm easily to 
outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, 1996, Armstrong was a very good but not great racer  
with a deadly case of testicular cancer that spread to his lungs 
and brain with alarming speed. Doctors gave him less than a 50 
percent chance of survival. Everybody close to Armstrong worried 
about how long he would live. He only worried how long before he 
could climb back on his bike. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I saw him,'' said Dr. Steven Wolff, one of  
Armstrong's oncologists, ``my concern wasn't racing, just keeping 
him alive. But he's such a fierce human being. The extraordinary 
thing, even back then, was how certain Lance was about one day 
coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That day arrived with Wolff sitting in the grandstand behind the  
winner's podium, alongside other board members of a foundation 
Armstrong created to benefit cancer patients. A row ahead of Wolff 
sat Armstrong's wife, Kristin. Next to her was Linda Armstrong, 
occasionally waving the flag to ward off the shakes. 
</P>
<P>
	A question about her son's start in athletics broke the tension  
of the moment. Soon, his accomplishments were spilling out. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance was winning 10-kilometer runs against grownups before he  
finished sixth grade. Soon after, he represented his hometown, 
Austin, Texas, in statewide swim meets. By age 15, he added bike 
racing to his repertoire and became a top-flight triathlete. Two 
years later, he watched fellow American Greg LeMond win the Tour de 
France a second time and decided it was something he, too, could 
achieve. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, as a 21-year-old, Armstrong made the U.S. Olympic team.  
The next year, edging closer to his goal, he won a road-racing 
world championship. When he made the Olympic squad again in 1996, 
everything seemed in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``And then,'' Linda Armstrong remembered ruefully, ``along came  
that minor setback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's almost possible to think of his bout with cancer that way  
now. Especially hearing Armstrong's doctors marvel over how he 
resumed training between doses of chemotherapy. They counseled 
patience, but Armstrong had a schedule in his head. Gradually, 
almost grudgingly, everyone else began working off that calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	By last year, thanks to an almost-insatiable appetite for hard  
work, Armstrong was back at his old discipline -- road-racing -- and 
competitive again. But the Tour de France is about much more than a 
single skill. 
</P>
<P>
	First run in 1903, the race now features 20 stages that take  
some 200 riders around France. A stage can be as short as 4 miles, 
such as the opening prologue race that gave Armstrong his first 
win, or as long as 148 miles. They can be over flat roads, or up 
and down mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Never known as a strong climber before, Armstrong took control  
of the race for good with back-to-back wins in Stages 9 and 10. It 
was the second of those wins, on a difficult climb up the Alps, 
that brought the scrutiny of French newspapers down on him -- and 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Tour struggling to recover from a doping scandal last  
year, and the French shut out of even a single stage win for the 
first time since 1926, the potshots began. In headlines loaded with 
double-entendres, they implied Armstrong was using 
performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue came to a head Wednesday, during the second of two  
days of racing through the Pyrenees. That's when Armstrong angrily 
appeared at a news conference to explain that trace amounts of 
cortisone found in his system were from a prescription skin cream 
he used to treat saddle sores. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the low point,'' Armstrong recalled now. ``A lot of  
things were happening. The going was tough, we were all fatigued 
and everybody was saying things. 
</P>
<P>
	``And if you crack in the mountains,'' he said, ``you lose the  
race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong didn't crack, instead roaring back three days later to  
win his fourth stage overall and lock up the race. It set the stage 
for his triumphant procession into Paris, where, like his 
countryman LeMond a few years earlier, he was welcomed almost as a 
native son. 
</P>
<P>
	French flags fluttered in a gentle breeze and sunlight washed  
over the wide boulevard as Armstrong soaked in the cheers of a 
crowd that called his name over and over. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more than I ever thought it would be,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Senators Poised To Clash Over Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators will weigh in on a battle critics say  
pits Big Oil against taxpayers' interests when they take up 
consideration of the Interior appropriations bill as early as 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most controversial provisions in the $13.9 billion  
spending bill is a measure that would bar the federal government, 
through June 2001, from changing the way it assesses royalties for 
oil and natural gas drilled on public lands. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed freeze, championed by Republican Sens. Pete  
Domenici of New Mexico and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, as well 
as a bipartisan roster of other Oil Patch lawmakers, would extend a 
moratorium that has been in place since mid-1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates argue the ban is necessary to rein in Interior  
Department bureaucrats from implementing a new royalty collection 
system that Hutchison has termed a ``back-door tax increase on an 
industry that already is on its knees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But critics contend the freeze amounts to little more than a  
windfall for major oil companies, some of which already stand 
accused of underpaying royalties to the federal government by 
hundreds of millions of dollars over the last two decades. For 
every year Interior is blocked from implementing its new royalty 
system, taxpayers are losing millions more, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have lost $200 million if I cannot derail this  
rider,'' said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who is leading efforts 
to strip the moratorium out of the bill after being stymied in 
earlier efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Boxer suggested momentum is on her side. Oil  
companies have entered into, or are contemplating, settlements with 
federal or state governments worth hundreds of millions of dollars, 
she pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog group that is  
tracking the issue, estimates some $5 billion in royalty 
underpayment settlements have been entered into to date. 
</P>
<P>
	And a retired Atlantic Richfield Co. executive, testifying in a  
California lawsuit, said his company and others paid royalties on 
the basis of a posted price that was as much as 20 percent below 
the oil's fair market value. 
</P>
<P>
	``If these big companies were right, then I ask, why are they  
settling all over the place for billions of dollars in back 
payments and why is this retired employee risking imprisonment by 
saying he swears to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but 
the truth in the court of law?'' Boxer asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantic Richfield acknowledged the executive had worked for the  
company, but offered no comment beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
	Boxer accused Congress of being captive to oil interests, saying  
the Senate is ``owned and operated by the oil companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchison chief of staff Larry Di Rita said any interest his  
boss is pushing is for the people of Texas, not the oil industry. 
``There are a couple hundred thousand Texans who rely on a strong 
energy sector in our economy, and Senator Hutchison represents 
those Texans up here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchison, who contends any underpayment questions are for the  
courts to resolve, maintains Congress must have a voice in the 
writing of new royalty collection regulations. The Interior 
Department's Minerals Management Service is in the midst of a new 
rule-making process after finding itself blocked on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil executives complained about Interior's earlier proposal,  
which would calculate royalties on the basis of the market price. 
They lobbied Congress to block that new collection system, saying 
it overstates the value of oil and is too complicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, oil companies pay cash royalties after estimating the  
value of the oil they've pumped from federal lands. But the 
industry is pushing a new collection system: paying royalties to 
the government in product rather than cash. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agree with MMS that the current rule needs to be revised,  
it needs to be made much more simple, it needs to be much more 
fair,'' said Ken Leonard of the American Petroleum Institute. 
``Right now, it's administratively burdensome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Leonard said the industry would prefer to live with the  
flawed status quo rather than come under a collection system based 
on market prices as outlined by the minerals service.

<HEADLINE> JAL Under Attack From Shareholder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- As if slumping profits and a $12 billion debt  
weren't bad enough, Japan's premier airline is now under attack 
from its largest individual shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
	Eitaro Itoyama -- one of Japan's richest men, who openly admits  
to having friends in Japan's organized crime syndicates -- says he 
intends to launch a hostile takeover bid to oust the old management 
and save the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Itoyama, 56, told The Associated Press he is assembling a group  
of investors to buy a controlling 30 percent stake as soon as the 
end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to say who would join him, but said the group holds  
about an 8 percent share. Itoyama, JAL's largest individual 
shareholder, now holds 70 million shares, or 4 percent, of the 
airline's stock. 
</P>
<P>
	``If JAL tries to engage me in a bidding war, I have the  
strength, the cash, to win,'' warned Itoyama, who has a net worth 
of $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan Airlines, whose glittering jets were once a symbol of the  
nation's rise from the ashes of defeat in World War II, has turned 
a profit in just three of the last six years because of rising 
competition and money-losing investments made during the heady 
1980s. And its image took a drubbing last year after it admitted 
paying racketeers. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of a hostile takeover is raising eyebrows in  
Japan, where such takeovers are almost unheard of. Most companies 
rely on friendly corporate partners to bail them out in hard times. 
</P>
<P>
	Itoyama, however, is hardly the average Japanese businessman.  
</P>
<P>
	He is related by marriage to the late Ryoichi Sasakawa, a former  
war criminal who grew fabulously wealthy by operating public 
betting on speedboat races. And Itoyama was elected four times to 
Parliament as a member of Japan's ruling conservative Liberal 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	When a gangster was arrested two years ago for taking payoffs  
from Nomura Securities and other top financial firms, Itoyama went 
on record as saying the man was his golf buddy. 
</P>
<P>
	The specter of the underworld has followed Itoyama to JAL. Last  
February, news reports revealed the head of the Goto gang -- an 
affiliate of Japan's largest underworld syndicate -- had become 
JAL's second-largest individual shareholder, after Itoyama. 
</P>
<P>
	Itoyama says the Goto gangsters aren't his friends, and rolls up  
his sleeve to bare a scar he said was the work of a Goto gang 
hitman in 1986. He said the gang may be trying to block his bid -- 
or extort from him. 
</P>
<P>
	But many wonder if Itoyama has a hidden agenda in buying into  
JAL. 
</P>
<P>
	While a lawmaker, he spent his free time on such undertakings as  
accumulating shares of Yomiuri Land, a real estate company 
affiliated with Japan's largest newspaper. After five years of 
threats and negotiations, Itoyama sold the stake to the Yomiuri 
group in 1983 -- at what news accounts say was a hefty profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the skeptics is the airline itself, though officials are  
careful not to antagonize their largest shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's made that claim several times in the past,'' company  
spokesman Geoffrey Tudor said of Itoyama's threat of a hostile 
takeover. ``And at other times he's said something completely 
different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Itoyama insists he means business, and said JAL's losses,  
massive debt and scandals have made shareholders restless with the 
current management. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not doing this for me, I'm doing this to save JAL,'' the  
short, swarthy man said in a recent interview at his spacious 
office in a 17-story office tower that bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
	In a scandal that broke last August, JAL said it had links with  
racketeers, two of whom were arrested for taking payoffs disguised 
as rent for potted plants. Earlier this month, bullet holes were 
found in the home of a former president in what news reports said 
was a racketeer-linked shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, JAL has run up $12 billion in debt, a heavy burden  
for a company with total group revenues last year of $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of that was due to weak earnings in core airlines business,  
excessive orders for new aircraft and money-losing hotels acquired 
during the boom of the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline says its prospects are looking up and it is not as  
vulnerable as it once was. Drastic cost cutting helped JAL realize 
a strong rebound in earnings last year, and the company expects a 
smaller but still healthy profit this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the position now where, once Japan's economy  
recovers, I think our business results will also recover,'' said 
Vice President Hideyuki Kanenari. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our shareholders are happy.''

<HEADLINE> Indians' Ramirez Leaves Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland Indians slugger Manny Ramirez was  
struck on the left knee by a pitch from Justin Thompson of the 
Detroit Tigers in the third inning and had to leave Monday night's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	With the score tied at 2 and runners at second and third,  
Ramirez was hit on the outside of his knee by a full-count fastball 
from Thompson. Ramirez took a few steps toward first base before 
doubling over in pain. 
</P>
<P>
	He was examined by Indians assistant trainer Jim Warfield and  
walked to the Cleveland dugout moments later with manager Mike 
Hargrove. An Indians spokesman said Ramirez has a bruised left knee 
and there was no immediate plans for X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez was replaced in right field by Jacob Cruz.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Ramirez, who leads the majors with 102 RBIs,  
was hit on the batting helmet by Tigers' rookie pitcher Jeff 
Weaver, touching off a bench-clearing brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland, which has lost five straight and is just 2-9 since  
the All-Star break, has been injury-plagued all season, It has 
fielded its Opening Day lineup just four times this year.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Sues eMachines Over Patents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. sued eMachines, a rival  
maker of inexpensive personal computers, and its parent companies 
on Monday for allegedly infringing on 13 patents protecting 
Compaq's PC technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The disputed Compaq patents cover computer screen displays to  
keyboards to the PC's internal circuitry. The lawsuit tries to get 
eMachines to stop selling PCs that allegedly infringe on Compaq's 
patents as well as seeks unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq filed suit against eMachines and its Korean parent  
companies, Trigem Computer and Korea Data Systems, in federal court 
in Houston, where Compaq is based. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for eMachines, based in Irvine, Calif., had no  
immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit escalated the intense rivalry between Compaq, the  
No. 1 maker of PCs, and eMachines, a startup seller of $400 PCs 
that has vaulted to No. 5 among PCs sold at retail in May, 
according to the research firm PC Data. Compaq's least expensive PC 
costs $600, without rebates. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq insisted through a spokesman that its lawsuit was not  
just a strategic tactic in the computer wars. ``We think 
competition's a good thing,'' Compaq spokesman Alan Hodel said, 
``but not when a competitor improperly uses another companies' 
technology.''

<HEADLINE> Indians Activate Reliever Karsay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Indians, locked in their worst losing  
streak of the season, activated reliever Steve Karsay from the 
15-day disabled list on Monday and designated knuckleballer Tom 
Candiotti for assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Karsay, Cleveland's most effective pitcher the first three  
months, had been on the disabled list since July 2 with a strained 
left oblique muscle. He is 7-1 with a 2.63 ERA in 37 relief 
appearances this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Candiotti, acquired on June 29, went 1-1 with an 11.05 ERA in  
seven appearances -- two starts -- with the Indians. The right-hander 
was back for his second stint with Cleveland after pitching here 
from 1986-1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians entered Monday night's game against the Detroit  
Tigers having lost five straight and nine of 10.

<HEADLINE> Corn, Soybeans Fall Sharply / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Corn and soybean futures fell sharply Monday  
on the Chicago Board of Trade as the Midwest's weather outlook improved. 
Wheat futures also retreated. 
</P>
<P>
        Corn and soybeans posted steep declines as a line of thundershowers  
moved through key Midwest growing states, providing much-needed soil 
moisture to crops that baked last week under temperatures in the mid- 
to upper-90s. 
</P>
<P>
        Forecasters now are calling for cooler temperatures later this  
week and say additional rainfall should help relieve crops from recent 
heat stress. 
</P>
<P>
        While crop conditions have deteriorated, farmers still are  
on track to harvest bumper crops. That production will add to large 
inventories left over from last year's harvest as export demand only 
now begins to recover from Asian economic turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for December delivery fell 3 3/4 cents to $2.75 a bushel;  
December corn fell 8 cents to $2.16 1/2 a bushel; December oats fell 
4 1/4 cents to $1.16 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 19 1/2 cents 
to $4.62 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while  
pork futures finished mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
        August live cattle fell .20 cent to 65.45 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .77 cent to 77.52 cents a pound; August lean hogs 
rose .20 cent to 49.07 cents a pound, while other contract months declined; 
August pork bellies rose 1.10 cents to 44.47 cents a pound, while other 
contract months declined.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wrestlers Vie for Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Freestyle wrestling at the Pan  
American Games could very well preview the U.S. team that will 
compete in the Olympics next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, it might not.  
</P>
<P>
	The United States will send its A team, minus two-time world  
champion Terry Brands, to the mat for the competition that starts 
Tuesday. But the same team might not go to Sydney in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter how well a wrestler does here, there's no guarantee  
he'll be on the Olympic team, which will be chosen in trials in 
Dallas next June. Regardless of how successful a wrestler has been 
in the past, if he doesn't win his weight class at the trials, he 
doesn't go to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	And there will be a lot of experienced, outstanding wrestlers  
competing for those berths. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are really excited about what lies ahead of them --  
the Pan Ams, the world championships and then ... the Olympics,'' 
U.S. coach John Smith said. ``The only disappointing thing is that 
you may not be working with the same guys next year. It's that 
strong right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to last year's world championships, there are five  
new faces out of eight wrestlers. That just tells you the quality 
of U.S. wrestling right now and the depth we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the eight U.S. wrestlers in Winnipeg will compete in  
this year's world championships Oct. 8-11 in Ankara, Turkey. The 
exception here is Eric Guerrero, who will replace two-time world 
champion Bands at 58 kilograms. Guerrero, the No. 2-ranked wrestler 
at that weight and a three-time NCAA champion at Oklahoma State, 
flew into Winnipeg on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brands, who had to pull out at the last minute because of an  
illness and was returning home to Iowa City, Iowa, will go to 
worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	With Brands gone, Les Gutches is the only former world champion  
on the U.S. team. Also on the team is Lincoln McIlravy, who won a 
bronze medal at the 1998 world meet and has lost just once in the 
last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the thing about this team is there are quite a few  
young, hungry athletes that want a piece of the pie right now,'' 
said Smith, who was a gold medalist in the 1987 and 1991 Pan Ams. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nice thing about working with this particular team, it  
doesn't take a lot of external push individually. These guys push 
themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few push themselves harder than McIlravy, who still hasn't  
gotten over his 3-2 loss to three-time world champion Arayik 
Gevorgian of Armenia in the first round of last year's worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a burr under my saddle for almost 12 months  
now,'' said McIlravy, a three-time NCAA champion at Iowa and a 
five-time South Dakota state champion in high school. ``I want to 
make a serious run at the world championships this year and this is 
a great competition to see where we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McIlravy, who wrestles at 69 kilograms, bounced back from his  
loss to Gevorgian to win seven straight matches and claim the 
bronze medal. He finished the year 27-1 and is 18-0 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	New faces on the team include super heavyweight Stephen Neal,  
who has made a quick transition from college to freestyle 
wrestling. Neal, 22, won his second straight NCAA championship in 
March, then won the U.S. nationals six weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	His weight class includes world champion Alexis Rodriguez of  
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel pressure,'' Neal said. ``I've got the Cuban who  
is the world champ, so I guess I'm an underdog. I just want to show 
the world who I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others who made the team by earning a No. 1 ranking for the  
first time are Eric Akin (54 kilograms), Joe Williams (76 
kilograms) and Dominic Black (97 kilograms). Black, 29, who's in 
the Army, is the oldest of the newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had an exciting year so far and I'm excited to be part of  
the Pan Ams competition,'' said Black, who's approaching the 
competition no differently than any other. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always prepare the same,'' he said. ``Make sure you  
sacrifice to be a champion.''

<HEADLINE> U.S., Vietnam Reach Trade Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today the United States  
and Vietnam are taking ``a major step forward'' in normalizing 
relations with an agreement in principle on a landmark trade 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a quarter-century after the Vietnam war, the two  
countries announced the deal yesterday in Hanoi. It is expected to 
benefit both sides, particularly Vietnam, which has been hit hard 
by fallout from the Asian financial crisis and is eagerly looking 
for investors and export markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But it would also require major reforms for one of the world's  
poorest countries, which suffers from a debt-ridden banking system, 
inefficient state-owned enterprises and widespread corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``In addition to promoting American commercial interests,  
enhancing our economic relations with Vietnam will also help 
advance cooperation with Vietnam on other issues of importance to 
our nation,'' the president said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``These include obtaining the fullest possible accounting of our  
missing from the war, encouraging continued progress in the freedom 
of emigration and seeking improvements in the human rights 
situation in Vietnam,'' the president said. ``Since the United 
States normalized relations with Vietnam, we have made steady 
progress in each of those areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the agreement was ``a major step forward for both  
countries.'' He said he would review the agreement and consult with 
Congress and the government of Vietnam in hopes of signing the 
agreement and establishing normal trade relations ``very soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, the result of nine rounds of talks over the last  
three years, would remove the final barrier for U.S. investors who 
got a late start into the Vietnamese market because Washington did 
not lift its trade embargo against Hanoi until early 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides said the agreement will govern areas such as  
bilateral trade, investment, tariff reduction and intellectual 
property rights. It could pave the way for Vietnam to join the 
World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, which will have to be translated, signed and  
approved by the U.S. Congress and Vietnam's National Assembly, is 
expected to take effect early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Communist Vietnam began opening its markets in the mid-1980s  
with the Doi Moi restructuring process. But the pace of reforms has 
slowed to a crawl over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	With declines in foreign investment and exports and a rise in  
unemployment, the government is hungry for an infusion into its 
economy. The World Bank estimates unfettered access to the U.S. 
market will add around $800 million, or almost 10 percent, to 
Vietnam's export revenues each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Work began in 1996 on the bilateral trade pact that would give  
normal trading status -- formally known as most-favored-nation 
status -- to Vietnam. If the deal is finalized, only Cuba and North 
Korea will not have such status with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks had stalled over Vietnam's tariffs -- 200 percent for  
automobile imports -- and its unwillingness to open its markets to 
U.S. investment and services. It fears its fledgling businesses 
would be at a disadvantage in competing with American companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Most analysts agree that Vietnamese industries are not yet ready  
to compete with major international companies but say competition 
would be one of the best ways to help them get up to world 
standards.

<HEADLINE>  Brett, Ryan Lead Hall of Fame Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- George Brett was completely blown away.  
And it was not by one of Nolan Ryan's fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
	Following an unassuming speech by baseball's greatest power  
pitcher ever, one of the game's best clutch hitters felt the 
pressure on the Hall of Fame podium Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	His eyes welled up with tears. His voice cracked. And he was so  
overwhelmed, he cut his induction speech short. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've broken down. I've had every emotion I could. It's time to  
get out of here,'' Brett said later, recalling the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty stressful,'' he said. ``I felt like I was up  
there for an eternity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it was only 17 minutes. But to Brett, that was plenty  
long enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett spoke last, after Robin Yount, Orlando Cepeda and Ryan, on  
an afternoon when a record crowd estimated at 50,000 honored seven 
new members. 
</P>
<P>
	Late umpire Nestor Chylak, Negro leagues pitcher Smokey Joe  
Williams and turn-of-the-century manager Frank Selee also were 
inducted. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the largest Hall of Fame class since Sandy Koufax led a  
parade of eight in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan spent most of his 16-minute speech thanking those who had  
made his career possible. Along with family members and friends, 
the man whose Hall plaque praised him as a ``Texas legend'' paid 
tribute to former players' union chief Marvin Miller and all fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciate y'all being here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I always thought there was going to be life after baseball,''  
Ryan said. ``I didn't realize the grip baseball had on me. It took 
me two full years to get over the fact that I was no longer a 
baseball player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, 52, played a record 27 seasons and holds major league  
marks of seven no-hitters and 5,714 strikeouts. He finished 
324-292, yet never won a Cy Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
	``A fierce competitor and one of baseball's most intimidating  
figures on the pitching mound,'' read his bronze plaque, which 
bears a ``T'' for the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett and Yount each topped 3,000 hits and Cepeda hit 379 home  
runs. All three were Ryan strikeout victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-four Hall inductees -- 15 of them struck out by the Ryan  
Express -- turned out for the 60th anniversary festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Williams, the oldest at 80, stayed more than a hour in the  
sweltering heat before leaving in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the hero of the recent All-Star Game at Fenway Park,  
and Willie Mays, who made a rare return to see former teammate 
Cepeda, got some of the biggest ovations. 
</P>
<P>
	Also receiving a huge cheer was Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the  
former owner of the Texas Rangers. New York Gov. George Pataki, 
mentioned as a possible running mate on a presidential ticket with 
Bush, implored, ``Let's have another great New York welcome for 
Governor Bush!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only boos of the afternoon came for commissioner Bud Selig.  
He was met with calls of ``Where's Pete Rose?'' and ``How about 
Charlie Hustle?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, as has become his custom, was on Main Street, signing  
autographs just blocks from the Hall. Banned from baseball, he's 
ineligible for Hall election. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've expressed my opinion to Mr. Selig. My thoughts are Pete  
Rose should be in the Hall of Fame,'' Ryan said later. ``Pete Rose 
should be judged on his merits as a player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's inductees increased the Hall membership to 244 --  
with space for only 240 plaques in the main gallery, extra room was 
found in an adjacent rotunda. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year, first-time candidates include Jack Morris, Goose  
Gossage and Kent Hrbek. Tony Perez and Carlton Fisk will again 
appear on the Baseball Writers' Association of America ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett had 3,154 hits and batted .305 in a 21-year career with  
Kansas City. ``Played each game with ceaseless intensity and 
unbridled passion,'' his plaque read. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett, 46, brought his family, including son Robin -- named for  
Yount -- and two of his three brothers. Ken was a former big league 
pitcher and Bobby was a minor leaguer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tearful during his speech, Brett looked at his older brothers  
and said, ``Sometimes I wonder why all this happened to me and not 
you. All I ever wanted to do was be as good as you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yount, a two-time AL MVP, had 3,142 hits in a 20-year career  
with the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	``A bastion of consistency and durability,'' read his plaque,  
which also denoted his ``stoic demeanor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yount, 43, was afraid his emotions might get the best of him. So  
he called Hall officials about three weeks ago and asked to speak 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never dreamed of being in the Hall of Fame,'' he said. ``And  
with all due respect, Mr. Gehrig, today I consider myself the 
luckiest man on the face of the earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, 61, was the second player from Puerto Rico to be  
elected, following Roberto Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
	``His ability to drive the ball with authority was respected and  
feared,'' his plaque read. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda rose to stardom with the San Francisco Giants, and  
entered the Hall wearing their cap. His final season was 1974, when 
he played two months with Brett for the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kid is never going to make it,'' Cepeda recalled himself  
thinking, drawing a laugh from Brett. ``Sometimes, you make 
mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chylak, who worked in the AL from 1954-78, was only the eighth  
umpire elected. Accepting on his behalf was his son, Bob -- Chylak 
was working when Bob was born, learning of the birth on the Yankee 
Stadium scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams played in the Negro leagues from 1910-32. In a 1952  
poll by the Pittsburgh Courier, he beat out Satchel Paige as black 
baseball's best pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Selee managed the Boston Beaneaters and Chicago Cubs from  
1890-1905. He is credited with turning catcher Frank Chance into a 
first baseman, creating the Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance infield. 
</P>
<P>
	Also honored were Bob Stevens of the San Francisco Chronicle and  
late announcer Arch McDonald. Stevens won the J.G. Taylor Spink 
Award for writing and McDonald got the Ford C. Frick Award for 
broadcasting.

<HEADLINE> State Surpluses Hit 19-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The booming economy, conservative  
forecasting and prudent management have left states in their best 
financial shape in at least two decades, according to a national 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
	The 44 states that provided information to the National  
Conference of State Legislatures ended fiscal year 1999 a total of 
$33.4 billion in the black. 
</P>
<P>
	The number combines general fund ending balances with reserve  
funds and represents 9.4 percent of 1999 state general fund 
spending, the survey showed. That tops the previous high of 9 
percent in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCSL, a clearinghouse of information for states and their  
lobbying arm in Washington, has been conducting the survey since 
1978. The organization is holding it annual conference in 
Indianapolis this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey released Monday also showed that state legislatures  
overall lowered taxes for a fifth consecutive year, approving a net 
cut of $5.5 billion for fiscal year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The general fiscal conditions of our states is excellent,''  
said Dan Blue, a state representative from North Carolina and 
president of the NCSL. ``In fact, it's probably unprecedented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey indicated that of the 44 states reporting, 32 ended  
the 1999 state fiscal year with a balance exceeding 5 percent, the 
level Wall Street analysts recommend as prudent. Seventeen of those 
had balances exceeding 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen states deposited money in their rainy day funds or  
other reserve accounts, while 20 cut taxes specifically to reduce 
excess revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota cut taxes by more than 18 percent, and three other  
states -- Connecticut, Colorado and Missouri -- reduced taxes by 3 
percent or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two states of the 44 reporting -- Nebraska and South Dakota  
-- approved significant tax increases.

<HEADLINE> Gore: $1B More for Vets' Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Clinton administration is asking  
Congress to add $1 billion in spending for veterans' health 
programs in the budget that begins Oct. 1, Vice President Al Gore 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``World War II veterans are aging rapidly -- all of us are aging  
rapidly,'' Gore told about 25 veterans at Nashville International 
Airport. ``And because the veterans' population is aging the need 
for health care is increasing. If we're going to fully discharge 
the obligation America owes the veterans, we have to account for it 
in the budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said the $1 billion includes $800 million to hire more  
medical workers ``and take other steps necessary to reduce waiting 
time and ensure quality care'' at Department of Veterans Affairs 
facilities; $100 million for home- and community-based long-term 
care services and $100 million to help upgrade outdated facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said the additional spending could be paid for under the  
administration's current budget request. He noted that he had 
served in Vietnam, where he was an Army journalist, and co-founded 
the Vietnam-era veterans caucus in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	During the announcement, Gore wore a hat from the local Vietnam  
Veterans of America chapter he belongs to. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes several days after Sen. Paul Wellstone,  
D-Minn., said a survey by his office found that 20 of the 22 VA 
health care networks would have spending shortfalls under the 
administration's $17.3 billion veterans health request for 2000. 
Veterans groups, citing the millions of World War II and Korean 
veterans at or approaching old age, have estimated the spending gap 
at $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Republican National Chairman Jim Nicholson said  
``Gore's high-sounding pronouncement'' came as a GOP-led House 
Appropriations subcommittee was ``doing the hard work of actually 
restoring the VA funding which (President) Clinton and Gore had so 
thoughtlessly and recklessly cut'' in the original budget 
submission.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Urge Farm Relief Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With no end in sight to the slump in the farm  
economy, Democrats and Republicans jockeyed for position in a 
coming battle over how much emergency aid to give to producers this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm-state Democrats proposed a $10 billion bailout Monday and  
said they will insist that the Senate vote next week on the package 
before lawmakers leave town for their August recess. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're confronted with the fierce urgency of now,'' said Sen.  
Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. ``There is no excuse for any further 
delay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republican leaders had been insisting that it was too  
soon to know how much assistance growers will need, but now they're 
working on a measure of their own to propose in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will work out something, I think, when the time comes,  
whether it's before or after the recess, and farmers will benefit 
from the actions we take,'' said Sen. Thad Cochran, a Mississippi 
Republican who chairs the Senate agricultural appropriations 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP package would probably include $7 billion to $10 billion  
in aid, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is expected to take up the Agriculture Department's  
annual appropriations bill next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Sen. Dick  
Lugar, R-Ind., thinks it's too early for Congress to act. On 
Monday, he proposed holding three days of hearings next week so 
lawmakers could get a better idea how much assistance is needed and 
how it should be distributed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lugar said he wanted to avert a ``bidding war'' between  
Republicans and Democrats and ensure that President Clinton would 
sign whatever package Congress passes. The hearings would ``provide 
a clear road map for prompt action'' by lawmakers when they return 
in September, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lugar said the hearings were the idea of Agriculture Secretary  
Dan Glickman, a Democrat, but Democrats in the Senate quickly 
rejected the suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This looks like more delaying tactics, that's all I can say,''  
said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman later issued a statement acknowledging that he had  
conferred with Lugar. But Glickman said hearings ``should not stand 
in the way of efforts in Congress ... to enact, immediately, 
emergency farm assistance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agricultural economy is mired in its worst slump since the  
early 1980s because of a worldwide grain glut that shows no signs 
of easing this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress provided $6 billion in farm relief last fall after  
Clinton vetoed a Republican-backed $4 billion package. This year, 
farm groups are asking for up to $17 billion in aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic proposal includes $5.6 billion in direct payments  
to farmers, doubling what they are scheduled to get under the 1996 
farm law, along with $1.3 billion in trade assistance, $400 million 
in crop-insurance discounts, and a variety of other aid to 
producers of certain crops. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP proposal also would likely include the $5.6 billion in  
direct payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also want Congress to rewrite the 1996 farm law,  
popularly known as ``Freedom to Farm,'' which ended a 
Depression-era system of price supports. Republicans have so far 
refused to reconsider the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional debate is playing out against the backdrop of  
the 2000 presidential campaign in Iowa, the site of the first 
caucuses, where Republican Gary Bauer recently criticized GOP 
congressional leaders for not moving more quickly on a bailout. 
Democrats circulated his comments in Washington.

	At Least 23 Deaths from Heat Wave  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Scorching heat gripped the eastern third of the  
country today, continuing a hot spell that has been blamed for at 
least 23 deaths. Heat advisories were posted today from Kansas 
eastward through the Ohio Valley, and over parts of the Southeast. 
Temperatures throughout the region hit the 90s and reached triple 
digits with the heat index. The weather was blamed on seven deaths 
in Cincinnati over the weekend, 11 deaths in Illinois in the past 
week and five in Missouri. Forecasts say there's no immediate 
relief in sight.

	House GOP Would Cut NASA 10 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans would cut NASA's budget by 10  
percent and trim some housing and climate programs below President 
Clinton's request as they began pushing a $93.8 billion spending 
bill through a House panel today. The international space station, 
one of NASA's highest profile projects, would receive $2.4 billion, 
$100 million more than this year but just half the increase Clinton 
sought. The bill would deny the president's $150 million request 
for future missions of the Earth observing system, which studies 
climate, and trim $75 million from future Mars exploration missions 
as well.

	Kosovo Refugees in U.S. Returning Home  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- About 300 of the Kosovo refugees brought to  
America by the U.S. government left today for their homeland, the 
first to return since the NATO bombing campaign ended. The group 
took a charter flight from Kennedy Airport. The plane was scheduled 
to arrive in Skopje, Macedonia, at 9 a.m. Tuesday. A bus and other 
vehicles were to take them to Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. 
About 9,700 refugees were brought to the United States by the 
government beginning in May.

	Report: Gas Additive Can Be Harmful  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a major reversal in environmental policy, a  
government advisory panel tomorrow will urge widespread reduction 
in the use of a controversial gasoline additive once touted as key 
to reducing air pollution from automobiles. The additive, MTBE, is 
used in so-called reformulated gasoline required by the 
Environmental Protection Agency in all or parts of 16 states. That 
accounts for about a third of the gasoline sold in the country.

	U.N.: Kosovo, Africa Support Differ

<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The international community, and Western  
countries in particular, have given far less financial support to 
more than 4 million African refugees than they have to the 850,000 
refugees from Kosovo, the U.N. refugee chief said today. China's 
U.N. ambassador, Qin Huasun, said it was ``extremely unfair'' that 
there was enough aid to give every Kosovo refugee $1.60 every day 
while each African refugee would receive only 11 cents a day. He 
blamed the discrepancy on the ``political interests'' of some 
countries.

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian Parliament Speaker Ahmed Qureia had  
to wait for three years and the election of a moderate Israeli 
government to win an invitation to Israel's Knesset in Jerusalem -- 
a gesture that implies recognition of the Palestinians' fledgling 
independence. Qureia and his Israeli counterpart, Avraham Burg, 
greeted each other warmly today under a portrait of the father of 
Zionism, Theodor Herzl, then exchanged gifts -- a silver peace dove 
from the host, a mother-of-pearl box from the guest -- before 
walking together along the marble halls of the Knesset, or

stymied would-be bidders. EBay earned $5.1 million, or 4 cents a 
share, in the three months ended June 30. In the year ago period, 
the San Jose-based eBay earned $5.2 million, or 5 cents a share. 
The online auction site has been battling problems with crashes and

the Dow industrials average closed down 47.80 to 10,863.16.

	Baseball Umpires Sue Leagues

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Less than two weeks after saying they would quit  
en masse, umpires turned around and sued baseball today for the 
right to withdraw their resignations. In a 14-page complaint filed 
in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia, the Major League Umpires 
Association also accused the American League and the commissioner's 
office of saying they intend to withhold termination pay of up to 
$400,000 per umpire.

<HEADLINE> Luck, Calculation Aid Bush's Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- In a lightning-fast emergence as the  
clear leader for the Republican presidential nomination, Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush has benefited from a series of events -- some pure 
luck, others carefully calculated. 
</P>
<P>
	The first -- and most basic -- was to stay out of the fray at a  
time when others rushed in last year. Bush said he had to stay at 
home -- first to campaign for re-election as Texas governor and 
then, after a landslide victory in November, to keep watch while 
the Texas Legislature was in session. He said he would not start 
campaigning until this summer, though the hustings were crowded in 
important early states like Iowa and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a sense in presidential politics that familiarity  
breeds contempt,'' said consultant Ralph Reed, architect of much of 
Bush's strategy. ``There is a time and a place to pet the pigs and 
kiss the babies, but that comes a little bit later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush sat on the sidelines marking time, no other GOP  
candidate was able to catch fire and momentum. That would have put 
pressure on Bush to move. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a time when Elizabeth Dole was ahead in New  
Hampshire, but she didn't do anything to push the envelope,'' said 
Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	In polling, in money and in backing from the Republican  
establishment, Bush has built a near-overwhelming edge for the GOP 
nomination, and early polls show him well ahead of Vice President 
Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seems to be sort of all things to all people,'' said Larry  
Hugick, director of political and media polls for Princeton Survey 
Research. ``Everybody can find something in him they like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Bush was able to seize on a national mood, coming from  
outside Washington at a time when the country was weary of Beltway 
scandals such as President Clinton's affair with White House intern 
Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe to some degree George W. Bush is the right guy to follow  
in the wake of Monicagate,'' Hugick said. ``Even though he's got 
the name, he isn't a Washington insider.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush capitalized on a second trend from last fall's elections,  
when the GOP lost seats in Congress but 31 governors, a solid 
majority, were Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really what's happened is there is a shift in visibility and  
recognition based on performance of the governors who have been 
able to accomplish things,'' said Montana Gov. Marc Racicot, an 
early Bush backer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush skillfully parlayed his ties to the governors into an  
important cornerstone of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Not coincidentally, the 1998 elections also led to the  
resignation of then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, a potential rival who 
probably could have matched Bush's prodigious fundraising skills. 
</P>
<P>
	With congressional Republicans in retreat, the power brokers of  
the Republican Party began looking outside Washington for hope. 
With his high poll standings, Bush was an obvious first choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think right now with the Republican rank and file, and many  
conservatives, there's an incredible desire and in some cases a 
zeal to win,'' said Greg Mueller, a consultant allied with 
publisher Steve Forbes. ``The pure fact that he's beating Al Gore 
in all the polls is propping up his campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also is running a different kind of campaign. While  
building campaign organizations in states which hold important 
early tests, Bush also is spending time developing networks 
throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Governors have been key to that, and Michigan Gov. John Engler  
headed an effort to bring them into the fray. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of governors don't have national recognition but they  
have in their respective states ... great credibility,'' said 
Engler. ``These are key swing states and there's a base to build 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Engler aide John Truscott described a recent Bush trip to  
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``They basically turned the organization over to us,'' Truscott  
said. ``We chose the event, we chose the location, we chose the 
people. They turn it over to the governors because the governors 
know how to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is No. 1 in fund raising. His $37 million is double Gore's  
take for the first half of the year, and 10 times more than his 
nearest GOP rival. 
</P>
<P>
	``His ability to take the whole Republican fund-raising  
establishment and to deny it to everyone else is what is unique,'' 
said Brian Kennedy, who runs Alexander's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	That is key, given the compressed campaign schedule.  
</P>
<P>
	``With the new schedule you're forced to have a king's ransom in  
the bank to be competitive,'' said Notre Dame political scientist 
Robert Schmuhl. Bush's ``king's ransom'' is $30 million in the 
bank, dwarfing all others. 
</P>
<P>
	His rivals say things will change as Bush gets greater exposure.  
</P>
<P>
	``People who are for him are really soft,'' said consultant John  
Maxwell, allied with Forbes. ``He's still in the honeymoon 
period.''

<HEADLINE>  Pan Am Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- With superb pitching, Cuba's powerful  
baseball team made an early statement in its Pan Am Games opener: 
We're the favorite, so come and get us. 
</P>
<P>
	And, by the way, we're not talking.  
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans had nothing to say after beating Mexico 5-1 Sunday  
night. They packed up their gear, loosened the collars of their 
bright red jerseys and quickly and purposefully headed to their bus 
in the parking lot of CanWest Global Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps their quick exit was a reflection of an earlier claim by  
Cuba's delegation that its athletes are being encouraged to defect 
through the Canadian media. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe they just want to let their play do their talking.  
</P>
<P>
	Cuba, which split a pair of exhibition games this year against  
the Baltimore Orioles, has won every Pan Ams baseball gold since 
the last time the competition was held in Winnipeg in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with the tournament serving as an Olympic qualifier and the  
United States using professionals for the first time, they are 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Contreras allowed only two hits in 4 1-3 innings. But when  
he suddenly lost his control and walked two batters with his team 
nursing a 1-0 lead, his night was over in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	In came 20-year-old Maels Rodriguez, who quickly got a double  
play and didn't allow a hit until the ninth, striking out five with 
a fastball that could be heard popping all over the picturesque 
park. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Lazo came in to finish the victory, also allowing one hit.  
</P>
<P>
	Ariel Pestano had three hits for the Cubans and long-time stars  
Omar Linares and Orestes Kindelan provided RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, a Cuban athlete and a journalist have defected, and  
Jose Ramon Fernandez, president of the Cuban Olympic Committee, 
said ``our delegation is very upset about publications inciting 
Cuban athletes to desert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pistol shooter Abel Juncosa Reyes asked for asylum before the  
games. Sources said Lisette Cepero of Radio Rebelde also has sought 
asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans are annoyed by stories that have appeared in the  
Winnipeg Sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation is contrary to the Olympic spirit and to the  
sports spirit in general,'' Fernandez said. ``The Cuban delegation 
does not accept these methods, which are contrary to the spirit of 
friendship and hospitality with which the Canadian people have 
received us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez was most angry about a statement signed by Enrico  
Blanco, a boxer who left Cuba in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is here now, inciting desertion,'' Fernandez said.  
</P>
<P>
	With Princess Anne in attendance at track and field, Johnny Gray  
performed royally and regally. The 39-year-old Gray, the 1987 Pan 
Am champ, won the 800 meters, edging Norberto Tellez of Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public dwells in your head that you're too old and you're  
supposed to believe it,'' Gray said. ``I don't. To have held up the 
way I did today shows that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray began his victory lap around the packed University of  
Manitoba stadium even before the judges examined the photo finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``With my experience, you take the victory lap and they'll give  
it to you,'' Gray said laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	Another longtime star, Cuban long jumper Ivan Pedroso, won with  
a leap of 28 feet, third best in the world this year. The two-time 
world outdoor champion and four-time world indoor champion overcame 
three fouls. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Huffins, the two-time U.S. champion in the decathlon, set  
a games record in beating teammate Daniel Steele by 100 points with 
a score of 8,170. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Williams ended the United States' 12-year drought in the  
men's 100. But teammate Angela Williams lost in the women's 100 to 
Chandra Sturrup, who gave the Bahamas its first-ever Pan Am track 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Angela Williams nearly didn't run. She aggravated a hamstring  
while warming up and the U.S. team trainer told her not to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	Other men's winners were Jamaica's Greg Haughton in the 400;  
Vanderlei Lima of Brazil in the marathon; and Joel Bourgeois of 
Canada in the 3,000-meter steeplechase. 
</P>
<P>
	In other women's events, Letitia Vriesde won the 800 for  
Surinam's first-ever track and field gold at the games; Mexico's 
Ana Guevera took the 400; Erika Olivera became the first Chilean 
marathoner to win a Pan Am medal with a games record 2:37:41; 
Mexico's Adriana Fernandez won her second straight 5,000 title; 
Argentina's Alejandra Garcia took the games' first pole vault for 
women; and Osleidys Menendez of Cuba won the javelin at 216-0, also 
a Pan Am record. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. men's track coach Ralph Lindeman, 48, was hospitalized  
Saturday night with chest pains. Dr. Dan Carr, head physician at 
the athletes village, said Lindeman was being held for observation 
Sunday at Victoria Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	While Cuba won six Greco-Roman wrestling golds, the United  
States took two, plus four silver and two bronze. The American 
champions were Dennis Hall of Milwaukee at 58 kilograms, Matt 
Lindland of Oregon City, Ore., at 76 kilos. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's Eric Lopez won the all-around men's gymnastics title.

<HEADLINE> EU Regulators OK Tyco-Raychem Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union regulators Monday  
cleared Tyco International Ltd.'s $2.87 billion purchase of Raychem 
Corp. following an investigation that focused on the companies' 
share of the European market for computer screens that respond to 
touch. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Commission said the companies' combined share of  
the touch screen market was less than 30 percent and will only 
increase slightly through the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``This operation will not create or strengthen a dominant  
position,'' the EU executive body said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyco announced in May it planned to buy Raychem, a U.S designer,  
manufacturer and distributor of electronic components. Based in 
Bermuda, Tyco is a leader in making fire protection systems and 
providing electronic security services, and also makes electrical 
and electronic components. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger will make the combined companies the second-largest  
supplier of touch screens in the EU, behind U.S. competitor 
Micro-Touch Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Commission said the existence of other strong players  
such as Gunze Limited of Japan and Canada's Dynapro, and the likely 
entry of new competitors into the market meant it had no 
competition concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Under EU rules, the Commission checks all mergers and takeover  
with a major impact on markets within the 15-nation Union to ensure 
they conform with European anti-trust and monopoly regulations.

<HEADLINE> Spielman Bangs in Return To Browns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Chris Spielman's orange helmet dangled from  
his right hand as he made a slow, purposeful walk to the other end 
of the practice field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Browns' workout had ended more than a half-hour  
earlier Sunday, and more than 2,000 fans headed home following the 
team's first full-squad workout in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, there was Spielman, still in his cleats and shorts, walking  
back on the field in the twilight to get in some more reps -- 
banging the blocking sled and roughing up the tackling dummy. 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder the linebacker is an Ohio football legend.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was just testing my helmet to make sure there was enough air  
in it,'' Spielman said explaining his early evening sojourn. 
``Sometimes when you get dinged, there's not enough air in your 
helmet. That was a good hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman got dinged and donged.  
</P>
<P>
	During a running play in 7-on-7 drills near the end of Sunday's  
practice, Spielman had stepped up to the line of scrimmage and 
collided with fullback Tarek Saleh, a former linebacker himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Their helmet-on-helmet meeting made one of those sounds only  
football players flying at full speed can make -- thundering, 
violent, scary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you see it?'' Browns coach Chris Palmer asked. ``Spielman  
filled and Saleh filled. That's what football's all about. On a 
scale of 1 to 10, that was a 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The blow staggered Spielman, who had to be helped off the field  
and who still looked a little foggy walking into the Browns' field 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, a four-time Pro Bowler with Detroit and Buffalo,  
hadn't taken a hit like that in nearly two years. He played only 
nine games in 1997 before breaking his neck and undergoing 
vertebrae fusion surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	He had hoped to make his comeback last season, but when his  
wife, Stephanie, was diagnosed with breast cancer, Spielman decided 
to stay home to care for her and his family. Stephanie Spielman is 
now cancer-free. 
</P>
<P>
	Following his neck surgery, there were doubts Spielman would  
ever be the player he once was, and the hit by Saleh was the first 
real test for his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fine,'' Spielman said. ``It was a good whack. I needed  
it. It was one of things where you get your bell rung. That's part 
of training camp. The good thing is that you get to do it again 
tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't the case Monday morning. Spielman woke up with a  
what he called a ``funny feeling'' in his neck and was kept out of 
the Browns early workout and taken to The Cleveland Clinic for a 
precautionary MRI. 
</P>
<P>
	While awaiting the results, which showed no abnormalities,  
Spielman said he pondered life without football. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought about even in the worst-case scenario, my wife is  
alive and that brought a smile to my face,'' said Spielman, who was 
back in pads for Monday afternoon's practice. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, Spielman said he wouldn't be playing for the  
Browns if he didn't think his neck was 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any doctor would put me in a position where I  
was at more risk than an anyone else and I wouldn't put myself in 
that position,'' he said. ``I have a goal, to be able to run around 
in the backyard a lot of times when I go home and I don't want to 
jeopardize that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If there was ever a player who seemed to be born to play for the  
Cleveland Browns, it's Spielman. He was a household name in Ohio as 
a high school star at Massillon, about 50 miles south of Cleveland, 
and later as an All-American at Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	And as the Browns return to the NFL following a three-year  
absence, so too is Spielman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nice way for me to wind down a career and to serve  
those who've watched me play throughout the years in northeast 
Ohio,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman isn't buying into the notion the new Browns are an  
expansion team and therefore shouldn't be expected to compete right 
away. He thinks Cleveland can make it to the playoffs in its first 
year back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would just walk out of here and never come back if we're  
shooting for Year Two,'' he said. ``That's not on my agenda. I 
don't think it's on anybody's agenda. You don't play this game not 
to win now. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not often given the opportunity to make National  
Football League history, especially as a team and we have the 
opportunity to do that.''

	``This situation is contrary to the Olympic spirit and to the  
sports spirit in general,'' Fernandez said. ``The Cuban delegation 
does not accept these methods, which are contrary to the spirit of 
friendship and hospitality with which the Canadian people have 
received us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez was most angry about a statement signed by Enrico  
Blanco, a boxer who left Cuba in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is here now, inciting desertion,'' Fernandez said.  
</P>
<P>
	With Princess Anne in attendance at track and field, Johnny Gray  
performed royally and regally. The 39-year-old Gray, the 1987 Pan 
Am champ, won the 800 meters, edging Norberto Tellez of Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public dwells in your head that you're too old and you're  
supposed to believe it,'' Gray said. ``I don't. To have held up the 
way I did today shows that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray began his victory lap around the packed University of  
Manitoba stadium even before the judges examined the photo finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``With my experience, you take the victory lap and they'll give  
it to you,'' Gray said laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	Another longtime star, Cuban long jumper Ivan Pedroso, won with  
a leap of 28 feet, third best in the world this year. The two-time 
world outdoor champion and four-time world indoor champion overcame 
three fouls. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Huffins, the two-time U.S. champion in the decathlon, set  
a games record in beating teammate Daniel Steele by 100 points with 
a score of 8,170. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Williams ended the United States' 12-year drought in the  
men's 100. But teammate Angela Williams lost in the women's 100 to 
Chandra Sturrup, who gave the Bahamas its first-ever Pan Am track 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Angela Williams nearly didn't run. She aggravated a hamstring  
while warming up and the U.S. team trainer told her not to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	Other men's winners were Jamaica's Greg Haughton in the 400;  
Vanderlei Lima of Brazil in the marathon; and Joel Bourgeois of 
Canada in the 3,000-meter steeplechase. 
</P>
<P>
	In other women's events, Letitia Vriesde won the 800 for  
Surinam's first-ever track and field gold at the games; Mexico's 
Ana Guevera took the 400; Erika Olivera became the first Chilean 
marathoner to win a Pan Am medal with a games record 2:37:41; 
Mexico's Adriana Fernandez won her second straight 5,000 title; 
Argentina's Alejandra Garcia took the games' first pole vault for

<HEADLINE> Report: Gas Additive Can Be Harmful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency, awaiting  
a report today critical of smog-fighting MTBE in gasoline, is 
reversing course and urging a prompt and significant rollback in 
the additive's use because it is getting into drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
	The methanol-based additive in so-called reformulated gasoline,  
used in about a third of the nation's motor fuel in 16 states, once 
was touted as key to cutting air pollution from automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal research shows that the compound causes tumors in rats  
and may do so in humans. A University of California study showed 
that the additive has affected at least 10,000 groundwater sites 
throughout the state. Recently California announced it would ban 
MTBE use, and Maine state officials pulled out of the reformulated 
gasoline program because of concern about MTBE. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA Administrator Carol Browner said Monday that the EPA ``must  
begin to significantly reduce the use of MTBE in gasoline as 
quickly as possible without sacrificing the gains we've made in 
achieving cleaner air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the EPA would ask Congress to develop new legislation  
designed to maintain the reformulated gas program that has been 
credited with cutting air pollution from cars, but with an aim 
toward phasing out MTBE use to protect water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the nation's air quality and its water supply must be  
protected but ``never one at the expense of the other,'' Browner 
said in a statement anticipating the release of findings of an EPA 
advisory panel today on the future of the gas additive. 
</P>
<P>
	The advisory panel, comprising diverse interests from  
environmentalists to oil industry executives and state regulators, 
found that while reformulated gasoline has contributed to 
significant air quality improvements, MTBE poses a growing threat 
to drinking water, according to draft summary obtained by The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel found that MTBE molecules travel unusually fast  
through soil and into ground water once gasoline gets into the 
environment. That can happen through leaks in underground tanks as 
well as spills while refueling motor vehicles, boats and other 
equipment such as lawn mowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Coinciding with the advisory panel report's release, a coalition  
of government, environmental and industry groups was to announce 
today a nationwide education campaign on the need to protect 
against gasoline leaks and spills. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year 9 million gallons of gasoline -- the equivalent of a  
full supertanker -- are spilled in the United States from leaks, 
inefficient engines and carelessness, said the Alliance for Proper 
Gasoline Handling, the coalition spearheading the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear what a change in MTBE use would have on gasoline  
prices, but some experts expect it may cause increases at the pump 
as refiners find other ways to reduce toxic chemical releases. It 
also may boost ethanol prospects because that is one of the major 
alternative additives for pollution control. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress in 1990 required that gasoline sold in areas with  
severe air pollution contain a higher amount of oxygen so gasoline 
would burn more completely. Oil companies responded by using MTBE, 
methyl tertiary butyl ether, a methanol-based additive. While other 
additives such as ethanol also could be used, MTBE has been by far 
the widest choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Reformulated gasoline is required to be sold in all or part of  
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, 
Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, 
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin. Arizona 
also uses the fuel because the state's gasoline supplies primarily 
come from California refineries. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA advisory panel, formally called the Blue Ribbon Panel on  
Oxygenates and Gasoline, concluded that MTBE use in reformulated 
gasoline ``should be reduced substantially.'' Two of the panel's 
members recommended it be banned entirely, and the group said 
Congress should give states clear authority to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a report summary, the panel found trace levels of  
MTBE in 5 percent to 10 percent of the drinking water in areas 
where reformulated gasoline is sold. While those levels themselves 
pose no health concerns, the panel felt they were a strong enough 
signal that widespread use of MTBE could pose a future threat to 
the drinking water supply. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not saying there's a public health threat now,'' Daniel  
Greenbaum, president of the Boston-based Health Effects Institute 
and chairman of the advisory panel, said in an interview. ``We're 
trying to prevent what has become a low-level, widespread problem 
from becoming a larger and worse problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenbaum emphasized that the panel does not call for the  
outright banning of MTBE, but that alternatives to MTBE be more 
widely brought into use as additives to gasoline to ensure the air 
quality gains made under the program are not eroded. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeast states have been pushing for greater flexibility to  
ban MTBE in reformulated gasoline. Jason Grumet, executive director 
of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, said 
the MTBE experience makes one thing clear: ``We better be pretty 
careful where we're leaping before we make profound changes in the 
nation's fuel supply again.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Community in Housing Spat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- A historic preservation ordinance has  
prompted a dispute in this upscale community tucked near the heart 
of the Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The city council last month put 700 of the city's 19,000 homes  
on a preservation list that prohibits them from demolition and 
restricts remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was intended to stop newly-rich Internet tycoons from  
knocking down modest homes and replacing them with tacky mansions. 
</P>
<P>
	But some residents said the move has backfired.  
</P>
<P>
	Doloris Oakley, who has spent the past 33 years expanding,  
renovating and improving her wood shingle home on a sprawling, one 
acre lot, said the ordinance goes too far. 
</P>
<P>
	``This all seems very arbitrary,'' she said. ``We feel that our  
property rights are being taken away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now the residents are fighting back.  
</P>
<P>
	They have formed a housing association with the intent to get  
the city council to let voters decide next year whether the 
demolition ban and remodeling restrictions should stay in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is too much legislation, too much government  
ordination in something that the city and the citizens have handled 
very well over time,'' said Ann Barbee, whose home sits in the 
middle of the so-called ``Professorville'' neighborhood where 200 
homes are now permanently preserved. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar historic preservation ordinances are sweeping through  
the country, as communities scramble to save historic buildings and 
the neighborhoods and landscapes they anchor. 
</P>
<P>
	During the past two decades, ordinances and boards aimed at  
preserving historic property have tripled to 2,250, according to 
the National Alliance of Preservation Commissions. In California 
alone, more than half of the cities have now passed historic 
preservation restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in a situation where, because of economic pressures, it  
is very, very desirable for developers to come in and just scrape 
all these lots and build these huge houses because that's what 
people are looking for,'' said Mildred Mario, a member of Palo 
Alto's historic resources board. 
</P>
<P>
	Palo Alto, home to Stanford University, is an enclave with good  
schools, tree-lined streets and a buzzing downtown main street. 
Most homes are small, two or three bedrooms, tucked in cozy 
neighborhoods with well kept lawns and gardens. 
</P>
<P>
	But because the nearby Silicon Valley has become a global  
economic force, it has become a very expensive place to live, with 
many tract homes, apartment buildings and busy freeways. This 
expansion and housing crunch has made Palo Alto a haven, albeit a 
costly one, where the average three-bedroom home costs $650,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``A booming economy can be a real enemy of preservation,'' said  
former mayor Gail Woolley. ``Palo Alto is completely built out. 
Land values are just skyrocketing. It's scary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But many residents feel the city's preservation effort has  
unfairly targeted them and forced them to give up their property 
rights, said Craig Woods, president of the newly formed 
neighborhood association. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been the most controversial, complex and divisive  
issue to come before this city in the memory of many longtime 
residents,'' Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If individual homeowners are going to be asked to subsidize  
this law and to submit control of their homes to the city, they 
should be allowed to directly participate in that decision,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Probes Rocket Belt Mystery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- In 1995, a test pilot with a rocket contraption  
strapped to his back shot into the air and flew over the Houston 
Ship Channel like Buck Rogers for 28 seconds. The crowd went wild. 
</P>
<P>
	After the demonstration, one of the developers of the rocket  
belt put it in his trailer and drove off. 
</P>
<P>
	The rocket belt hasn't been seen since.  
</P>
<P>
	The demonstration was the first and last public flight of the  
RB-2000 rocket belt, one of only three such devices operational in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years later, accusations of murder and assault envelop the  
three men who collaborated to build the device. 
</P>
<P>
	One is dead, while another is a suspect in his slaying and faces  
a trial this week in a lawsuit brought by the third partner 
accusing him of absconding with their invention to keep the profits 
to himself. 
</P>
<P>
	In the midst of it all, the question remains: What happened to  
the rocket belt? 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1965 movie ``Thunderball,'' James Bond straps on a rocket  
belt and quips that ``no well-dressed man should be without one.'' 
It was the entertainment world's first glimpse of a real such 
gadget, which later appeared in dozens of commercials, movies and 
at special events such as the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The size of a bulky backpack and weighing 120 pounds when  
fueled, the belt has two tanks filled with hydrogen peroxide and a 
third containing nitrogen. When the throttle is opened, a 
high-pressure stream blasts out two nozzles, providing the lifting 
thrust. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Aircraft first developed the device in the early 1960s for  
the Defense Department, which wanted a rocket to improve soldiers' 
mobility. But is fuel capacity allowed for only a 20-second flight, 
making it impractical. 
</P>
<P>
	But others were intrigued and dreamed of building their own  
rocket machine. One such person was Brad Barker. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, Barker was working in Florida helping to maintain a  
rocket belt owned by a stunt man who flew the contraption at Disney 
World. Later that year, he contacted an old acquaintance, pilot and 
aeronautics buff Larry Stanley, about teaming up to build a belt. 
</P>
<P>
	As Stanley tells it, both men borrowed thousands from their  
mothers to buy the parts. Barker, he says, purchased the machinery, 
while Stanley worked to put it all together. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Wright, a friend of Barker's who owned a car audio shop in  
Houston, offered them space at his business to build the belt. The 
rent was to be paid later, according to Stanley, after the belt was 
operational and making money. 
</P>
<P>
	In November 1994, that moment was near. The belt was ready for  
test flights. But suspicion already hung over the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley believed Barker had been charging him at least twice  
what the parts and machinery cost and pocketing whatever money was 
left over. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley confronted Barker. A fight broke out, and Barker beat  
his partner with a 4-pound hammer. Both men were charged with 
assault, though the charges against Stanley were dropped. Barker 
was convicted and placed on probation. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership was over.  
</P>
<P>
	Wright quickly placed a lien on the rocket belt, claiming  
Stanley owed him back rent. Stanley never saw the belt again, and 
the last time anyone saw it publicly was at a 1995 National 
Basketball Association event in Houston, when Barker put it in his 
trailer and drove away. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Stanley sued Barker and Wright, accusing them of  
conspiring to seize the belt ``for their own personal use, benefit 
and monetary gain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case finally was set for trial last July. In a last-ditch  
effort to settle his part of the case, Wright agreed a few weeks 
before trial to contact Barker and try to learn the whereabouts of 
the rocket belt, according to Wright's former attorney, Ronald 
Bass. 
</P>
<P>
	A few days later, Wright was bludgeoned to death in his home.  
</P>
<P>
	Authorities questioned Barker but never charged him. Harris  
County sheriff's officials say he remains a suspect along with one 
other unidentified person. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker maintains his innocence and insists he has phone records  
proving he was out of state when Wright was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sheriff's department has gone out of its way to try to  
associate the rocket belt with this murder,'' Barker says, ``and 
it's got nothing to do with it whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the rocket belt, Barker refuses to discuss its  
whereabouts. When asked whether he had it, he replied: ``I could 
tell you yes, I could tell you no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley's lawsuit finally went to trial on Monday. But attorneys  
for he other side weren't there to present a defense, meaning a 
default judgment against them is likely after the judge hears 
Stanley's side. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley is seeking reimbursement for the rental value of the  
rocket belt since December 1994 -- an estimated $500,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stanley says all he really wants is the rocket belt back.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only things that carry you through life are persistence  
and determination. So if I'm persistent and determined, I will 
recover that rocket belt,'' he says. ``It has been four years, and 
I'm not anywhere close to giving up on it. (Barker) is going to 
have to bury it.''

Panmunjom, ending three years of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1694, the Bank of England received a royal charter as a

<P>
	In 1967, in the wake of urban rioting, President Johnson  
appointed the Kerner Commission to assess the causes of the 
violence, the same day black militant H. Rap Brown said in 
Washington that violence was ``as American as cherry pie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, the House Judiciary Committee voted 27-11 to recommend  
President Nixon's impeachment on a charge that he had personally 
engaged in a ``course of conduct'' designed to obstruct justice in 
the Watergate case. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, actor James Mason died in Lausanne, Switzerland, at age

exploded at the public Centennial Olympic Park, killing one person 
and injuring more than 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: Workers at the Nissan Motor Corp. assembly plant  
in Smyrna, Tenn., voted against representation by the United Auto 
Workers. Eighty people were killed when a Korean Air DC-10 crashed

<HEADLINE> Feherty, McCarron Tied for Lead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWCASTLE, Wash. (AP) -- David Feherty does television commentary  
on golf for CBS Sports and spends time with his wife and five 
children. He says he's barely played golf this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Monday, he fired a 6-under-par 66 to share the  
first-round lead with Scott McCarron at the $595,000 Fred Couples 
Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
	With seven birdies and just one bogey, Feherty had the lead all  
to himself before McCarron finished strong with four birdies and an 
eagle on the last six holes of the 7,024-yard, par-72 course at The 
Golf Club at Newcastle. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Funk and Jeff Sluman were two back at 68. Tournament host  
Couples shot a 69 to join Nolan Henke, Hal Sutton and Mike Hulbert 
at three off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Feherty, the amiable 40-year-old from Northern  
Ireland, who stole the show on the first day of the two-day event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any explanation for today,'' Feherty said. ``If I  
played 10 rounds of golf this year I'd be surprised. I think I was 
abducted by aliens last night and replaced with a superior human 
being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Feherty, who has been announcing for CBS for three years and  
also writes a column for Golf Magazine, has played in three of the 
four previous Couples tournaments that benefit local charities. 
</P>
<P>
	Feherty won 10 tournaments in his career before going behind the  
camera. He was a member of the 1991 European Ryder Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of the tournament, which ends Tuesday, earns  
$160,000.

	NATO security was tight on the road to Gracko, a farm village 10  
miles from the provincial capital Pristina where the victims were 
slain. British troops erected three checkpoints along the way and a 
platoon of 30 British soldiers was securing the village itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbs in Gracko had hoped to bury the farmers today, but not all  
of the bodies had been released by the morgue in Pristina, where 
they were undergoing autopsies. The burials were expected to be 
held later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	A public memorial service did not take place, although Gracko  
residents mourned in private. 
</P>
<P>
	Gracko villagers blamed ethnic Albanians for Friday's killings --  
the worst such incident since NATO moved in last month -- and said 
the killing field was near a village that was a rebel Kosovo 
Liberation Army stronghold. KLA leaders denied any involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite pledges by NATO and the United Nations to find and  
punish the attackers, the killings have increased fear among 
Kosovo's dwindling Serb population. More than 20 Serbs have 
requested escorts to leave Kosovo following the incident, said Maki 
Shinohara, a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency. 
</P>
<P>
	A meeting of a new transitional government committee of ethnic  
Albanians and Serbs scheduled for today was postponed indefinitely 
in response to a Serb request. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. administrator in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, pledged not  
to let the killings wreck efforts to create peace and security for 
all of the province's ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``The murderers sought to stop us. We must not permit that,'' he  
said. ``Our mission must go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the peacekeepers, known as KFOR, arrived in Kosovo on June  
12, there have been 198 killings in the province, British Col. Ian 
Waters said today. Of the victims, 73 were Serb and 72 were ethnic 
Albanian. The bulk of the others were Gypsies living in the 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have an unsuitably high murder rate,'' Waters told  
journalists today, adding that most seemed to be ethnically 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia, meanwhile, demanded an urgent meeting of the U.N.  
Security Council on ways to stop ethnic violence in Kosovo, a 
province in the country's Serbian republic. 
</P>
<P>
	The demand, relayed by Yugoslavia's U.N. ambassador, Vladislav  
Jovanovic, also insisted that Yugoslav troops be allowed to return 
to the province to protect Serbs, the state-run Tanjug news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have lost confidence in KFOR and it is going to be very  
difficult to rebuild it again,'' Momcilo Trajkovic, a local Serb 
politician, told Associated Press Television News. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators from the international war crimes tribunal began  
investigating the Serb killings. Until now, forensic teams have 
concentrated almost exclusively on the alleged killings of ethnic 
Albanians by Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo's Serbs are increasingly the victims of killings, arson  
and other violence in revenge attacks by some of more than 700,000 
ethnic Albanian refugees who have flooded back to Kosovo under NATO 
protection. More than 100,000 Serbs are believed to have fled the 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 10,000 ethnic Albanians were killed in a Serb  
crackdown before and during the 78-day NATO bombing campaign that 
eventually forced Yugoslavia to accept a peace plan and pull its 
forces out of Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Water Polo Star Tackles Law School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- U.S. water polo star Courtney Johnson  
has had a busy summer, what with preparing for the Pan American 
Games while also taking law school finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 25, of Salt Lake City, attends Santa Clara University's  
law school. But because of several major tournaments beginning in 
May, she hasn't gone to classes on a steady schedule. Instead, 
Johnson did an internship with the public defender in Orange 
County, Calif., for half of her credits, then went to class from 
June 1-July 8 for the other half. 
</P>
<P>
	But she was required to take a three-hour final exam in  
``Commercial Paper and Payment Law'' last Saturday, when she was 
playing for the national team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to the law school dean and he said as long as my  
professor approved it and as long as it was proctored, it was OK,'' 
Johnson said. ``It was an open note and open book test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team leader Michelle Pickering served as the proctor on Sunday  
after the Americans lost 8-7 to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was harder taking the test here,'' said Johnson,  
who still has two semesters of law school remaining. ``There was 
the distraction of playing water polo, which needs to be my primary 
focus while I'm up here, so I was not as prepared as I would like 
to have been. I would have been more prepared if I was at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson spent as much as five hours a day studying while in  
Winnipeg, but she said she would have been ``studying all day at 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	 *NO DREAM TEAM:* After breezing through the Tournament of the  
Americas, U.S. basketball now turns its attention to the Pan 
American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't look for Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett and Gary Payton in  
Winnipeg. Expect instead to see Damon Bailey, Todd Lindeman and 
Byron Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team for the Pan Ams is comprised of Continental  
Basketball Association players, just as it was when the United 
States won the silver medal in the 1995 games at Mar del Plata, 
Argentina. Mo McHone of the CBA's Sioux Falls Skyforce is the head 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the Dream Team, but the players can still dream.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something a lot of people have an opportunity to  
do,'' said Bailey, the former Indiana star who plays for the Fort 
Wayne Fury. ``It's been a long time since we've won the gold in the 
Pan Am Games, and everyone on this team is committed to going out 
and giving it everything they've got to bring the gold back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States hasn't won a Pan Ams gold medal in men's  
basketball since 1983. The U.S. men begin play in the 1999 games 
against Cuba on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RELAY SWITCH:* Chris Huffins, the Pan Ams gold medalist in the  
decathlon, will not run in the 400 relay as originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the United States, which has not won the event since  
1987, will use a team of Kaaron Conwright, long jumper Dwight 
Phillips, 100-meter gold medalist Bernard Williams and Curtis 
Perry. 
</P>
<P>
	Huffins returned home Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	U.S. coaches haven't decided the makeup of the 1,600 relay team.  
The United States also is winless in that event at the Pan Am Games 
since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Both relay finals will be run Friday, the last day of track and  
field. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DON'T SHOOT:* Games chairman Sandy Riley touched off a mild  
panic at the shooting range and almost got himself tossed from the 
venue. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley stopped on the firing line to visit with Canadian team  
member Wayne Sorenson, who had just finished shooting. When Riley 
picked up Sorensen's unloaded rifle and aimed it down the range, 
the safety staff began yelling across the venue at him. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because other staffers were working on the targets at the  
time. A sheepish Riley put the rifle down and continued on his way. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety staffers later said they didn't realize they were yelling  
at Riley. But they said the rules apply to everyone, even the 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *U.S. BIDS:* Three U.S. cities are vying for the right to bid  
for the 2007 Pan Am Games. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Olympic Committee representatives will visit all three  
candidates in September: the Raleigh-Durham area in North Carolina; 
Miami; and San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, all three areas will have a chance to make their pitch to  
the USOC board, which then will select one to make the U.S. bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pan Am Games have been staged in the United States twice, in  
Chicago in 1959 and Indianapolis in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indianapolis had a very short lead time and came together 18  
months out,'' USOC president Bill Hybl said. ``They made us very 
proud. We are again at a crossroads. It will be 20 years since the 
U.S. has hosted the Pan American Games, and the interest is 
there.''

	Serbs Mourn 14 Slain Farmers  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb villagers in Gracko held  
private vigils in their homes today for 14 Serb farmers slain in 
their fields, as they awaited the completion of autopsies to bury 
their dead. Serbs had hoped to bury the farmers today, but not all 
of the bodies had been released by the morgue in Pristina, where 
they were undergoing autopsies. The burials were expected to be 
held later in the week. Gracko villagers blamed ethnic Albanians

	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The FBI says it has ``specific  
information'' linking the man charged with murdering a Yosemite 
Park naturalist to the deaths of three other tourists earlier this 
year. Cary Stayner was questioned in March but ruled out as a 
suspect in the killings of Carole Sund, her daughter Juli, and a 
family friend. The FBI did not elaborate on what new evidence has 
been discovered. Stayner, a handyman at a hotel nearby Yosemite, 
will be arraigned today in the brutal killing of naturalist Joie

	WINSLOW, Maine (AP) -- Patrons eating lunch at a popular  
riverside restaurant said it ``sounded like a bomb'' when an 
87-year-old woman accidentally crashed her car into the dining room 
yesterday, injuring more than two dozen people. Thirteen people, 
many of them tourists, were taken to area hospitals, but only one 
had to be admitted, for rib fractures. About 15 others were treated 
at the scene for cuts and bruises. Marie Wyman apparently panicked 
when she struck two cars while trying to back out of a parking

	India: All Rebels Out of Kashmir

	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Indian officials claimed today that  
``there is no Pakistani presence'' in the Indian section of 
disputed Kashmir. Indian army officials said soldiers swept the 
last rebels from their side of Kashmir after killing 32 guerrillas 
in weekend fighting and losing seven of their own men. Sporadic 
shelling, however, continued on both sides. Early this year, 
hundreds of Islamic fighters seized mountaintops inside the 
Indian-held part of the territory. In May, India launched a 
campaign to evict the infiltrators, most of whom left after India 
and Pakistan agreed to halt the fighting two weeks ago.

top infectious disease in Japan. The number of TB patients rose to 
42,715 in 1997, up 243 from the year before. A total of 2,742 
people died of tuberculosis in Japan in 1997, slightly lower than 
1996.

	Smokers Rolling Own Cigarettes

	ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- With lawsuits against tobacco companies  
pushing up cigarette prices, smokers have taken to rolling their 
own. Sales of loose tobacco are up 30 percent over last year, a 
Brown &AMP; Williamson spokesman says.One tobacco company, M&AMP;R 
Holdings, is planning to introduce a make-your-own kit later this 
summer with a cigarette machine, tobacco and all the other 
accessories. Cigarette prices went up 45 cents a pack last year 
after four tobacco makers agreed to pay $206 billion to states for 
the cost of caring for sick smokers. In addition, the federal 
excise tax on cigarettes, now at 24 cents per pack, will jump 10 
cents on Jan. 1.

<HEADLINE> EU Official Warns Britain on Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The European Union's top finance official warned  
that Britain's decision to stand aloof from the single European 
currency threatens EU unity and risks tragic consequences for 
British politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``The UK's decision not to join the euro from the start may be  
the European tragedy of the present generation of British 
leaders,'' Yves-Thibault de Silguy told a meeting of the 
Corporation of London, which runs the city's financial district. 
</P>
<P>
	De Silguy, in his final speech in office Monday, said Britain's  
decision not to join the 11 EU nations that adopted the euro on 
Jan. 1 left it marginalized in Europe's financial decision-making, 
while the pound sterling suffers from exchange rate volatility 
buffeted between the euro and the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pound is clearly becoming a minor satellite of the much  
larger euro,'' de Silguy said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said exchange-rate uncertainty put British companies at a  
disadvantage, while international investors would be scared off if 
Britain's isolation for the EU currency bloc lasted much longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain, along with Sweden, Denmark and Greece, stayed out of  
the euro when the other EU members launched the single currency. 
Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor government has indicated Britain 
should swap sterling for the euro in the near future if the 
economic conditions are right and the British people vote for it in 
a referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	However, opinion polls consistently show most British voters  
want to keep the pound. Opposition to the euro has grown since the 
EU currency has fallen steadily against the dollar in recent 
months, down to near parity from more than $1.16 in January. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the euro has rebounded recently, trading late Monday in  
London at $1.0674. 
</P>
<P>
	In nearly five years as EU commissioner for financial and  
monetary affairs, de Silguy played a key role in preparations for 
the euro's launch. He is due to be replaced in September by former 
Spanish Economics Minister Pedro Solbes.

<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- A pilot who obtained his flying license just  
last week landed his single-engine airplane on a highway early 
today because he feared he was running out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgilio Alegria was flying from Dallas with one passenger in  
his Cessna 152, said Lisa Burkhardt, a spokeswoman for San Antonio 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	He radioed the San Antonio tower shortly after midnight saying  
he was about 2 1/2 miles from the airport and didn't think he had 
enough fuel to make it to a runway, airport officials said. San 
Antonio is about a 270-mile flight from Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Alegria dodged traffic and landed on the southbound lane of U.S.  
281. Neither he nor passenger Valerio Ochoa was injured.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed lower Monday, with banking  
shares falling amid concern about the outlook for global interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Concern about rising U.S. interest rates has cast a shadow over  
world stock markets since last Thursday, when U.S. Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan said the central bank will act ``promptly 
and forcefully'' if inflation resurfaces and unemployment continues 
to drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks which ended the day lower included ABN Amro, which closed  
down 10 cents at 21.05 euros. Paribas fell 5.60 euros to 96.50 
euros, BNP fell 3.90 euros to 71.10 euros, while Societe Generale 
shares ended down 6.90 euros at 152.00 euros. 
</P>
<P>
	Auto stocks also closed down, falling victim to an upsurge in  
the euro, which hit a 10-week high against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW closed down 17.00 euros at 665.00 euros, DaimlerChrysler  
fell 1.13 euros to 79.18 euros, and Volkswagen ended down 64 cents 
at 56.11 euros, amid expectations the stronger currency will slow 
demand by making exports more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index closed down 2.0 percent, the Paris  
CAC-40 index ended 1.0 percent lower, and Milan's MIBtel index fell 
1.7 percent. London's FTSE 100 index closed down 0.6 percent.

<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 590 European companies closed down  
4.05 points, or 1.3 percent, at 299.27, its lowest level since 
early March. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy stocks were the worst performers, with a 2.4 percent drop

<HEADLINE> Report Clears Blue Angels Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- A Navy report released this week has  
cleared two Blue Angels flight leaders of wrongdoing in how they 
handled allegations of adultery and other improprieties within the 
precision flying team. 
</P>
<P>
	Anonymous letters to the Navy and Pensacola News Journal had  
accused flight leader Cmdr. Pat Driscoll and his predecessor, Capt. 
George Dom, of failing to punish wrongdoers and treating officers 
more leniently than enlisted personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Driscoll removed a married pilot and female public  
affairs officer, both named in the letters, from the flight 
squadron based at Pensacola Naval Air Station for what he called a 
``loss of trust and confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They were reassigned for disobeying orders to end a personal  
relationship and avoid contact to prevent any perception that 
something inappropriate was going on, said Cmdr. Jack Papp, a Navy 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	But a Navy official who did not want to be identified said  
Driscoll found no evidence of adultery between the married pilot, 
Marine Maj. Scott Wedemeyer, and the single female officer, Navy 
Lt. Tanya Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
	The letters also alleged a pilot no longer in the Navy had  
gotten away with adultery. The pilot denied it, and the 
investigator wrote that Dom tried but was unable to find any 
evidence to support the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	A third complaint was about two single Blue Angels officers, one  
no longer with the team, who had been dating. The public portion of 
the report released Monday does not indicate how the case was 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Dom had discouraged such dating, and Driscoll prohibits it. The  
Navy ordinarily does not bar dating that does not constitute 
adultery or fraternization -- which usually involves a relationship, 
not necessarily sexual, between members of different ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was endorsed by Rear Adm. Mike Bucchi, chief of naval  
air training at Corpus Christi Naval Air Station, Texas, who wrote 
that Dom and Driscoll handled matters in a manner that was 
``thorough, balanced, timely and fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no preferential treatment or inequal treatment of  
either officer or enlisted members,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucchi also endorsed the commanders' policy that Blue Angels  
members should not date each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Wedemeyer and Ms. Wallace are awaiting reassignment. Wedemeyer  
has an unlisted phone and could not be reached for comment. Ms. 
Wallace was en route to Pensacola from a temporary assignment in 
Norfolk, Va.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is likely to fall  
40,000 short of its promise to put 100,000 more state and local 
cops on the nation's streets by the end of the year 2000, the 
Justice Department inspector general estimated Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Releasing an audit of the Community Oriented Policing Services  
(COPS) program, Inspector General Michael Bromwich said program 
officials have shifted their timeline. 
</P>
<P>
	``COPS officials have informed us that their goal is to fund --  
that is, to have approved grant applications for -- 100,000 new 
officers by the end of fiscal year 2000,'' Bromwich said. ``This is 
significantly different from having 100,000 new officers ... 
actually deployed to the streets.'' That goal has been stated 
publicly by administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Using COPS office projections, Bromwich estimated 59,765  
additional officers will be deployed by the end of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno said, ``We have every intention of  
reaching the president's goal.'' She called the report ``a 
constructive tool for improving program management in reaching that 
goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said  
the report ``confirms many of Congress' criticisms'' about the 
program. He also said it should raise questions about whether COPS 
can handle another $6.375 billion sought by the president to add 
50,000 more officers by the end of 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	A centerpiece of President Clinton's 1992 campaign, the COPS  
program was part of a 1994 crime law. It authorized $8.8 billion 
for grants to state and local police agencies to hire new officers 
or redeploy old ones into street work with the community. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Lou Leary, the program's acting director, disputed  
Bromwich's conclusions about whether the ultimate goal will be 
reached. She said the findings relied heavily on audits of 149 
grantees, either referred to him by the COPS program or selected by 
him because they appeared to have problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``The inspector general has no basis for inferring broad  
conclusions about the COPS program from this high risk pool of 
pre-selected sites, which represents only approximately 1 percent 
of the 11,300 COPS grantees,'' Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging the audits may not be representative, Bromwich  
said they nevertheless raised questions about some COPS figures. 
</P>
<P>
	He said grantee audits played no role in these findings: that  
COPS counted 7,722 officers as funded even though local police 
agencies had not accepted the $485 million for them, and that the 
program prematurely counted another 2,526 officers as funded before 
grantees received award documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute has been referred to Deputy Attorney General Eric  
Holder for resolution. Bromwich and Leary had some points of 
agreement, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Leary said her office accepted recommendations from the  
inspector general for tightening supervision of grantees. Bromwich 
said ``the COPS office has taken essential first steps to address 
identified weaknesses in grant program management and 
administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general also noted that by February, COPS had  
awarded grants to hire or redeploy 92,324 officers at an average 
cost of $54,256 per officer, well below the anticipated average 
cost of $75,000 per officer. The cost includes hiring, training, 
salary and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	If this trend continues, Bromwich said, the program could reach  
its goal for $5.8 billion -- a savings of $1.7 billion from 
authorized spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The grants to hire new officers last three years, but grants to  
redeploy officers are for one year only and often pay for equipment 
designed to free officers from desks for street duty. 
</P>
<P>
	When the grants end, local police agencies are left to pay for  
the officers with their money. 
</P>
<P>
	Bromwich said redeployment grants are to account for one-third  
of the 100,000. But he said audits of 67 redeployment grantees 
found that more than three-quarters ``could not demonstrate they 
had or would redeploy officers from administrative duties to the 
streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bromwich said there is no requirement that 31,091 officers  
funded early in the program will still be on duty in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	His random survey of 191 grantees found that 96 percent said  
they would retain the officers, but 70 percent of audited grantees 
had yet to draft a retention plan. Leary said 96 percent of 
original grantees requested local funds to retain the officers.

<HEADLINE> Texaco, Arco Beat Estimates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Second quarter earnings at Texaco Inc. and  
Atlantic Richfield Co. beat Wall Street estimates as the companies 
took advantage of rising crude oil prices. 

</P>
<P>
                            	 *Texaco    	
</P>
<P>
	The White Plains N.Y.-based oil company earned $286 million or  
52 cents a share in the second quarter, down 15 percent from the 
$335 million or 60 cents a share in the year-ago period. Results 
beat Wall Street expectations by 3 cents, according to analysts 
surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the second quarter 1999 totaled $8.27 billion, up from  
$8.04 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The benchmark price for crude has risen into the $19 to $20  
per barrel range signaling higher upstream earnings in the months 
ahead,'' said Texaco chairman and CEO Peter I. Bijur. 
</P>
<P>
	Results for the three months ended June 30 included a special  
gain of $21 million for the sale of Texaco's interest in six 
California onshore and offshore fields, and a special charge of $11 
million for employee layoffs. Including one-time gains and charges, 
Texaco earned $273 million, or 50 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of 1999, income before special items was $391  
million, or 70 cents per share, compared with $594 million, or 
$1.06 per share, in the year earlier period. Sales in the first 
half of the year were $15.46 billion, compared to $16.19 billion 
the year earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Texaco on Monday fell $1.50 to $60.87 1/2 on the New York  
Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                     	 *Atlantic Richfield Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter operating earnings at Atlantic Richfield Co. rose  
37 percent during the second quarter on the strength of higher oil 
prices and aggressive cost cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles-based Arco earned $302 million, or 92 cents per  
share, compared to $220 million or 67 cents per share in 1998. 
Results beat Wall Street estimates by 6 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings do not include a special, one-time $11 million gain  
from field operations. Counting that special benefit, earnings rose 
to $313 million, or 95 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the quarter were $3 billion, up from $2.5 billion a  
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher earnings marked a sharp turnaround for Arco, which is  
in the process of merging with London-based BP Amoco. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to benefitting from higher gasoline prices, Arco's  
cost-cutting program saved the company $220 million during the 
first six months of 1999, said Mike Bowlin, the company's chairman 
and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``All areas of our company are contributing to this  
achievement,'' Bowlin said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, Arco earned $478 million,  
or $1.46 per share, on revenues of $5.7 billion. That compares to 
earnings of $374 million, or 60 cents per share, on revenues of 
$5.3 billion during the first half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Arco on Monday fell $1.81 1/4 to $87.62 1/2 on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Patrick Kennedy Thanks Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- A member of the Kennedy family has  
stepped forward to thank Americans for their expressions of 
sympathy over the death of John F. Kennedy Jr. in the plane crash 
that also killed his wife and sister-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made an enormous difference in my family's ability to cope  
with this very tragic loss,'' said Rep. Patrick Kennedy, 32, a son 
of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Returning to Rhode Island after a weekend of mourning at the  
Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Mass., the Massachusetts Democrat 
voiced gratitude for an ``overwhelming'' outpouring of condolences. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Kennedy's cousin, Joseph P. Kennedy II, a former  
congressman from Massachusetts and son of Robert F. Kennedy, also 
had words of thanks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been such an overwhelming outpouring of kindness  
from so many people that it was very touching for all of our 
family,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr.'s private plane crashed into the ocean off Martha's  
Vineyard, Mass., on July 16, killing him, his wife Carolyn Bessette 
Kennedy and her sister Lauren Bessette. 
</P>
<P>
	``I loved my cousin John dearly and I am so grateful for the  
relationship I had with him,'' Rep. Kennedy said. ``I feel the loss 
immensely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a stop at a senior center in Woonsocket named after the late  
President John F. Kennedy, Patrick Kennedy said he wanted to ``make

<HEADLINE> Philips Buys Into LG LCD Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Royal Philips Electronics of the  
Netherlands agreed Monday to buy a 50 percent stake in LG LCD Co., 
which makes computer screens, for $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement marks the largest investment in South Korea by a  
foreign company and the Dutch company's biggest foreign investment, 
LG LCD officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	LG LCD, a wholly owned subsidiary of the LG group, is one of the  
world's largest producers of thin-film transistor liquid crystal 
displays, or TFT-LCD. It has three plants in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal gives Philips a key supply source in flat-panel  
computer screens, one of the fastest growing markets in the 
multimedia hardware industry. Flat-panel screens are increasingly 
used in cars, handheld devices, televisions and military equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	LG moved into the TFT-LCD business in the early 1990s and has  
since expanded its facilities aggressively. The global market for 
flat-panel color screens reached $8 billion last year and is 
growing rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	LG LCD makes an estimated at 4.7 million screens a year. Its  
sales are expected to reach $1.8 billion this year, up from $500 
million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	LG LCD, South Korea's third largest conglomerate, plans to use  
the huge cash inflow to cut it debts. As of late April, the 
business group had $30.4 billion in debt and $40 billion in assets.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Camp Focuses on QBs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- With No. 1 draft choice Donovan McNabb  
still among the missing as the Philadelphia Eagles opened training 
camp Monday at Lehigh University, the focus was on the quarterbacks 
who were in camp. 
</P>
<P>
	For Bobby Hoying, it was almost like last summer, when he was  
the starting quarterback and every media member wanted to hear his 
every word. 
</P>
<P>
	For Koy Detmer, it was almost like late last season, when he was  
the focus when he started the final five games in the Eagles' 3-13 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	However, times have changed.  
</P>
<P>
	In the offseason, the team signed unrestricted free-agent  
quarterback Doug Pederson, and new coach Andy Reid named him the 
starter. Then the Eagles selected McNabb with the second pick in 
April's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer and Hoying were left to battle for the third quarterback  
spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to get out there and play well and see what happens,''  
said Hoying, who threw 224 passes last season without throwing a 
single touchdown. ``I felt I played well in the minicamps we had 
and I just want to come out here and continue that progress. If I 
do that, good things will happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoying is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent after  
this season, while Detmer is only in his third NFL season. The 
Eagles have to determine which player is best suited to being a 
third-string quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things will work themselves out. They always do,'' said  
Detmer, who threw five touchdowns and five interceptions last 
season. ``I'm pleased with my progress. I know that Bobby and I are 
competing. That's the nature of the business. You make things work 
out for you. All you can do is play as well as you can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb is one of four Eagles draft picks still unsigned, along  
with offensive guard Doug Brzezinski, a third-round pick, and wide 
receiver Na Brown and safety Damon Moore, both fourth-rounders. 
Team executive Joe Banner said Monday that progress had been made 
in all of the contract talks, but he was not specific. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had conversations with three of the four agents of players  
who aren't here and I remain optimistic that all but one of those 
will get resolved fairly quickly,'' Banner said.

<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- A pro-Indonesian militiaman was killed  
and two others injured in a clash today between groups fighting 
over whether to seek independence for East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence, which comes as U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan  
considers whether to again postpone an independence referendum 
because of security fears, is certain to increase tension in the 
Indonesian territory. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright today  
expressed concern about the recent violence in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look to the Indonesian government to meet its obligation to  
create a secure and credible environment,'' said Albright, who 
spoke at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum 
in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, U.N. officials temporarily closed two voter  
registration stations in the Indonesian territory after threats by 
anti-independence militants, said Hiro Ueki, spokesman for the U.N. 
Assistance Mission in East Timor (UNAMET). 
</P>
<P>
	Ueki said about 30 militia members threatened to destroy the  
centers on Sunday after U.N. staff refused to register them because 
they had failed to provide required identification documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The posts, near Balibo, an anti-independence stronghold about 60  
miles southwest of Dili, were closed as a precaution. UNAMET 
reopened both today with extra security, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	UNAMET is operating 200 registration centers across East Timor  
for the vote, in which East Timorese are to choose between full 
independence and remaining part of Indonesia as an autonomous 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	The date of the vote, originally set for Aug. 8, has been  
postponed to Aug. 21 or 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan is expected to announce within the next few days whether a  
further delay will be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor has been wracked by unrest, guerrilla warfare and  
human rights abuses since Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese 
colony in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Independence activists claim the vast majority of East Timor's  
800,000 people want to break away from Indonesia. The activists, 
the United Nations and others accuse the militia groups of using 
violence and intimidation to derail the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Philippines, East Timor leader Jose Ramos Horta said  
today that Indonesia faces isolation and a major blow to economic 
recovery if the army derails the referendum.

<HEADLINE> Avid Outdoorsman Arrested After Naturalist Beheaded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PORTAL, Calif. (AP) -- Cary Stayner's friends didn't consider  
him a violent man. Until now, neither did the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, a motel handyman, was an avid outdoorsman who enjoyed  
hiking and sunbathing in the nude. With youthful and clean-cut good 
looks, the 37-year-old was relatively quiet and friendly, but 
considered somewhat of a loner. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those who knew him best worked with him at the Cedar  
Lodge or the adjacent restaurant, where he rented a room upstairs 
for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in this remote enclave on Yosemite's western doorstep are  
still shaking their heads at the news that he is accused of 
beheading a Yosemite National Park naturalist and is a suspect in 
the slayings of three sightseers who were last seen at the lodge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I'm shocked. To say the least,'' said Jim Houtz, who owns  
the Cedar Lodge restaurant and regularly tends bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends said Stayner would often go to beaches known for  
skinny-dipping and nude sunbathing. Lately, he had found a new spot 
in Yosemite where he could take off his clothes and catch some sun 
without any worries, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another popular destination for Stayner was a nudist colony in  
Sacramento County, the Laguna del Sol, where he was known to escape 
on his days off, and where he was taken into custody Saturday 
morning by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner attended Merced High School and worked as a window  
installer at an Atwater glass company after he graduated, according 
to his father, Delbert Stayner, who lives about 60 miles west of El 
Portal, in a small farm town outside Merced. 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1997, the Cedar Lodge hired Stayner. He was laid off  
Jan. 7 because of a slowdown in work, then rehired March 20. As a 
maintenance worker, he took care of mechanical and electrical 
breakdowns, and carried a radio so he could be contacted by the 
front desk should anyone ask for towels, an extra cot, or some 
other need. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner ate regularly at the restaurant, often twice a day for  
lunch and dinner. He wasn't considered a troublemaker, or violent 
in any way, by those who got to know him. His criminal record 
appears limited to drug charges, four of them filed in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Cedar Lodge workers recall Stayner being around when Carole  
Sund, 42, Juli Sund, 15, and Silvina Pelosso disappeared Feb. 15, 
even though he was out-of-work at the time. They don't remember 
whether he talked about that crime. Most could not fathom the 
possibility he had anything to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would have been the furthest of suspects in the locals'  
minds,'' said Kathy Hefner, a manager at the Cedar Lodge 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI questioned him during the Sund-Pelosso investigation but  
ruled him out as a suspect. They didn't return to him until shortly 
after Joie Ruth Armstrong, a naturalist for the Yosemite Institute, 
was found decapitated a few hundred feet from the employee home she 
shared with two other workers, who were away at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	James M. Maddock, special agent-in-charge of Sacramento, would  
not elaborate on why Stayner was dismissed as a suspect at the 
time, nor on how they were led to him in Armstrong's murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do look forward to the day when I can share the details of  
the investigations from start to finish,'' Maddock said.

<HEADLINE> 'Haunting' Scares Away Competition / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Poor reviews didn't scare off moviegoers from  
``The Haunting,'' making the high-tech ghost story No. 1 at the box 
office over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Shirley Jackson's ``The Haunting of Hill House,'' the  
movie starring Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones had $33 million 
in ticket sales in its opening weekend, according to industry 
estimates Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Final figures were to be released today.  
</P>
<P>
	Another movie rich in special effects and bad reviews,  
``Inspector Gadget,'' opened in second place with $22 million, 
while the beauty pageant dark comedy ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' opened 
weakly in 11th place with $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' came in at No. 10  
with $4.2 million. With a total of $402.9 million since its May 19 
release, the ``Star Wars'' prequel edged ``E.T. The 
Extra-Terrestrial'' to take third place for all-time U.S. box 
office in actual dollars, behind ``Titanic'' and the original 
``Star Wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gross-out sex comedy ``American Pie'' slipped from second to  
third place, taking in $10.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Kubrick's racy ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' starring Tom Cruise  
and Nicole Kidman, dropped from first place to fourth, grossing 
$9.9 million on its second weekend. That was down 54 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``'Eyes Wide Shut' was more of a first-weekend type of picture  
because the anticipation was so heavy,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, 
president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks box office 
numbers. ``People just dying to see it went out that opening 
weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Haunting'' director Jan De Bont had his fourth straight No. 1  
opening, after ``Speed,'' ``Twister'' and ``Speed 2: Cruise 
Control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The critically panned ``Haunting'' faces a specter of its own  
with the wide release this week of ``The Blair Witch Project,'' a 
horror phenomenon that has been selling out a handful of theaters. 
The film goes from 31 screens to about 1,000 on Friday and from 
1,500 to 2,000 by Aug. 6, said Paul Pflug, spokesman for the 
distributor, Artisan Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	The low-budget movie took in $2 million for an average of about  
$64,500 a screen, more than five times the average for ``The 
Haunting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Blair Witch Project'' is rated R while ``The Haunting''  
has a PG-13 rating. That should leave room in the market for both, 
said Jim Tharp, distribution chief for DreamWorks, which released 
``The Haunting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see 'Blair Witch' as being our worst nightmare,''  
Tharp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Haunting,'' $33 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Inspector Gadget,'' $22 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``American Pie,'' $10.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' $9.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Big Daddy,'' $6.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Lake Placid,'' $5.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Wild, Wild West,'' $5.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``The Wood,'' $4.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Tarzan,'' $4.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' $4.2 million.

<HEADLINE> Shaq Likely To Return to Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal probably will be  
back, although Grant Hill's chances of being an Olympian again 
aren't so certain. As for the 12th man, it's a tossup. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men's basketball team said goodbye Monday to its three  
youngest players -- Wally Szczerbiak, Elton Brand and Richard 
Hamilton -- and began looking toward next summer's 2000 Olympics in 
Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine NBA veterans who won the Tournament of the Americas  
will return, with three other players added to the Olympic roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the one person that seems extremely likely is Shaq,''  
said Russ Granik, the USA basketball president and NBA deputy 
commissioner. ``Tim (Duncan) has been happy to say all month that 
we don't have a true center on the team, so I'd be surprised if 
he's not picked. 
</P>
<P>
	``After that, there's a lot of great players and the committee  
will have some tough choices. Some of it will come down to 
position, some of it will come down to seeing if everyone's still 
healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team did not show any glaring weaknesses in Puerto  
Rico, although the lack of a physical low-post presence was obvious 
in the gold medal game. Canada's Todd MacCulloch, a second-round 
pick of the Philadelphia 76ers, finished with 26 points and 14 
rebounds simply by parking himself under the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	With players like Yugoslavia's Vlade Divac, Lithuania's Arvydas  
Sabonis and Australia's Luc Longley expected at the Olympics, the 
U.S. team will need another big body. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill was chosen for this team but withdrew because the  
tournament conflicted with his wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grant, like anybody else, will just have to wait until we get  
our committee together at the end of the year,'' Granik said. 
</P>
<P>
	Granik said Karl Malone and Allen Iverson will be among the  
players considered for the Olympic roster. A big factor will be 
who's playing well early in the NBA season when the selection 
committee meets. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA vice president Rod Thorn, a chief architect of the team,  
wants to Americans to add an outside shooter to complement 3-point 
specialists Allan Houston, Steve Smith and, to a lesser degree, 
Gary Payton. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States won its 10 games by an average of 31.6 points,  
down slightly from the 1996 Olympians' average margin of 32.3. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team reached 100 points only four times in 10 games, a  
mark that was reached 25 times in 30 games by the three previous 
Dream Teams. 
</P>
<P>
	This, however, was the best defensive team, limiting opponents  
to 66.2 points a game -- more than four points lower than the 1996 
team's 70.3 points-against average. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest surprise was Kevin Garnett. The coaches, team  
executives and support staff were impressed with the attitude and 
maturity of the 22-year-old forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Sunday what he thought this team's signature was, Garnett  
paused several seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Poise,'' he said. ``Just when you guys thought it was going to  
be a challenge against Puerto Rico, or just when you thought a game 
might be close, we kept our poise and showed the type of team we 
are -- the professionalism we possess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Garnett, that professionalism manifested itself in  
everything from bowing to fans at the medal ceremony to frolicking 
with children in the pool alongside the team's luxury resort. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's three weeks was filled as much with golf, gambling,  
jet skiiing and sun tanning as it was with basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no practices or shootarounds after the first full day  
in Puerto Rico. During the games, the Americans turned up the 
energy when needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's been much more fun than work,'' Houston said.  
``But when you have a team full of great competitors and players 
like this, you put pressure on yourself to play hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really wasn't a work environment, but playing every single  
day for eight days took a toll on us. Other than that it was fun. I 
think playing together for three weeks will be an advantage rather 
than going to he Olympics without knowing each other.''

<HEADLINE> GTE Income Grows 15.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Second-quarter income grew 15.3 percent at  
GTE Corp., spurred by revenue growth in wireless, long-distance and 
Internet communications. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE earned $776 million, or 79 cents per share, for the  
April-June period. In last year's second quarter, the company 
earned $673 million, or 69 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter revenues totaled $6.29 billion, rising 7 percent  
from $5.88 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest quarterly profit matched most Wall Street forecasts,  
according to a First Call survey of analysts that follow the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	However, GTE's stock slipped 81 1/4 cents a share to $75.43 3/4 on the  
New York Stock Exchange after Monday's report, possibly weighed 
down by a sharp downturn in the technology sector. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE's second-quarter results ``deliver on a commitment we made  
in May 1997 to grow earnings in the 13-to-15 percent range,'' said 
GTE chief executive Charles R. Lee said. ``Especially gratifying is 
the outstanding growth and continued evolution of our data and 
Internet businesses, in which we have made substantial investments 
over the past two years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GTE's proposed merger with Bell Atlantic is still awaiting  
certain government approvals. The deal recently won Justice 
Department clearance, but a ruling is still pending from the 
Federal Communications Commission and certain state bodies.

<HEADLINE> 3 Arrested for Mailing Ammunition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Two men and a woman were arrested  
Monday on charges they mailed dozens of guns and ammunition to 
Ireland for a cause they were ``very devoted to,'' investigators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Smyth and Siobhan Browne, of Weston, and Conor Anthony  
Claxton, of Deerfield Beach, are charged with violations of the 
federal Arms Export Control Act. 
</P>
<P>
	They are accused of exporting weapons without a license, mailing  
concealable firearms without a license and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said eight packages of guns and ammunition were  
mailed from South Florida to Ireland, but were intercepted by 
British authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The guns were purchased for a cause the defendants were ``very  
devoted to,'' according to a federal affidavit. The document did 
not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the sender of the packages stated falsely  
that they contained toys, video cassette players, stereo equipment, 
computers, baby clothes, radios and other items. 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth unidentified defendant remains a fugitive.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Releases New Windows Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft on Monday sent a select group of  
computer and software manufacturers the first test version of the 
planned successor to its Windows 98 operating system, a program 
code-named ``Millennium'' that's scheduled for release next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Windows 98, which Microsoft targeted for both home and  
business use, Millennium is aimed solely at the consumer and home 
market. Microsoft's strategy is to capture the business segment -- 
from small business applications to the largest corporate networks 
-- with its new Windows 2000 operating system, which it hopes to 
ship by the end of December. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Sanford, group product manager for Microsoft's Consumer  
Windows Division, said Millennium will try to soothe the primary 
gripe of Windows users: that it's just too complicated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Millennium is the first step in the process of attaining these  
goals, in really simplifying the home computer experience,'' 
Sanford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft originally planned to bring out a consumer version of  
Windows 2000, a high-powered operating system built on a different 
code base than Windows 98. But in April, Microsoft President Steve 
Ballmer announced that one more generation of Windows 98 would be 
made, one that would link personal computers to the vast new array 
of digital devices appearing in homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballmer said Microsoft eventually plans a consumer operating  
system based on Windows 2000, but probably not before 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer computer market has evolved in a different  
direction from business, with home users wanting inexpensive 
machines that nevertheless can handle rich graphics for games, 
high-quality audio, Internet browsing, and have the capacity to 
link with other computers, stereos, televisions and various 
electronic gadgets around the house. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballmer has said computer manufacturers have asked Microsoft for  
a version of Windows that can do all that, but still be based on 
standard technology so it will work with existing computer 
components that have fallen drastically in price. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether a new version of Windows likewise will drop its price is  
an open question. Sanford said no price has been set for Millennium 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``pre-beta'' version of Millennium being released Monday is  
just the framework for the program, with computer makers and 
software vendors being asked to evaluate it from a technical 
standpoint. Sanford said it's too early to say what particular 
features the new program will have. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really focusing on the underlying technology, the core  
plumbing and piping of the system,'' Sanford said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said one thing being strongly considered is dropping  
the code that supports MS-DOS, the 1980s-vintage operating system 
that made Microsoft's fortune. Although eliminating such support 
would prevent Windows from running old software, it would 
drastically improve performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is necessary for us to evaluate the pieces of legacy code  
currently in Windows and determine what, if any value they offer 
consumers,'' Sanford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Sanford would not give specifics, he did outline broad  
goals for Millennium: 
</P>
<P>
	--Support for digital media and entertainment. The popularity of  
music and video, digital photography and super-realistic games has 
exploded, and the program will let users take full advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	--Easy connection to the Internet.  
</P>
<P>
	--Home networking. Millennium will simplify connecting multiple  
computers in the home to share data and an Internet connection, and 
provide the means for connecting different ``intelligent'' devices. 
</P>
<P>
	--A notion called ``It Just Works.'' The idea is that from the  
moment a computer is turned on, it should perform without baffling 
or frustrating the user. Millennium would be able to diagnosis its 
problems and ``heal'' itself, run new hardware or software simply 
and automatically, and allow new users to operate a computer 
straight out of the box. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Microsoft gets the technical feedback from its testers, it  
will incorporate needed changes in future test versions, Sanford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Microsoft has not yet decided on a final name for the  
operating system once it's ready for sale.

<HEADLINE> EBay Earnings Beat Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Second-quarter operating results for  
Internet auction house eBay Inc. beat Wall Street expectations, 
despite repeated troubles with the company's computer server that 
stymied would-be bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay earned $5.1 million, or 4 cents a share, in the three  
months ended June 30. In the year ago period, the San Jose-based 
eBay earned $5.2 million, or 5 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call had predicted earnings of 3  
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues shot up to $49.5 million for the second quarter of  
1999, up from $19.5 million for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Including charges and merger-related costs, eBay had net income  
of $816,000, or 1 cent a share, compared with $2.7 million, or 2 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of eBay closed Monday at $105.06 1/4, down $2.75 in trading  
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of registered eBay users increased to 5.6 million  
from more than 3.8 million in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The online auction site has been battling problems with crashes  
and slowdowns for months. 
</P>
<P>
	One of eBay's worst outages prevented the company from holding  
auctions of just-released merchandise tied to this year's ``Star 
Wars'' movie. Another crash lasted nearly a full day.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Feels Growing Pains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Though Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura  
called for unity when the Reform Party opened its convention, the 
three-day gathering was marked by squabbling and power struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the election of new chairman Jack Gargan on Sunday was not  
without controversy. Gargan's election could cause further splits 
in the party since he has vowed not to support another presidential 
run by Ross Perot. 
</P>
<P>
	Gargan, a retired financial consultant from Florida, also said  
he will move the party's headquarters from Perot's Dallas offices 
to Florida. He said that he ran for the post only to save the 
party. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Benjamin, vice chairwoman of the party, turned from watching  
a squabble within the New Jersey delegation on Saturday to say that 
the party must weather such storms as part of its growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of these things is growing pains. At this stage,  
everything is important,'' said Benjamin, of Cherry Hill, N.J. 
``This is democracy. It isn't pretty today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The party's lack of unity is of great concern, said Gargan, who  
won Ventura's endorsement in the balloting to succeed outgoing 
party Chairman Russ Verney. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer delegates came to this year's convention than in the past  
two years, Gargan noted. Only 350 of the 585 delegates showed up 
for the Reform Party's weekend convention, and the party also is 
losing ballot access in some states, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gargan said the state of the party was the reason he ran for  
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want the damned job, but I've got too much at stake,''  
he said. ``I have so much at stake I'm not about to let this ship 
go down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reform Party's troubles may stem in part from its mission:  
welcoming people who want change and are disenchanted by other 
parties. That attracts so many different kinds of people that it's 
hard to develop a unified message. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have everyone, from people who think Jesse Jackson is too  
conservative to people who think Pat Buchanan is too liberal,'' 
said Tom McLaughlin, the Pennsylvania state chairman and the third 
candidate on the chairmanship ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	McLaughlin estimated that there are eight to 10 factions within  
the party. He said the party can be unified as long as its platform 
sticks to economic issues like balancing the budget, reducing the 
national debt and campaign finance reform. Social issues should be 
left for the individual candidates to decide, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all members agree with McLaughlin, however. Richard Kline, a  
Reform Party gubernatorial candidate in Missouri, joined the party 
because Democrats in his state wouldn't support his anti-abortion 
stance. He wants the Reform Party to adopt a pro-life position. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite such difficulties, the party is making some important  
strides. 
</P>
<P>
	``Minnesota in 1998 shocked the world. It is time for us to  
shock the world in the 2000 presidential election,'' Ventura 
bellowed to conventioneers by phone on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Boosted by Ventura, more and more Reform Party candidates have  
gained the courage to run for office, including gubernatorial 
candidates Gatewood Galbraith in Kentucky and Jerry Ladner in 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura couldn't come to the conference because of severe  
weather that day in Detroit, but that didn't stop rumors that he 
was avoiding the conference to set himself apart from Perot. 
</P>
<P>
	Party members have already discussed drafting millionaire  
developer Donald Trump and retired Gen. Colin Powell for possible 
runs. On Sunday, Ventura suggested that Republican Sen. John McCain 
of Arizona would be a good candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Verney, the outgoing chairman, told members not to get  
discouraged and to continue focusing on organization, communication 
and unity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the leadership skills in place, we have the  
infrastructure, and the future is ours,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong's Rapid Pace Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOXMEER, Netherlands (AP) -- Tour de France champion Lance  
Armstrong kept up his winning ways Monday as he launched a week of 
races, receptions and talk show appearances almost as grueling as 
the Tour itself. 
</P>
<P>
	After three weeks pedaling through France, the 62-mile race  
around this town southeast of Amsterdam was more about picking up 
the $25,000 appearance fee than being first across the line. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Texan gave 20,000 cheering fans what they had come to  
see, breaking from the pack shortly before the finish to beat 
Australia's Robbie McEwan. Servais Knaven of the Netherlands was 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was scheduled to ride races in Belgium and the  
Netherlands on Tuesday and Wednesday before flying to the United 
States for talk show appearances Thursday. He was due back in the 
Netherlands again Friday for another money-spinning race. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to Dutch TV before Monday's race, Armstrong said he had  
already been congratulated by President Clinton, who called from 
Air Force One on the way back from the funeral in Morocco of King 
Hassan. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's victory Sunday came less than three years after  
being diagnosed with testicular cancer that spread to his brain and 
lungs. Doctors gave him only about a 50 percent chance of survival. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old, only the second American to win the tour,  
dedicated the victory to cancer survivors around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was diagnosed with cancer in 1996. After four rounds  
of chemotherapy and two operations -- one to remove a testicle and 
one for brain lesions -- he began his comeback early last year. His 
doctors say there is a tiny chance the cancer will return.

	GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (AP) -- Dan Dutko, a major Democratic  
fund-raiser and member of the Democratic National Committee, was in 
critical condition Monday night from head injuries suffered in a 
mountain bike accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutko was flown Sunday to St. Mary's Hospital in Grand Junction  
after his accident in Aspen. He was in Aspen for a fund-raiser 
attended by President Clinton on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutko, 54, of Chevy Chase, Md., is co-chairman of Leadership  
2000, the DNC's top finance committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to serving as co-chair of the senior DNC committee,  
Dutko is also a founding partner and chairman of The Dutko Group 
Inc., a lobbying firm based in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	He has also held other political positions, including vice

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Women To Nix Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is planning an  
appeal to women in its effort to rally opposition to the big tax 
cut Republicans are trying to push through Congress, saying women 
could be hurt more than men if government surpluses aren't 
available to bolster Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress and the American public face an important decision:  
to invest in a stronger Medicare program for our mothers and 
grandmothers or give away the entire surplus on a risky and 
irresponsible tax scheme,'' says an administration document 
describing the message President Clinton and first lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton hope to get across at a White House event scheduled 
for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At the event, the Clintons plan to highlight a study by a  
nonprofit group showing that women rely more than men do on 
Medicare -- the nation's health insurance program for the elderly 
and disabled -- mainly because women on average live longer and have 
lower incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that elderly women spend an average of 20  
percent more on prescription drugs than men -- something Medicare 
doesn't cover, although the administration says it should. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, a contender for the 2000 Democratic  
presidential nomination, is expected to tout the statistics about 
women and Medicare at a separate rally against GOP tax cuts with 
Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats are also expected to single out Americans living  
in rural areas in their pitch. Gore plans to take along 
administration figures showing that nearly half of senior citizens 
in rural areas lack health insurance covering prescription drugs, 
compared to about a third of all retirees nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has proposed, and congressional Democrats are  
backing, new universal Medicare coverage for prescription drugs -- 
at a 10-year cost of $118 billion to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	To pay for the new benefit and buttress Medicare against the  
coming wave of baby boom retirements, Clinton wants to use $794 
billion of the federal budget surpluses projected over the next 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders also have endorsed the idea of a Medicare  
overhaul and new drug benefits. But they are trying to earmark much 
of the future surplus for a tax cut costing $792 billion over 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has promised to veto the GOP tax cut, which passed the  
House last week and is scheduled for consideration on the Senate 
floor this week, ensuring that the two parties will have to work 
out a compromise later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the meantime, the two political parties are competing to  
exploit debate over the surplus as a symbol of their different 
visions for the country leading up to the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Women are expected to play a pivotal role in those elections,  
and Gore wants to inherit the support Clinton has enjoyed among 
them. Clinton's focus on family issues helped him win the women's 
vote 55 percent to 37 percent in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The study showing women's disproportionate reliance on Medicare  
was conducted by the Older Women's League. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medicare is a women's health plan,'' said OWL's executive  
director, Deborah Briceland-Betts. 
</P>
<P>
	Three out of five Medicare beneficiaries are women. Among the  
oldest participants in the program, the study found, women comprise 
an even greater share: 71 percent of those over age 85, and 83 
percent of those over age 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Women also have a greater financial need for help paying medical  
bills in old age. Seven in 10 of the nation's retirees living in 
poverty are women. And women, who are also more likely to have 
chronic illnesses, spend 22 percent of their old-age incomes on 
health care, compared with 17 percent for men. 
</P>
<P>
	On prescription drugs alone, the study estimates, elderly women  
will spend an average $1,200 on in the year 2000, compared with 
$1,000 for men.

<HEADLINE>  Armstrong Wins Tour de France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Lance Armstrong, even before he got sick, never  
imagined winning the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	But here he was, standing on the victory podium on the  
Champs-Elysees, listening to ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' after 
completing one of sports' most remarkable comebacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never expected to be here. Even in my first career,''  
Armstrong said, referring to his life before cancer. ``I never had 
plans for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong rode to victory in the Tour de France on Sunday less  
than three years after being diagnosed with testicular cancer that 
spread to his brain and lungs. Doctors gave him only about a 50 
percent chance of survival. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Texan, only the second American to win cycling's  
showcase race, dedicated his victory to cancer survivors around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it sends out a fantastic message,'' he said. ``We can  
return to what we were before -- and even better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's ride inspired a lot of fans, especially some  
Americans who came over to catch part of his thrilling ride. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been cycling all my life, and I just decided on Friday  
night to come over,'' said Michael Grotz of Park Ridge, N.J. ``With 
Armstrong coming back from cancer, it's amazing. Here's a guy who's 
winning and he deserves it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The finish, under brilliant skies, was a marked contrast to last  
year's final leg. The 1998 race ended in a drizzling rain after a 
huge drug scandal placed the entire sport under suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Armstrong was dogged by accusations in the French media  
that he used performance-enhancing drugs. Many people couldn't 
believe that a cyclist recovering from cancer could prevail in the 
brutal three-week event. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no proof, however. The sport's ruling body, which  
tests cyclists during the race, said the only drug Armstrong used 
was an approved prescription cream for saddle sores. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's 20th and final stage was won by Australia's Robbie  
McEwen. He edged Germany's Erik Zabel in a furious sprint. Silvio 
Martinelli of Italy was third. Armstrong was 86th -- in the 86th 
Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's final margin in the overall standings was 7 minutes,  
37 seconds, the same lead he had on Saturday. Alex Zulle finished 
second and Spain's Fernando Escartin was third. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other American to win the race was Greg LeMond, a  
three-time champion whose last victory was in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was diagnosed with cancer in 1996. After four rounds  
of chemotherapy and two operations -- one to remove a testicle and 
one for brain lesions -- he began his comeback early last year. His 
doctors say there is a tiny chance the cancer will return. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the keys to Armstrong's cycling victory was his ability  
to master the mountain climbs that had always given him trouble. 
After he easily won the first stage in the Alps, he became the 
prohibitive favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	The final stage was a fairly easy 89-mile ride from Arpajon up  
to Paris, and then past many of the city's grandest sights: the 
Louvre, the Tuileries Gardens with their giant summer ferris wheel, 
the arcaded Rue de Rivoli, the Place de la Concorde with its 
Egyptian obelisk, and then up the Champs-Elysees to the Arc de 
Triomphe for a loop that was repeated 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
	French national champion Francois Simon dyed his hair the  
red-white-and-blue of his jersey. And not only was Armstrong clad 
in the yellow shirt of the race's leader -- his wheel was yellow, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Armstrong was to lose that newly decorated wheel to a  
puncture, but his loyal teammates from the U.S. Postal Service 
helped him back to the pack. 
</P>
<P>
	For the host country, the race was a disaster. For the first  
time since 1926, a French cyclist failed to win a stage. 
</P>
<P>
	But Armstrong's victory could be a big boost for American  
cycling, much as the success of the U.S. soccer team in the Women's 
World Cup has inspired many in the United States. Although LeMond 
won the race, it was not with an American team. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-year-old U.S. Postal Service team was euphoric throughout  
the race. Early on, team managing director Mark Gorski compared an 
Armstrong victory to a team of French players winning the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory also will be quite lucrative.  
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's agent, Bill Stapleton, said the win could be worth  
$2.5 million from prize money and bonuses from sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there's the publicity: Armstrong begins a marathon  
round of TV talk show appearances later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to strike while the iron is hot,'' Stapleton said.

<HEADLINE> Maryland Man Seeks Right To Sell Beer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SMITH ISLAND, Md. (AP) -- Newcomer Steven Eades can't see the  
harm in offering a cold beer with the steaming Chesapeake Bay blue 
crabs he'd like to serve in his cafe overlooking Tangier Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	But some of the island's longtime residents, whose English and  
Welsh ancestors settled here in 1657, believe that allowing Eades 
to sell alcohol would threaten their religious heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	To them, beer means brawling -- and the nearest police officer is  
a 40-minute boat ride away. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have done without it all these years, I don't see that  
we need it,'' said Jennifer Dize, 49, who was born on the island 
and lives on the same parcel of land where her great-grandparents 
lived. Like many islanders, Mrs. Dize is Methodist and believes 
drinking alcohol is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Eades, a 48-year-old retired trucker, moved to the island two  
years ago. He had already owned a bed-and-breakfast there and 
wanted to live on Smith Island year-round. 
</P>
<P>
	He respects the way the islanders hold their ancestors in such  
high regard and place family, church and community above all else. 
But he also believes times have changed and liquor sales would 
simply be another sign of progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am certainly not against the feelings of the church and I  
don't want to cause any harm to their beliefs. But there is a lot 
of heritage that has changed over the years,'' Eades said. ``It is 
just change ... not necessarily good or evil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He points out that locals can order a case of beer from the  
mainland and have it delivered by the ferry that makes the 12-mile 
trip from Crisfield to the island twice a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors, however, are caught high and dry.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of transient boaters,'' Eades said. ``Most of  
them are on vacation and they would like to relax for the evening 
and have steamed crabs and beer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About one-third of the island's 350 or so residents headed to  
the mainland last month to encourage the Somerset County liquor 
board to turn Eades down. One board member was in favor, one 
opposed and the third asked for a delay. The board was expected to 
vote Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Local historian Jennings Evans predicts Eades' bid will fail.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our forefathers were against it and the majority of the people  
still feel that way,'' said the 68-year-old Evans, an island native 
who speaks in the part-Southern, part-English accent distinctive of 
islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the crab feast is over, we don't want any bottle  
throwing. That's when people go to bed. They work hard here. They 
don't want any brawling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back in the 1960s, when teen dances at the community center  
could get out of hand, the fire department would blow the whistle 
to alert the men to break up a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would frighten them so bad they wouldn't do it again,''  
Evans said. ``But it would happen more often if we had a regular 
tavern here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an emergency, a state police helicopter can arrive in 15  
minutes, but Evans said it usually takes at least an hour for 
police to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	When an umpire, baseball players and fans got into a brawl five  
years ago, the locals had to break it up. ``If we waited for 
police, they would have been dead,'' Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eades said selling liquor could bring in much-needed tourist  
dollars and give the islanders a way to make a living from 
something other than the dwindling crab population. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Dize fears alcohol sales would force Smith Island to  
hire a police officer and raise taxes, which many older residents 
can't afford. Plus, there is the religious issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as strong alcohol, the Bible speaks strongly,'' Mrs.  
Dize said. ``We have been told it is wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Methodists came to the island in 1810 and the religion took hold  
because the islanders liked its fervent, direct appeal to God. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had some people end up as alcoholics,'' Mrs. Dize  
said. ``If he is open they can go right there and pick up some more 
and keep drinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two men staying at Eades' bed-and-breakfast this summer, while  
they rebuild the island's jetty, said it doesn't seem right that 
Eades can't sell beer. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they do it on the mainland, why not here? This is the state  
of Maryland,'' said engineer Steve Ganun. 
</P>
<P>
	Crane operator Bruce Walling said he'd enjoy coming by the store  
and having a cold one after work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is pretty bad,'' Walling said. ``This is 1999.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of existing homes surged to an all-time  
high in June as Americans, mindful of rising mortgage rates, rushed 
out to close deals. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Realtors said today that sales of  
existing single-family homes jumped 10.6 percent in June to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.53 million units, the highest 
level ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Existing-home sales were up in all parts of the country, the  
association said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When buyers saw interest rates moving up this spring they  
jumped off the fence and into the market to take advantage of 
excellent affordability condition before mortgage rates moved 
higher,'' said Sharon Millett, the association's president. 
</P>
<P>
	The big jump in sales in June followed two consecutive monthly  
declines. In May, existing-home sales fell to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 5 million units, a little worse than the 5.04 
million units the association previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	And, in April, sales dropped to 5.25 million units after hitting  
what was then an all-time high of 5.42 million units in March. 
</P>
<P>
	June's performance was better than projections by many analysts,  
who expected sales of 5.11 million units last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgage rates have been creeping up over the last couple of  
months. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 7.55 
percent in June, up from 7.15 percent in May, according to Freddie 
Mac, the mortgage company. The rate was 7 percent in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mortgage interest rates in June were at the highest level in  
two years, but we expect them to ease and trend downward during the 
second half of the year, helping to keep the market in record 
territory,'' said the association's chief economist, James Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some economists said they expect a slowdown in housing  
activity in the coming months. ``We believe that home sales have 
peaked,'' said Merrill Lynch economist Gerald Cohen. ``The backup 
in interest rates has caused a significant decline in mortgage 
applications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest gains in sales were in the Northeast, rising 11.1  
percent to an annual rate of 700,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
	The Midwest followed with a 10.9 percent increase to a rate of  
1.22 million units. Sales in the South rose 10.2 percent to a rate 
of 2.16 million, and in the West they went up 9.9 percent to a rate 
of 1.45 million units. 
</P>
<P>
	The association's report follows a government report last week  
that construction of new homes and apartments fell sharply in June 
to the lowest level in just over a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists blamed that performance on rising mortgage rates and  
a shortage of skilled workers and some building materials and 
suggested it was a sign that one of the economy's booming sectors 
could be cooling off. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the national median sales price for existing homes  
rose 4.3 percent to $137,000 in June over June 1998, the 
association said. The median is the point where half the homes sell 
for less and half sell for more.

<HEADLINE> Avid Outdoorsman Arrested After Naturalist Beheaded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PORTAL, Calif. (AP) -- Cary Stayner's friends didn't consider  
him a violent man. Until now, neither did the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, a motel handyman, was an avid outdoorsman who enjoyed  
hiking and sunbathing in the nude. With youthful and clean-cut good 
looks, the 37-year-old was relatively quiet and friendly, but 
considered somewhat of a loner. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those who knew him best worked with him at the Cedar  
Lodge or the adjacent restaurant, where he rented a room upstairs 
for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in this remote enclave on Yosemite's western doorstep are  
still shaking their heads at the news that he is accused of 
beheading a Yosemite National Park naturalist and is a suspect in 
the slayings of three sightseers who were last seen at the lodge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I'm shocked. To say the least,'' said Jim Houtz, who owns  
the Cedar Lodge restaurant and regularly tends bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends said Stayner would often go to beaches known for  
skinny-dipping and nude sunbathing. Lately, he had found a new spot 
in Yosemite where he could take off his clothes and catch some sun 
without any worries, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another popular destination for Stayner was a nudist colony in  
Sacramento County, the Laguna del Sol, where he was known to escape 
on his days off, and where he was taken into custody Saturday 
morning by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner attended Merced High School and worked as a window  
installer at an Atwater glass company after he graduated, according 
to his father, Delbert Stayner, who lives about 60 miles west of El 
Portal, in a small farm town outside Merced. 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1997, the Cedar Lodge hired Stayner. He was laid off  
Jan. 7 because of a slowdown in work, then rehired March 20. As a 
maintenance worker, he took care of mechanical and electrical 
breakdowns, and carried a radio so he could be contacted by the 
front desk should anyone ask for towels, an extra cot, or some 
other need. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner ate regularly at the restaurant, often twice a day for  
lunch and dinner. He wasn't considered a troublemaker, or violent 
in any way, by those who got to know him. His criminal record 
appears limited to drug charges, four of them filed in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Cedar Lodge workers recall Stayner being around when Carole  
Sund, 42, Juli Sund, 15, and Silvina Pelosso disappeared Feb. 15, 
even though he was out-of-work at the time. They don't remember 
whether he talked about that crime. Most could not fathom the 
possibility he had anything to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would have been the furthest of suspects in the locals'  
minds,'' said Kathy Hefner, a manager at the Cedar Lodge 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI questioned him during the Sund-Pelosso investigation but  
ruled him out as a suspect. They didn't return to him until shortly 
after Joie Ruth Armstrong, a naturalist for the Yosemite Institute, 
was found decapitated a few hundred feet from the employee home she 
shared with two other workers, who were away at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	James M. Maddock, special agent-in-charge of Sacramento, would  
not elaborate on why Stayner was dismissed as a suspect at the 
time, nor on how they were led to him in Armstrong's murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do look forward to the day when I can share the details of  
the investigations from start to finish,'' Maddock said.

<HEADLINE>  Armstrong Wins Tour de France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Lance Armstrong, even before he got sick, never  
imagined winning the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	But here he was, standing on the victory podium on the  
Champs-Elysees, listening to ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' after 
completing one of sports' most remarkable comebacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never expected to be here. Even in my first career,''  
Armstrong said, referring to his life before cancer. ``I never had 
plans for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong rode to victory in the Tour de France on Sunday less  
than three years after being diagnosed with testicular cancer that 
spread to his brain and lungs. Doctors gave him only about a 50 
percent chance of survival. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Texan, only the second American to win cycling's  
showcase race, dedicated his victory to cancer survivors around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it sends out a fantastic message,'' he said. ``We can  
return to what we were before -- and even better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's ride inspired a lot of fans, especially some  
Americans who came over to catch part of his thrilling ride. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been cycling all my life, and I just decided on Friday  
night to come over,'' said Michael Grotz of Park Ridge, N.J. ``With 
Armstrong coming back from cancer, it's amazing. Here's a guy who's 
winning and he deserves it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The finish, under brilliant skies, was a marked contrast to last  
year's final leg. The 1998 race ended in a drizzling rain after a 
huge drug scandal placed the entire sport under suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Armstrong was dogged by accusations in the French media  
that he used performance-enhancing drugs. Many people couldn't 
believe that a cyclist recovering from cancer could prevail in the 
brutal three-week event. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no proof, however. The sport's ruling body, which  
tests cyclists during the race, said the only drug Armstrong used 
was an approved prescription cream for saddle sores. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's 20th and final stage was won by Australia's Robbie  
McEwen. He edged Germany's Erik Zabel in a furious sprint. Silvio 
Martinelli of Italy was third. Armstrong was 86th -- in the 86th 
Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's final margin in the overall standings was 7 minutes,  
37 seconds, the same lead he had on Saturday. Alex Zulle finished 
second and Spain's Fernando Escartin was third. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other American to win the race was Greg LeMond, a  
three-time champion whose last victory was in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was diagnosed with cancer in 1996. After four rounds  
of chemotherapy and two operations -- one to remove a testicle and 
one for brain lesions -- he began his comeback early last year. His 
doctors say there is a tiny chance the cancer will return. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the keys to Armstrong's cycling victory was his ability  
to master the mountain climbs that had always given him trouble. 
After he easily won the first stage in the Alps, he became the 
prohibitive favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	The final stage was a fairly easy 89-mile ride from Arpajon up  
to Paris, and then past many of the city's grandest sights: the 
Louvre, the Tuileries Gardens with their giant summer ferris wheel, 
the arcaded Rue de Rivoli, the Place de la Concorde with its 
Egyptian obelisk, and then up the Champs-Elysees to the Arc de 
Triomphe for a loop that was repeated 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
	French national champion Francois Simon dyed his hair the  
red-white-and-blue of his jersey. And not only was Armstrong clad 
in the yellow shirt of the race's leader -- his wheel was yellow, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Armstrong was to lose that newly decorated wheel to a  
puncture, but his loyal teammates from the U.S. Postal Service 
helped him back to the pack. 
</P>
<P>
	For the host country, the race was a disaster. For the first  
time since 1926, a French cyclist failed to win a stage. 
</P>
<P>
	But Armstrong's victory could be a big boost for American  
cycling, much as the success of the U.S. soccer team in the Women's 
World Cup has inspired many in the United States. Although LeMond 
won the race, it was not with an American team. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-year-old U.S. Postal Service team was euphoric throughout  
the race. Early on, team managing director Mark Gorski compared an 
Armstrong victory to a team of French players winning the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory also will be quite lucrative.  
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's agent, Bill Stapleton, said the win could be worth  
$2.5 million from prize money and bonuses from sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there's the publicity: Armstrong begins a marathon  
round of TV talk show appearances later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to strike while the iron is hot,'' Stapleton said.

<HEADLINE> Instant Messaging Battle Heats Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- America Online and Microsoft are engaged  
in what could become a bitter tug-of-war over instant messaging as 
it fast becomes another cultural mainstay of Internet life. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle flared up last Thursday when Microsoft launched a  
service similar to AOL's Instant Messenger allowing users of its 
MSN network to send notes in real time to AOL subscribers. AOL, 
angered by what it considered trespassing in its private online 
community, retaliated by electronically blocking the rogue instant 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Microsoft has launched revised versions to get  
around the defenses constructed by AOL, which in turn put up new 
blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft argues that instant messages, like e-mail, should flow  
freely between online services for all to use, and that AOL's 
attitude violates the spirit of the Internet. Microsoft is being 
backed on this issue by major allies like Yahoo! who want to make 
sure members of their online communities can ``flash'' a note to 
any of the 80 million users of AOL's instant messaging services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine a world where we couldn't talk by telephone if we had  
different'' phone companies, said Deanna Sanford, lead product 
manager for MSN marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanford said her company will continue to post new versions of  
its software to elude AOL's defenses. A new version was posted 
early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL chief executive Steve Case downplayed the standoff later in  
the day as a ``squabble'' that could be resolved through talks, 
``not by Microsoft hacking into our network.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jousting is as much about bragging rights as dollars,  
analysts said, because little revenue is generated directly from 
instant messaging. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as Microsoft wants to maintain dominance in the operating  
systems market, AOL wants to control the messaging market. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is essentially a political battle,'' said Simon Hayward,  
research director for Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn. ``The issue 
is the way Microsoft went about doing this. AOL feels its turf has 
been stepped on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instant messaging initially caught on as a gossip tool at home  
and at the office, but has become a popular way to send comments 
more quickly and with even less formality than e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, because the notes have to be short, the business  
applications of instant messaging are limited. 
</P>
<P>
	Messaging services usually feature a ``buddy list'' that lets  
users know when friends or associates are logged onto the Internet. 
Messages appear in a box on a user's screen. 
</P>
<P>
	While AOL's instant messaging services, AIM and ICQ (short for  
``I seek you''), dominate the market, about 200,000 copies of 
Microsoft's messaging software were downloaded the first day it 
appeared on the company's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be more rounds back and forth,'' said Mark Levitt,  
research director with International Data Corp. in Framingham, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also said the fight could have a positive result if it  
speeds the way toward an industry standard. They noted that e-mail 
in its early days also was restricted. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, Prodigy Communications and others are also urging AOL to  
open up its instant messaging network. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL has said it favors the development of industry standards,  
but plans to block competitors until they are. An AOL official said 
Monday a letter has been sent to Microsoft asking to discuss the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL officials also say they're alarmed that MSN's Messenger  
Service asks AOL users to enter their user name and password before 
they can connect, raising privacy questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have it all over our screens: `Never give out your  
password,''' spokeswoman Ann Brackbill said.

<HEADLINE> Pioneering Feminist Journalist Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Donna Allen, a media critic, author, labor  
activist, pioneer feminist and founder of the Women's Institute on 
Freedom of the Press, has died of a heart attack. She was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, a Washington resident, died July 19 at a hospital  
relatives declined to name, said her daughter, Martha Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was active all the way to the end, which is the way she  
wanted it,'' Allen's daughter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Petoskey, Mich., Allen helped organize farm workers in  
California and wrote and edited labor publications for the American 
Federation of Labor from her home in Washington during the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen received a bachelor's degree in economics from Duke  
University in 1943, a master's degree in economics from the 
University of Chicago in 1953 and a doctorate in history from 
Howard University in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	She opposed nuclear weapons and the Vietnam War as a founding  
member of the Women Strike for Peace, and worked for the National 
Committee to Abolish the House Un-American Activities Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen and two others were cited for contempt of Congress for  
refusing to testify during a closed-door hearing of the House 
Un-American Activities Committee in 1965. Committee members had 
questioned why she and other activists had invited a pacifist 
Japanese law school dean to lecture in the United States in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	The three had demanded an open hearing. Their convictions later  
were overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1997 article, Allen wrote that the number of females using  
the Internet had experienced a recent surge and women maintained 
thousands of sites on the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women worldwide are therefore building their own  
communications systems, to speak their information for 
themselves,'' she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press describes itself  
as a nonprofit, tax-exempt research, education, networking and 
publishing organization, founded 27 years ago to increase 
communication among women and to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Martha Allen said the group will continue.

<HEADLINE> Big West Expected To Break Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The Big West Conference is expected to  
announce its breakup as early as this week, which would leave five 
of its 12 schools looking for a new league. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-division conference would become a one-division league  
that includes only California schools that do not play football, 
according to New Mexico State president William Conroy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The California schools have indicated they're interested in  
going off on their own with a California conference. They might add 
a few other California schools,'' Conroy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The six schools that would remain in the league currently make  
up the conference's Western Division. It includes UC Irvine, Cal 
State Fullerton, Long Beach State, UC Santa Barbara, Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo and Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	That would leave New Mexico State, Idaho, Boise State, Utah  
State and North Texas -- the conference's Eastern Division teams 
along with Nevada -- looking for another league. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakup came about following the realignment of the Western  
Athletic Conference. The WAC announced last month that Nevada would 
be leaving the Big West and joining the conference next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nevada's departure has put the Big West schools in a difficult  
situation,'' Conroy said after meeting with the presidents of Big 
West schools in Salt Lake City. ``It's hard to tell how all these 
conferences are going to end up two years from now.''

<HEADLINE> Enfeebled Russian Cinema on Display </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- In Vladimir Khotinenko's latest film, a soft  
rumble accompanies the sex scenes -- the sound of portable heaters 
brought in to warm the unclad actors during wintertime shooting 
because the studio, one of Russia's largest, couldn't pay its 
energy bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like a comedy. Those heaters sounded like an  
airplane,'' said Khotinenko, among the cream of Russia's film 
industry and one of only two Russian directors chosen to 
participate in this month's 21st Moscow International Film 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, money problems mean his film, ``Strastnoy Boulevard,'' may  
barely be ready for its Tuesday premiere. 
</P>
<P>
	Khotinenko's hardships, and those of the bedraggled festival,  
reflect the sorry state of Russia's movie industry. Lack of cash is 
their most obvious problem; they're also hobbled by a surge in 
piracy, foreign competition and the collapse of the centralized 
Soviet distribution system. 
</P>
<P>
	Soviet directors artfully survived Communist censorship,  
producing poignant, sometimes piercing commentaries on love and 
war. Some critics even credit daring, perestroika-era films -- 
including ``Repentance'' and ``Little Vera'' -- with helping bring 
down the Soviet Union, by laying bare its faults and giving voice 
to viewers' fears and frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
	But those filmmakers owed their survival to funding from the  
same government that sought to restrict them. Generous state 
support for the arts has now evaporated, and private sponsors are 
scarce in a country that has been in economic decline throughout 
this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Russian adolescents have never been to a movie theater.  
That's partly because they cannot afford the $4 ticket. The average 
salary in Russia is estimated at $50 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is also because of an entrenched pirate industry, which  
sells videos of Hollywood films for about $2 sometimes before 
they're even released in U.S. theaters. ``Star Wars: The Phantom 
Menace'' is premiering in Russia at the Moscow Film Festival -- but 
it's been available on video since early this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood, which complains its studios lose about $300 million  
annually to piracy in Russia, boycotted the Moscow Film Festival in 
the early 1990s in protest. Yet piracy is even more devastating for 
Russian films, for whom the domestic market is the key chance to 
make money. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian filmmakers also cannot compete with the allure of  
foreign films. After years of being denied access to many Western 
movies, Russian viewers are now devouring them, especially those 
with expensive special effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Editing Khotinenko's film last summer took longer than planned  
because the sweltering cutting room had no air-conditioning and the 
machinery kept overheating. He had to abandon plans for an original 
score because he couldn't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
	A few Russian directors are prospering, notably Nikita  
Mikhalkov, who won an Oscar in 1994 for Best Foreign Film with 
``Burnt by the Sun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following that success, Mikhalkov rounded up $40 million -- a  
heart-stopping sum in Russian film circles -- to make his latest 
movie, ``The Barber of Siberia.'' He even persuaded the government 
to pitch in several million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The film opened this spring in Russia to mixed reviews, and it's  
unclear whether box office receipts at home will justify its huge 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Mikhalkov may be hoping revenues outside Russia will take up the  
slack. Russian critics complain the film aims too blatantly at 
Western audiences, with British actors Julia Ormond and Richard 
Harris in starring roles and 70 percent of the dialogue in English.

<P>
	But Mikhalkov is a vocal and popular nationalist who shows no  
sign of forgetting the Russian viewer. He is president of the 
Moscow Film Festival -- and has hinted he could run for president of 
the country. At the festival's opening, Prime Minister Sergei 
Stepashin joined Mikhalkov on stage and playfully saluted him. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Mikhalkov's tutelage, the festival isn't the topnotch  
forum its organizers wish it were. 
</P>
<P>
	The last festival, in 1997, featured Robert de Niro and entries  
from major foreign studios. This year, many stars snubbed the 
invitation, and festival planning was hampered by funding delays 
from the Moscow government. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitaly Wolf, a Russian culture critic, called this year's film  
entries ``second- and third-rate'' films that couldn't make it into 
other festivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry's troubles have stirred up some unsettling  
questions. One panel discussion at the film festival asked why 
moviemakers thrived artistically under totalitarianism but failed 
when they won freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not advanced enough in capitalism to achieve a balance  
between commercial and artistic film,'' Wolf said.

                          *Martin Agronsky    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Martin Agronsky, a voice from radio's golden  
age and a pioneer in television who helped pioneer the ``talking 
heads'' news format, died Sunday of heart failure. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Agronsky began in newspaper journalism, became a war  
correspondent on radio and was a Washington correspondent, foreign 
correspondent and commentator for U.S. television from 1943 until 
he retired in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Agronsky's syndicated television program, ``Agronsky &AMP;  
Company,'' ended in early 1988 after an 18-year run. It was the 
nation's top-ranked public affairs program when Agronsky retired. 
</P>
<P>
	The show, which began as a newscast on Washington's WTOP-TV, now  
WUSA-TV, was considered the first to use the informal format of 
reporters talking among themselves rather than interviewing 
newsmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Agronsky's first job was in 1936 as general assignment reporter  
for the Palestine Post, now the Jerusalem Post. Before he retired, 
he had worked for all three major networks and PBS. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by three daughters and two sons.

 *Shoukry Ayyad    	
</P>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Shoukry Ayyad, one of the Arab world's most  
respected poetry critics, died Friday of a heart attack. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Ayyad wrote 20 books on Arabic poetry, language and theater,  
including ``The Hero in Literature and Fables,'' ``Music of 
Poetry'' and ``Language and Creativity.'' He published a regular 
literary column for a newspaper, Al-Ahram. 
</P>
<P>
	Ayyad also wrote a volume of poetry and the novel, ``Heavenly  
Bird.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Egyptian government gave him the state Literary Award, but  
denied him a license to publish a monthly literary magazine. He 
appealed in vain to President Hosni Mubarak, and then published 
collections of articles in book form.

<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Henry Walter Brosin, a former president of  
the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, the American 
Psychiatric Association and the American College of Psychiatrists, 
died July 3. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Brosin had been a resident of Tucson since 1969, when he was  
named a professor of psychiatry at the University of Arizona 
Medical School. He helped organize its department of psychiatry, 
retiring from the school in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Brosin studied psychiatry at the Chicago Institute and was  
associated with the University of Chicago. From 1950 to 1969 he was 
on the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh, and was chairman of 
the department of psychiatry and director of the Western 
Psychiatric Institute and Clinics.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Denis de Coteau, who served as music  
director for the San Francisco Ballet for 23 years, died Friday of 
cancer. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	De Coteau joined the company in 1968 as assistant conductor. In  
recent years, the New York City native had served as the San 
Francisco Ballet's Music Director Emeritus. He also was conductor 
emeritus at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. 
</P>
<P>
	De Coteau was credited with helping lead the ballet company to  
international success under artistic director Helgi Tomasson.

	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Edward C. Lambert, the founder of the  
University of Missouri's student television station, died Sunday. 
He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Lambert created KOMU-TV in 1953 as a way to train students in  
broadcast reporting and production. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the station's first general manager and served for more  
than 20 years as the moderator of Missouri Forum, a public affairs 
show broadcast on KOMU and on radio stations around the state.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Barbara Raskin, author of feminist novels  
about women in middle age, most notably ``Hot Flashes,'' died 
Friday of complications following surgery for vascular disease. She 
was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Published two decades after the women's movement kicked into  
gear, ``Hot Flashes'' of 1987 was considered an important work for 
its celebration of female friendship. 
</P>
<P>
	The book chronicles three women who gather to mourn the death of  
a writer friend, who had left behind a journal describing her 
despair when her husband left for a younger woman. The friends 
salvage the writer's unfinished autobiographical novel, written for 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hot Flasthes'' was on The New York Times bestsellers list for  
four months and was praised for capturing the feelings of a 
generation of well-educated women who raised families while their 
husbands pursued careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Raskin's other books include ``The National Anthem,'' a look  
at Washington during the Watergate investigation, ``Loose Ends'' 
and ``Out of Order.'' She received a fiction award from the 
National Endowment for the Arts in 1982.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- William Targ, a former editor who agreed to  
publish Mario Puzo's ``The Godfather'' sight unseen, died Thursday. 
He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Targ worked for G.P. Putnam's Sons. He retired in 1978.  
</P>
<P>
	He worked with Simone de Beauvoir, Ashley Montagu and Lin  
Yutang, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1968, Targ bought ``The Godfather'' for a $5,000 advance on  
the strength of an oral presentation. Two other publishers had 
already turned down the work, which went on to become the most 
profitable novel published by Putnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Targ, born in Chicago to parents who had emigrated from Russia,  
dropped out of high school after losing interest in all courses but 
English and print shop, in which he learned to set type by hand. He 
bought books second hand because he refused to borrow from 
libraries. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 22, he opened his own book shop and began piecing  
together what would become a collection of thousands of rare books.

<HEADLINE> Old, Young Win Gold in Pan Am Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- At 21 years old, sprinter Bernard  
Williams still has plenty of spring in his legs. 
</P>
<P>
	At 39, Johnny Gray showed he still has something left, too.  
</P>
<P>
	The two U.S. runners at the opposite end of the track and field  
age spectrum both earned gold medals Sunday at the Pan American 
Games as Princess Anne watched in a sold-out stadium on a perfect, 
cloudless evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, whose sole claim to fame had been winning the national  
junior college championship this year, sped to a victory in the 100 
meters, beating a field that lacked Canadian star Donovan Bailey, 
but included teammate Tim Harden, the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this shows that we have young athletes that are  
capable of running and winning titles,'' said Williams, who signed 
with Florida after competing at Barton County (Kansas) Community 
College. ``Each year I'm trying to get a title, and that's like a 
stepping stone to the Olympics. That is my ultimate goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray knows about the Olympics. He already has competed in four  
and is hoping to make it five next year in Sydney. The man younger 
runners call ``Mr. Gray'' won the 800, nipping Cuba's Norberto 
Tellez in a thrilling stretch run. 
</P>
<P>
	His time of 1:45.38 was fairly ordinary, but he did win. And the  
guy is 39, after all. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're young, all you think about is time,'' said Gray, a  
Los Angeles native who trains in Santa Monica, Calif. ``Throughout 
the years, I have found out winning is more important. It's not the 
only thing. I don't want all those youngsters reading that Johnny 
Gray says winning is the only thing. But you do compete to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray competed quite well on this night. He and Tellez, 27, ran  
stride for stride down the straightaway and at the last instant, 
Gray leaned to beat the Cuban by .02 seconds. Although the judges 
took a couple of minutes to determine the winner, Gray set out on 
his victory lap anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``With my experience, you take the victory lap and they'll give  
it to you,'' he said with a sly grin. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray has been around so long he has a 16-year-old son. That's  
only three years younger than one of Gray's teammates, Angela 
Williams, the silver medalist in the women's 100. 
</P>
<P>
	``My 16-year-old is a basketball player. All he can do is  
dribble and shoot 3-pointers,'' Gray said. ``I tell him that real 
men run the 800 meters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Williams ran 10.08, just .02 off the Games record, to  
become the first American to win the Pan Ams 100 since Lee McRae in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time,'' Williams said. ``That meant a lot to me, to  
work hard and get that gold medal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harden, who has a personal best of 9.92, couldn't overcome a  
slow start and finished fourth in 10.19. 
</P>
<P>
	The victories by Gray and Williams came the day after U.S. men's  
track coach Ralph Lindeman, 48, was hospitalized with chest pains. 
He was being held for observation Sunday at Victoria Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's Ivan Pedroso shook off fouls on his first two jumps -- one  
more and he would have been out of the competition -- to win the 
long jump with a leap of 28 feet, the third best jump in the world 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In other men's events, Chris Huffins and Daniel Steele of the  
United States finished 1-2 in the decathlon, Huffins scoring 8,170 
points and Steele 8,070, and Danny McCray of the United States won 
the silver medal in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele's total qualified him for the world championships next  
month. Huffins, a two-time U.S. champion, had qualified earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Angela Williams, who won the NCAA championship for Southern  
California in June, aggravated her left hamstring just before the 
race and was icing it afterward as she sat on the ground chatting 
with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trainer told me not to run,'' she said. ``But I did not  
come this far, this is my last competition of the season, I was 
going to run. I have a lot of pride. I did not want to be the one 
where they say the U.S. stepped out of the race. Even though it was 
legitimate, that's not me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra Sturrup, who trains with U.S. star Marion Jones in  
Raleigh, N.C., beat Williams to give the Bahamas its first-ever 
gold in Pan Ams track. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamaica's Greg Haughton won the men's 400 with a season-best of  
44.59, Vanderlei Lima of Brazil earned the gold in the marathon at 
2:17:20, and Joel Bourgeois of Canada won the 3,000 steeplechase in 
8:35.03. 
</P>
<P>
	In women's events, Osleidys Menedez of Cuba set a Pan Ams record  
in winning the javelin at 216-0, Letitia Vriesde of Surinam won the 
800 in 1:59.095, and Mexico's Ana Guevera took the 400 in 50.91. 
Argentina's Alejandra Garcia won the first pole vault competition 
for women, clearing 14-1 1/4.

<HEADLINE> IOC Hires Ad Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee, looking to  
strengthen its image for the 2000 Sydney Games, hired an 
advertising agency Monday to develop spots that will focus on 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads by the Los Angeles firm TBWA/Chiat Day will begin  
running in January in TV, print and online outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is coming off the worst scandal in the history of the  
games in which six of its members were expelled and four resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	However, IOC marketing director Michael Payne said the  
advertising plans were in place before the scandal broke. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has nothing to do with earlier issues of this year,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne did not say how much the ad campaign cost but added that  
reports of $150 million are not far off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indirectly, it will be of that value or even greater,'' he  
said. ``But we're not spending any money buying air time. It will 
be a very affordable investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic media outlets, in the United States and elsewhere, will  
not be charging the IOC additional fees to run the promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``In addition to the rights fee they pay, a certain amount of  
promotional time was included,'' Payne said.

<HEADLINE> Rape Suspect Eludes Capture in Mich. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THETFORD TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- A man suspected of raping two  
girls and leaving them for dead along a bike path escaped arrest 
Monday by grabbing a sheriff's deputy's gun and shooting at 
officers, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the officers was hit, but police said they might have  
wounded the suspect, Jack Duane Hall, 34. 
</P>
<P>
	For most of the day, police searched the forested area for Hall.  
More than 60 officers, some wearing camouflage clothing and makeup 
with assault rifles strapped to their backs, rode all-terrain 
vehicles. They were helped by dogs and a helicopter with 
heat-seeking gear. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said Hall was familiar with the terrain and might have  
escaped. Later, authorities began searching a wider area. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall was wanted in the rape of two girls, ages 8 and 14, who  
were found bruised and bleeding Saturday in the farming community 
about 55 miles north of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls told authorities a man approached them as they walked  
along the bike path and threatened them with a knife. He raped both 
girls, handcuffed one, then beat and choked them until they lost 
consciousness, Sheriff Robert Pickell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He may have thought they were dead. It appears he wanted them  
dead,'' Pickell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were released from a hospital Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Pickell said investigators linked the suspect to the attacks  
from a tip. He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	When officers went to the home of the man's mother Monday, he  
attacked a sheriff's deputy, Pickell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He jumped from the garage and tried to turn the barrel toward  
her,'' the sheriff said. ``She was fighting for her life. She did 
everything right. Then he turned on the two detectives and they 
returned fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Woods, who lives nearby, said he has known Hall for about  
six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been to the house and played with my kids,'' said Woods,  
32. ``It's crazy. He's someone you'd never suspect.''

<HEADLINE> Boxer Fernando Vargas Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- Junior middleweight boxing champion  
Fernando Vargas was arrested for investigation of assault with a 
deadly weapon and burglary, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas, 21, of Oxnard, Calif., was arrested with four other men  
shortly after 6 a.m. Sunday in Summerland, said Santa Barbara 
County sheriff's Sgt. Bill Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas successfully defended his International Boxing Federation  
junior middleweight title July 17 in a bout with Raul Marquez in 
Nevada. He earned $500,000 with the win, his 17th straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe Vargas and the others entered a man's home  
and attacked him. The victim, whose name was withheld, suffered 
minor injuries but did not require hospitalization, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Summerland is an unincorporated county area.  
</P>
<P>
	Vargas and the other men, ages 20 to 28, were released after  
posting bail of $10,000 each, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to assault and burglary, they were also booked for  
investigation of conspiracy to commit a crime. Authorities declined 
to reveal what type of weapon was used in the attack, but said it 
was not a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	An arraignment for Vargas has been scheduled for Aug. 23.  
</P>
<P>
	Vargas wants to unify the junior middleweight division and hopes  
to fight undefeated welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of the 1996 U.S. Olympic boxing team, he emerged as a  
potential star in the sport in December 1998 when he stopped 
veteran Yory Boy Campas of Mexico to win the IBF junior 
middleweight championship. He won the bout only five days after his 
21st birthday and in his 15th professional fight.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars' Top Pick Holding Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The Jacksonville Jaguars are facing a  
rookie holdout for the first time in their five-year history and 
team officials say if it begins, it could be a long one. 
</P>
<P>
	Executive vice president Michael Huyghue said Monday that the  
Jaguars and first-round draft pick Fernando Bryant, a cornerback 
from Alabama, are no closer to agreeing on a deal than they were 
when negotiations began two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is Bryant's wish for a four-year deal and the Jaguars  
insistence that the contract run for five seasons. Players report 
to training camp Thursday. Huyghue said there have been no recent 
shifts in the negotiations, but he is still hoping for a 
last-minute deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``But once you get to a holdout situation, then it gets a lot  
more difficult to capitulate,'' Huyghue said. ``You don't want to 
set a tone for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the Jaguars six first-round draft picks -- they had two in  
1995 and 1998 -- only one has missed any portion of training camp. 
That was Renaldo Wynn in 1997, and Huyghue insists he was signed 
before camp began and wouldn't have missed a minute were it not for 
a late airline flight on the first day of camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Money doesn't appear to be an issue in the Bryant negotiation.  
Because of the amount of money left in their rookie salary cap 
pool, the Jaguars seem locked in to offering the 26th overall pick 
about $840,000 for his first season and a signing bonus in the 
range of $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth year is the sticking point. The Jaguars want it as a  
hedge against free agency. Bryant doesn't want it because he can 
make bigger money more quickly if he has a successful first three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the player is a good player, he's going to be rewarded  
anyway,'' Huyghue said. ``That's always been our philosophy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant's agent, Jimmy Sexton, refused comment on the  
negotiations. He did say there was nothing new as of Monday.

<HEADLINE> Handyman Arrested in Yosemite Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A motel handyman questioned but ruled  
out as a suspect in the slayings of three Yosemite sightseers has 
now been linked to those crimes after his arrest in the beheading 
of a woman who worked in the national park. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest Saturday of Cary Stayner even had one FBI agent  
wondering if the death of 26-year-old naturalist Joie Ruth 
Armstrong could have been prevented. 
</P>
<P>
	``I struggled with that issue for the last 24 hours and I  
continue to do so,'' James M. Maddock, FBI special agent-in-charge 
of Sacramento, said Sunday. ``I'm confident we've done everything 
that reasonably could have been done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's decapitated body was found Thursday near her  
Yosemite housing. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, 37, was arrested Saturday at a nudist colony and is  
scheduled be arraigned today on a charge of murder in a national 
park, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddock said Stayner also is believed to have played a role in  
the killings of Carole Sund, her daughter Juli, and family friend 
Silvina Pelosso of Argentina. The three were last seen alive at a 
lodge in El Portal where Stayner worked as a maintenance man. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have developed specific information linking Stayner to the  
Sund-Pelosso murders,'' Maddock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner previously was questioned in the slayings but ruled out  
as a suspect, Maddock said. He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators in that case had focused on a loose-knit band of  
ex-cons in Modesto who have histories of sex and drug offenses. 
Authorities had said they were confident that most of those 
responsible in the sightseer killings were already in custody on 
unrelated charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddock said there is no evidence linking Stayner to the other  
people who have come under scrutiny, but in light of the new 
development, the FBI will re-evaluating the possible roles of those 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking at whether (Stayner) is solely responsible (for  
the sightseers murders) or if others are involved,'' Maddock said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect, who grew up in California's mostly rural Central  
Valley region, has a family history peppered with tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	His younger brother Steven was kidnapped at age 7 in 1972 and  
raised for seven years by his abductor, who sexually abused him. In 
1980, the boy escaped, and his story inspired headlines nationwide 
and a television miniseries. But in 1989 he died at age 24 in a 
hit-and-run motorcycle accident. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, an uncle, Jesse Stayner, was found shot to death in his  
Merced County home. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner was last seen Thursday night by friends and  
coworkers at the Cedar Lodge. He was taken into custody by federal 
authorities Saturday morning at a nudist colony in Wilton, near 
Sacramento, after a person recognized him from news reports and 
called authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Armstrong's body was discovered a few hundred yards from the  
park housing she shared with a man and woman, who were away at the 
time. A park official who spoke on the condition of anonymity told 
The Associated Press the woman had been decapitated. 
</P>
<P>
	She was last seen alive Wednesday at the park offices of  
Yosemite Institute, where she worked. The institute's main offices 
are in El Portal -- on the outskirts of Yosemite -- and the 
organization has held conferences at the Cedar Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
	El Portal is also the town where the victims in the previous  
slayings were last seen alive in February during a sightseeing 
trip. The three women had stayed at the Cedar Lodge, where Stayner 
has rented a room above the restaurant for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hired there in August 1997 and was laid off in January of  
this year because of a slowdown in business. 
</P>
<P>
	He was rehired March 20, a day after Mrs. Sund's and Silvina's  
bodies were found in the trunk of their rental car. Juli's body was 
later found hidden off a lightly traveled highway. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents of Carole Sund, Carole and Francis Carrington, were  
at the FBI's news conference Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy that it looks like maybe the case is over,''  
Carole Carrington said after the press conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It brings some closure, no question,'' her husband said.

<HEADLINE> Hornets Sign Top Choice Baron Davis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- The Charlotte Hornets signed first-round draft  
pick Baron Davis to a contract on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not released.  
</P>
<P>
	Davis, 20, the third overall pick in the 1999 NBA draft, played  
point guard at UCLA and turned pro after his sophomore season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2, 210-pounder is known as a physical, aggressive  
player. He returned from a knee surgery suffered at the end of his 
freshman season to lead the team in scoring, assists and steals 
last season. He averaged 13.6 points and 5.1 assists in 59 games. 
</P>
<P>
	He played for the Hornets' summer league entry in the Atlanta  
Summer Shootout earlier this month, averaging 10.7 points, 4.7 
assists, 1.7 steals and 35.7 minutes in three starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to have our first-round draft pick signed,'' said  
Bob Bass, the Hornets' executive vice president of basketball 
operations. ``We were very excited about his play in Atlanta and 
look forward to seeing him at training camp in October.''

<HEADLINE> Bausch &AMP; Lomb To Sell Lab Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Bausch &AMP; Lomb, completing its refocus on  
its eye care business, is selling Charles River Laboratories, which 
breeds rodents for research, to the investment group Global Health 
Care Partners. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale announced Monday is for $400 million cash and a $43  
million promissory note. The company put the division up for sale 
early this year and it is the last of the eye-care company's 
non-strategic businesses to be sold. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sale of Charles River Laboratories completes our strategic  
transformation to a dedicated technology-based health care company 
for the eye,'' said Bausch &AMP; Lomb chairman and CEO William 
Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Bausch &AMP; Lomb announced the sale of its  
Miracle Ear hearing aid business to Amplifon SpA of Italy for an 
undisclosed sum. In April, the company sold its sunglasses business 
that included the Ray-Ban brand for $640 million to Italy's 
Luxottica Group SpA, owner of the LensCrafters retail chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles River Laboratories was acquired by Bausch &AMP; Lomb in  
1984. The sale is expected to be completed in September. 
</P>
<P>
	With facilities in 18 countries, Charles River's 2,200 employees  
specially breed rats, mice and other rodents for biomedical 
research. The Wilmington, Mass.-based company's 1998 revenues were 
$240 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Health Care Partners is a unit of DLJ Merchant Banking, a  
private equity fund of the New York-based investment banking firm 
of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, Bausch &AMP; Lomb announced its earnings excluding  
onetime items rose 25 percent to $47.1 million, or 80 cents a 
share, in the second quarter ended June 26 on strong sales of 
disposable and replacement contact lenses and pharmaceuticals. It 
earned $37.6 million, or 66 cents per share, in the quarter a year 
ago before onetime items. 
</P>
<P>
	That was three cents a share higher than the 77 cents a share  
that analysts surveyed by First Call had expected. In trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange, Bausch &AMP; Lomb rose $3.62 1/2 a share to 
$73.43 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Including onetime gains on the sunglass business sale, net  
income for the quarter was $173.4 million, or $2.94 a share, up 
from $55.3 million, or 98 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $453.3 million from $408.4 million a year ago.  
</P>
<P>
	Bausch &AMP; Lomb's new line of SofLens66 and PureVision contact  
lenses helped boost contact-lens sales 8 percent in the quarter, 
while sales of lens-care products grew 7 percent on strong foreign 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmaceutical sales rose 24 percent as a result of price  
increases in non-ophthalmic generic products, while surgical 
products sales increased 11 percent over last year, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months, the company earned $195.8 million, or  
$3.34 a share, including gains versus $32 million, or 58 cents per 
share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $843.2 million from $765.9 million a year  
earlier.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Unveils $10M Ad Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Steve  
Forbes, in a new set of radio and television ads, presents warm 
testimonials from his family and promises to appoint anti-abortion 
judges if sent to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The advertisements are the latest installment in a $10 million  
summer media campaign that is increasingly focused on Iowa and New 
Hampshire, two early voting states in the 2000 primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	A millionaire businessman, Forbes is the only presidential  
candidate with a major ad campaign under way. 
</P>
<P>
	The TV ads are designed to introduce Forbes as a family man in  
light of internal polls that suggest voters know little about his 
personal life, campaign officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife and I of 27 years have five daughters,'' Forbes said  
in the black-and-white opening of one TV ad. His daughters take 
their turns, calling him a ``wonderful role model,'' who is ``so 
optimistic'' and ``incredibly strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Sabina, calls Forbes ``extremely honest.''  
</P>
<P>
	``When I see our family in the future -- in the White House  
hopefully -- I don't think any problems or challenges would be too 
... great for us,'' says daughter Moira in one TV ad. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio ads set for broadcast in Iowa are more political.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any judge I appoint for life will be pro-life,'' Forbes says  
in one spot. 
</P>
<P>
	He alludes to the GOP front-runner, George W. Bush, who has said  
he would not require judges to be anti-abortion. Without mentioning 
the Texas governor or other rivals by name, Forbes said, ``Some of 
the politicians who are running for president won't tell you what 
kind of judges they would appoint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another radio ad, Forbes urges supporters to help him win the  
Iowa straw vote in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes began his media campaign in early June, producing ads  
that attempted to cast him in a presidential light as he discussed 
national policy. Those ads, which ran nationwide, will be phased 
out, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new TV ads will air in New Hampshire and Iowa. The radio ads  
will run only in Iowa.

<HEADLINE> Autopsy: Tertyshny Bled to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KELOWNA, British Columbia (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers defenseman  
Dimitri Tertyshny bled to death after falling off a boat and being 
cut by the propeller, according to autopsy results released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tertyshny fell from the boat in Okanagan Lake on Friday night  
and was run over by the propeller, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The coroner said the propeller cut the player's throat, severing  
veins and arteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Tertyshny, 22, was in the boat with Francis Belanger and Mikhail  
Chernov, who play for the Philadelphia Phantoms, the Flyers' AHL 
affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said a 22-year-old Kelowna woman was also in the boat.  
</P>
<P>
	Tertyshny was not wearing life jacket, according to police.  
</P>
<P>
	Alcohol was consumed by the boating party, but Belanger, who was  
operating the boat, was not legally impaired, police said following 
the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven Flyers and Phantom players were in Kelowna for a  
power-skating clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	Tertyshny had two goals and eight assists in 62 games in  
1998-99, his rookie season. He was drafted by the Flyers in the 
sixth round in 1995, but continued to play in his home town of 
Chelyabinsk, Russia, until joining the team last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers are planning a memorial service for Tertyshny.  
</P>
<P>
	Tertyshny was under contract with the Flyers for the following  
season, but assistant coach Jim McCrossin couldn't say what 
financial arrangements will be made to help Tertyshny's wife, 
Pauline, who is four months pregnant and still lives in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other Flyer players have died while under contract, and the  
organization has been good to their families,'' McCrossin said. 
``Dimitri's family will be looked after.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Releases New Windows Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft on Monday sent a select group of  
computer and software manufacturers the first test version of the 
planned successor to its Windows 98 operating system, a program 
code-named ``Millennium'' that's scheduled for release next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Windows 98, which Microsoft targeted for both home and  
business use, Millennium is aimed solely at the consumer and home 
market. Microsoft's strategy is to capture the business segment -- 
from small business applications to the largest corporate networks 
-- with its new Windows 2000 operating system, which it hopes to 
ship by the end of December. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Sanford, group product manager for Microsoft's Consumer  
Windows Division, said Millennium will try to soothe the primary 
gripe of Windows users: that it's just too complicated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Millennium is the first step in the process of attaining these  
goals, in really simplifying the home computer experience,'' 
Sanford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft originally planned to bring out a consumer version of  
Windows 2000, a high-powered operating system built on a different 
code base than Windows 98. But in April, Microsoft President Steve 
Ballmer announced that one more generation of Windows 98 would be 
made, one that would link personal computers to the vast new array 
of digital devices appearing in homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballmer said Microsoft eventually plans a consumer operating  
system based on Windows 2000, but probably not before 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer computer market has evolved in a different  
direction from business, with home users wanting inexpensive 
machines that nevertheless can handle rich graphics for games, 
high-quality audio, Internet browsing, and have the capacity to 
link with other computers, stereos, televisions and various 
electronic gadgets around the house. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballmer has said computer manufacturers have asked Microsoft for  
a version of Windows that can do all that, but still be based on 
standard technology so it will work with existing computer 
components that have fallen drastically in price. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether a new version of Windows likewise will drop its price is  
an open question. Sanford said no price has been set for Millennium 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``pre-beta'' version of Millennium being released Monday is  
just the framework for the program, with computer makers and 
software vendors being asked to evaluate it from a technical 
standpoint. Sanford said it's too early to say what particular 
features the new program will have. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really focusing on the underlying technology, the core  
plumbing and piping of the system,'' Sanford said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said one thing being strongly considered is dropping  
the code that supports MS-DOS, the 1980s-vintage operating system 
that made Microsoft's fortune. Although eliminating such support 
would prevent Windows from running old software, it would 
drastically improve performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is necessary for us to evaluate the pieces of legacy code  
currently in Windows and determine what, if any value they offer 
consumers,'' Sanford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Sanford would not give specifics, he did outline broad  
goals for Millennium: 
</P>
<P>
	--Support for digital media and entertainment. The popularity of  
music and video, digital photography and super-realistic games has 
exploded, and the program will let users take full advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	--Easy connection to the Internet.  
</P>
<P>
	--Home networking. Millennium will simplify connecting multiple  
computers in the home to share data and an Internet connection, and 
provide the means for connecting different ``intelligent'' devices. 
</P>
<P>
	--A notion called ``It Just Works.'' The idea is that from the  
moment a computer is turned on, it should perform without baffling 
or frustrating the user. Millennium would be able to diagnosis its 
problems and ``heal'' itself, run new hardware or software simply 
and automatically, and allow new users to operate a computer 
straight out of the box. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Microsoft gets the technical feedback from its testers, it  
will incorporate needed changes in future test versions, Sanford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Microsoft has not yet decided on a final name for the  
operating system once it's ready for sale.

<HEADLINE> Rivals Tackle Y2K Problem Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- While Delta Air Lines and its competitors spend  
their summer dueling over discount fares and fighting for frequent 
fliers, they're also teaming up to take on a common enemy -- the Y2K 
bug. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's major airlines still want to beat each other out of  
a buck. But they're also swapping tips to ensure each others' 
computer systems don't crash when the Year 2000 arrives. 
</P>
<P>
	They aren't alone. Rival banks, phone companies, hospitals,  
electric utilities and other industries have reached a similar 
conclusion -- there's little or no advantage to be gained from a 
competitor's Y2K catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
	``If one airline happens to have a (Y2K) problem ... the flying  
public is going to perceive the whole industry has a problem,'' 
said Walter Taylor, Atlanta-based Delta's vice president for 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 computer bug threatens computer programs that read  
dates using only two digits for the year. If computers read the 
year 00 as 1900 rather than 2000, they could spit out inaccurate 
data. 
</P>
<P>
	In worst-case scenarios, it's a problem that could shut down  
airline reservation systems, short-circuit bank transactions, cause 
telephone networks to crash and scramble credit reports. 
</P>
<P>
	So competitors are holding joint tests of their computer  
systems, sponsoring Y2K roundtables through their trade 
associations and pooling their money to pay consultants to target 
problem areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a lot of ways it's not altruism. It's a recognition of the  
fact that if the systems break down, everybody's going to be at 
risk,'' said John Koskinen, chairman of President Clinton's Council 
on Y2K Conversion. ``They all need to live to fight another day and 
the best way to do that is to work together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Johnson, a Bedminster, N.J.-based spokesman for AT&AMP;T Corp.,  
says the reason for the cooperation is simple: ``Corporate America 
is not stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T and BellSouth Corp. have been locked in a series of  
regulatory fights over the Baby Bells' efforts to offer 
long-distance service and AT&AMP;T's attempts to expand into local 
telephone markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But they recently put those differences aside to conduct tests  
together to ensure customers will be able to complete calls on New 
Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Each company set up labs to see how their phone switches would  
work when computer clocks were forwarded to Jan. 1, 2000. They 
tested local calls, long-distance calls, collect calls, 
calling-card calls, international calls and 911 calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just think the overall health of the industry is more  
important than fighting over customers at this moment,'' said Clay 
Owen, Year 2000 spokesman for BellSouth. 
</P>
<P>
	The cooperation hasn't been easy. BellSouth and AT&AMP;T spent  
months hashing out the details with their lawyers and contract 
negotiators before they could agree on what tests to conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	And some corporations remain skittish to share information,  
afraid they might run afoul of antitrust laws or be sued for giving 
Y2K advice that doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, President Clinton signed into law two measures aimed  
at calming those fears. One prohibits companies from suing each 
other over faulty advice unless they can prove intentional 
deception. 
</P>
<P>
	The other says trade associations can collect Y2K information  
from members and allows companies to share information directly 
without fear of antitrust sanctions. The exemption sunsets in July, 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still some lawyers giving what I call crummy legal  
advice,'' Koskinen said. ``They're saying the statute's fine but 
you can't get in any trouble if you don't say anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knowing many of their customers are edgy about possible Y2K  
disruptions, companies are getting together in part to reassure the 
public that things will be OK. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Clearing House, an association of nine New York  
banks, has been working to calm fears after focus groups showed 
people are worried that hype about the Y2K problem could induce 
panic. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things we're trying to do is not to get them to  
overreact. All these industries are working hard, they're 
prepared,'' said George Thomas, director of information systems for 
the banking group. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everybody's being so chummy when it comes to the Y2K bug,  
said Bruce Webster, a Dallas consultant who co-chairs the 
Washington, D.C.-based Year 2000 Group, an organization of 
professionals who work on Y2K issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth is, I think a lot of businesses hope their  
competitors have problems and may be counting on it,'' Webster 
said.

<HEADLINE> Big West Expected To Break Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The Big West Conference is expected to  
announce its breakup as early as this week, which would leave five 
of its 12 schools looking for a new league. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-division conference would become a one-division league  
that includes only California schools that do not play football, 
according to New Mexico State president William Conroy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The California schools have indicated they're interested in  
going off on their own with a California conference. They might add 
a few other California schools,'' Conroy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The six schools that would remain in the league currently make  
up the conference's Western Division. It includes UC Irvine, Cal 
State Fullerton, Long Beach State, UC Santa Barbara, Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo and Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	That would leave New Mexico State, Idaho, Boise State, Utah  
State and North Texas -- the conference's Eastern Division teams 
along with Nevada -- looking for another league. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakup came about following the realignment of the Western  
Athletic Conference. The WAC announced last month that Nevada would 
be leaving the Big West and joining the conference next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nevada's departure has put the Big West schools in a difficult  
situation,'' Conroy said after meeting with the presidents of Big 
West schools in Salt Lake City. ``It's hard to tell how all these 
conferences are going to end up two years from now.''

<HEADLINE> Lyons' Co-Defendant Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The last co-defendant in the federal case  
against the leader of one of the nation's largest black church 
organizations has been sentenced to 18 months of probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Brenda Harris, a former planner for the National Baptist  
Convention USA and the one-time mistress of the Rev. Henry Lyons, 
also was sentenced Monday to 75 hours of community service and 
fined $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so sorry that I allowed myself to become involved with a  
married man. I am so sorry that I broke the law,'' Ms. Harris told 
U.S. District Judge Henry Adams. ``And I am sorry that I let down a 
God I love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She pleaded guilty in April to misprision of a felony, which  
means she failed to inform police when a crime was being committed. 
As part of a deal with prosecutors, charges of money laundering and 
bank fraud were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Harris could have received six months in prison and a $5,000  
fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was able, through God's help to see where I was wrong,'' she  
said outside court. ``I hope that my life, from this point forward, 
will help other people not do what I did, not walk the way I 
walked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons was convicted in February on state racketeering and theft  
charges for bilking $4 million from companies doing business with 
the convention. He also was convicted of taking nearly $250,000 
from the Anti-Defamation League that was to help rebuild burned 
black churches. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons is serving 5 1/2 years in state prison. Last month, a federal  
judge sentenced him to four years and three months behind bars on 
bank fraud and tax evasion charges, but that term will be served 
concurrently with the state sentence.

<HEADLINE> Boston Housing Settles Bias Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Housing Authority has agreed to pay  
$1.5 million to settle allegations at least 13 blacks and Hispanics 
were harassed by other tenants because of their race. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged incidents took place between 1992 and 1996 at two  
housing projects in South Boston and Charlestown that were almost 
entirely white before the housing authority began desegregating 
them in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement, announced Monday, provides $650,000 for the 13  
plaintiffs, $500,000 for attorneys' fees, and $350,000 for other 
public housing tenants who come forward with valid claims of racial 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad it's over, and I hope this is a new beginning  
for some changes at the BHA,'' said one of the plaintiffs, Reina 
Rodriguez, 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, who lived in the Old Colony public housing  
development in South Boston until 1995, said white tenants 
repeatedly vandalized her car, shouted racist insults at her and 
her three children, and scrawled racist graffiti outside her door, 
with a drawing of a lynching and the words, ``We're going to kill 
all you niggers if you don't leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also said white tenants tied her door shut from the outside  
with a rope when she was nine months' pregnant. She said the 
housing authority repeatedly ignored her transfer requests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those of us at the housing authority embrace this settlement  
because it encompasses a significant number of initiatives we are 
already undertaking,'' said BHA Administrator Sandra Henriquez, who 
took over in 1996. ``We are committed to changing the culture of 
this public housing authority to one that embraces differences and 
welcomes everyone despite the color of skin, race, language spoken, 
gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability or age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the $1.5 million payment, the agreement called  
for the BHA to take specific steps, including: increasing police 
patrols to deter racial harassment; cracking down on racist 
graffiti; hiring two people to investigate civil rights complaints; 
providing civil rights training for employees and tenants; and 
keeping track of reports of racial bias. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope this will be a national model, not only in  
Massachusetts but across the country, for how housing authorities 
can protect tenants, and particularly minority tenants,'' U.S. 
Attorney Donald K. Stern said.

<HEADLINE> Slumping Indians Try To Regroup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Indians came home from a disastrous weekend  
in New York and immediately locked the door. 
</P>
<P>
	Having lost five straight games and nine of 10, Cleveland held a  
players-only meeting in their clubhouse Monday night before opening 
a three-game series against the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a chance to talk things over and kind of kick each other  
in the butt,'' Indians manager Mike Hargrove said. ``I don't know 
that that's what they did in this meeting, but I've got to assume 
that's what they talked about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians opened a six-game homestand having won just twice in  
11 games since the All-Star break. They've looked nothing like the 
team which dominated the AL during the first three months of the 
season, and on Saturday got bombed 21-1 by the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries have been a big part of Cleveland's problem. The  
Indians have only had their opening day lineup four times all year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cleveland did get a little healthier on Monday as reliever  
Steve Karsay was activated from the 15-day disabled list. To make 
room, the club designated Tom Candiotti for assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Karsay had been the club's most effective pitcher before going  
on the DL on July 3 with a pulled oblique muscle. He is 7-1 with a 
2.63 ERA in 37 appearances as the team's long reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	Candiotti, acquired earlier this month partly to fill Karsay's  
role and make spot starts, said he wasn't surprised he had been 
designated. The Indians have 10 days to trade, release or send him 
to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say it was like a big surprise,'' said Candiotti,  
who was rocked by the Yankees in a start Friday night and again in 
a relief stint Saturday. ``I kind of had a weird role here where I 
haven't been a starter or a reliever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Candiotti is unsure what he'll do if the Indians decide to send  
him to Triple-A Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I would really go,'' said Candiotti, who is  
1-1 with a 11.05 ERA in seven appearances with Cleveland. ``We'll 
make that decision down the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their recent slide, the Indians still held an 11-game  
lead over second-place Chicago in the AL Central entering Monday's 
game. However, that doesn't make losing any easier, Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been through stuff like this before, it's never fun,''  
he said. ``Fact of the matter is, it's absolutely miserable. You 
stay with these things, you played your way into it, you play 
you're way out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Saturday's trading deadline quickly approaching, Hargrove  
said he, general manager John Hart and assistant GM Mark Shapiro 
have been busy looking into possibly making a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians have reportedly been looking for a left-handed  
pitcher, and one name that won't seem to go away is Anaheim starter 
Chuck Finley. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've talked about a lot of trades and a lot of names,''  
Hargrove said. ``The last three or four days we've had numerous 
discussions and we've been working hard on seeing what's available 
and who's available. You never know until you explore these things 
and see who's out there.''

<HEADLINE> Forbes Unveils $10M Ad Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steve Forbes' $10 million summer-long  
advertising blitz will be updated this week with warm testimonials 
from his family and a promise that he would appoint anti-abortion 
judges if elected president. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads will run in Iowa and New Hampshire, two early voting  
states in the 2000 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, a millionaire Republican, is the only presidential  
candidate with a major ad campaign under way. Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush, the GOP front-runner in polls and money-raising, has no plans 
to begin airing ads before the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' latest ads are designed to introduce him as a family man  
in light of internal polls that suggest voters know little about 
his personal life, campaign officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife and I of 27 years have five daughters,'' Forbes said  
in the black-and-white opening of one TV ad. His daughters take 
their turns, calling him a ``wonderful role model,'' who is ``so 
optimistic'' and ``incredibly strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Sabina, calls Forbes ``extremely honest.''  
</P>
<P>
	``When I see our family in the future -- in the White House  
hopefully -- I don't think any problems or challenges would be too 
... great for us,'' says daughter Moira in one TV ad. 
</P>
<P>
	That radio ads, which are set for broadcast only in Iowa, are  
more political. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any judge I appoint for life will be pro-life,'' Forbes says  
in one spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Without mentioning the Texas governor or other rivals by name,  
Forbes said, ``Some of the politicians who are running for 
president won't tell you what kind of judges they would appoint.'' 
Bush has said he would appoint conservative judges, though he won't 
require them to be anti-abortion advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	In another radio ad, Forbes urges supporters to help him win the  
Iowa straw vote in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes began his media campaign in early June, producing ads  
that attempted to cast him in a presidential light as he discussed 
national policy. Those ads, which had a limited run outside Iowa 
and New Hampshire, will be phased out, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent about $2.7 million on the first set of ads and plans to  
spend about $2.5 million on the latest set. By fall, Forbes plans 
to spend a total of about $10 million on advertising, aides say.

<HEADLINE>  Brett, Ryan Lead Hall of Fame Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- George Brett was completely blown away.  
And it was not by one of Nolan Ryan's fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
	Following an unassuming speech by baseball's greatest power  
pitcher ever, one of the game's best clutch hitters felt the 
pressure on the Hall of Fame podium Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	His eyes welled up with tears. His voice cracked. And he was so  
overwhelmed, he cut his induction speech short. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've broken down. I've had every emotion I could. It's time to  
get out of here,'' Brett said later, recalling the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty stressful,'' he said. ``I felt like I was up  
there for an eternity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it was only 17 minutes. But to Brett, that was plenty  
long enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett spoke last, after Robin Yount, Orlando Cepeda and Ryan, on  
an afternoon when a record crowd estimated at 50,000 honored seven 
new members. 
</P>
<P>
	Late umpire Nestor Chylak, Negro leagues pitcher Smokey Joe  
Williams and turn-of-the-century manager Frank Selee also were 
inducted. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the largest Hall of Fame class since Sandy Koufax led a  
parade of eight in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan spent most of his 16-minute speech thanking those who had  
made his career possible. Along with family members and friends, 
the man whose Hall plaque praised him as a ``Texas legend'' paid 
tribute to former players' union chief Marvin Miller and all fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciate y'all being here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I always thought there was going to be life after baseball,''  
Ryan said. ``I didn't realize the grip baseball had on me. It took 
me two full years to get over the fact that I was no longer a 
baseball player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, 52, played a record 27 seasons and holds major league  
marks of seven no-hitters and 5,714 strikeouts. He finished 
324-292, yet never won a Cy Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
	``A fierce competitor and one of baseball's most intimidating  
figures on the pitching mound,'' read his bronze plaque, which 
bears a ``T'' for the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett and Yount each topped 3,000 hits and Cepeda hit 379 home  
runs. All three were Ryan strikeout victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-four Hall inductees -- 15 of them struck out by the Ryan  
Express -- turned out for the 60th anniversary festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Williams, the oldest at 80, stayed more than a hour in the  
sweltering heat before leaving in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the hero of the recent All-Star Game at Fenway Park,  
and Willie Mays, who made a rare return to see former teammate 
Cepeda, got some of the biggest ovations. 
</P>
<P>
	Also receiving a huge cheer was Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the  
former owner of the Texas Rangers. New York Gov. George Pataki, 
mentioned as a possible running mate on a presidential ticket with 
Bush, implored, ``Let's have another great New York welcome for 
Governor Bush!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only boos of the afternoon came for commissioner Bud Selig.  
He was met with calls of ``Where's Pete Rose?'' and ``How about 
Charlie Hustle?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, as has become his custom, was on Main Street, signing  
autographs just blocks from the Hall. Banned from baseball, he's 
ineligible for Hall election. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've expressed my opinion to Mr. Selig. My thoughts are Pete  
Rose should be in the Hall of Fame,'' Ryan said later. ``Pete Rose 
should be judged on his merits as a player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's inductees increased the Hall membership to 244 --  
with space for only 240 plaques in the main gallery, extra room was 
found in an adjacent rotunda. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year, first-time candidates include Jack Morris, Goose  
Gossage and Kent Hrbek. Tony Perez and Carlton Fisk will again 
appear on the Baseball Writers' Association of America ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett had 3,154 hits and batted .305 in a 21-year career with  
Kansas City. ``Played each game with ceaseless intensity and 
unbridled passion,'' his plaque read. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett, 46, brought his family, including son Robin -- named for  
Yount -- and two of his three brothers. Ken was a former big league 
pitcher and Bobby was a minor leaguer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tearful during his speech, Brett looked at his older brothers  
and said, ``Sometimes I wonder why all this happened to me and not 
you. All I ever wanted to do was be as good as you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yount, a two-time AL MVP, had 3,142 hits in a 20-year career  
with the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	``A bastion of consistency and durability,'' read his plaque,  
which also denoted his ``stoic demeanor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yount, 43, was afraid his emotions might get the best of him. So  
he called Hall officials about three weeks ago and asked to speak 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never dreamed of being in the Hall of Fame,'' he said. ``And  
with all due respect, Mr. Gehrig, today I consider myself the 
luckiest man on the face of the earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, 61, was the second player from Puerto Rico to be  
elected, following Roberto Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
	``His ability to drive the ball with authority was respected and  
feared,'' his plaque read. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda rose to stardom with the San Francisco Giants, and  
entered the Hall wearing their cap. His final season was 1974, when 
he played two months with Brett for the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kid is never going to make it,'' Cepeda recalled himself  
thinking, drawing a laugh from Brett. ``Sometimes, you make 
mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chylak, who worked in the AL from 1954-78, was only the eighth  
umpire elected. Accepting on his behalf was his son, Bob -- Chylak 
was working when Bob was born, learning of the birth on the Yankee 
Stadium scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams played in the Negro leagues from 1910-32. In a 1952  
poll by the Pittsburgh Courier, he beat out Satchel Paige as black 
baseball's best pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Selee managed the Boston Beaneaters and Chicago Cubs from  
1890-1905. He is credited with turning catcher Frank Chance into a 
first baseman, creating the Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance infield. 
</P>
<P>
	Also honored were Bob Stevens of the San Francisco Chronicle and  
late announcer Arch McDonald. Stevens won the J.G. Taylor Spink 
Award for writing and McDonald got the Ford C. Frick Award for 
broadcasting.

He was met with calls of ``Where's Pete Rose?'' and ``How about 
Charlie Hustle?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, as has become his custom, was on Main Street, signing  
autographs just blocks from the Hall. Banned from baseball, he's 
ineligible for Hall election. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've expressed my opinion to Mr. Selig. My thoughts are Pete  
Rose should be in the Hall of Fame,'' Ryan said later. ``Pete Rose 
should be judged on his merits as a player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's inductees increased the Hall membership to 244 --  
with space for only 240 plaques in the main gallery, extra room was 
found in an adjacent rotunda. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year, first-time candidates include Jack Morris, Goose  
Gossage and Kent Hrbek. Tony Perez and Carlton Fisk will again 
appear on the Baseball Writers' Association of America ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett had 3,154 hits and batted .305 in a 21-year career with  
Kansas City. ``Played each game with ceaseless intensity and 
unbridled passion,'' his plaque read. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett, 46, brought his family, including son Robin -- named for  
Yount -- and two of his three brothers. Ken was a former big league 
pitcher and Bobby was a minor leaguer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tearful during his speech, Brett looked at his older brothers  
and said, ``Sometimes I wonder why all this happened to me and not 
you. All I ever wanted to do was be as good as you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yount, a two-time AL MVP, had 3,142 hits in a 20-year career  
with the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	``A bastion of consistency and durability,'' read his plaque,  
which also denoted his ``stoic demeanor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yount, 43, was afraid his emotions might get the best of him. So  
he called Hall officials about three weeks ago and asked to speak 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never dreamed of being in the Hall of Fame,'' he said. ``And  
with all due respect, Mr. Gehrig, today I consider myself the 
luckiest man on the face of the earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, 61, was the second player from Puerto Rico to be  
elected, following Roberto Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
	``His ability to drive the ball with authority was respected and  
feared,'' his plaque read. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda rose to stardom with the San Francisco Giants, and  
entered the Hall wearing their cap. His final season was 1974, when 
he played two months with Brett for the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kid is never going to make it,'' Cepeda recalled himself  
thinking, drawing a laugh from Brett. ``Sometimes, you make 
mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chylak, who worked in the AL from 1954-78, was only the eighth  
umpire elected. Accepting on his behalf was his son, Bob -- Chylak 
was working when Bob was born, learning of the birth on the Yankee 
Stadium scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams played in the Negro leagues from 1910-32. In a 1952  
poll by the Pittsburgh Courier, he beat out Satchel Paige as black 
baseball's best pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Selee managed the Boston Beaneaters and Chicago Cubs from  
1890-1905. He is credited with turning catcher Frank Chance into a 
first baseman, creating the Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance infield. 
</P>
<P>
	Also honored were Bob Stevens of the San Francisco Chronicle and  
late announcer Arch McDonald. Stevens won the J.G. Taylor Spink 
Award for writing and McDonald got the Ford C. Frick Award for 
broadcasting.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Abortion Law Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A judge blocked the state Monday from  
enforcing a new law that requires doctors to notify the parents of 
girls under 18 who are seeking abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hours after the state began enforcing the law, Circuit  
Judge Terry Lewis issued a temporary injunction, saying abortion 
clinics, doctors and advocacy groups had showed they were likely to 
win their challenge to the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Cory Tilley, a spokesman for Gov. Jeb Bush, said Lewis' order  
would be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-one other states have laws that require parents to be  
notified or give their consent if their daughters under 18 are 
having an abortion. Courts have blocked enforcement in eight 
states. One state isn't enforcing its law, and the laws haven't 
taken effect in three states. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's law says doctors must notify parents 48 hours before  
performing abortions. Permission from parents is not required, and 
girls can ask a judge to exempt them from the law based on their 
maturity or the risks they face if their parents are involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis cited a Florida Supreme Court decision a decade ago that  
said a parental-consent law violated the privacy provision of the 
Florida Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot say that the effect of this legislation is an  
insignificant intrusion on a minor's ability to freely choose 
whether or not to terminate her pregnancy, as protected by the 
Florida State Constitution,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	State health officials had argued that parents have a right to  
be involved in their children's health care. But the judge pointed 
out that girls are allowed to give their babies up for adoption and 
get treatment for sexually transmitted diseases without notifying 
their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlene Carres, an attorney for the abortion providers, said  
the decision ``shows a great appreciation for the facts of life: 
that there are minors out there who are not well-served by 
involving their parents.''

<HEADLINE> Couple Fights for Wash. Dream Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, Wash. (AP) -- A couple's dream home overlooking the  
scenic Columbia River Gorge is caught in the middle of a fight 
between local planners and the agency created to protect the area's 
natural beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian and Jody Bea began building their 4,000-square-foot home  
in 1997 on their 20-acre parcel of land, atop a bluff overlooking 
the tree-lined gorge that separates Oregon from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	County planners had approved the couple's plan for the  
three-story cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Columbia River Gorge Commission, a joint  
Oregon-Washington agency charged with protecting the area, got 
complaints that the house was clearly visible from the Oregon side 
of the gorge. There are other homes in the area, but they aren't as 
prominent as the Bea home. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission shut down construction more than a year after the  
frame started going up. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Judge James Ladley sided with the commission, saying  
its decision was correct although he sympathized with the Beas -- 
who have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal bills 
fighting to keep the house where it is. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beas plan to appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Skamania County had argued that its land-use  
decisions should not be subject to review by the commission, 
especially when a structure is so near completion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, the house sticks out like a sore thumb, but the gorge  
commission's objections came too late in the land-use permitting 
process,'' said Skamania County attorney Brad Andersen. ``If they 
can come in and invalidate the permit, no decision of the county is 
ever permanent, and every landowner is always at risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission argues that it is entirely within the powers  
granted it by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Skamania County had given the Beas a list of 33 conditions they  
had to meet to comply with the federal act that created the 
Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area and set guidelines for 
limited development. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the commission ordered the Beas to move the house to  
a less visible location. A conservation group even offered to pay 
the $35,000-$45,000 cost of moving the home. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Beas, living for now in a rented house in nearby  
Washougal, Wash., still want to move into their dream cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're all environmentalists,'' Bea said. ``No one  
wants to see downtown Portland in the gorge. But we have private 
property rights too.''

<HEADLINE> At Least 11 Deaths from Heat Wave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scorching heat gripped the eastern third of the country on  
Monday, continuing a hot spell that has been blamed for at least 23 
deaths -- including an elderly Illinois woman found inside her 
102-degree home. 
</P>
<P>
	Heat advisories were posted Monday from Kansas eastward through  
the Ohio Valley, and over parts of the Southeast. Temperatures 
throughout the region hit the 90s and reached triple digits with 
the heat index. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather was blamed on seven deaths in Cincinnati over the  
weekend, 11 deaths in Illinois in the past week and five in 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	In West Peoria, Ill., a neighbor found the body of 82-year-old  
Helen Lane on Saturday. All the windows in her home were closed and 
her air conditioner had broken; the temperature inside was 102. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the Cincinnati victims were found in homes where the  
temperatures were about 98. 
</P>
<P>
	``The heat's not going to go away,'' Hamilton County (Ohio)  
Coroner Carl L. Parrott said. ``Unless people modify their 
behavior, there will be more deaths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois death count included two young boys -- ages 2 and 1 1/2  
-- found last week outside their home in their parents' sweltering 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures reached 100 degrees in St. Louis on Monday, making  
it the hottest day of the 12-day span of 90-plus degree weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitals in the city were reporting high numbers of cases of  
heat stress. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York state, more than 1,000 people were treated for heat  
exhaustion and dehydration at the three-day Woodstock '99 concert. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat has also increased demand for air conditioning and  
tightened supplies of electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	The utility Cinergy, parent of PSI Energy which serves 655,000  
customers in central and southern Indiana, said it would interrupt 
electrical service on Monday to certain large-volume customers 
under special contracts to reduce electricity loads. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasts say there's no immediate relief in sight.

<HEADLINE> EU Clears Wal-Mart Takeover of Asda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union regulators Monday  
approved the $10.7 billion takeover of British supermarket chain 
Asda Group PLC by the U.S. retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulatory approval was seen as a formality, since the two  
companies do not operate in each others' markets. The EU's 
executive body said the operation does not raise competitive 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Asda is only active in Britain, where it is the third largest  
supermarket operator. Wal-Mart's only operations in Europe are in 
Germany, following its purchase last year of the Wertkauf chain of 
95 supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
	On the procurement side, the Commission said both companies buy  
most of their supplies from national producers and the few 
producers supplying both companies, are ``tend to be large 
multinational companies with considerable bargaining power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart announced its move into Britain last month with  
acquisition of Asda which has 229 stores and annual sales of $12.8 
billion. The deal more than doubles Wal-Mart's international sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU Commission checks all large mergers impacting on markets  
within the 15-nation block to ensure they do not create monopolies 
or other unfairly dominant position.

<HEADLINE> Pharmacy Discounts Hepatitis C Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Three pharmacists tired of turning away  
hepatitis C patients who couldn't pay $1,400 a month for the only 
treatment available are bottling and selling the drugs themselves 
at half the price. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher's Specialized Pharmacy Services, a drug store in  
Pittsburgh, began selling its version of the drugs this month. 
Until now, they had to be purchased from Madison, N.J.-based 
Schering-Plough Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``How would you like to have a disease and have insurance and  
still not be able to afford the drug?'' said Don Kerrish, one of 
the three druggists who own the pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hepatitis C is spread by blood and affects an estimated 3.9  
million people in the United States. It can lead to chronic liver 
problems, including cirrhosis and cancer. There is no vaccine 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough's treatment, known as Rebetron, consists of  
Ribavirin, which simply helps another drug, interferon, fight the 
virus. The company uses a type of interferon called Intron A, the 
only type approved for use with Ribavirin for treating hepatitis C. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher's is selling Ribavirin for $225 a month and, separately,  
an interferon not made by Schering-Plough for $420 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The pharmacists said they have received about 10 calls a day  
from potential patients since they started the sales July 9. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the Food and Drug Administration is letting both sell  
their drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Klein, an activist with the Hepatitis C Action and  
Advocacy Council, said Schering-Plough packages the drugs together 
just to make more money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doctors and patients need to have the access and flexibility  
to make the choices they deem appropriate, not the drug company,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough's president of U.S. marketing, Richard Zahn,  
denied the accusation: ``I think we're a company that cares about 
patients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough has asked the FDA to look into whether Fisher's  
is violating federal guidelines. By promoting the drugs, the 
pharmacy is moving toward manufacturing, which is not allowed, 
Schering-Plough claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerrish said the pharmacy is meeting federal regulations and  
selling safe drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough says its treatment -- which earned $248 million  
in the 12 months ending May 1999 -- is the only one proven to work. 
However, the company says it is effective in only about 40 percent 
of the people who take it. That's one reason some people are 
clamoring for an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher's isn't claiming its version is as good as  
Schering-Plough's, only that it's a choice.

<HEADLINE> No Charges Yet in Tobacco Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department's criminal  
investigation of the tobacco industry is near closing without 
charges as officials debate whether evidence gathered can be used 
to prepare a civil lawsuit, a senior department official said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have been anticipating for several months a decision  
to close the criminal case. Among subjects the investigation looked 
into was whether industry executives lied either to Congress or the 
Food and Drug Administration about their knowledge of nicotine's 
addictiveness or how it was used in the manufacture of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional testimony from tobacco executives was  
delivered April 14, 1994, and the statements to the FDA were made 
as late as June of that year. In both cases, the five-year statute 
of limitations ran out this year without charges being filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno has authorized the department's  
civil division to prepare a lawsuit to recover billions of dollars 
spent by federal health insurance programs to treat tobacco-related 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	A task force has been assembled and is studying the 200,000  
pages of industry documents disclosed as a result of a Minnesota 
lawsuit against the tobacco companies. As the industry settled with 
most state governments, Minnesota received $6.6 billion to drop its 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The formal ending of the criminal investigation has been delayed  
in part by the debate over whether to transfer to the civil 
division task force industry documents and other evidence obtained 
during the criminal grand jury investigation, according to the 
department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Because grand juries have more power to compel disclosure of  
information than plaintiffs in civil lawsuits, it is unusual, 
though not unheard of, for such transfers to occur. 
</P>
<P>
	A transfer would require permission for a limited exception to  
grand jury secrecy rules from Norma Holloway Johnson, who as chief 
U.S. District Court judge supervises the grand jury that has heard 
evidence in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Without question, the tobacco companies would oppose such a  
transfer if Johnson allowed them to weigh in on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration partially averted a potential roadblock  
Friday in its efforts to obtain extra funds to bring the case. The 
Justice Department has sought $20 million for the fiscal year 
beginning Oct. 1 to pay for 40 lawyers and expert witness fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate removed language from its report on the bill covering  
Justice appropriations that would have barred spending any money on 
the lawsuit, but the bill does not provide the requested $20 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said last week she has enough attorneys to file a lawsuit  
but hopes to persuade Congress to provide the extra money to ensure 
the government makes the best case it can in court.

<HEADLINE> Rates Rise in Treasury Auction / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest level in two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.50 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.535 percent, up from 4.520 percent last 
week. An additional $7.50 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.520 percent, up from 4.490 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since July 12 when the  
bills sold for 4.600 percent. The six-month rate also was the 
highest since July 12 when the rate was 4.540. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.663 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,885.40 and 4.703 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,771.50. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 4.98 
percent last week from 5.01 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy's Flight Not Illegal in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- John F. Kennedy Jr.'s fatal flight would never  
have taken off in countries where it's against the law to fly at 
night unless the pilot is qualified to rely on instruments alone. 
</P>
<P>
	While such flights are not recommended by American aviation  
officials, there is nothing illegal in the United States about 
flying at night as long as visibility is at least three miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Night flight poses challenges when the sky and land blend  
together in a gathering gloom, and the horizon -- the visual 
reference point for keeping a plane level -- disappears. 
</P>
<P>
	Over water, with the great blue sea becoming a great black  
nothing at night, a pilot can easily become disoriented and lose 
control of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``Flying over the ocean when the light is right is no big deal.  
When the light is not right -- and I suppose that's the condition in 
the Kennedy flight -- it becomes a very big deal,'' said Stuart 
Matthews, chief executive of the Flight Safety Foundation, a 
commercial aviation organization. 
</P>
<P>
	For that reason, flying over the Bahamas at night without  
instrument proficiency is forbidden. Countries such as England and 
Canada require more hours spent training at night and flying by 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	In an editorial last week, USA Today -- citing statistics of 116  
accidents, 85 percent fatal, from 1995 to 1997 when pilots flew 
from clear conditions to disorienting ones -- called for a closer 
look into imposing night-flying restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If other countries protect inexperienced pilots and their  
passengers from predictably hazardous night flying conditions, 
perhaps it's time the USA should do the same,'' the paper wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, a basic private pilot's license can be  
earned after spending 40 hours in the cockpit, half with an 
instructor and half solo. That includes three hours of night 
flying, including 10 takeoffs and landings and a 100-mile night 
flight, plus three hours of instrument training. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Canada, with its bad weather, vast stretches of  
sparsely populated land and large lakes, has much stricter 
requirements -- among the stiffest in the world for a basic pilot's 
license. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada requires 45 hours of flight time and 40 hours of ground  
school for a license. To fly at night, pilots must have an 
additional 20 hours of training -- 10 hours at night and 10 hours 
using just instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	While an instrument rating in the United States requires 40  
additional hours of training, a basic U.S. pilot's license involves 
rudimentary instrument training. New pilots in the U.S. also are 
taught to make a 180-degree turn out of a cloud and recover from 
losing control. 
</P>
<P>
	William Langewiesche, a former commercial pilot and author of  
``Inside the Sky: A Meditation on Flight,'' has criticized the way 
pilots are trained in America. 
</P>
<P>
	``The emergency training is phony. It's not a scam, but it's a  
facade,'' he said. ``Don't imply things that aren't true: that 
three or six or even 10 hours of instrument training is going to be 
a solution in a real situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``All that training should be abandoned and the good weather  
pilot should be very clear as to the impossibility of flying an 
airplane without seeing the outside horizon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he sees it, one solution is to take pilots into storms and  
pitch-black nighttime conditions, something Langewiesche often does 
to prepare experienced pilots for such conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the Kennedy accident, Michael Barr, director of  
the aviation safety program at the University of Southern 
California, said he would like to see a review of previous private 
aviation accidents. If flying into poor conditions is deemed a 
problem, one solution would be requiring more training for unusual 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can't be an emotional response to a single accident,''  
Barr said. ``A draconian way of solving that is to say that you 
can't fly at night and can't fly over water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics in the United States actually show there are fewer  
visual flight accidents per hour of night flight than during 
daytime and fewer visual flight accidents than instrument-rated 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
	For every million hours of visual flight, there are 8.8  
accidents in daytime, 7.6 at night, according to the Aircraft 
Owners and Pilots Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew Steketee, senior vice president of AOPA, attributed the  
difference to more experienced pilots flying at night. 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics also show there are 24.1 accidents per 1 million  
hours of instrument-only flying at night, a figure largely due to 
the tricky transition instrument pilots must make while landing 
visually.

	Most aviation experts said the Kennedy crash is bound to have an  
impact. On Thursday, as AOPA's president testified before a 
congressional committee on the American Airlines crash in Little 
Rock, Ark., talk turned to flying in bad weather conditions as a 
result of the Kennedy crash, Steketee said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be studied and debated by the authorities, and the  
aviation community and the industry,'' Steketee said. ``Anytime 
there's an accident of this publicity people will read about it and 
remember it. This sort of thing will become some of the lore of 
pilots.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Announces Incentive Grants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seventeen states and the District of Columbia  
will receive grants totaling $57.4 million for lowering their drunk 
driving limit to 0.08 percent blood alcohol content, Vice President 
Al Gore announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas, Washington and the District of Columbia are receiving  
grants for the first time for passing legislation effective in 1999 
to adopt the stricter limit. The other states have received grants 
in the past for having .08 BAC laws. To qualify for the grants, 
states must have enacted a .08 BAC by Sept. 30 of the fiscal year 
for which the grant is given. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of these states and the District of Columbia have  
taken a tough stance against drinking and driving and I continue to 
challenge the Congress to enact legislation to keep impaired 
drivers off America's roads,'' Gore said in announcing the grants. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton last year advocated a 0.08 percent blood  
alcohol content as a nationwide standard for legal drunkenness 
rather than the 0.1 percent limit in effect in two-thirds of the 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant money may be used to support highway safety programs, such  
as ones that encourage seat belt use or motorcycle education. It 
may also be used for highway construction. 
</P>
<P>
	The states and their grant awards: Alabama, $2.4 million;  
California, $13.5 million; Florida, $6.2 million; Hawaii, $705,417; 
Idaho, $924,560; Illinois, $5.8 million; Kansas, $2.1 million; 
Maine, $705,417; New Hampshire, $705,417; New Mexico, $1.1 million; 
North Carolina, $3.5 million; Oregon, $1.9 million; Texas, $9.4 
million; Utah, $1.1 million; Vermont, $705,417; Virginia, $3.1 
million; and Washington, $2.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The District of Columbia will receive $705,417.

<HEADLINE> New Fighting Erupts in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) -- Fighting has broken out in southern  
Somalia between militiamen of a new faction and forces loyal to 
Hussein Aidid, one of Somalia's most powerful faction leaders, a 
witness said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the new Digil Salvation Army attacked Aidid's men  
with rocket-propelled grenades, machine guns and rifles Sunday in 
Coriolei, 75 miles south of Mogadishu, the witness said on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Somalia has had no central government since the 1991 ouster of  
the late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre by a coalition of rebels. 
After his ouster, coup leaders turned on each other, and the 
country disintegrated into fiefdoms protected by clan-based 
militia. 
</P>
<P>
	Somalis descend from six original clans. Aidid is a member of  
the Habr-Gedir sub-clan of the Hawiya clan. 
</P>
<P>
	The new faction is led by Col. Ali Sheik Abdulkadir and is made  
up of members of the Gerra tribe of the pre-Hawiya clan, the 
witness said by shortwave radio from the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The witness said Coriolei was calm but tense Monday, and Aidid's  
forces were fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately possible to ascertain the number of  
casualties from the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahdi Mohamed Jumale, an Aidid spokesman in Mogadishu, said  
Aidid's forces had ``engaged bandits'' and dispersed them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gerra have been at loggerheads with Aidid's forces in recent  
weeks, complaining of high taxation.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong's Victory Powers Austin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Three years ago, many here thought Lance  
Armstrong wouldn't live to see the 1999 Tour de France let alone 
win it. 
</P>
<P>
	So even before Armstrong, who survived a devastating bout with  
cancer, won the most-rugged of endurance races Sunday, his hometown 
already regarded him as a hero. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only is he a hometown hero, he's a world hero,'' said John  
Crismond, who watched ABC's afternoon coverage with about 750 
cycling enthusiasts during a party at the Copper Tank Brewing Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously he didn't bring those problems upon himself, but  
he's chosen to carry the banner for people with cancer,'' said 
Crismond, who like many in the crowd wore yellow shirts 
representing the Tour leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Armstrong was diagnosed in 1996 with testicular  
cancer that had spread rapidly through his body. He needed surgery 
to remove lesions from his brain and one of his testicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Then come months of chemotherapy.  
</P>
<P>
	Sally Koch, a self-described ``terrible biker'' but a big  
Armstrong fan, feared the worst when Armstrong went public with 
news of his cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we read about his cancer that he had, it seemed like it  
was pretty much all over,'' Ms. Koch said. ``He was so sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jammed shoulder to shoulder in the restaurant, the crowd cheered  
every time Armstrong's face came on the television screens and 
quieted every time he spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans also paused for the playing of ``The Star-Spangled  
Banner'' when Armstrong received the winner's trophy before letting 
out a final cheer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a phenomenal thing,'' said Renee Orr, who said she  
rode bicycles competitively until she had children. ``This really 
is a hometown boy done well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others couldn't wait for the afternoon broadcast of taped  
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl Haussmann, the director of the Lance Armstrong Foundation  
for cancer research, was in his office by 8 a.m. Sunday to watch 
the race on the Internet, putting up with its sometimes fuzzy and 
choppy images. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is amazing. It's Lance, it's the comeback, it's  
history,'' Haussmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a guy who we saw with no hair, lying in bed barely  
able to move after brain surgery, and now he's won cycling's 
greatest race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only other American to win the Tour de France was Greg  
LeMond, a three-time champion whose last victory came in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	By early Sunday, someone had left a basket of flowers on the  
doorstep of the Lance Armstrong Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Keep rolling Lance,'' read one of several messages on the  
card. ``You are an inspiration.''

<HEADLINE> Brett, Ryan Lead Hall of Fame Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- George Brett was completely blown away.  
And it was not by one of Nolan Ryan's fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
	Following an unassuming speech by baseball's greatest power  
pitcher ever, one of the game's best clutch hitters felt the 
pressure on the Hall of Fame podium Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	His eyes welled up with tears. His voice cracked. And he was so  
overwhelmed, he cut his induction speech short. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've broken down. I've had every emotion I could. It's time to  
get out of here,'' Brett said later, recalling the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty stressful,'' he said. ``I felt like I was up  
there for an eternity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it was only 17 minutes. But to Brett, that was plenty  
long enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett spoke last, after Robin Yount, Orlando Cepeda and Ryan, on  
an afternoon when a record crowd estimated at 50,000 honored seven 
new members. 
</P>
<P>
	Late umpire Nestor Chylak, Negro leagues pitcher Smokey Joe  
Williams and turn-of-the-century manager Frank Selee also were 
inducted. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the largest Hall of Fame class since Sandy Koufax led a  
parade of eight in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan spent most of his 16-minute speech thanking those who had  
made his career possible. Along with family members and friends, 
the man whose Hall plaque praised him as a ``Texas legend'' paid 
tribute to former players' union chief Marvin Miller and all fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciate y'all being here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I always thought there was going to be life after baseball,''  
Ryan said. ``I didn't realize the grip baseball had on me. It took 
me two full years to get over the fact that I was no longer a 
baseball player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, 52, played a record 27 seasons and holds major league  
marks of seven no-hitters and 5,714 strikeouts. He finished 
324-292, yet never won a Cy Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
	``A fierce competitor and one of baseball's most intimidating  
figures on the pitching mound,'' read his bronze plaque, which 
bears a ``T'' for the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett and Yount each topped 3,000 hits and Cepeda hit 379 home  
runs. All three were Ryan strikeout victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-four Hall inductees -- 15 of them struck out by the Ryan  
Express -- turned out for the 60th anniversary festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Williams, the oldest at 80, stayed more than a hour in the  
sweltering heat before leaving in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the hero of the recent All-Star Game at Fenway Park,  
and Willie Mays, who made a rare return to see former teammate 
Cepeda, got some of the biggest ovations. 
</P>
<P>
	Also receiving a huge cheer was Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the  
former owner of the Texas Rangers. New York Gov. George Pataki, 
mentioned as a possible running mate on a presidential ticket with 
Bush, implored, ``Let's have another great New York welcome for 
Governor Bush!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only boos of the afternoon came for commissioner Bud Selig.  
He was met with calls of ``Where's Pete Rose?'' and ``How about 
Charlie Hustle?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, as has become his custom, was on Main Street, signing  
autographs just blocks from the Hall. Banned from baseball, he's 
ineligible for Hall election. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've expressed my opinion to Mr. Selig. My thoughts are Pete  
Rose should be in the Hall of Fame,'' Ryan said later. ``Pete Rose 
should be judged on his merits as a player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's inductees increased the Hall membership to 244 --  
with space for only 240 plaques in the main gallery, extra room was 
found in an adjacent rotunda. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year, first-time candidates include Jack Morris, Goose  
Gossage and Kent Hrbek. Tony Perez and Carlton Fisk will again 
appear on the Baseball Writers' Association of America ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett had 3,154 hits and batted .305 in a 21-year career with  
Kansas City. ``Played each game with ceaseless intensity and 
unbridled passion,'' his plaque read. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett, 46, brought his family, including son Robin -- named for  
Yount -- and two of his three brothers. Ken was a former big league 
pitcher and Bobby was a minor leaguer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tearful during his speech, Brett looked at his older brothers  
and said, ``Sometimes I wonder why all this happened to me and not 
you. All I ever wanted to do was be as good as you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yount, a two-time AL MVP, had 3,142 hits in a 20-year career  
with the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	``A bastion of consistency and durability,'' read his plaque,  
which also denoted his ``stoic demeanor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yount, 43, was afraid his emotions might get the best of him. So  
he called Hall officials about three weeks ago and asked to speak 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never dreamed of being in the Hall of Fame,'' he said. ``And  
with all due respect, Mr. Gehrig, today I consider myself the 
luckiest man on the face of the earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, 61, was the second player from Puerto Rico to be  
elected, following Roberto Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
	``His ability to drive the ball with authority was respected and  
feared,'' his plaque read. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda rose to stardom with the San Francisco Giants, and  
entered the Hall wearing their cap. His final season was 1974, when 
he played two months with Brett for the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kid is never going to make it,'' Cepeda recalled himself  
thinking, drawing a laugh from Brett. ``Sometimes, you make 
mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chylak, who worked in the AL from 1954-78, was only the eighth  
umpire elected. Accepting on his behalf was his son, Bob -- Chylak 
was working when Bob was born, learning of the birth on the Yankee 
Stadium scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams played in the Negro leagues from 1910-32. In a 1952  
poll by the Pittsburgh Courier, he beat out Satchel Paige as black 
baseball's best pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Selee managed the Boston Beaneaters and Chicago Cubs from  
1890-1905. He is credited with turning catcher Frank Chance into a 
first baseman, creating the Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance infield. 
</P>
<P>
	Also honored were Bob Stevens of the San Francisco Chronicle and  
late announcer Arch McDonald. Stevens won the J.G. Taylor Spink 
Award for writing and McDonald got the Ford C. Frick Award for 
broadcasting.

<HEADLINE> ISC Completes Merger With Penske </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- International Speedway Corp. on  
Monday announced it has completed its merger with Penske 
Motorsports Inc., a move that puts 10 U.S. racetracks under one 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``As part of ISC, we will benefit from their industry expertise  
and financial resources as we seek to provide fans with the best in 
motorsports entertainment,'' said Roger Penske, PMI's founder and 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Penske will serve as vice chairman of ISC's board of directors.  
Greg Penske, PMI's president and chief executive officer, will 
oversee the management of the acquired facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	William C. France, chairman and chief executive of ISC, said  
``the contribution of PMI's management will be instrumental in 
developing new tracks in key markets including Kansas City, 
Chicago, New York and Denver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal gives the merged company an even tighter hold on some  
of auto racing's premier events, especially the NASCAR Winston Cup 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	ISC also gets a bigger cut of the growing NASCAR television pie.  
NASCAR, which is run by France, has said that it would take over 
television negotiations instead of leaving that duty to individual 
racetracks. 
</P>
<P>
	ISC is paying $50 per share in stock and cash for 12.2 million  
shares of Detroit-based Penske. ISC already held 12 percent of 
Penske Motorsports. 
</P>
<P>
	ISC owns or operates Daytona International Speedway, Talladega  
Superspeedway in Alabama, Phoenix International Raceway, Darlington 
Raceway in South Carolina, and Watkins Glen International in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	It also operates Tucson Raceway Park in Arizona and has a 90  
percent stake in the Homestead-Miami Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Penske owns and operates Michigan Speedway in Brooklyn, Mich.;  
Nazareth Speedway in Pennsylvania; California Speedway in San 
Bernardino; and North Carolina Speedway near Rockingham.

<HEADLINE> Rift Widens in Switched-Baby Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENA VISTA, Va. (AP) -- A year ago, the families of two little  
girls switched at birth met for the first time, and everyone got 
along just fine. 
</P>
<P>
	They agreed they could work things out without lawyers. The  
children would stay with the families raising them, and the 
biological families would get liberal visitation rights. 
</P>
<P>
	That was then.  
</P>
<P>
	This is now: a custody battle so bitter that one mother screamed  
as she was leaving court: ``That's my child and I want her home 
with me!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paula Johnson's outburst was the latest twist in a yearlong  
saga. 
</P>
<P>
	It began last summer when Ms. Johnson, a single mother, asked  
her former boyfriend for more child support for their daughter, 
Callie. To make sure he was the father, his blood was tested. When 
the results came back, Ms. Johnson learned that not only was the 
man not Callie's father, but Ms. Johnson was not the girl's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out that Callie and another girl, now both 4, had been  
switched at the University of Virginia Medical Center. 
Investigations by state officials failed to determine how the 
switch occurred and several lawsuits are pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a day after Ms. Johnson got the test results, Callie's  
biological parents, Kevin Chittum and Whitney Rogers, were killed 
in a car wreck without ever learning that the girl they were 
raising, Rebecca, was not theirs. After the car accident, Chittum's 
parents and Ms. Rogers' parents agreed to share custody of Rebecca, 
only to find out a short time later that Rebecca was not their 
biological granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	When the truth finally came out, the two sides met in August  
1998, and Ms. Johnson said at the time: ``Everyone was just 
wonderful. These are people you can feel very close to, even 
without this ordeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The truce has since broken down. Ms. Johnson has petitioned for  
custody of Rebecca and wants to keep Callie, too, while the other 
side wants to stick to the original agreement to keep things as 
they were. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy and Brenda Rogers, who are helping to raise Rebecca, leave  
little doubt they blame Ms. Johnson for the rift but won't go into 
specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	``My days of speaking to Paula are over,'' Tommy Rogers said in  
an interview Sunday at his Buena Vista home. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson's lawyer, Ken Mergenthal, would not allow his client  
to be interviewed. He said grandparents with differing agendas 
caused the rift. He said the Rogerses and the Chittums were 
bickering, and Ms. Johnson didn't like Rebecca being in the middle 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts who have followed the case said discord was all but  
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	Nadine Kaslow, professor of family and child psychology at Emory  
University in Atlanta, said the families' pledge to work out 
custody and visitation amicably ``was too much to expect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is so complicated, even the courts and mental health  
professionals will have trouble figuring out what's best,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, it's not clear whether Callie knows what is  
going on. As for Rebecca, Brenda Rogers said the little girl is 
doing fine and has been told nothing about the switch. 
</P>
<P>
	``She just knows her mommy and daddy are in heaven,'' Mrs.  
Rogers said. ``Eventually, when she gets older, she will know the 
truth.''

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor: Croat Head Caused Purge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Croatian President Franjo  
Tudjman's ``obsession'' with annexing parts of Bosnia led to the 
massacre of hundreds of Muslims, a Yugoslav war crimes tribunal 
prosecutor said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Gregory Kehoe said Bosnian Croat forces acted as  
agents of Tudjman's regime as they swept through central Bosnia in 
1992-94 killing Muslim men, women and children and torching their 
homes and mosques. 
</P>
<P>
	Kehoe's accusations, made during closing arguments in the U.N.  
court's trial of Croat Gen. Tihomir Blaskic, are likely to further 
strain relations between the tribunal and Croat authorities that 
are already at the breaking point. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour has threatened to report Croatia  
to the U.N. Security Council if it does not soon extradite two 
indicted suspects in Croat custody and hand over thousands of pages 
of evidence wanted by investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Blaskic, 38, faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if  
convicted of any one of 20 charges of crimes against humanity, war 
crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions. He has pleaded 
innocent to all counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say he commanded troops responsible for the killings  
and persecution, including the massacre of more than 100 Muslim 
men, women and children in the village of Ahmici in April 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Blaskic does not deny being a colonel in the Bosnian Croat  
militia but insists he tried to prevent atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	Kehoe told the three-judge tribunal panel the purge was part of  
a political plan ``developed in the halls of power in Zagreb, 
Croatia, by President Franjo Tudjman and his political 
associates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One witness cited Monday by Kehoe said that annexing parts of  
Bosnia was ``an obsession with Tudjman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign in central Bosnia was aimed at driving Muslims out  
of a self-proclaimed Bosnian Croat state, which would then be 
annexed by Croatia, Kehoe said. Ultimately, Croatia did not take 
over the territory. 
</P>
<P>
	In what was interpreted as a snub to the tribunal by Tudjman,  
Blaskic was promoted to the rank of general in the Croat army in 
1995, shortly after he was indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Bosnian Croat troops fighting in Bosnia in 1992 and  
1993 are widely regarded as having been tools of Zagreb, Tudjman 
has never been indicted by the tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecution and defense closing arguments were expected to take  
five days. Judges likely will take weeks to consider their 
verdicts.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Umpires Sue Leagues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Less than two weeks after saying they would quit  
en masse, umpires turned around and sued baseball Monday for the 
right to withdraw their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 14-page complaint filed in U.S. District Court in  
Philadelphia, the Major League Umpires Association also accused the 
American League and the commissioner's office of saying they intend 
to withhold termination pay of up to $400,000 per umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires, whose resignations are set to take effect Sept. 2, also  
claimed baseball has offered them up to $2 million in future gains 
if they join a dissident group in the union that is trying to fire 
its negotiator, Richie Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	They also said several baseball officials are spreading ``false  
and misleading statements to umpires about deadlines to accept 
resignations, deadlines to offer rescissions of resignations and 
deadlines to reject rescissions of resignations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires chose the resignation tactic because their current labor  
deal has a no-strike clause, and they fear owners would lock them 
out after it expires. 
</P>
<P>
	However, their position has been weakened by the decisions of 23  
of 32 AL umpires who say they will stay on. Only three of their 36 
NL counterparts say they will remain. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners have hired more than 20 new umpires from the minor  
leagues as of Sept. 1. The Triple-A umpires had been working as 
vacation fill-ins in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	While no additional withdrawals of resignations were received  
Monday, one baseball official, speaking on the condition he not be 
identified, said several NL umpires had called baseball to say they 
were considering reversing course and staying on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're partially divided right now and hopefully we can all  
come together at some point,'' said NL umpire Bruce Froemming, a 
union board member. ``But as far as what happened in Philly today, 
I have not talked to anybody and am as confused as anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Edmund V. Ludwig,  
who three years ago issued a court order that prevented umpires 
from striking in the postseason. Umpires threatened a strike after 
Roberto Alomar spit at umpire John Hirschbeck and was given just a 
five-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, umpires want a court order that gives them until  
Sept. 2 to withdraw their resignations. They also want Ludwig to 
declare that owners have engaged ``in numerous and serious unfair 
labor practices'' and to declare that mass resignations are a legal 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far, 14 of the 56 umpires who resigned have withdrawn their  
resignations. The baseball official said the sport would continue 
to accept withdrawals, but only until all vacancies are filled. 
</P>
<P>
	At least four more minor league umpires were hired Monday,  
another baseball official said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual twist, umpires accused owners of wrongfully  
agreeing to give Larry Barnett more termination pay than the labor 
contract requires. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett, who with 31 years of service is baseball's senior  
umpire, agreed to retire after this season for $550,000 -- $150,000 
more than the AL was required to give him. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL also has been negotiating for the retirements of Dale  
Ford, Ted Hendry, Ken Kaiser and Durwood Merrill, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The current labor agreement is set to expire Dec. 31. Umpires  
asked the court to declare that the current labor agreement was 
abandoned by the AL and NL because commissioner Bud Selig is trying 
to shift supervision of umpires from the leagues to Sandy Alderson 
in the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips declined comment, as did Selig.  
</P>
<P>
	Ludwig, however, did not immediately set a date for a hearing.

<HEADLINE>  Red Sox Pluck Huskey From Mariners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- If they're going to stop their current slide, the  
Boston Red Sox will need to improve both their pitching and their 
hitting. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitching help will have to come from within. But the hitting  
got a boost on Monday when Boston acquired outfielder Butch Huskey 
from the Seattle Mariners for minor league pitcher Robert Ramsay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this is a good addition to our team for this year,  
and also for future years,'' said Red Sox general manager Dan 
Duquette, whose team is 5-12 since July 5. ``He should be poised to 
put up some good numbers for the next couple of years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huskey, 27, was hitting .290 with 15 homers and 48 RBIs in 74  
games with Seattle this season, but has been in a 31-for-135 (.230) 
slump since June 1. Huskey will make $1.5 million this year and 
isn't eligible for free agency until after the 2001 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle acquired Huskey from the New York Mets last winter, but  
he didn't seem to fit into the Mariners' plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our outfield was a little crowded over there,'' he said. ``I  
had a good feeling that if it wasn't going to be me (traded), it 
was going to be one of our other outfielders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsay, 25, is 6-8 with a 5.35 ERA at Pawtucket of the Triple-A  
International League, allowing 114 hits in 114 1-3 innings with 79 
strikeouts and 36 walks. 
</P>
<P>
	He led Red Sox minor league pitchers in strikeouts last season,  
fanning a team-record 166 in 162 2-3 innings at Double-A Trenton of 
the Eastern League. He was selected Boston's minor league pitcher 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Vancouver, Wash., Ramsay lives in Camas, Wash., and  
was a member of the Washington State Pac-10 North championship team 
in 1995. The Red Sox and Mariners had discussed the same trade 
earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deal didn't come together then, but we're happy that it  
came together now,'' Duquette said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't like to trade young left-handed pitchers, but we have  
a need for another right-handed hitter on our major league team. 
And that's what we're getting in Butch Huskey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duquette said Huskey could play right field, left field,  
designated hitter, first base or third. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves the Red Sox looking for pitching. Rather than making  
a trade, Duquette is hoping he can get all the help he needs when 
ace Pedro Martinez is eligible to come off the disabled list Aug. 
3. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our pitching is still the strength of our team,'' Duquette  
said. ``We're hoping to return Pedro Martinez to the rotation next 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Closer Tom Gordon, who has missed most of the season with a  
right elbow strain, threw from a mound on Sunday and had none of 
the trouble he experienced in his previous workout. But he still 
appears to be a long way from returning. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramon Martinez, Pedro's brother and the former Los Angeles  
Dodgers star, also does not appear to be close to returning from 
shoulder surgery. Juan Pena, who had a strong outing for the Red 
Sox' Triple-A team on Sunday night, could be the next emergency 
starter.

<HEADLINE> Hornets' Pick Says He's Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOREST HILL, Texas (AP) -- The agent of former Texas Christian  
basketball star Lee Nailon said Monday his client is innocent of 
drug possession and evading arrest charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Fox said the 24-year-old Nailon simply was in the wrong  
place at the wrong time when he was arrested Saturday at a suburban 
Fort Worth hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the case is being blown out of proportion,'' Fox said.  
``Lee wasn't smoking anything. All they're basically saying is that 
Lee was there. There isn't much meat on the bones here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nailon, the Charlotte Hornets' second-round draft pick this  
year, was with TCU running back LaDainian Tomlinson and another 
friend, Leroy Nesbitt III, at a Comfort Inn in Forest Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested the three after finding between two and four  
ounces of marijuana and other paraphernalia in their second-floor 
room. They were released Sunday after posting $1,500 bond apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	The marijuana charge is a Class A misdemeanor with possible  
penalties of a year in jail and a fine of up to $4,000. The charge 
of evading arrest could be a misdemeanor or a felony, depending on 
the circumstances, Forest Hill police Detective Chris Hebert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers arrested the three around 5 p.m. Saturday while  
investigating a robbery of three hotel employees that took place 
earlier in the day, Hebert said. The officers smelled marijuana 
coming from the rooms occupied by the three men and arrested them 
in the hotel parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Police later found the drugs and the paraphernalia in their  
room. Hebert said police doubt there is a connection between the 
robbery and the three men.

<HEADLINE> Fires Rage at Woodstock '99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- What began with scattered bonfires near the  
close of Woodstock '99 -- just as peace candles were being handed 
out -- ended in a destructive melee that was finally quieted early 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Tents and booths were destroyed, concert light stands and a  
speaker tower were toppled and a mob tried to destroy a radio 
station truck over several chaotic hours beginning late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the real Woodstock,'' said a disgusted Mike Long,  
31, of Detroit, as police moved in. ``They messed up. They messed 
up the whole name of Woodstock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven people were arrested on charges ranging from rioting to  
criminal mischief, State Police Superintendent James McMahon said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Five concertgoers were injured, one seriously, when a trailer  
was toppled on them, he said. Two troopers also were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	McMahon estimated that 200 to 500 youths actively took part in  
the rioting, although thousands more watched and cheered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great shame that this happened because in so many ways  
it was so uplifting,'' promoter John Scher said. ``It puts a 
permanent blemish on what happened here. I think the kids made a 
mistake. They did not intend for this to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The violence that erupted after almost three days of peace and  
love at Woodstock '99 came as the Red Hot Chili Peppers were in the 
midst of their festival-closing set and a group named Pax was 
handing out candles to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Scher said the show was stopped when the first fire was set near  
the East Stage, but fire officials decided it was a controllable 
ground fire and the band played on. 
</P>
<P>
	About a quarter-mile from the stage, several concertgoers then  
set fire to a dozen parked vendors' trailers and pulled cases of 
soda and merchandise from the trucks, feeding the flames with 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
	To some, it seemed like a reaction to the high food and beverage  
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it first started, there was something to it,''  
18-year-old Spencer Parker said. ``It has a little bit of meaning 
when you pay $4 for a pretzel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rioters, who fueled the fire with pieces of the plywood wall  
surrounding the site, also pulled down a large T-shirt stand, 
looted a trailer full of hardware and tipped over a car and burned 
it. All around, tents and booths also were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire and police units did not respond immediately as officials  
seemed to be caught off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where are the police? Where are the firemen? Where are the  
people in control?'' asked Ruth Mahorn, 36, of Binghamton, N.Y., as 
she walked quickly away from the disturbance with her friends. 
``These kids are animals. It should never have gotten this far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scher said the 1,250-person internal security force was not  
activated because they were not properly trained to handle a riot. 
</P>
<P>
	More than an hour after the melee began, state troopers in riot  
gear moved in, dodging lemons and oranges thrown by the crowd. They 
had moved most of the remaining 150,000 concertgoers into the 
camping area by 2 a.m. today. About 200 people remained near the 
middle of the venue, using trash cans for drums as they had since 
the concert began on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	By early today, flames inside the venue had been extinguished  
and the situation was stabilized. The effect, though, was not 
likely to go away anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're jerks,'' said Karen Thomas, 24, of Massachusetts.  
``It's been great all weekend. People were cool, and now this is 
how people will remember Woodstock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of campers missed the riot, having packed up Sunday  
morning so they could make quick getaways once their favorite band 
finished up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all have got to work in the morning,'' said Mara Kugler of  
Baldwin, N.Y., a sleeping bag tucked under her arm. 
</P>
<P>
	State police said the exodus was expected to take up to a day  
because more than 225,000 had packed the site. 
</P>
<P>
	The day had started on a more cheerful note. Slightly over 100  
people decided at daybreak that stripping was better than grabbing 
an extra hour or two of sleep and turned out for a massive nude 
photo shoot as a brilliant orange sun lit up the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to see the expressions that the photos could bring  
for decades to come,'' said Sarah Warner of Allston, Mass. 
``Picture your kid going, 'Grandma, was that you? You were hot!'''

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Feels Growing Pains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- A retired financial consultant with the  
backing of Jesse Ventura has been elected chairman of the Reform 
Party in a vote marking a dramatic shift for the fledgling party 
and defeat for its founder, Ross Perot. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Gargan, 68, of Cedar Key, Fla., won a runoff election  
213-135 yesterday over party Vice Chairwoman Patricia Benjamin of 
New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Gargan had gained momentum with the coveted endorsement of  
Ventura, Minnesota's governor and the Reform Party's 
highest-ranking elected official. 
</P>
<P>
	Gargan and Ventura have said they will not support a 2000  
presidential run by Perot, who lost presidential elections in 1992 
and 1996. The new chairman also plans to establish headquarters in 
Florida in an attempt to break away from the charismatic Dallas 
billionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	``To many people, the word Perot is magic and it is a very  
positive thing,'' Gargan said prior to the election. ``But in 
Florida, more likely than not it is a negative thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gargan succeeds outgoing party Chairman Russ Verney.  
</P>
<P>
	Though Ventura called for unity when the party opened its  
convention, the three-day gathering was marked by squabbling and 
power struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin said the party must weather such storms as part of its  
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of these things is growing pains. At this stage,  
everything is important,'' said Benjamin, of Cherry Hill, N.J. 
``This is democracy. It isn't pretty today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer delegates came to this year's convention than in the past  
two years, Gargan noted. Only 350 of the 585 delegates showed up 
for the Reform Party's weekend convention, and the party also is 
losing ballot access in some states, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gargan said the state of the party was the reason he ran for  
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want the damned job, but I've got too much at stake,''  
he said. ``I have so much at stake I'm not about to let this ship 
go down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reform Party's troubles may stem in part from its mission:  
welcoming people who want change and are disenchanted by other 
parties. That attracts so many different kinds of people that it's 
hard to develop a unified message. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have everyone, from people who think Jesse Jackson is too  
conservative to people who think Pat Buchanan is too liberal,'' 
said Tom McLaughlin, the Pennsylvania state chairman and the third 
candidate on the chairmanship ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	McLaughlin estimated that there are eight to 10 factions within  
the party. He said the party can be unified as long as its platform 
sticks to economic issues like balancing the budget, reducing the 
national debt and campaign finance reform. Social issues should be 
left for the individual candidates to decide, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all members agree with McLaughlin, however. Richard Kline, a  
Reform Party gubernatorial candidate in Missouri, joined the party 
because Democrats in his state wouldn't support his anti-abortion 
stance. He wants the Reform Party to adopt a pro-life position. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite such difficulties, the party is making some important  
strides. 
</P>
<P>
	``Minnesota in 1998 shocked the world. It is time for us to  
shock the world in the 2000 presidential election,'' Ventura 
bellowed to conventioneers by phone on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Boosted by Ventura, more and more Reform Party candidates have  
gained the courage to run for office, including gubernatorial 
candidates Gatewood Galbraith in Kentucky and Jerry Ladner in 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura couldn't come to the conference because of severe  
weather that day in Detroit, but that didn't stop rumors that he 
was avoiding the conference to set himself apart from Perot, who 
spoke to the delegates Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Party members have already discussed drafting millionaire  
developer Donald Trump and retired Gen. Colin Powell for possible 
runs. On Sunday, Ventura suggested that Republican Sen. John McCain 
of Arizona would be a good candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, McCain said that although he was ``flattered'' by  
Ventura's comments, he has no intentions of leaving the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would ask him and his supporters to consider pursuing our  
shared reform agenda through the party to which I am a proud and 
loyal member -- the Republican Party,'' McCain said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Verney, the outgoing chairman, told members not to get  
discouraged and to continue focusing on organization, communication 
and unity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the leadership skills in place, we have the  
infrastructure, and the future is ours,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Belize Jumper Faces Hurdles, Alone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Nothing seems to be going right for  
Belize's only track and field athlete in the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did Michael McKoy struggle in his only event at this  
regional Olympics, officials failed to spell his name right on the 
entry lists. 
</P>
<P>
	The phone card he bought to call home didn't work, and the scant  
media attention he earned came from the fact he represented one of 
the smallest delegations at the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Such are the travails for this tiny Central American nation's  
lonely long jumper, the only Belizean among nearly 600 track and 
field entrants. 
</P>
<P>
	While countries like Brazil, the United States and Cuba brought  
hundreds to the games, the former British colony with a population 
of about 200,000 could only send McKoy and two cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
	It's athletes like McKoy, though, and those in equally tiny  
delegations like St. Kitts and Nevis, that make events like the Pan 
Am Games unique. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not necessarily the one athlete with the most bells and  
whistles who wins,'' said Brian Koshul, the games' press secretary. 
``Every athlete adds to the luster; any country that would be 
missing would detract from the games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just getting to the Canadian heartland for the event was tough  
enough for the 21-year-old auto mechanic, who works a regular day 
before training at night. He considers Sunday his day off because 
he only has to do a 10-mile training run. 
</P>
<P>
	After all that work, McKoy was hoping to make his mother proud.  
She raised the family of seven alone ever since his father left 
when he was 7 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	``I miss her,'' he confessed. ``She's my mom and dad.''  
</P>
<P>
	The crowd roared as he approached the runway for his first jump  
-- but not for him. The fans were cheering for the men's 400-meter 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	He clapped his hands above his head, trying to persuade the  
crowd to urge him on. The smattering of spectators who noticed 
politely obliged. He charged down the runway, but a red flag 
followed him into the sand. Foul. 
</P>
<P>
	On the second jump, the crowd was focusing on the women's pole  
vault. No matter. Another foul. 
</P>
<P>
	If he fouled once more, McKoy would not have even been able to  
register a jump. The pressure was on. The crowd noticed him this 
time, stepping in for the country without a cheering section. 
</P>
<P>
	He leapt. This one was fair. The mark was 22 feet, 6 inches.  
</P>
<P>
	He finished last.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed,'' he said. ``I came here to do a job and I  
didn't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to watch the rest of the event, he sadly walked off the  
field toward the area reserved for interviews. Only moments before, 
it had been swarming with reporters following U.S. decathletes 
Chris Huffins and Daniel Steele, but only a few stragglers remained 
when McKoy walked in. 
</P>
<P>
	He stood by the rail and sheepishly admitted even losing was a  
thrill. 
</P>
<P>
	How could he forget the opening ceremony and the honor of  
walking behind his country's flag? Or the performance of the 
Snowbirds, Canada's precision flying squad? Or the torch-lighting? 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been such a pleasure,'' he said. ``A lot of guys wanted  
this spot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Track isn't such a big deal back in Belize, a tourist  
destination known for its Mayan ruins and spectacular coral reefs. 
But McKoy's countrymen were avidly following every jump. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely, he's our only representative,'' said James  
Adderly, the sports editor for Belize's Channel 5. ``We're going 
with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well aware that he would be besieged back in Belize, McKoy  
dreaded explaining why he lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I get home, they'll ask, `What did you bring back,' '' he  
said, wishing the answer was something metallic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bring back my best. I tried my best.''

<HEADLINE> Euro Rallies Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro surged to a 10-week high against the  
dollar on Monday, continuing a rally set off last week amid signs 
of an economic recovery in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose slightly against the Japanese yen, boosted by  
comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers supporting a 
strong U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0654, up  
from $1.0503 late Friday. It rose as high as $1.0724 in intraday 
trading, its highest level in 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 116.61 Japanese yen, up from  
116.55. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven European countries launched the euro with great fanfare  
on Jan. 4, but the currency has mostly struggled ever since. Last 
week, it slid to an all-time low of $1.0108. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last week, however, the euro has staged somewhat of a  
recovery, fueled by signs of renewed economic growth in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's climb was helped by comments from the future president  
of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Ernst Welteke, who said there had been 
``good economic reasons'' for the euro's fall in recent months, but 
now ``signs of an economic pickup in Europe are visible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also boosting the euro was a 0.5 percent rise in German consumer  
prices in June. That sparked speculation that the European Central 
Bank may soon boost interest rates to ward off inflationary 
pressures. Higher interest rates would make euro-based investments 
more attractive to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the yen, the dollar rose after Summers reiterated his  
support of a strong U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I have said many, many times, a strong dollar is very much  
in the interest of the U.S.,'' he said. ``That has been our policy, 
it will continue to be our policy. It is a policy that has served 
the U.S. well in promoting confidence, in reducing inflation, in 
reducing capital costs for American firms, in promoting 
capacity-creating investment. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollars also was quoted at 1.5052 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5308, and 1.5095 Canadian dollars, up from 1.5070. The British 
pound rose to $1.5906 from $1.5703. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8359 German 
marks, down from 1.8602; 6.1576 French francs, up from 6.2454.

<HEADLINE> Ike Turner Writes Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ike Turner wants to set the record straight.  
</P>
<P>
	The rhythm-and-blues entertainer has written a book, ``Takin'  
Back My Name,'' that is his rebuttal of ex-wife Tina Turner's book 
and movie ``What's Love Got to Do With It?'' Ms. Turner's book 
accused him of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``That movie gave me high notoriety. It did me no good,'' Turner  
said. ``Now people see Tina as a woman scorned. Women, when they 
get mad, they turn on you. They might say anything or do 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turner's book, due out in September, offers graphic accounts of  
drug abuse and obsessive sexual activity that started when he was 
6. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner, who was one-half of the Ike and Tina Turner Revue in the  
1960s, said: ``I'm not denying things, just telling my side of the 
story.''

<HEADLINE> Union Carbide Earnings Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DANBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Rising costs for basic materials helped  
drive Union Carbide Corp.'s second-quarter net income down to less 
than half of what the chemicals company earned in the same quarter 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were slightly below Wall Street expectations but  
Union Carbide shares were up 12 1/2 cents a share at $46 in trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company earned $56 million, or 41 cents per share, in the  
three months ended June 30, down from $118 million, or 85 cents per 
share, in 1998. First Call's survey of analysts showed they 
expected earnings of 42 cents a share on average. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell 3 percent to $1.42 billion from $1.46 billion in  
second quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rising feedstock prices -- which climbed too quickly to  
be passed along through increased selling prices -- combined with 
lower performance from joint ventures helped drag results for the 
quarter down, Chairman William Joyce said. 
</P>
<P>
	The outlook is better for the third quarter, Joyce said. Demand  
for products should be high, and selling prices are up. Although 
feedstock prices may continue to rise, the rate of increase will 
probably not be as high as in the second quarter, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of this year, Union Carbide earned $107  
million, or 79 cents per share, on sales of $2.82 billion. That's 
down from earnings of $260 million, or $1.86 per share, on sales of 
$3.02 billion in the first half of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The results for the first half of this year reflect a charge of  
$20 million, or 14 cents per share, related to a change in 
accounting principles.

<HEADLINE> Man Dropped to His Death in Wyoming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) -- A man was dangled and dropped to his death  
from a hotel window by another man who had been screaming at the 
victim before letting go of his leg, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Holloman, 39, who has no permanent address, was arrested  
Sunday night on suspicion of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Witness Manuelita Gonzalez of Denver said she and her husband  
were walking by the Idleman Hotel when they heard screaming and saw 
a man being dangled from a third-floor window by another man. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim was being punched by the man, who was screaming,  
``What did I ever do to you?'' Ms. Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
	She could hear a third man in the background begging the man to  
pull the victim back into the room. A few minutes later the man let 
go of the victim's leg and he fell, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The man hit headfirst into the ground,'' she said. ``It was  
horrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The name of the 45-year-old victim also has not been released.

<HEADLINE> Trinidad and Tobago Shifts to Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) -- When the big international oil  
companies were drilling off the coasts of Trinidad and Tobago 
decades ago, they cursed whenever they struck natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Back then, gas was the unloved stepchild to black gold.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't see it, nor can you feel it,'' said Doug Quillen,  
senior vice president of Texaco Global Gas in Houston. ``You can't 
put it in a bucket and carry it around to sell it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most companies left the stuff under the seabed. Natural gas was  
expensive to transport by ship, and no market had developed. But 
one company, Amoco, developed a gasfield in Trinidadian waters on a 
modest scale, signing a 20-year agreement to supply the country's 
new state National Gas Co. in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus was born Trinidad and Tobago's natural gas industry -- and  
it has grown into the linchpin of a burgeoning economy in the 
Caribbean nation of 1.3 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's oil reserves are expected to run out in 15 years,  
but it has proven natural gas reserves of 21.3 million cubic feet 
and probable reserves of an additional 9.4 million cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking at least another 60 years,'' said Frank Look  
Kin, president of National Gas Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in the 1970s, Trinidad recognized the potential of its gas  
reserves. The government, awash with cash from oil sales during the 
era of high-priced petroleum, encouraged gas-based industries like 
petrochemicals and steel, providing subsidies when necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	The Electricity Commission was an early convert to gas-fired  
power stations and the National Gas Co. started selling to other 
users, mainly industries needing cheap fuel. A gas-based industrial 
complex sprang up around Point Lisas on the southwestern coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Minister Finbar Gangar said at a recent energy conference  
in Trinidad that gas surpassed oil as the prime mover of Trinidad's 
economy in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to encouraging gas-using industries, Trinidad has  
become a leading supplier of ammonia and methanol, natural gas 
byproducts that are used in the production of a variety of goods, 
such as plastic bottles, paint and compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it is joining the ranks of the world's exporters of  
liquified natural gas, after luring investment to build the 
expensive treatment facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Supported by tax breaks and pre-sold supply contracts in the  
United States and Spain, a partnership was formed a few years ago 
by Amoco Trinidad, British Gas Trinidad, Repsol of Spain, Cabot LNG 
of Boston and Trinidad's state gas company to build a $1 billion 
processing plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlantic LNG plant was built in record time and under budget  
and made its first shipment this April to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said it made Trinidad the world's 11th  
liquefied natural gas-producing nation, joining such countries as 
the United States, Qatar and Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's government granted generous incentives, giving  
Atlantic LNG a 10-year tax holiday, although the plant is still 
expected to generate $4 billion to $6 billion in tax revenues over 
the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The country is encouraging other industrial development tied to  
its gas supplies. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
	--Norsk Hydro of Norway plans to build a $1.6 billion aluminum  
smelter that will eclipse Atlantic LNG as the largest investment in 
the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	--Phoenix Park, at Point Lisas, recently finished a $155 million  
expansion, making it one of the hemisphere's largest gas-processing 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
	--Titan Methanol's second plant is scheduled to begin operations  
soon, making Trinidad the world's largest methanol exporter. 
</P>
<P>
	--One of the world's largest iron producers, Companhia Vale do  
Rio Doce of Brazil, wants to build a multi-facility ``steel 
district'' that reportedly would include an ethylene plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our mission is to become the most investment-friendly country  
in the Western Hemisphere,'' Prime Minister Basdeo Panday said at a 
recent energy conference in Trinidad.

<HEADLINE> Film Takes New Browns To the Past </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- The Browns are the first expansion team in  
NFL history with a history. And before taking the field for the 
first time, the new Browns learned about the old Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Chris Palmer wants his players to understand and respect  
the franchise's storied past. So on Saturday night, during the 
team's first training camp meeting, he showed a film that 
chronicled more than a half-century of Cleveland football memories. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gave me chills,'' cornerback Ray Jackson said. ``It was  
great. I had no idea they were the first team to win a Monday night 
game. That got me fired up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the eight-minute video, ``This Is Cleveland Browns  
Football,'' players watched black-and-white footage of Otto Graham 
throwing pinpoint scoring passes in the 1940s and 50s when Paul 
Brown's teams dominated the All-American Football Conference and 
later the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Some were awestruck as fullback Marion Motley bulldozed  
tacklers, lost his helmet and went the final 15 yards for a 
touchdown. They saw Jim Brown and Leroy Kelly run around and away 
from defenses in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	There was Brian Sipe leading the '70s Browns in another  
comeback, and Bernie Kosar threading a TD pass to Webster Slaughter 
in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
	And after a final image of the Dawg Pound, Cleveland's rabid  
end-zone contingent of fans, the film closed with the words: ``The 
Cleveland Browns, to be continued ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Chris Spielman said he recognized all the Browns  
greats in the video except Hall of Fame defensive end Len Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm bummed out about that, too,'' Spielman said. ``I'll get  
that corrected, believe me. I'll know everything about Len before 
the week is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It seems rookie quarterback Tim Couch has a lot more to learn  
about Cleveland football history. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the film session, Couch turned to fellow quarterback Ty  
Detmer with an important question. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Where's their face masks at?''' Detmer said.  
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the full roster of 89 players practiced together for  
the first time. And for the first time since camp opened for the 
rookies last Thursday, players were in full pads and hitting. 
</P>
<P>
	As the players walked from the locker room shortly after 8 a.m.,  
they were cheered by nearly 2,000 fans with the loudest ovation 
reserved for Spielman, an Ohio football great. 
</P>
<P>
	He hasn't played a down in the NFL since midway through the 1997  
season when he was sidelined while with Buffalo. He planned to come 
back last year after neck surgery, but sat out the season to be 
with his wife as she battled breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's humbling,'' Spielman, a four-time Pro Bowler, said of the  
greeting. ``It's nice. It was kind of welcome back home and a 
welcome back to playing. It's something I'm going to remember for a 
long time. I've never had that before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Browns fans have been hungry for football, and after a  
three-year wait they finally got to see real-live players knock 
each other around. 
</P>
<P>
	``That first thud, that's what Cleveland has been waiting to  
hear,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the afternoon session, Spielman was involved in a violent  
collision with fullback Tarek Saleh. Spielman was slow getting up 
and staggered back to the huddle. 
</P>
<P>
	Following practice, Spielman walked the length of the practice  
field -- alone with no one else around -- and hit the blocking sled 
and tackling dummy several times. At first, there was speculation 
Spielman was checking his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I had to put some more air in my helmet and I was just  
testing it out,'' Spielman said. ``A whack like that feels good. I 
hadn't had one of those in a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Antonio Langham, selected in the expansion draft, is  
one of three former Browns -- Jerry Ball and Orlando Brown are the 
others -- who is also a member of the new Browns. Langham has been 
in town for months but said it wasn't until Sunday's practice that 
he felt he had truly returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until you put the pads on and you see those fans,'' he said.  
``I'm back now. It's Cleveland football again. Your blood starts to 
bleed brown again.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Computer Business Grows Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif (AP) -- Compaq Computer, struggling with  
executive turmoil and sharp competition, barely held its three-year 
lead as the top personal computer vendor in the world during the 
second quarter of 1999, according to market research companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compaq certainly has some issues. They weren't really prepared  
for this whole subsidized free PC marketing blitz that happened,'' 
said International Data Corp. analyst Christine Arrington in 
Framingham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	After leading the industry with inexpensive personal computers  
in the early 1990s, Compaq's profits have plunged as competition 
has flourished in the low-end market, and Internet services are 
giving away PCs to people who sign up for their services. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, released Monday, show that worldwide shipments rose  
25.6 million, a 27 percent increase over the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq managed to capture 14.6 percent of the worldwide market,  
but in the U.S. Compaq retained a very narrow lead -- one-third of 
one percent -- over arch rival Dell Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In the U.S., Dell's unit volume increased 55 percent as the  
company expanded. IBM rose to the No. 3 spot in the U.S. reporting 
70 percent growth over the same period last year, according to IDC. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Smulders, a senior analyst at Dataquest Inc. in San  
Jose, said international growth reflected recovering markets in 
Asia and South America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demand in the Asia-Pacific region was driven by a return in  
business confidence together with Internet-related consumer PC 
demand,'' he said. ``The Latin America market also did well as the 
Brazilian market shows signs of recovering from the exchange rate 
crisis in January and continued strength in Mexico.''

<HEADLINE> House of Blues Buys Universal Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- House of Blues Entertainment said Monday it  
is buying Universal's live-music unit for $190 million, acquiring a 
promotion business that includes 20 concert sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is part of a selloff of some assets by Universal  
Concerts owner Seagram Co., which is trying to raise cash and 
reduce debt after its $10 billion purchase of PolyGram music. The 
companies said the sale should close by the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will nearly quadruple the number of concert venues for  
House of Blues. The Los Angeles-based company now has seven House 
of Blues sites around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Universal owns, operates or has exclusive booking arrangements  
for 20 concert sites in the United States and Canada, including 
Molson Park in Toronto, the Blossom Music Center in Cleveland and 
the Gorge near Seattle. The deal includes Universal's interests in 
19 of those venues. Seagram will retain ownership of the Universal 
Amphitheatre on the lot of Universal Studios Hollywood and lease 
the concert site to House of Blues. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating those venues will broaden concert-promotion options  
for House of Blues, whose show sites now are clubs that hold about 
1,000 to 2,000 people, said Greg Trojan, House of Blues president 
and chief executive officer. Universal's venues include many larger 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can go to artists and labels and say, 'We can put you on  
tour in this wonderful group of venues and media properties under 
our great House brand name,''' Trojan said. ``It's a wonderful 
combination of assets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal also gives Universal the option to buy up to 1 percent  
of privately owned House of Blues. GetMusic.com, operated by 
Universal and BMG, also will have an online partnership with House 
of Blues Web efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good for us not only because of the cash but because of  
this relationship we'll have with House of Blues,'' said Seagram 
spokeswoman Anita Larsen. 
</P>
<P>
	Universal Concerts is a profitable business but it was among the

PolyGram deal last year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Marciano, president of Universal Concerts, and other  
management and employees will stay on to run the business for House 
of Blues. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will help House of Blues become an all-purpose music  
company, said Lou Mann, president of House of Blues media 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
	The company can start up-and-coming performers in its small  
clubs, move them up to larger amphitheaters and promote them 
through its radio network, ``House of Blues'' TV show, record label 
and music downloaded from its Web site, Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like to think we can take an artist from cradle to grave,''  
Mann said.

<HEADLINE> Old, Young Win Gold in Pan Am Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- At 21 years old, sprinter Bernard  
Williams still has plenty of spring in his legs. 
</P>
<P>
	At 39, Johnny Gray showed he still has something left, too.  
</P>
<P>
	The two U.S. runners at the opposite end of the track and field  
age spectrum both earned gold medals Sunday at the Pan American 
Games as Princess Anne watched in a sold-out stadium on a perfect, 
cloudless evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, whose sole claim to fame had been winning the national  
junior college championship this year, sped to a victory in the 100 
meters, beating a field that lacked Canadian star Donovan Bailey, 
but included teammate Tim Harden, the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this shows that we have young athletes that are  
capable of running and winning titles,'' said Williams, who signed 
with Florida after competing at Barton County (Kansas) Community 
College. ``Each year I'm trying to get a title, and that's like a 
stepping stone to the Olympics. That is my ultimate goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray knows about the Olympics. He already has competed in four  
and is hoping to make it five next year in Sydney. The man younger 
runners call ``Mr. Gray'' won the 800, nipping Cuba's Norberto 
Tellez in a thrilling stretch run. 
</P>
<P>
	His time of 1:45.38 was fairly ordinary, but he did win. And the  
guy is 39, after all. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're young, all you think about is time,'' said Gray, a  
Los Angeles native who trains in Santa Monica, Calif. ``Throughout 
the years, I have found out winning is more important. It's not the 
only thing. I don't want all those youngsters reading that Johnny 
Gray says winning is the only thing. But you do compete to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray competed quite well on this night. He and Tellez, 27, ran  
stride for stride down the straightaway and at the last instant, 
Gray leaned to beat the Cuban by .02 seconds. Although the judges 
took a couple of minutes to determine the winner, Gray set out on 
his victory lap anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``With my experience, you take the victory lap and they'll give  
it to you,'' he said with a sly grin. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray has been around so long he has a 16-year-old son. That's  
only three years younger than one of Gray's teammates, Angela 
Williams, the silver medalist in the women's 100. 
</P>
<P>
	``My 16-year-old is a basketball player. All he can do is  
dribble and shoot 3-pointers,'' Gray said. ``I tell him that real 
men run the 800 meters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Williams ran 10.08, just .02 off the Games record, to  
become the first American to win the Pan Ams 100 since Lee McRae in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time,'' Williams said. ``That meant a lot to me, to  
work hard and get that gold medal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harden, who has a personal best of 9.92, couldn't overcome a  
slow start and finished fourth in 10.19. 
</P>
<P>
	The victories by Gray and Williams came the day after U.S. men's  
track coach Ralph Lindeman, 48, was hospitalized with chest pains. 
He was being held for observation Sunday at Victoria Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's Ivan Pedroso shook off fouls on his first two jumps -- one  
more and he would have been out of the competition -- to win the 
long jump with a leap of 28 feet, the third best jump in the world 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In other men's events, Chris Huffins and Daniel Steele of the  
United States finished 1-2 in the decathlon, Huffins scoring 8,170 
points and Steele 8,070, and Danny McCray of the United States won 
the silver medal in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele's total qualified him for the world championships next  
month. Huffins, a two-time U.S. champion, had qualified earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Angela Williams, who won the NCAA championship for Southern  
California in June, aggravated her left hamstring just before the 
race and was icing it afterward as she sat on the ground chatting 
with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trainer told me not to run,'' she said. ``But I did not  
come this far, this is my last competition of the season, I was 
going to run. I have a lot of pride. I did not want to be the one 
where they say the U.S. stepped out of the race. Even though it was 
legitimate, that's not me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra Sturrup, who trains with U.S. star Marion Jones in  
Raleigh, N.C., beat Williams to give the Bahamas its first-ever 
gold in Pan Ams track. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamaica's Greg Haughton won the men's 400 with a season-best of  
44.59, Vanderlei Lima of Brazil earned the gold in the marathon at 
2:17:20, and Joel Bourgeois of Canada won the 3,000 steeplechase in 
8:35.03. 
</P>
<P>
	In women's events, Osleidys Menedez of Cuba set a Pan Ams record  
in winning the javelin at 216-0, Letitia Vriesde of Surinam won the 
800 in 1:59.095, and Mexico's Ana Guevera took the 400 in 50.91. 
Argentina's Alejandra Garcia won the first pole vault competition 
for women, clearing 14-1 1/4.

<HEADLINE>  Canada Beats U.S. in Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Who needs major leaguers when you get  
excitement, controversy and an incredible ending? 
</P>
<P>
	After a 30-minute delay over a rulings dispute, Canada scored  
four runs in the bottom of the 11th inning Monday to stun the 
United States 7-6 in baseball at the Pan American Games. The 
winning run scored when Stubby Clapp's routine popup with the bases 
loaded and two outs fell in short left field because of a 
miscommunication between American fielders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to lose any time when you feel like you played hard  
all game long, you go up by three and go two outs,'' said U.S. 
manager Buddy Bell, whose team of minor league players was not made 
available to comment after the loss. ``You just pretty much figure 
things will work out the way you want them to. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I have been in this game long enough to know better than  
that. We are quite disappointed at this point, but we will get over 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Travis Dawkins seemed to be under the ball when left  
fielder Shawn Gilbert called him off. But Gilbert couldn't reach 
the ball, and the Canadian team had a critical victory in the 
tournament that serves as a qualifier for the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada tied it on a three-run homer by Andy Stewart off U.S.  
pitcher Scott Stewart earlier in the 11th. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian manager Ernie Whitt was ejected in the top of the  
inning during a lengthy argument over rules. 
</P>
<P>
	After the U.S. team went ahead 6-3 on Jason Hardtke's two-run  
homer, Whitt walked to the mound to talk with pitcher Chad 
Ricketts. But because he had exceeded the number of free trips 
allowed in a game, Whitt was told that Ricketts must leave. 
</P>
<P>
	A 20-minute discussion ensued, turned heated and Whitt was  
ejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitt protested and after the umpires consulted with  
international baseball officials, a meeting was held under the 
grandstands. The protest was disallowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess they make the rules as they go,'' Whitt said.  
``Needless to say I am still upset about it, but it's nice to come 
back to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. men's track and field coach Ralph Lindeman was sent home to  
Colorado Springs at the advice of doctors after being hospitalized 
with chest pains. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindeman was held for observation Saturday night and Sunday in  
Victoria Hospital, then advised to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not life threatening,'' said Lindeman, 48, the track  
coach at the Air Force Academy. ``It's precautionary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Harvey Glance took over as head coach.  
</P>
<P>
	The United States claimed the gold and bronze medals in  
individual all-around women's gymnastics to help ease the sting of 
a disappointing second-place finish to Canada in Saturday's team 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan White, 16, one of the youngest members of the entire U.S.  
delegation, took the gold with a score of 37.649, edging Canada's 
Michelle Conway by .031 points. Jennie Thompson won the bronze 
despite falling off the balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
	In third place heading into the final rotation, White scored a  
9.525 on the uneven bars to jump into the lead. Conway, who had 
been leading, managed only a 9.156 in her final event, the vault. 
</P>
<P>
	The American women survived a rugged water polo match with Cuba,  
winning 10-5 but emerging from the pool with bruises, scratches and 
torn bathing suits. Maureen O'Toole had a hat trick. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very physical game,'' Heather Moody said. ``We didn't  
notice that in their play when we watched them two days ago, but 
they really took it out on us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico finished 1-2 in both race walks. Bernardo Segura, who was  
disqualified during the 1995 games, beat Daniel Garcia in the men's 
20-kilometer event. Graciela Mendoza beat Maria Sanchez for the 
women's gold, with Michelle Rohl, the U.S. champion and 1995 Pan 
Ams silver medalist, third.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Gamble, Signing Phillips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) -- Putting their needs on the field ahead  
of his history of trouble, the San Francisco 49ers on Monday signed 
running back Lawrence Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hope is that his deep troubles are behind him,'' general  
manager Bill Walsh said in announcing the signing at the University 
of the Pacific, where the team opened its training camp. ``Lawrence 
will come to the 49ers with a clean slate, as far as football is 
concerned. I expect him to do quite well here. I think you'll find 
him to be very pleasant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips was signed to two-year deal worth $1.75 million,  
including a $425,000 signing bonus. He can earn more through 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	At least some of that money will be going to the league to pay a  
fine for violating the NFL's violent crime policy. Commissioner 
Paul Tagliabue, in a meeting with Phillips two weeks ago, cleared 
him to play, but told him he would be subject to the fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Phillips: ``This is a great opportunity. I don't intend to  
screw it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh conceded the 49ers were taking a chance on a player whose  
career is in jeopardy after he was released by two NFL teams in 
less than a year. But he denied it was a panic move by a team that 
lost its top running back, Garrison Hearst, to a potentially 
career-threatening injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this a desperate move? Hardly,'' Walsh said. ``It's a  
business move, one we've thoroughly researched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that he believes he's a risk worth taking.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would sign myself, yes,'' said Phillips when asked to put  
himself in an NFL general manager's shoes. ``I don't see this as a 
risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To those who continue to believe he'll only bring problems,  
Phillips said, ``All you can do is try to prove them wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rap sheet on Phillips is long and disturbing, however.  
</P>
<P>
	Phillips pleaded no-contest to assaulting a former girlfriend in  
college, was arrested three times during 19 months with the St. 
Louis Rams and was released by the Miami Dolphins four weeks after 
a woman claimed he struck her when she refused to dance with him in 
a nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	But Phillips' strong performance in NFL Europe sparked renewed  
interest, and the 49ers edged Buffalo in bidding for him. Some 
teams in need of running backs, Cleveland and Baltimore among them, 
were leery and chose to not pursue him. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said he thinks the 49ers can provide a good environment  
for Phillips. But he also said he has warned Phillips he will be 
cut at the first sign of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old running back will try to fill the void left by  
the loss of Hearst. Hearst had surgery Saturday to treat 
circulatory complications following a broken left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst was San Francisco's most dynamic threat last season,  
rushing for a team-record 1,570 yards. He was hurt on the first 
play during last January's playoff loss at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers hope Hearst can return in early December, but coach  
Steve Mariucci said the team must be prepared to play this season 
without him. 
</P>
<P>
	With no capable backup -- the team allowed Terry Kirby to leave  
as a free agent -- the 49ers added running backs Charlie Garner and 
Travis Jervey and put aside their misgivings about Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers also filled a need on their defensive line Monday when  
Reggie McGrew, the former Florida star and and the 49ers' top draft 
pick last April, signed a seven-year, $7.4 million contract. The 
deal included a $2.5 million signing bonus and will void after four 
years if McGrew meets certain playing time clauses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams made Phillips the sixth overall selection in the 1996  
draft despite his record of violence at Nebraska. While on 
probation at Nebraska, he was arrested for drunken driving in 
California, leading to a 23-day jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Rams, he was a bust on the field. Coach Dick Vermeil,  
tired of repeated fines for missed meetings and other disciplinary 
problems, cut Phillips in November 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips signed with Miami in December 1997, but never  
established himself. He was cut a year ago, soon after the 
nightclub episode. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to save his career, Phillips joined Barcelona of NFL  
Europe and became the league's first 1,000-yard rusher. He 
reportedly has embraced religion and become a vegetarian, dropping 
more than 20 pounds to become a lighter, faster back. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh, while once discussing draft philosophies, said he would  
never have drafted Phillips because of his problems. But he says 
circumstances are different. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made some strong statements in the past about people like  
Lawrence Phillips being on a team, and I feel like George Bush 
saying, `Read my lips. No new taxes,''' Walsh said last week. ``But 
times change, he's changed, and we have a need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By completing the negotiations with McGrew, the 49ers ensured he  
will be on hand for the team's first training camp workout Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reggie wanted to play. He's not about holding out,'' coach  
Steve Mariucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco is counting on the 6-foot-1, 300-pound McGrew to  
step in at defensive tackle in place of Bryant Young, who broke his 
right leg during a Nov. 30 game against the New York Giants. Young 
plans to play with the metal rod that doctors inserted in his leg 
to stabilize it but he's not expected to return until midseason.

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Threaten Montana Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUSSELSHELL, Mont. (AP) -- Erratic winds and rising temperatures  
had hundreds of firefighters working hard Monday to contain a fire 
that threatened a small ranch town in central Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildfires also burned in California and parts of several other  
Western states. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews discovered Monday that the Musselshell County range fires  
in Montana, which have been burning for two days, was twice as big 
as they thought at 33,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	The town of Musselshell has a population of 50.  
</P>
<P>
	``We can't say the town's out of danger,'' said fire information  
officer Mary Lunsford. ``The winds are changing so fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven fires were started by lightning Saturday night. By Monday  
they burned together into five and were within a mile of the town. 
Firefighters commonly treat such groups of fires as a single unit, 
and the fires often merge into a single big blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, firefighters battled a pair of wildfires that  
have burned more than 17,000 acres of bush and brush in remote 
areas of San Bernardino and Santa Barbara counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Some livestock were killed and two unoccupied mobile homes were  
destroyed Sunday when a 2,800-acre blaze roared across a sparsely 
populated high desert and mountain area near Cajon Pass in San 
Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the West, mostly small fires burned in parts of  
Colorado, Idaho, Utah and Wyoming.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: $1B More for Vets' Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House today agreed to seek an  
additional $1 billion for veterans' health programs after criticism 
that its budget would result in major cutbacks in staff and 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase was announced by Vice President Al Gore, who is  
seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. He said he talked 
with the leaders of veterans' service organizations last March 
``about what we could do to improve veterans' benefits in our 
budget. I heard those concerns and I believe today's announcement 
is an important step in addressing them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No budget increases had been planned for the VA in the fiscal  
year starting Oct. 1. President Clinton's budget request had 
proposed $18 billion to provide medical care for America's 
veterans; some veterans groups say the figure should be at least 
$21 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent survey by Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., found that 20  
of the 22 VA health care networks would be short of money if 
Congress accepted the administration's budget proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans groups, citing the steady aging of the nation's  
veterans population and the increased health care needs of those 
who served in World War II and the Korean War, estimate the 
administration budget is $3 billion short of what is needed.

<HEADLINE> Film Takes New Browns To the Past </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- The Browns are the first expansion team in  
NFL history with a history. And before taking the field for the 
first time, the new Browns learned about the old Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Chris Palmer wants his players to understand and respect  
the franchise's storied past. So on Saturday night, during the 
team's first training camp meeting, he showed a film that 
chronicled more than a half-century of Cleveland football memories. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gave me chills,'' cornerback Ray Jackson said. ``It was  
great. I had no idea they were the first team to win a Monday night 
game. That got me fired up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the eight-minute video, ``This Is Cleveland Browns  
Football,'' players watched black-and-white footage of Otto Graham 
throwing pinpoint scoring passes in the 1940s and 50s when Paul 
Brown's teams dominated the All-American Football Conference and 
later the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Some were awestruck as fullback Marion Motley bulldozed  
tacklers, lost his helmet and went the final 15 yards for a 
touchdown. They saw Jim Brown and Leroy Kelly run around and away 
from defenses in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	There was Brian Sipe leading the '70s Browns in another  
comeback, and Bernie Kosar threading a TD pass to Webster Slaughter 
in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
	And after a final image of the Dawg Pound, Cleveland's rabid  
end-zone contingent of fans, the film closed with the words: ``The 
Cleveland Browns, to be continued ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Chris Spielman said he recognized all the Browns  
greats in the video except Hall of Fame defensive end Len Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm bummed out about that, too,'' Spielman said. ``I'll get  
that corrected, believe me. I'll know everything about Len before 
the week is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It seems rookie quarterback Tim Couch has a lot more to learn  
about Cleveland football history. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the film session, Couch turned to fellow quarterback Ty  
Detmer with an important question. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Where's their face masks at?''' Detmer said.  
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the full roster of 89 players practiced together for  
the first time. And for the first time since camp opened for the 
rookies last Thursday, players were in full pads and hitting. 
</P>
<P>
	As the players walked from the locker room shortly after 8 a.m.,  
they were cheered by nearly 2,000 fans with the loudest ovation 
reserved for Spielman, an Ohio football great. 
</P>
<P>
	He hasn't played a down in the NFL since midway through the 1997  
season when he was sidelined while with Buffalo. He planned to come 
back last year after neck surgery, but sat out the season to be 
with his wife as she battled breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's humbling,'' Spielman, a four-time Pro Bowler, said of the  
greeting. ``It's nice. It was kind of welcome back home and a 
welcome back to playing. It's something I'm going to remember for a 
long time. I've never had that before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Browns fans have been hungry for football, and after a  
three-year wait they finally got to see real-live players knock 
each other around. 
</P>
<P>
	``That first thud, that's what Cleveland has been waiting to  
hear,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the afternoon session, Spielman was involved in a violent  
collision with fullback Tarek Saleh. Spielman was slow getting up 
and staggered back to the huddle. 
</P>
<P>
	Following practice, Spielman walked the length of the practice  
field -- alone with no one else around -- and hit the blocking sled 
and tackling dummy several times. At first, there was speculation 
Spielman was checking his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I had to put some more air in my helmet and I was just  
testing it out,'' Spielman said. ``A whack like that feels good. I 
hadn't had one of those in a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Antonio Langham, selected in the expansion draft, is  
one of three former Browns -- Jerry Ball and Orlando Brown are the 
others -- who is also a member of the new Browns. Langham has been 
in town for months but said it wasn't until Sunday's practice that 
he felt he had truly returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until you put the pads on and you see those fans,'' he said.  
``I'm back now. It's Cleveland football again. Your blood starts to 
bleed brown again.''

<HEADLINE> Chargers' QB Likely Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Ryan Leaf had surgery Monday to repair a tear  
in his throwing shoulder, and the San Diego Chargers say he's 
likely to miss the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-year quarterback could be ready to play in 3-4 months  
if his rehabilitation goes well, but the Chargers aren't inclined 
to keep a roster spot open for him that long. Leaf, who dropped all 
the way to third string by the start of training camp, is expected 
to be put on the injured reserve list sometime before the season 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't made the decision, but it's likely we'll go to  
IR,'' general manager Bobby Beathard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a long time, and to carry a guy that long on  
the roster is unlikely,'' said coach Mike Riley, who already is 
anticipating tough decisions on how many players to carry at 
running back, fullback and tight end. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf hurt his right shoulder diving on a fumble during a  
voluntary workout in June. He aggravated it throwing a deep pass 
during the first few minutes of the opening practice of training 
camp on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	During Monday's 30-minute arthroscopic surgery, team doctors  
used three tacks to repair the torn labrum, trainer James Collins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said Leaf needs to be consistent in his rehabilitation.  
Veteran quarterback Erik Kramer, signed by the Chargers on 
Thursday, had a similar injury last year and said the rehab was 
grueling. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf hasn't always proven to be reliable during his brief,  
stormy NFL career. He supposedly fell asleep in team meetings last 
year, and caused grumbling among his teammates when, despite his 
atrocious rookie season, he skipped the first three days of the 
voluntary workouts in June to play in some charity golf 
tournaments. He also skipped some special passing drills Riley set 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's young, so that's going to be another part of the learning  
process of being a pro athlete,'' Riley said. ``It takes a lot of 
self-discipline, and Ryan's young and is learning how to do that. 
So obviously have to help him with that as far as staying on top of 
it ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if you're gone for three weeks, guys lose track of what  
they're doing, and then when they come back, it's like, `You should 
know that.' But it's not that easy when they're not physically a 
part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said Leaf will have to wear a sling for two weeks and  
then will be able to begin his rehab. He won't begin throwing until 
at least a couple months into rehab. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf, given an $11.25 million signing bonus after being taken as  
the second pick overall in the 1998 draft, was benched after nine 
starts. He threw 15 interceptions, two touchdown passes and lost 
four fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, defensive end Israel Ifeanyichukwu is scheduled for  
surgery Tuesday to repair torn cartilage and a partially torn 
anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. He was hurt in 
Saturday's practice and will be gone for the season.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Doesn't Expect To Upset Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) -- Just because the United States beat  
Brazil last year, don't expect another upset when they play 
Wednesday night in the FIFA Confederations Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just happened to be one of those special nights,'' said  
goalkeeper Kasey Keller, the star of the Americans' 1-0 win at the 
Rose Bowl in the CONCACAF Gold Cup. ``I'm not expecting to have the 
same performance. If I did it would be very unrealistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, which lost to France in last summer's World Cup final,  
is coming off a victory in South America's soccer championship 
earlier this month and a 4-0 rout of Germany in the first game of 
this tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing against the best team in the world,'' U.S. coach  
Bruce Arena said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Brazilians were especially impressive because the  
team has a system of play that transcends any one player. The 
Brazilians came to the Confederations Cup without many of their big 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``They continue to look like a great team regardless of who's on  
the field,'' Arena said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. players said they knew what they were up against, and would  
do their best to prevent the Brazilians from creating scoring 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to be very focused mentally and very  
strong physically,'' said midfielder Cobi Jones, who played in the 
U.S. win against Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilians, meanwhile, said they were mindful of their  
history with the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``That adversary has always been difficult for our country,''  
defender Serginho said. ``By tradition, the U.S. team has always 
been complicated for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the Brazilians weren't worrying about the stars who  
stayed home, a group that includes Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Roberto Carlos 
and Cafu. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a family here,'' Serginho said. ``Independent of which  
players came or didn't come, the level stays the same.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves New Use of Seizure Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An epilepsy drug used by adults was approved  
Monday for use as an add-on therapy for young patients with 
partial-onset seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration allowed the new use of the  
drug, topiramate, for pediatric patients ages 2 to 16 who suffer 
from partial-onset seizures, one of 20 types of seizure disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	Extending the use of topiramate to pediatric patients is an  
important advance for treatment of children with epilepsy, Epilepsy 
Foundation officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Uncontrolled partial seizures may severely impact a child's  
intellectual and social development,'' said Dr. Steven C. 
Schachter, chairman of the Epilepsy Foundation medical advisory 
board. ``We're pleased that there now is another treatment option 
for helping to bring such seizures in young patients under better 
control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drugs already are prescribed to treat pediatric epilepsy  
patients, but topiramate is the first of a new generation of 
anti-epileptic drugs approved for partial-onset seizures for 
patients as young as 2, the FDA said. About 750,000 pediatric 
patients have partial onset seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug's most common side effects, when used as an add-on  
therapy with other drugs, include drowsiness, loss of appetite, 
fatigue, nervousness, weight loss, aggressive reaction and 
difficulty with concentration and memory. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2.3 million Americans have epilepsy, about a third  
children. About 500,000 patients achieve full seizure control with 
medication, and another 1 million get partial relief. About 600,000 
patients have seizures that do not respond to drugs, the Epilepsy 
Foundation said. 
</P>
<P>
	Topiramate is marketed for adult patients under the brand name  
Topamax, manufactured by Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceuticals of Raritan, 
N.J.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former ``Melrose Place'' stars Josie Bissett  
and Rob Estes are new parents. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Source: Man Admits Calif. Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A motel handyman suspected  
of decapitating a naturalist and killing three Yosemite sightseers 
has confessed to the four slayings, law enforcement sources told 
The Associated Press on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner confessed to last week's beheading of naturalist  
Joie Ruth Armstrong, according to an FBI affidavit. He provided 
details about the killing that only police knew about, the 
affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner is also the prime suspect in the killings of sightseers  
Carole Sund, her daughter Juli and family friend Silvina Pelosso, 
whose bodies were found earlier this year, police said. Law 
enforcement sources speaking on the condition of anonymity said 
Stayner confessed to those killings also. 
</P>
<P>
	Many were relieved to hear of the Saturday arrest.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable that they can be connected and in such a  
beautiful place and under such tragic circumstances,'' said Kim 
Petersen, a volunteer for a foundation set up in memory of one of 
the sightseers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's horrible and I just hope that this is the end of it for  
all of them. That this can't happen anymore,'' Petersen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, 37, said nothing at a court appearance Monday in  
Sacramento, where a federal magistrate ordered him held pending 
arraignment in Fresno on Aug. 6. Dressed in an orange jumpsuit, 
husky and clean-cut, Stayner nodded when asked if he understood the 
FBI's complaint. The magistrate ordered a public defender 
appointed. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner had been questioned months ago in the death of the  
sightseers but was ruled out as a suspect. An investigator 
acknowledged that the arrest had made him question whether Ms. 
Armstrong's murder could have been prevented. 
</P>
<P>
	``I struggled with that issue for the last 24 hours and I  
continue to do so,'' said James Maddock, agent in charge of the FBI 
office in Sacramento. ``I'm confident we've done everything that 
reasonably could have been done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner worked and lived outside the park in El Portal at the  
Cedar Lodge where the sightseers were last seen and Ms. Armstrong 
was an occasional visitor. 
</P>
<P>
	He came under suspicion in Ms. Armstrong's death because his  
sport utility vehicle was spotted near her remote cabin an hour 
after she was last seen alive there Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice Thursday, park rangers and sheriff's deputies questioned  
Stayner and searched his car. Once, they grabbed his backpack to 
look for Ms. Armstrong's head, the FBI affidavit said. Nothing 
turned up -- Ms. Armstrong's head was later found near her body -- 
and Stayner was let go. 
</P>
<P>
	After Stayner failed to show up for work Friday -- his first  
absence in a year and a half -- FBI agents looked for him again. He 
was tracked down Saturday at Laguna del Sol, a nudist colony near 
Sacramento, after someone there recognized him from news reports 
and called authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner then confessed to the agents, the FBI said.  
</P>
<P>
	Maddock said that agents now believe there is a connection  
between the murders, with one possible tie being the way one of the 
sightseers was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Juli Sund's throat was cut so deeply that she was nearly  
decapitated, The Modesto Bee reported Monday, citing law 
enforcement sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, after Ms. Armstrong's body was found along a stream  
near her home, authorities said they did not believe there was a 
connection to the February slayings of the three sightseers. 
Maddock said at the time that he believed most of those responsible 
for the sightseers' deaths were behind bars on unrelated charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stayner name already is indelibly etched in the annals of  
California crime. 
</P>
<P>
	His younger brother Steven Stayner was kidnapped off a Merced  
street in 1972 and raised for seven years by a man who sexually 
abused him. Steven finally escaped and was reunited with his 
family. The story inspired a TV miniseries but had a tragic ending: 
In 1989 he died at age 24 in a hit-and-run motorcycle accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner's uncle Jesse Stayner, died a year later after being  
shot by his own gun. The Merced County sheriff's office has 
reopened the case, considering Cary Stayner as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	People who knew Cary Stayner in El Portal said he was friendly  
but didn't seem to have close friends. He would often go to nude 
beaches and sunbathe naked in Yosemite, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron Ludwig, 16, who works at the town's only gas station, said  
that despite Stayner's good looks, he never had dates or talked 
about any girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time I talked with him he said he was on a dry  
spell,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner was first hired at the Cedar Lodge in August 1997. He  
took care of mechanical and electrical breakdowns, and carried a 
radio so he could be contacted by the front desk should anyone ask 
for towels, an extra cot, or some other need. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner rented a room above the restaurant and ate there  
regularly. He wasn't violent in any way, and his criminal record 
appears limited to drug charges, four of them filed in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some tourists in Yosemite said that despite Stayner's  
arrest, questions about the case left them jittery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely extra precautious of my surroundings and aware  
of my environment,'' said Shannon Schirack, 29, from Canton, Ohio, 
spending a few days at the park with friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're more on edge not knowing whether the case has been  
solved.''

<HEADLINE> Christian Group Opens Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHEATON, Ill. (AP) -- Exodus International, a Seattle-based  
organization that claims homosexuals can be converted to change 
their sexual behavior, opened its annual conference Monday night 
while protesters planned to rally outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Exodus International, which began in 1976, burst into public  
notice a year ago with full-page ads in major newspapers 
proclaiming its belief that gays and lesbians can change. 
Conservative groups such as the Christian Coalition helped pay for 
the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Exodus teaches that ``freedom from homosexuality is possible  
through repentance and faith in Jesus Christ'' and seeks to provide 
help for ``men and women who desire to overcome their 
homosexuality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conference, a mixture of training workshops and  
inspirational rallies, is meeting at Wheaton College, a prominent 
Evangelical Protestant school, but is not sponsored by the college. 
</P>
<P>
	A protest was called for Monday night by Chicago-area members of  
the Metropolitan Community Churches, a denomination for 
homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Exodus has a right to their message, and we will continue to  
proclaim that God loves us just as we are,'' said Cynthia 
Marquardt, member of an MCC congregation in Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
	She said sexual conversion is impossible and that Exodus'  
message contributes to violence against gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	Exodus is a federation of 131 independent ministries located in  
38 states and the District of Columbia, plus several overseas 
affiliates. The organization is staffed by people from a variety of 
Christian denominations. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the group's leaders say they used to be gay or lesbian  
and merely offer options to people that want them. 
</P>
<P>
	Exodus is closely aligned with Homosexuals Anonymous, a  
twelve-step movement patterned after Alcoholics Anonymous, and with 
the the National Association for Research and Therapy of 
Homosexuality, made up of psychological counselors who work for 
change through ``reparative therapy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the American Psychiatric Association and American  
Psychological Association have denounced Christian-based reparative 
therapy, saying it doesn't work and can cause psychological damage.

<HEADLINE> Elliott's Brother May Be Donor Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- San Antonio Spurs forward Sean Elliott said  
Monday that a member of his family is a possibility for a match to 
provide him with a kidney transplant, although it is still too 
early to know for sure. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott said in a statement released by the Spurs that more  
tests are necessary, and at this point it's premature to make 
predictions as to whether a match will be found. 
</P>
<P>
	KSAT-TV reported earlier Monday that one of Elliott's two  
brothers had a compatible kidney. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Antonio television station quoted a source close to  
Elliott for the story. The station did not report which brother, 
Noel or Robert, was the match. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, 31, headed to Mexico on vacation after last week's  
announcement that he needs a kidney transplant to avoid dialysis. 
His disease, focal segmental glomerular sclerosis, is one of a 
variety of kidney ailments that result in severe, prolonged loss of 
protein into the urine. The cause is not clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, a starter on the Spurs' NBA championship team who hit a  
memorable 3-pointer at the buzzer of a playoff game to beat 
Portland, also thanked everyone who has offered support since he 
revealed his health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family and I would like to thank everyone for making us a  
part of their prayers. But at the same time, this is a difficult 
situation for my family and I ask the media covering this story to 
please respect my family's privacy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Antonio Express-News reported blood samples were taken  
from Elliott's two brothers and his mother, Odiemae. 
</P>
<P>
	``I drew the blood and packaged it myself last Monday,'' said  
Sean's father, Robert Elliott, a medical technician for Canna 
medical group in Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott's father was not a candidate to provide a kidney because  
he is diabetic.

<HEADLINE> Reds' Avery Placed on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Cincinnati Reds placed struggling  
left-hander Steve Avery on the 15-day disabled list Monday because 
of a strained shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the third trip to the disabled list in four seasons for  
Avery, 29, who is 6-7 with a 5.16 ERA in 19 starts this year. He 
was an 18-game winner in 1991 and 1993 with Atlanta, but has not 
won more than 11 games in any season since. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds recalled lefty B.J. Ryan to replace Avery.  
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, 23, went 2-1 with a 2.59 ERA for Double-A Chattanooga  
before being promoted to Triple-A Indianapolis where he was 1-0 
with a 4.00 ERA in just nine innings.

<HEADLINE> Accountability in Monson's Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Dan Monson will be held accountable by the  
University of Minnesota in ways that Clem Haskins never was. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins, who took a $1.5 million buyout last month to leave his  
job as men's basketball coach, had an airtight contract that washed 
him of responsibility for the actions of key figures in the 
school's academic fraud scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson, the Golden Gophers' new coach, won't have that luxury if  
his program ever gets into such hot water. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a stronger and more specific clause for termination  
with just cause,'' athletic director Mark Dienhart said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson's seven-year contract contains language that wasn't in  
Haskins' deal. Included is a clause that holds him accountable for 
rules violations committed by assistant coaches and ``any 
university employee for whom he is administratively responsible or 
representative of the university's athletic interest which, in the 
judgment of the university, (he) knew or should have known about 
with reasonable diligence and oversight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins was basically only accountable for himself and an  
assistant coach. Plus, he had an unusual provision that specified 
if he were fired with just cause, including NCAA rule violations, 
he got nearly $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Other major differences in Monson's contract, which pays him  
$490,000 a year plus outside income, include ``specific dollar 
amounts that are identified for termination without cause and 
liquidated damages if the coach were to leave early,'' Dienhart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, there is a $25,000 bonus if the team's grade point average  
exceeds 2.8 on a 4.0 scale. 
</P>
<P>
	``Academic bonus was a goal of mine and also something  
university president Mark Yudof hoped to see,'' Dienhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins' 10-year deal that paid him about $700,000 a year when  
outside income was included contained no such GPA or graduation 
bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the intent of the contract to make sure the coach had  
at least some responsibility and significant responsibility for the 
academic progress of the student athletes,'' Dienhart said. ``The 
terms there don't separate the coach from the academic performances 
of student athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins, who guided Minnesota to two National Invitation  
Tournament titles and the 1997 Final Four, was accused of 
tolerating and facilitating academic fraud among his players and 
misusing booster club money. 
</P>
<P>
	An internal audit revealed, among other things, that boosters  
paid for men's basketball coaches, a trainer and their wives to 
travel to Las Vegas in 1997. The $9,100 trip was for a ``coaches' 
seminar'' that never took place. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, former university employee Jan Gangelhoff said she did  
course work for at least 21 players from 1993-98, which was 
confirmed by four players. The university suspended four other 
players from the NCAA tournament opener against Gonzaga, which was 
coached by Monson. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA is looking into the scandal, and sanctions are expected  
this fall.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Lower; Dow Closes Down 47.80 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The continued threat of higher interest rates  
pushed stocks lower Monday in the second quietest session of the 
year. Highly priced technology shares fell most steeply. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 47.80 to close at  
10,863.16. After a few sluggish moves into positive territory at 
midday, the blue-chip index fell back and extended the losses of 
last week, when the Dow dropped 298.88 points, or 2.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower as well. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 slipped 9.18 to 1,347.76, and the Nasdaq composite 
index, dominated by technology stocks, fell 73.21 to 2,619.19. 
</P>
<P>
	Nervous investors have begun to believe that the Federal Reserve  
will raise interest rates as early as next month in an effort to 
hold off inflation. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who raised that 
possibility in Congressional testimony last Thursday, will address 
a Senate panel on Wednesday, and analysts said it's unlikely that 
stocks will muster much strength before then. 
</P>
<P>
	John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc.,  
said Greenspan appears to be laying a foundation for another modest 
rate increase, following the quarter-point increase imposed last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given his remarks, financial markets should tend not to be  
very surprised when the Fed moves to raise short-term rates in 
reaction to very robust economic or employment data,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later this week, the government will release the latest  
statistics on employment costs and on the gross domestic product, 
which could provide a clearer indication of whether inflation has 
encroached on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aside from post-earnings blues, it really seems to be  
anticipation of the ECI (employment cost index) that is holding the 
market down,'' said Tom Galvin, chief equity strategist at 
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, the prospect of higher interest rates pushed bond  
prices lower, driving yields higher. The 30-year Treasury bond 
yielded 6.03 percent by late afternoon after returning above 6 
percent on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology shares were mostly lower. Analysts say those stocks,  
which drove the Nasdaq to a string of records earlier this month, 
are now falling prey to profit-taking as investors try to lock in 
their gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, investors often determine that the high valuations of many  
technology stocks are a riskier bet during times of higher interest 
rates, especially if they can secure solid, stable returns from 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft fell 2 5/8 to 87 5/8 and Hewlett Packard dropped 2 1/16 to  
105 11/16, the weakest performer among Dow components. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online lost ground as several top executives, including  
Chairman and Chief Executive Stephen Case, sold 4 million shares. 
AOL, which has begun battling several rivals over instant-messaging 
technology, fell 7 13/16 to 100 1/8 as the most active issue on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	On a summertime Monday, merger activity was relatively quiet,  
but new deals provided the market with scattered gains. Host 
Marriott Services Corp. rose 5 47/64 to 15 31/64 after Italy's 
Autogrill SpA said it will offer $529 million, or $15.75 per share, 
to acquire it. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express got a modest boost from its second-quarter  
earnings report. Shares rose 15/16 to 136 1/2 after the company posted 
a 12 percent increase in profits for the quarter. American Express 
beat analysts' estimates by a penny, according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
NYSE, which experienced the second slowest day of 1999. Only July 
2, the Friday before the Independence Day weekend, was slower. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on all exchanges came to a slim 751.75 million shares.  
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 2.97 to 635.90, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 5.50 to 790.79. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.51 to 442.87. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.25 percent.  
European indexes were mostly lower on concerns over Wall Street's 
weakness. Germany's DAX index fell 2.0 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 
fell 0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 1.0 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> Governors Waffle on 'Happiness' Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- In these cynical times, it seems that even  
happiness can arouse suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	At least, that's what Pam Johnson discovered when she asked all  
50 U.S. governors to declare Aug. 8 ``National Admit You're Happy 
Day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The request was met with derision, hesitancy and head-scratching  
across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no official position on happiness,'' hedged a letter  
from New York Gov. George Pataki. ``We're going to wait and see 
what the federal government and other governors do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson, founder of the Secret Society of Happy People,  
proposed the day of observance as part of her ongoing campaign to 
drag contentment out of the closet. 
</P>
<P>
	Convinced that happiness has fallen out of fashion in the  
therapy-driven, angst-ridden 1990s, Ms. Johnson wages her 
unorthodox battle from her suburban Dallas apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our culture doesn't know what to do anymore with expressions  
of happiness,'' she said Saturday. ``It's like a foreign language 
to us -- we rush to get it, and then we don't have anybody to 
tell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson dreamed up this summer's holiday to draw more  
attention to the society's cause -- but a scant 15 governors have 
agreed to declare Aug. 8 a day of admitted bliss, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen did not issue a proclamation or had no society members  
in their states, earning ``stick in the mud'' or ``parade raining'' 
titles from Ms. Johnson. An additional 17 state leaders, have not 
responded, she said. New York remained noncommittal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll need to check with our attorneys,'' ran the reply from  
Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating's office. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the first time the society president has locked  
horns with notables in the name of promoting contentment: During 
the holiday season, Ms. Johnson took Ann Landers to task after the 
advice guru opposed the ever-popular holiday letters that detail 
families' successes. 
</P>
<P>
	To Ms. Johnson, Ms. Landers' advice represented another  
intolerant strike against happiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pressure to keep happiness to yourself,'' she said.  
``At work you're not supposed to like your boss or your job, and 
with your friends you're not supposed to brag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But nothing prepared the peppy Texan for the response to the day  
of national contentment she envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the notoriously offbeat Jesse Ventura -- former professional  
wrestler and present governor of Minnesota -- refused to bite. 
</P>
<P>
	``He represents the people of Minnesota, and he really doesn't  
see how this affects them,'' Ventura's office told Ms. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Saturday, fellow Texan and presidential hopeful George W.  
Bush was among the 17 governors who had not responded to the 
request, Ms. Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though bemused by the reaction, the society's founder is  
steaming ahead with plans for the holiday. There will be a party, 
of course, as well as an open invitation to muse out loud over 
life's pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really bizarre-- it's not like I proposed a `Take Your  
Guns to Work Day,''' Ms. Johnson quipped. ``I meant it to be quite 
the opposite of controversial.''

<HEADLINE> Bausch &AMP; Lomb To Sell Lab Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Bausch &AMP; Lomb will complete its refocus  
on its eye care business with the sale of its last non-strategic 
holding, Charles River Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	The eye care company said Monday it would sell Charles River,  
which breeds rodents for research, to the investment group Global 
Health Care Partners for $400 million cash and a $43 million 
promissory note. 
</P>
<P>
	The company put the division up for sale early this year.  
</P>
<P>
	``The sale of Charles River Laboratories completes our strategic  
transformation to a dedicated technology-based health care company 
for the eye,'' said Bausch &AMP; Lomb chairman and CEO William 
Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Bausch &AMP; Lomb announced the sale of its  
Miracle Ear hearing aid business to Amplifon SpA of Italy for an 
undisclosed sum. In April, the company sold its sunglasses business 
that included the Ray-Ban brand for $640 million to Italy's 
Luxottica Group SpA, owner of the LensCrafters retail chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles River Laboratories was acquired by Bausch &AMP; Lomb in  
1984. The sale is expected to be completed in September. 
</P>
<P>
	With facilities in 18 countries, Charles River's 2,200 employees  
specially breed rats, mice and other rodents for biomedical 
research. The Wilmington, Mass.-based company's 1998 revenues were 
$240 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Health Care Partners is a unit of DLJ Merchant Banking, a  
private equity fund of the New York-based investment banking firm 
of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, Bausch &AMP; Lomb announced its earnings excluding  
onetime items rose 25 percent to $47.1 million, or 80 cents a 
share, in the second quarter ended June 26 on strong sales of 
disposable and replacement contact lenses and pharmaceuticals. It 
earned $37.6 million, or 66 cents per share, in the quarter a year 
ago before onetime items. 
</P>
<P>
	That was three cents a share higher than the 77 cents a share  
that analysts surveyed by First Call had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Including onetime gains on the sunglass business sale, net  
income for the quarter was $173.4 million, or $2.94 a share, up 
from $55.3 million, or 98 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $453.3 million from $408.4 million a year ago.  
</P>
<P>
	Bausch &AMP; Lomb's new line of SofLens66 and PureVision contact  
lenses helped boost contact-lens sales 8 percent in the quarter, 
while sales of lens-care products grew 7 percent on strong foreign 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmaceutical sales rose 24 percent as a result of price  
increases in non-ophthalmic generic products, while surgical 
products sales increased 11 percent over last year, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months, the company earned $195.8 million, or  
$3.34 a share, including gains versus $32 million, or 58 cents per 
share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $843.2 million from $765.9 million a year  
earlier.

<HEADLINE> EU Official Warns Britain on Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The European Union's top finance official used his  
final speech in office Monday to warn that Britain's decision to 
stand aloof from the single European currency threatens EU unity 
and risked tragic consequences for British politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``The UK's decision not to join the euro from the start may be  
the European tragedy of the present generation of British 
leaders,'' Yves-Thibault de Silguy told a meeting of the 
Corporation of London, which runs the city's financial district. 
</P>
<P>
	De Silguy said Britain's decision not to join the 11 EU nations  
that adopted the euro on Jan. 1 left it marginalized in Europe's 
financial decision-making, while the pound sterling suffers from 
exchange rate volatility buffeted between the euro and the U.S. 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pound is clearly becoming a minor satellite of the much  
larger euro,'' de Silguy said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said exchange-rate uncertainty put British companies at a  
disadvantage, while international investors would be scared off if 
Britain's isolation for the EU currency bloc lasted much longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain, along with Sweden, Denmark and Greece, stayed out of  
the euro when the other EU members launched the single currency. 
Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor government has indicated Britain 
should swap sterling for the euro in the near future if the 
economic conditions are right and the British people vote for it in 
a referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	However, opinion polls consistently show most British voters  
want to keep the pound. Opposition to the euro has grown since the 
EU currency has fallen steadily against the dollar in recent 
months, down to near parity from more than $1.16 in January. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the euro has rebounded recently, trading late Monday in  
London at $1.0674. 
</P>
<P>
	In nearly five years as EU commissioner for financial and  
monetary affairs, de Silguy played a key role in preparations for 
the euro's launch. He is due to be replaced in September by former 
Spanish Economics Minister Pedro Solbes.

<HEADLINE> Former Port of Miami Head Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Two months after he was acquitted of stealing Port  
of Miami revenue, the port's former director was charged Monday 
with violating state campaign financing laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Carmen Lunetta was charged with making contributions to local  
candidates through people who were later reimbursed by Fiscal 
Operations, a company contracted by Miami-Dade County to operate 
cranes at the port. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the five counts against him carries a maximum penalty of  
one year in jail. He and his attorney refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, a federal judge acquitted Lunetta and two other men of  
charges they stole $1.3 million in port revenue and spent it on 
lingerie, vacations, bar tabs, Super Bowl tickets and a $120,000 
donation to the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ruled that although there was ``substantial evidence  
of greed and public corruption,'' the money technically belonged to 
the defendants because it had not yet been turned over to 
Miami-Dade County. 
</P>
<P>
	Lunetta's co-defendants were Calvin Grigsby, the owner of Fiscal  
Operations, and a part-owner of a stevedoring company.

<HEADLINE> Group: Hate Against Hispanics Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Hate crimes against Hispanics are on the rise,  
underscoring a troubling pattern of harassment against the nation's 
fastest-growing minority group by law enforcement and extremists, 
the National Council of La Raza said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that open season has been declared on our  
community,'' President Raul Yzaguirre said at the annual convention 
of the nation's largest Hispanic civil rights group. ``Private 
citizens and law enforcement officials feel they can harass or 
attack Hispanic Americans with almost complete impunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A report released by the group, ``The Mainstreaming of Hate,''  
chronicles allegations of hate crime violence, church burning and 
law enforcement abuse. Although the authors rely heavily on 
anecdotal evidence, they say the study gives a first-of-its kind 
look at an emerging pattern of hate activity against Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the first year federal hate crime statistics were  
reported, there were 472 anti-Hispanic incidents reported. The 
numbers increased to 516 in 1995 and 564 in 1996. In 1997, the last 
year reported, anti-Hispanic hate crimes exceeded 600 incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Yzaguirre said attacks against Hispanics are being overlooked.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was clear that most of the incidents that came across our  
desks involving Latinos were simply being ignored by the media and 
policy-makers,'' Yzaguirre said. ``To the extent we are data 
invisible, we will continue to be policy invisible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The authors said ``numerous cases'' of illegal and inappropriate  
seizures, traffic stops based on ethnic appearance and physical 
abuse have been reported and instill in Latinos a sense of fear and 
mistrust. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that Hispanics themselves seem to be committing  
more hate crimes. Using numbers principally from incidents reported 
in California, the only state where such numbers are collected 
based on national origin and ethnicity, preliminary numbers showed 
an increase Hispanic-committed crimes, said Carmen Joge, a La Raza 
policy analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	La Raza advocates the passage of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act  
of 1999 and extensive training of local law enforcement officials 
in identifying and responding to hate violence.

<HEADLINE> Missing Army Plane Found in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A missing U.S. Army plane appears to  
have slammed into an uncharted mountain in Colombia, probably 
killing all five Americans and two Colombians on board, a top U.S. 
official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers spotted wreckage Sunday on a mountain near the  
southwestern border with Ecuador that they believe is from the 
reconnaissance plane that disappeared Friday on an anti-narcotics 
mission over rebel-controlled territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew of the plane ``have probably lost their lives in a  
fatal accident.'' Barry McCaffrey, the Clinton administration's top 
anti-narcotics official, told reporters in the capital, Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll know more today,'' when a ground team will be sent to  
the wreckage, which has so far been seen only from the air because 
of the rugged terrain, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, McCaffrey told The Associated Press that it ``appears  
as if it (the plane) probably flew into a mountain, an unmarked 
mountain, in bad weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey began a two-day visit to Colombia today to discuss his  
proposal to increase U.S. anti-narcotics aid to the region by as 
much as $1 billion. The new aid would include stepped up support to 
Colombia's police and army to better stand up to 
``narco-guerrillas,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Army has not released the names of the five soldiers,  
who are based at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas. Two unidentified 
Colombian air force officers were also on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials say their Havilland RC-7 was on a routine  
counternarcotics mission over a rebel-dominated area where drug 
crops are grown when it disappeared from radar screens. 
</P>
<P>
	Its disappearance, however, was likely to heighten speculation  
in Colombia that Washington is getting deeply involved in the 
country's 35-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	American officials have repeatedly stressed they have no  
interest in giving counterinsurgency aid or sending American troops 
to fight in the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	But the perception among many Colombians that intervention is  
possible has grown amid steady rebel advances, frequent visits to 
Bogota by high-ranking U.S. officials and growing U.S. support to 
the Colombian military -- whose main activity is fighting the 
guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia, the world's No. 1 source of cocaine and a growing  
exporter of heroin, is the primary focus of U.S. anti-narcotics 
operations in the hemisphere. Aid this year tripled to roughly $300 
million. 
</P>

	The U.S. Army also is helping to train and equip a new,  
1,500-member counternarcotics battalion. The new force will operate 
largely in the rebel-dominated south, where the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, partly finances itself by taxing the 
peasants who grow drug crops and protecting traffickers' airstrips 
and laboratories.

	The U.S. government also recently began sharing intelligence on  
rebels with the army units taking part in anti-narcotics 
operations.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Vietnam Reach Trade Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today the United States  
and Vietnam are taking ``a major step forward'' in normalizing 
relations with an agreement in principle on a landmark trade 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a quarter-century after the Vietnam war, the two  
countries announced the deal yesterday in Hanoi. It is expected to 
benefit both sides, particularly Vietnam, which has been hit hard 
by fallout from the Asian financial crisis and is eagerly looking 
for investors and export markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But it would also require major reforms for one of the world's  
poorest countries, which suffers from a debt-ridden banking system, 
inefficient state-owned enterprises and widespread corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``In addition to promoting American commercial interests,  
enhancing our economic relations with Vietnam will also help 
advance cooperation with Vietnam on other issues of importance to 
our nation,'' the president said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``These include obtaining the fullest possible accounting of our  
missing from the war, encouraging continued progress in the freedom 
of emigration and seeking improvements in the human rights 
situation in Vietnam,'' the president said. ``Since the United 
States normalized relations with Vietnam, we have made steady 
progress in each of those areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the agreement was ``a major step forward for both  
countries.'' He said he would review the agreement and consult with 
Congress and the government of Vietnam in hopes of signing the 
agreement and establishing normal trade relations ``very soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, the result of nine rounds of talks over the last  
three years, would remove the final barrier for U.S. investors who 
got a late start into the Vietnamese market because Washington did 
not lift its trade embargo against Hanoi until early 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides said the agreement will govern areas such as  
bilateral trade, investment, tariff reduction and intellectual 
property rights. It could pave the way for Vietnam to join the 
World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, which will have to be translated, signed and  
approved by the U.S. Congress and Vietnam's National Assembly, is 
expected to take effect early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Communist Vietnam began opening its markets in the mid-1980s  
with the Doi Moi restructuring process. But the pace of reforms has 
slowed to a crawl over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	With declines in foreign investment and exports and a rise in  
unemployment, the government is hungry for an infusion into its 
economy. The World Bank estimates unfettered access to the U.S. 
market will add around $800 million, or almost 10 percent, to 
Vietnam's export revenues each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Work began in 1996 on the bilateral trade pact that would give  
normal trading status -- formally known as most-favored-nation 
status -- to Vietnam. If the deal is finalized, only Cuba and North 
Korea will not have such status with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks had stalled over Vietnam's tariffs -- 200 percent for  
automobile imports -- and its unwillingness to open its markets to 
U.S. investment and services. It fears its fledgling businesses 
would be at a disadvantage in competing with American companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Most analysts agree that Vietnamese industries are not yet ready  
to compete with major international companies but say competition 
would be one of the best ways to help them get up to world 
standards.

<HEADLINE> Superb Catch by Cardinals' Bragg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- St. Louis Cardinals right fielder Darren  
Bragg tumbled into the stands, scaring teammates and fans, while 
making a spectacular catch in the first inning of Monday night's 
game against the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Bragg raced toward the foul line on a liner hit by F.P.  
Santangelo. He leaped to catch the ball, landing on top of the 
fence and tumbling onto a concrete walkway. 
</P>
<P>
	As fans gasped, Cardinals players and trainer Barry Weinberg  
raced to the right-field corner. 
</P>
<P>
	But, after slowing getting back on his feet and getting examined  
by Weinberg for six minutes, Bragg walked back to his spot in right 
field.

<HEADLINE> Late-Night Tour of Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- Todd Zeile zeroed in with his camcorder  
and called over Ivan Rodriguez for a closer look. 
</P>
<P>
	They kept staring at the old, beat-up pillow -- actually, the  
catcher's mitt used by Hank Gowdy on Boston's 1914 Miracle Braves -- 
and could not believe their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would have to be perfect to catch with that,'' said  
Rodriguez, a seven-time Gold Glove winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I'm using that sometimes,'' said Zeile, shaking  
his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the Hall of Fame induction ceremonies Sunday,  
baseball's present met its past when players from the Texas Rangers 
and Kansas City Royals took a late-night stroll through the shrine. 
</P>
<P>
	``You people are a part of it,'' Hall curator Ted Spencer told  
the Texas contingent. ``This is where all of you would like to end 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, they were to meet in the annual Hall exhibition game  
two blocks away at cozy Doubleday Field, the birthplace of 
baseball. Those teams were picked to come to Cooperstown to honor 
two of the newest inductees, Nolan Ryan of the Rangers and George 
Brett of the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	But on this night, with the doors closed to the public, a lot of  
these players looked like little kids. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time MVP Juan Gonzalez and his Texas teammates studied Babe  
Ruth's bat and looked at Stan Musial's locker. They marveled at the 
short-pants uniform the Chicago White Sox wore in the 1970s and 
stared at a picture of Eddie Gaedel, the midget who once batted for 
the St. Louis Browns in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of Royals coaches pointed at turn-of-the-century,  
heavy-wire catcher's masks and laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	``That looks like something Hannibal Lecter would wear,'' one  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael Palmeiro stood at the far end of the main gallery, gazing  
down the long row of bronze plaques. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of inspires me, to see all of them hanging there,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 34, the All-Star Texas first baseman has 2,096. Every  
eligible player with 3,000 has been elected to the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of walk through these halls and think, `maybe.' It's  
like a vision, it's out there and I can see it,'' he said, waving 
his hand as if casting a spell. ``It's way out there, but it's 
within reach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers reliever Danny Patterson held no such illusions.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine being here, I'm in awe,'' he said. ``The only  
way I'll make it is by giving up somebody's 3,000th hit or 
something. I thought I might get a chance to do it against Wade 
Boggs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers played Sunday at Tampa Bay, then flew to Utica,  
N.Y., about 45 miles from Cooperstown. About 20 Texas players took 
the bus ride for a 75-minute visit to the Hall, and Ryan was there 
to greet them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kind of hungry when we got in, and I thought about going  
to get something to eat and not coming here at all,'' Patterson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more amazing than I ever thought,'' he said. ``This might  
be a once-in-a-lifetime trip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City played extra innings at home Sunday and then  
traveled to Utica. The entire Royals team made the trip to the 
Hall, arriving shortly before 11 p.m. EDT and leaving after 
midnight for their Utica hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas was to play Tuesday night at Baltimore, and the Royals  
returned home to play Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Royals rookie pitcher Tim Byrdak brought his camcorder. He  
lingered in the new home-run exhibit, hovering over a case showing 
Roger Maris' bat and uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives you an appreciation of the game you play,'' he said.  
``It brings back the excitement of playing baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Royals pitcher Jay Witasick saw the one display that mattered  
most. In an exhibit on amateur baseball, there's an MVP trophy of a 
youth tournament with his name on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was here, but I forgot to bring my camera,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He remembered, at least, to stop by the gift shop on the way  
out. Along with several other Royals and Rangers, he picked up some 
shirts and hats as souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeile narrated his own tour as he filmed -- ``there's a picture  
of Babe and his car'' -- and soaked in the whole experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``To most guys, the history of baseball is what happened 15 or  
20 years ago, things they can relate to,'' he said. ``I think 
players today are more interested than they would be perceived, but 
you don't get a lot of chances to delve into it. It's nice to be 
here and see the pioneers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One day, some of these players might wind up with a spot in  
Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmeiro and Rodriguez posed for a picture in front of Ryan's  
plaque. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's special knowing that I caught him,'' said Rodriguez, an  
eight-time All-Star. ``I'm trying to play hard, too, to make it 
here.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton's Run Brings GOP Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Conservative activists and Republican  
officials across the country are trying to cash in on Hillary 
Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In early June, on the very day Mrs. Clinton announced she was  
forming an exploratory committee, conservative radio talk show host 
Gary Nolan and veteran conservative strategist Craig Shirley 
announced a national drive to ``stop Hillary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to raise $10 million,'' Nolan said last week, vowing  
that all the money raised by Conservatives for Effective Leadership 
will be spent in an effort to defeat Mrs. Clinton in New York 
because ``there's a very good chance she could be elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A letter from Nolan to 40,000 potential contributors warned that  
``the liberals want Hillary to be president,'' that she and her 
husband are corrupt and that ``she's a committed radical Marxist to 
boot!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nolan said his group would likely begin airing anti-Hillary  
Clinton television ads in New York early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The right-wing attacks on Hillary Clinton will backfire,''  
spokesman Howard Wolfson said Monday. ``New Yorkers are sick of 
partisan politics. They want to talk about issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fund-raising drive is moving beyond New York, however.  
</P>
<P>
	In late June, Alabama GOP Chairman Winton Blount sent a letter  
to 10,000 donors seeking contributions ranging from $50 to $500 
``to help our friends in New York in their battle with Hillary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a tremendous response from it,'' Blount said Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Later this year, Blount plans to head to New York with a check  
for ``thousands of dollars'' to assist the New York GOP. He 
conceded, however, that the effort was aimed mainly at raising 
funds for the Alabama Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Party officials in New Hampshire, South Carolina and a number of  
other states are planning fund-raising efforts similar to 
Alabama's. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire GOP Chairman Steve Duprey said Alabama's  
initiative was ``too good an idea to pass up.'' Duprey said all the 
money raised in the Granite State from 10,000 letters going out 
within two weeks would be sent to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Such appeals are successful, according to J. Sam Daniels,  
executive director of the South Carolina GOP, because ``people are 
just sick of the Clintons. By her losing, I think most people feel 
we'll finally get rid of them, totally and forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties have tried to use candidates or other people in the  
news for fund-raising purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have used conservative jurist Robert Bork, former  
President Reagan and Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., to raise money, said 
Jay Severin, a New York GOP consultant. ``For Republicans, Teddy 
Kennedy has been the Jesse Helms figure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire's Duprey said, ``Hillary Clinton is the Republican  
fund-raising tool that matches Newt Gingrich for the Democrats.'' 
He called Mrs. Clinton ``a poster-girl for large, central 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blount recalled that former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo was a  
favorite fund-raising hook for Republicans. ``He tended to get 
people's juices running,'' the Alabama GOP chairman said. ``He was 
a unrepentant liberal, as she is.''

<HEADLINE> Tendinitis Forces Rios To Withdraw </HEADLINE>

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Marcelo Rios of Chile withdrew from the  
Mercedes-Benz Cup ATP Tour tournament Monday because of tendinitis 
in both hips. 
</P>
<P>
	Rios, the fourth seed, was scheduled to play Swedish qualifier  
Magnus Larsson on Tuesday. Instead, he was replaced by Paradon 
Srichaphan of Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	Rios, ranked 13th in the world, dominated the tour last year,  
winning seven titles and was ranked No. 1 for a time. 
</P>
<P>
	But injuries have plagued him this year, including a bad back  
that kept him from playing Wimbledon. He reached the quarterfinals 
at the French Open and has won two titles this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been the worst (year) of my career,'' he said. ``It's the  
first time I'm so injured in four years.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Lower; Dow Closes Down 47.80 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The continued threat of higher interest rates  
pushed stocks lower in listless trading today, inflicting the 
steepest damage on highly priced technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was down 47.80 at 10,863.16, having surrendered a modest 
gain at midday. The blue-chip index fell 298.88 points, or 2.7 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower as well.  
</P>
<P>
	Nervous investors have begun to believe that the Federal Reserve  
will raise interest rates as early as next month in an effort to 
hold off inflation. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who raised that 
possibility in Congressional testimony last Thursday, will address 
a Senate panel on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc.,  
said Greenspan appears to be laying ground for another modest rate 
increase, following the quarter-point increase imposed last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given his remarks, financial markets should tend not to be  
very surprised when the Fed moves to raise short-term rates in 
reaction to very robust economic or employment data.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later this week, the government will release the latest  
statistics on employment costs and on the gross domestic product, 
which could provide a clearer indication of whether inflation has 
encroached on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aside from post-earnings blues, it really seems to be  
anticipation of the ECI that is holding the market down,'' said Tom 
Galvin, chief equity strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, the prospect of higher interest rates has pushed  
bond prices lower, driving yields higher. The 30-year Treasury bond 
yielded 6.03 percent by late afternoon after returning above 6 
percent on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology shares were mostly lower. Analysts say those stocks,  
which drove the Nasdaq to a string of records earlier this months, 
are now falling prey to profit-taking as investors try to lock in 
their gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, as higher interest rates begin cutting into corporate  
profits, technology companies are often the first to suffer. 
Investors often determine that their high valuations are a riskier 
bet, especially if they can secure solid, stable returns from 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft was lower today. America Online, which is battling  
several rivals over instant-messaging technology, fell steeply. AOL 
also lost ground as several top executives, including Chairman and 
Chief Executive Stephen Case, sold 4 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	On a summertime Monday, merger activity was relatively quiet,  
but new deals provided the market with scattered gains. Host 
Marriott Services Corp. rose sharply after Italy's Autogrill SpA 
said it will offer $529 million, or $15.75 per share, to acquire 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	According to preliminary calculations, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
fell 10.88 to 1,346.06, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 72.71 
to 2,619.71. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 2,051 down, 969 up and 511 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 611.18 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
628.94 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 2.97 to 635.90, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 5.50 to 790.79. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.51 to 442.87.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Pluck Huskey From Mariners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- If they're going to stop their current slide, the  
Boston Red Sox will need to improve both their pitching and their 
hitting. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitching help will have to come from within. But the hitting  
got a boost on Monday when Boston acquired outfielder Butch Huskey 
from the Seattle Mariners for minor league pitcher Robert Ramsay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this is a good addition to our team for this year,  
and also for future years,'' said Red Sox general manager Dan 
Duquette, whose team is 5-12 since July 5. ``He should be poised to 
put up some good numbers for the next couple of years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huskey, 27, was hitting .290 with 15 homers and 48 RBIs in 74  
games with Seattle this season, but has been in a 31-for-135 (.230) 
slump since June 1. Huskey will make $1.5 million this year and 
isn't eligible for free agency until after the 2001 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle acquired Huskey from the New York Mets last winter, but  
he didn't seem to fit into the Mariners' plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our outfield was a little crowded over there,'' he said. ``I  
had a good feeling that if it wasn't going to be me (traded), it 
was going to be one of our other outfielders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsay, 25, is 6-8 with a 5.35 ERA at Pawtucket of the Triple-A  
International League, allowing 114 hits in 114 1-3 innings with 79 
strikeouts and 36 walks. 
</P>
<P>
	He led Red Sox minor league pitchers in strikeouts last season,  
fanning a team-record 166 in 162 2-3 innings at Double-A Trenton of 
the Eastern League. He was selected Boston's minor league pitcher 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Vancouver, Wash., Ramsay lives in Camas, Wash., and  
was a member of the Washington State Pac-10 North championship team 
in 1995. The Red Sox and Mariners had discussed the same trade 
earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deal didn't come together then, but we're happy that it  
came together now,'' Duquette said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't like to trade young left-handed pitchers, but we have  
a need for another right-handed hitter on our major league team. 
And that's what we're getting in Butch Huskey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duquette said Huskey could play right field, left field,  
designated hitter, first base or third. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves the Red Sox looking for pitching. Rather than making  
a trade, Duquette is hoping he can get all the help he needs when 
ace Pedro Martinez is eligible to come off the disabled list Aug. 
3. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our pitching is still the strength of our team,'' Duquette  
said. ``We're hoping to return Pedro Martinez to the rotation next 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Closer Tom Gordon, who has missed most of the season with a  
right elbow strain, threw from a mound on Sunday and had none of 
the trouble he experienced in his previous workout. But he still 
appears to be a long way from returning. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramon Martinez, Pedro's brother and the former Los Angeles  
Dodgers star, also does not appear to be close to returning from 
shoulder surgery. Juan Pena, who had a strong outing for the Red 
Sox' Triple-A team on Sunday night, could be the next emergency 
starter.

<HEADLINE>  Rams Trying To Keep Bruce Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MACOMB, Ill. (AP) -- Isaac Bruce gets royal treatment in training  
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	He can sit out drills and go at his own pace. Others sweat,  
going over assignments again and again. Not Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Rams have a goal: They want their star receiver  
healthy for the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, Bruce missed 15 games the last two seasons with

	``The thing about Isaac is at times he practices so hard that he  
hurts himself,'' cornerback Todd Lyght said. ``With the workload we 
have, sometimes you have to pace yourself. You can't be at full 
throttle all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receivers coach Al Saunders had a daily schedule for Bruce  
in the weeks between the final minicamp in June and the start of 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Saunders is really hands-on. He has a habit of running  
downfield with his receivers, calling out blocks as he goes, so 
Bruce is never far away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm about two feet from him most of the practice,''  
Saunders said. ``So I don't know if I can watch him any closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders' read on Bruce, who was spectacular in 1995 and '96  
with 203 receptions, 3,119 yards, 20 touchdowns and a Pro Bowl 
berth: ``It looks like he's in pretty good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce's read on all the attention: ``I can handle it for right  
now. I'm going to get antsy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce caught more passes (224) than any player in NFL history  
his first three seasons. Six times he's caught more than 10 passes 
in a game, with a high of 15 for 210 yards against Miami in 1995, 
and four times he's topped 200 yards in receiving. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed almost all of the first five games in 1997, falling  
from 84 to 56 catches. Last year was a disaster. He played in only 
five games and caught 32 passes for 457 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	After such a stretch, it's only natural he'd have doubts.  
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of creeps in, but I push it away like I'm supposed  
to,'' he said. ``It's something I can't worry about, so I just go 
out and do what I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And when he's healthy, he does an awful lot.  
</P>
<P>
	``Injuries are part of the game and that's what happened to  
me,'' Bruce said. ``Anytime I'm on the field, I'm very productive. 
My talent and skill level haven't diminished at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of Bruce's problem is not knowing how or when to slow down.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, he has a problem,'' coach Dick Vermeil said. ``Last  
year we left it up to him, but he's a worker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams picked wide receiver Torry Holt in the first round. On  
the day Holt signed a five-year, $10 million contract, Vermeil said 
Holt had the ``ability to be equivalent'' to Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce said his motivation comes from within.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always hungry,'' he said. ``I've been hungry when I was  
sitting on the sidelines even when I was playing and the defense 
was on. I don't think I get any hungrier than normal.''

	MACOMB, Ill. (AP) -- Isaac Bruce gets royal treatment in training

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> US, Canada Get OK for Beef Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The United States and Canada received final  
approval Monday for $124 million in sanctions against the European 
Union in the dispute over hormone-treated beef, trade officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. governmnet planned to start imposing the 100 percent  
tariffs on Thursday, pending the approval from the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Products targeted include Italian tomatoes, Danish ham and  
French Roquefort cheese, goose liver and truffles. The reprisals 
will effectively price the items out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU has banned imports of beef treated with certain hormones  
for the past 11 years because of fears that the drugs could cause 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO ruled that Brussels was acting illegally and ordered it  
to lift the ban, but the EU refused to comply, insisting instead 
that it will carry out more tests to prove that its ban is 
justified. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of arbitrators earlier this month ruled that the United  
States was entitled to impose sanctions totaling $116.8 million per 
year in retaliation for beef producers' loss of trade, Canada was 
awarded $7.7 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never like to, but sometimes we have to do something that  
isn't pleasant with one of our major trading partners,'' said U.S. 
Ambassador Rita Hayes. ``We hope that we will be able to sit down 
and work out quickly a negotiated solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EU officials said they were disappointed that the United States  
had not agreed to an offer of compensation to head off sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Under that approach, legal trade barriers on other U.S. products  
would have been lowered to expand American sales in the EU market. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes said compensation would only have been a temporary  
solution and the United States was more interested in settling the 
dispute for good. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is already enforcing another $191.2 million  
per year of sanctions against the European Union in a long-running 
dispute over bananas.

<HEADLINE> PBS Studies Puerto Rican History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ernesto Gomez Gomez tells friends he left his  
native Mexico to get to know the mother he never knew, a Puerto 
Rican freedom fighter incarcerated near San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	They don't believe him.  
</P>
<P>
	After all, teen-agers are supposed to ``run amok, to hang out,  
to dance at parties,'' not spend weekends in a prison visitor's 
room. 
</P>
<P>
	Life has never been simple for the boy known in one country as  
Ernesto Gomez Gomez and in another as Guillermo Sebastian Morales 
Pagan. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a century after the United States claimed Puerto Rico  
as a commonwealth in 1898, ``The Double Life of Ernesto Gomez 
Gomez'' provides a vivid look at how the political struggle for 
Puerto Rican independence has shaped one young man's extraordinary 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	The documentary airs on PBS' ``P.O.V.'' on Tuesday at 10 p.m.  
EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a tale about a typically exuberant teen -- a boy who mugs  
for the camera, hates taking out the trash, shrugs when a school 
counselor asks him what he wants to do with his life. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's also about history, political activism, adoption and  
family -- about a young man with two names, two languages, three 
heritages and the pressing question of which identity to call his 
own. ``It's only one boy, but it's like two souls,'' a family 
friend says. 
</P>
<P>
	Dylcia Pagan and Guillermo Morales are members of the Armed  
Forces for National Liberation, or FALN, labeled terrorists by the 
FBI for planting dozens of bombs to call attention to the fight for 
Puerto Rican independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Pagan is two months pregnant when a bomb blows up in Morales'  
hands in 1978 and he is taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Their baby boy, Guillermo, is just 5 months old when Pagan goes  
into hiding. In 1980, 11 FALN activists, including Pagan, are 
captured in a van packed with 19 bombs. They are tried and 
convicted of sedition, and Pagan is sentenced to 55 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The toddler with the tawny curls has no name and no history when  
he lands in the Mexican home of Alma Gomez and Gabino Gomez. 
Politically minded themselves, they name the infant Ernesto, after 
the revolutionary Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernesto is 10 -- a bright, well-loved child who is fiercely  
patriotic -- when they sit him down and tell him the truth: first 
that he is adopted, and later that his birth parents are Puerto 
Rican freedom fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was confusing,'' Gomez Gomez, now 20, recalls in an  
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the family journeys to California, where Ernesto  
passes off as Pagan's nephew to get into the prison for their 
tearful reunion. 
</P>
<P>
	At 15, after a first-time meeting with his father, who had  
escaped to Mexico before being exiled to Cuba, Ernesto leaves 
Mexico with hopes of getting to know his birth mother. 
</P>
<P>
	The camera follows him, capturing the boy's disorientation in a  
new country far from home and his attempts at adjusting to a new 
name and identity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here was Guillermo, a 15-year-old boy, to take us through what  
it means to have a mom in prison, a terrorist to some, a hero to 
others,'' says documentarian Catherine Ryan, who teamed up with 
Gary Weimberg to help Gomez Gomez tell his story. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, Ernesto sheds his Mexican name and resuscitates  
his birth name. But where does Ernesto end and Guillermo begin? He 
is Guillermo when he speaks at Puerto Rican independence rallies 
and when he checks into prison to see his mother. But he is Ernesto 
watching a Cinco de Mayo parade that sharpens his longing for the 
vast, loving family he left behind in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Ernesto died, he had the most beautiful family in the  
world,'' the teen tells the camera, in English. ``And now Guillermo 
was alone, with a strange woman in prison that the people said that 
she is his mother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Double Life'' is a moving depiction of a family torn apart  
by political belief and then stitched back together, in a fashion, 
by loyalty and love. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Guillermo, we have newspaper clippings, broadcast reports  
and footage to recount the bombings and the FALN trials. But it 
takes Guillermo's resolve to investigate his own history for us to 
glimpse the private anguish behind the stony faces peering at us 
from the newsprint. 
</P>
<P>
	For Pagan, losing her family was the risk and the sacrifice of  
fighting for Puerto Rican independence. For years, she knew nothing 
of the whereabouts of her ``little warrior.'' Once reunited, she 
would not let him go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to hear me being called Mom. Mama. Madre,'' she says.  
``I never have stopped being his mother.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	`20/20': Heart disease may be the number-one killer among black  
women, but recent studies show some doctors sometimes fail to 
diagnose heart attacks in women and minorities. One study found 
that the odds of black women being referred for catheterization 
were less than half that of white men. ``The group that was least 
likely to receive a good treatment recommendation was black 
women,'' says Dr. Kevin Schulman, who conducted the study. ``We 
found evidence of bias.'' ABC News' Dr. Nancy Snyderman reports on 
why some doctors fail to diagnose heart disease in women and 
minorities, and what some patients are doing to ensure they receive 
proper treatment, on ``20/20 Monday'' tonight at 8 p.m. EDT. Connie

<HEADLINE> Instant Messaging Battle Heats Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- With instant messaging on the Web  
becoming a cultural mainstay like e-mail, Microsoft's battle 
against America Online's dominance of a new community could turn as 
nasty as the browser wars between Microsoft and Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	But this time Microsoft has major allies like Yahoo! who want to  
make sure members of their online communities can ``flash'' a note 
to any of the 80 million users of AOL's instant messaging services. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle flared up last week when Microsoft launched a service  
similar to AOL's Instant Messenger, allowing users of its MSN 
network to zap messages to AOL subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, angered by what it considered trespassing in its private  
online community, promptly retaliated with an electronic blockade 
against instant messages from the original MSN service -- and 
subsequent versions designed to outflank AOL's defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft argues that instant messages, like e-mail, should flow  
freely between online services for all to use, and that AOL's 
attitude violates the spirit of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine a world where we couldn't talk by telephone if we had  
different'' phone companies, said Deanna Sanford, lead product 
manager for MSN marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanford said her company will continue to post new versions of  
its software to elude AOL's defenses. A new version was posted 
early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, AOL chief executive Steve Case downplayed the  
standoff as a ``squabble'' that could be resolved through talks, 
``not by Microsoft hacking into our network.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jousting, analysts said, is as much about bragging rights as  
dollars, because little revenue is generated directly from instant 
messaging. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as Microsoft wants to maintain its dominance of the  
operating software that runs most computers, AOL would like to 
control the messaging market. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is essentially a political battle,'' said Simon Hayward,  
research director for Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn. ``The issue 
is the way Microsoft went about doing this. AOL feels its turf has 
been stepped on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instant messaging initially caught on as a gossip tool at home  
and at the office, but has become a popular way to send comments 
more quickly and with even less formality than e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, because the notes have to be short, the business  
applications of instant messaging are limited. 
</P>
<P>
	Messaging services usually feature a ``buddy list'' that lets  
users know when friends or associates are logged onto the Internet. 
Messages appear in a box on a user's screen. 
</P>
<P>
	While AOL's instant messaging services, AIM and ICQ (short for  
``I seek you''), dominate the market, about 200,000 copies of 
Microsoft's messaging software were downloaded the first day it 
appeared on the company's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be more rounds back and forth,'' said Mark Levitt,  
research director with International Data Corp. in Framingham, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also said the fight could have a positive result if it  
speeds the way toward an industry standard. They noted that e-mail 
in its early days also was restricted. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, Prodigy Communications and others are also urging AOL to  
open up its instant messaging network. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL has said it favors the development of industry standards,  
but plans to block competitors until they are. An AOL official said 
Monday a letter has been sent to Microsoft asking to discuss the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL officials also say they're alarmed that MSN's Messenger  
Service asks AOL users to enter their user name and password before 
they can connect, raising privacy questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have it all over our screens: `Never give out your  
password,''' spokeswoman Ann Brackbill said.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Libya, Sudan Sanctions Eased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Starting Tuesday, sanctions against Iran,  
Libya and Sudan will be eased to allow American companies to sell 
them food, medicine and medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	All three countries are listed by the State Department as  
exporters of terrorism, which makes them subject to military and 
business sanctions. Tougher embargoes that bar other dealings, 
including humanitarian aid, are being eased. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sanctions on food, medicine and medical equipment do not  
generally advance our policy goals and may have adverse 
consequences in the humanitarian realm,'' Stuart Eizenstat, the 
deputy Treasury secretary, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said companies selling humanitarian goods would need licenses  
from the Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the new policy offers U.S. companies,  
particularly farmers, an opportunity to boost exports. American 
farmers, feeling lingering effects of a global financial crisis, 
are suffering their worst economic period in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``With farm prices still low and global demand still soft, this  
action could not have come at a better time,'' Agriculture 
Secretary Dan Glickman said. ``Our farmers are hurting, and they 
deserve every opportunity to reach out to as many potential 
consumers as possible around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy offers farmers the opportunity to sell more than  
13 million tons of grain, worth as much as $2 billion, to Iran, 
Libya and Sudan, administration officials estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy generally allows licensed companies to sell  
``agricultural commodities and products that are intended for 
ultimate consumption as food by humans or animals,'' Eizenstat 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agricultural items permitted for export would include raw,  
processed and packaged foods, animal feeds, live food animals and 
seeds for food crops, Eizenstat said. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations do not allow sale of nonfood agricultural  
commodities such as cotton or tobacco, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department announced the intended policy change in  
April. It said barring sales of food and medicine usually fails to 
hurt targeted regimes but deprives American companies of export 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	Embargoes will continue as before against Iraq, North Korea,  
Cuba and Serbia, all sanctioned countries to which sales of certain 
items are already permitted. All but Serbia also are on the State 
Department terrorism list, along with Syria, which is not under 
further embargo.

<HEADLINE> Dow Slips 29; Nasdaq Falls 41 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened lower today as continued worries  
about higher interest rates hurt technology and financial shares. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 29.12 at 10,881.84. The blue-chip index was building on last 
week's decline, when the Dow fell 298.88 points, or 2.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 6.39 at 1,350.55, and the technology-dominated 
Nasdaq composite index was down 41.88 at 2,650.52. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are clinging to fears that the Federal Reserve will  
raise interest rates as early as next month in an effort to hold 
off inflation. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who raised that 
possibility in Congressional testimony last Thursday, will address 
a Senate panel on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Later this week, the government will release the latest  
statistics on the gross domestic product, which could provide a 
clearer indication of whether inflation has encroached on the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of higher interest rates has pushed bond prices  
lower, driving yields higher. The 30-year Treasury bond yielded 
6.03 percent this morning after returning above 6 percent on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks and brokerages, which are interest-rate sensitive, were  
among today's losers. J.P. Morgan fell 1 15/16 to 131 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology shares were also mostly lower. Microsoft was off 1 3/8  
at 88 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 82.3 million shares, 
on par with Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 2.25 to 636.62, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 5.82 to 790.47. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.25 percent.  
European indexes were mostly lower on concerns over Wall Street's 
weakness. In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 2.3 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 1.8 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 was down 1.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Dairy Farmers Looking for Help / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pennsylvania dairy farmer Jim Van Blarcom  
would have replaced his aging farm equipment long ago if milk 
prices had been higher and more predictable. 
</P>
<P>
	But Van Blarcom finds it difficult to plan a budget and  
determine what new equipment he can afford. So he is deferring 
purchases for now, even though the older machinery breaks down more 
often and needs more helping hands to operate. 
</P>
<P>
	He is counting on help from Congress in the form of a bill  
authorizing Pennsylvania's entry into a regional dairy compact that 
now covers the six New England states. The measure is becoming one 
of the most contentious farm issues before Congress this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Northeastern states would be able to join as well, while a  
separate compact would be set up for the South. If the bill does 
not pass, the New England compact would break up Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sorely needed to maintain our dairy industry in the  
Northeast part of the country,'' said Van Blarcom, who operates a 
dairy farm in Columbia Crossroads, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	He said milk prices need to be higher and more stable for dairy  
farmers to stay in business. Dairy is Pennsylvania's leading 
agriculture commodity. 
</P>
<P>
	The compacts would allow member states to set a minimum price  
for Class 1 milk, the type used for drinking. That is the price 
that farmers get for their milk and only indirectly determines the 
price at the grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
	The minimum price is likely to be higher than what farmers have  
been getting, and it would dampen price swings by eliminating the 
lower price levels. When the market price is above the minimum 
price, farmers would get the higher, market price. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1980 to 1997, the price of milk rose just 48 cents per  
hundred pounds (11.6 gallons) from $13.60 to $14.08. After reaching 
near record levels in 1998, the price dropped by a third during the 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the compacts agree that price instability is a  
problem for farmers, but they believe farm subsidies and insurance 
are among the better ways to address the farmers' plight. 
</P>
<P>
	Midwestern dairy farmers, in particular, complain that the  
compacts would unfairly upset the balance between supply and demand 
and hurt farmers outside the compact area. 
</P>
<P>
	``Producers respond to higher price incentives by producing more  
milk, and consumers respond by buying less milk,'' said Steven 
Etka, a lobbyist for the Upper Midwest Dairy Coalition. ``The 
surplus ends up being dumped into the national market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Jaeger, assistant director for the Consumer Federation of  
America, said consumers also hurt from higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to stabilize prices, don't stabilize them at a  
level that is disadvantageous to consumers,'' he said. ``What's 
wrong with letting the market determine the price?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Joel Rotz, dairy specialist for the Pennsylvania Farm  
Bureau, said that when market prices fall, only some of the 
decrease is passed on to consumers. Having the minimum price, he 
said, would at least keep more farmers in business. 
</P>
<P>
	The market price is currently determined by a complex federal  
formula, which is undergoing changes as well. The current formula 
takes into account such factors as cheese prices and the farm's 
distance from Eau Claire, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania farmers say they are at a disadvantage because a  
greater portion of their milk is used for drinking and not for 
making cheese, which has a longer shelf life and can better 
withstand price swings.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Fall by Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen at midday  
Tuesday following dollar-supportive comments by U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Lawrence Summers. Japanese stock prices fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 116.64 yen, up 0.20 yen from late Monday in  
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 116.61 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 121.24 points,  
or 0.69 percent, to 17,370.10 at the end of the morning session. On 
Monday, the average closed down 43.10 points, or 0.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar rose following Summers' remarks  
at a seminar on poor country debt relief at the International 
Monetary Fund late Monday. ``As I have said many times, a strong 
dollar is very much in the interest of the U.S.,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Currency ``market players covered their short positions after  
Summers reiterated his strong dollar policy,'' said a dealer at a 
European bank on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency was also supported on concern over possible  
Bank of Japan dollar-buying intervention in currency markets around 
115 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	After the dollar fell as low as 115.48 yen in New York late  
Monday, market participants turned cautious towards pushing the 
dollar any lower as the central bank was seen as likely to 
intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	The BOJ has sold the yen to buy the dollar in recent weeks to  
stem the yen's rapid rise against the greenback as part of Japanese 
financial authorities' attempts to help the nation's fledging 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains in the yen make Japanese exports more costly abroad, and  
thus less competitive, while cutting the value of foreign revenue 
in yen terms. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro traded at 124.40 yen in midday  
trading, above its level of 122.68 yen in late trading in Tokyo 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices moved lower at the end of the  
morning session. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline follows four straight sessions of losses for  
Japanese stocks, with the Nikkei falling over 1000 points as 
players took profits amid gains in the yen and on the sense that 
shares were overvalued. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 3.65 points, or 0.25 percent, to 1,432.67. The 
TOPIX closed down 0.17 points, or 0.01 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.6800 percent from Monday's finish of 1.7150 percent, driving 
its price up to 101.03 yen from 100.73 yen.

<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Olympic hurdles champion Ludmila  
Engquist of Sweden will return to competition this week despite 
continuing to undergo chemotherapy for breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian-born Engquist said she will run in Friday's DN Galan  
Grand Prix meet at Stockholm's Olympic Stadium, the Swedish news 
agency TT reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am someone who wants to try to do impossible things. I want  
to show that it is possible,'' said Engquist, who also holds the 
world indoor record for the 100-meter hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
	Engquist announced in April that she had breast cancer and did  
not plan to return to competition until 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``But Ludmila has reacted (to chemotherapy) less than expected.  
Her unbelievable physique has helped her,'' said Arne Ljungqvist, 
her doctor and chairman of the Swedish Track and Field Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've trained almost as usual every day,'' Engquist said. ``The  
training has gone so well that I thought 'why not compete also?' -- 
it's so boring just to train.''

<HEADLINE> Does New Stadium Mean Better Record? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Here's even more pressure on Seattle: The other  
six teams that moved into new ballparks in the 1990s all improved 
their records, some dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	After going 76-85 last season, the Mariners are 47-51, including  
4-4 at Safeco Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``The money doesn't necessarily help in any one year,'' Mariners  
vice president Bob Aylward said. ``The money helps over time. But 
Safeco Field is going to allow the Mariners to be aggressive and 
over time it's going to mean this franchise is going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Indians, Baltimore Orioles, Chicago White Sox and  
Colorado Rockies improved significantly and the Texas Rangers 
improved a bit. The Atlanta Braves just kept on winning, and have 
seven consecutive division titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening of Camden Yards increased the Orioles' operating  
income from $11 million in 1991 to $34 million in 1992, according 
to a book by Washington State economist Rodney Fort. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Comiskey Park increased the Chicago White Sox' operating  
income from $8 million in 1990 to $18 million in 1991. The Colorado 
Rockies went from $4 million to $11 million in 1995, after Coors 
Field opened, according to the book ``Hard Ball, the Abuse and 
Power in Pro Team Sports,'' by Fort and James Quirk. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians were an exception, dropping from $13 million in 1993  
to a $4.5 million loss in the strike-shortened 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the revenue stream not only goes up but becomes more  
certain, it allows the baseball department to become more 
aggressive,'' said Aylward, an executive with the Orioles when 
Camden Yards opened in 1992. ``It made a tremendous difference in 
our revenue stream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners expect Safeco Field to produce an extra $25 million  
a year for the team, which claims it lost $1.7 million in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle's record the past five years is 379-362 (.511). If the  
Mariners perform similarly to their predecessors with new 
ballparks, they'll average a .593 percentage in the next five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez, both eligible for  
free agency after the 2000 season, don't stick around, that's 
unlikely to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle is a veteran team, and Fort said additional revenue  
generated by the new stadium should help the Mariners keep their 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Safeco Field is the most expensive baseball stadium in history.  
The total price tag is $517.6 million and climbing. The next 
highest is Turner Field in Atlanta at $257 million. 
</P>
<P>
	At $372 million, the public's share of Safeco Field tops the  
price of any of the other six stadiums. And the Mariners are 
seeking $60 million more for cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mariners real revenue handicap is local TV, not at the  
gate,'' Fort said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle's local television revenue is about $16 million a year,  
compared to $69 million for the New York Yankees. The major league 
average is around $23 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball teams with new stadiums enjoyed an increase in value of  
79 percent immediately after the stadium opened, according to 
Financial World magazine. The value of teams without new stadiums 
increased 11 percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Other clubs have noticed.  
</P>
<P>
	Teams in Detroit, Houston, San Francisco, Milwaukee, Cincinnati  
and Pittsburgh will be moving into new ballparks in coming years.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Players Adjust to Roles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FROSTBURG, Md. (AP) -- Charley Casserly began his Washington  
Redskins career 22 years ago as an unpaid intern, sleeping at the 
YMCA and sometimes in his car so he could be closer to Redskin 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinny Cerrato started earlier this year with a nice paycheck and  
a room at the Dulles Airport Marriott. He was an exile from Redskin 
Park, an innocent pawn in the struggle for control of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Cerrato was getting to know his scouts and working  
the phones as he finally got settled in his new job as Redskins 
general manager. The man he replaced, Casserly, spent part of his 
day as Executive Vice President in Charge of Nothing by going for a 
swim at the Frostburg State University gymnasium while the players 
went through the first morning practice of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bet you feel relieved, Charley,'' yelled a fan as Casserly  
made an appearance at the afternoon practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Casserly just smiled and shrugged his shoulders.  
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to put his own stamp on the Redskins immediately -- and  
alleviate the tension between Casserly and coach Norv Turner -- new 
owner Daniel Snyder ousted Casserly on Friday. Casserly was paid a 
handsome sum and will become a ``consultant to the owner'' on Sept. 
3, Snyder's polite way of telling someone to scram. 
</P>
<P>
	Cerrato was essentially given Casserly's job under the title of  
director of player personnel, ending an on-again, off-again year of 
employment prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an interesting offseason,'' Cerrato said. ``It was  
wait-and-see kind of thing. It was different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cerrato spent the last eight seasons building winning rosters in  
the front office of the San Francisco 49ers, but ownership turmoil 
there left Carmen Policy and Dwight Clark headed for Cleveland and 
Cerrato out of work. When Snyder and Howard Milstein won the 
initial bidding war for the Redskins, Snyder recruited Cerrato and 
sent him to Redskin Park to prepare for the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	But John Kent Cooke, outgoing Redskins president and bidding war  
loser, wouldn't let Cerrato have an office. Cerrato checked into 
the hotel and stayed there several weeks preparing for the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The work was for naught. Milstein had to withdraw because NFL  
owners weren't going to approve him, leaving Casserly to conduct 
what turned out to be a masterful draft that left the Redskins with 
cornerback Champ Bailey and three first-round draft picks for next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was disappointed when I went home,'' Cerrato said. ``But  
then when Mr. Snyder got involved again, it was a breath of fresh 
air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder put together his own group to buy the team and Cerrato  
was again in the mix. Now he's ready to carry out the wishes of an 
aggressive owner who wants to make noise right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``His energy and enthusiasm will show on the field,'' Cerrato  
said. ``We are all about winning. Winning is the key word in this 
scenario.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cerrato may have to deal one of the three first-round picks if  
Snyder senses a big name can be lured. But before returning to the 
phones, Cerrato paused briefly to remember his San Francisco days. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest disappointment was the disruption of things last  
year,'' he said. ``It was like a soap opera and turmoil. When you 
got two guys that are best friends fighting, it's not a good 
situation. It's too bad it had to happen and it divided everything. 
It's almost like they have new ownership. A lot of people that were 
that aren't there. A lot of people got caught in the middle of it 
and they didn't have anything to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few months from now, possibly after he has joined another  
team, Casserly may be using those exact words to describe the 
Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Notes:* Charlie Brown, Redskins receiver from 1982-84, has  
joined the team for two weeks as an intern receivers coach. He'll 
be the offensive coordinator this fall at Mississippi Valley State. 
... Rookie T Derek Smith and LB Antwaune Ponds, both with knee 
injuries, are destined for the Physically Unable to Perform List, 
ruling them out for about half the season.

<HEADLINE> Western Wildfires Being Contained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Firefighters kept watch for rattlesnakes  
Sunday as they battled a pair of fires that had burned more than 
30,000 acres near Reno and a Navy bombing range to the east. 
</P>
<P>
	About 500 firefighters had completely surrounded a 15,500-acre  
wildfire in the steep canyons about 8 miles east of Reno, and the 
columns of smoke that were visible from the city had started to 
dissipate. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews also had mostly contained the 15,500-acre fire southeast  
of Fallon that was started on the Fallon Naval Air Station by 
bomber training on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A third fire that had blackened more than 32,000 acres of  
rangeland in the sparsely settled northeast corner of the state was 
fully contained Sunday, eight days after it was started by 
lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of northern Nevada is very, very dry,'' Forest Service  
spokeswoman Sharon Sweeney said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reno fire had burned quickly through thick stands of highly  
flammable grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Hand crews had to be used because steep terrain made it  
impossible to get bulldozers and other heavy equipment near the 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rattlesnakes have been seen along the fire line and in the  
vicinity of the fire,'' Forest Service spokeswoman Jocelyn Biro 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters lit a series of back fires early Sunday to help cut  
off the primary flames and by midday the fire was 85 percent 
contained by fire breaks. Biro said they hoped to have it 
extinguished by Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reno and Fallon fires were both caused by humans and  
investigators were attempting to learn if they might have been set 
deliberately. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the West, a week-old fire in California's Santa  
Barbara County had burned 14,200 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a fast-moving fire in the San Bernardino National  
Forest damaged several homes, killed sheep and other livestock and 
forced evacuations as flames blackened 2,850 acres of desert and 
mountain brush. Two sheds and two trailers were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 45 minutes we were running for our lives,'' resident Joan  
Van Horn said tearfully. ``The fire was in the meadow right in 
front of me. We couldn't see to get out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze, located about 70 miles northeast of Los Angeles in  
San Bernardino County, began around 12:45 p.m. Sunday near Highway 
138, closing it down for nine hours.

<HEADLINE> Handyman Confesses To Yosemite Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- Months ago, motel handyman  
Cary Stayner was ruled out as a suspect in the murders of three 
Yosemite sightseers. 
</P>
<P>
	When Yosemite naturalist Joie Ruth Armstrong turned up dead last  
week -- this time, decapitated -- the FBI took another look at 
Stayner, who is now suspected in all four slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigator acknowledged that Stayner's arrest had made him  
question whether Ms. Armstrong's murder could have been prevented. 
</P>
<P>
	``I struggled with that issue for the last 24 hours and I  
continue to do so,'' said James Maddock, agent in charge of the FBI 
office in Sacramento. ``I'm confident we've done everything that 
reasonably could have been done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the 37-year-old Stayner, who was arrested  
Saturday, confessed to the beheading of Ms. Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner is the prime suspect in the killings of Carole Sund, her  
daughter Juli and family friend Silvina Pelosso, who disappeared in 
February, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner worked and lived outside the park in El Portal at the  
Cedar Lodge where the sightseers were last seen and Ms. Armstrong 
was an occasional visitor. He was questioned and ruled out as a 
suspect in the killings of the sightseers. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, after Ms. Armstrong's beheaded body was found along a  
stream near her home last week, authorities said they did not 
believe there was a connection to the February slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI task force and police had intensely followed leads across  
Northern California for five months. Maddock said last week that 
most of those responsible for the sightseers' deaths were behind 
bars on unrelated charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner came under suspicion in Ms. Armstrong's killing because  
his sport utility vehicle was spotted near her remote cabin an hour 
after she was last seen alive there Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice Thursday, park rangers and sheriff's deputies questioned  
Stayner and searched his car. Once, they grabbed his backpack to 
look for Ms. Armstrong's head, the FBI affidavit said. Nothing 
turned up -- Ms. Armstrong's head was later found near her body -- 
and Stayner was let go. 
</P>
<P>
	But after Stayner failed to show up for work Friday -- his first  
absence in a year and a half -- FBI agents looked for him again. He 
was tracked down Saturday at Laguna del Sol, a nudist colony near 
Sacramento, after someone there recognized him from news reports 
and called authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner then confessed to the agents, the FBI said.  
</P>
<P>
	He didn't say anything at a court appearance Monday in  
Sacramento. He nodded yes when asked if he understood the murder 
charge against him, and a public defender was appointed for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddock said that agents ``now believe there is a connection  
between the murders.'' Although he wouldn't say what they were, 
Juli Sund's throat also was cut, by a knife, so deeply that she was 
nearly decapitated, The Modesto Bee reported Monday, citing law 
enforcement sources and an interview with Francis Carrington, 
Juli's grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like Mr. Maddock, I feel sad we couldn't resolve this sooner  
and saved someone,'' Carrington said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other questions about the investigation remain. There is no  
evidence linking Stayner to others with ties to the sightseers 
case, and the FBI is trying to determine whether Stayner could be 
solely responsible for all four killings, Maddock said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stayner name already is indelibly etched in the annals of  
California crime. 
</P>
<P>
	His younger brother Steven Stayner was kidnapped off a Merced  
street in 1972 and raised for seven years by a man who sexually 
abused him. Steven finally escaped and was reunited with his 
family. The story inspired a TV miniseries but had a tragic ending: 
In 1989 he died at age 24 in a hit-and-run motorcycle accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner's uncle Jesse Stayner, died a year later after being  
shot by his own gun. The Merced County sheriff's office has 
reopened the case, considering Cary Stayner as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	People who knew Cary Stayner in El Portal said he was friendly  
but didn't seem to have close friends. He would often go to nude 
beaches and sunbathe naked in Yosemite, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron Ludwig, 16, who works at the town's only gas station, said  
that despite Stayner's good looks, he never had dates or talked 
about any girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time I talked with him he said he was on a dry  
spell,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner was first hired at the Cedar Lodge in August 1997. He  
took care of mechanical and electrical breakdowns, and carried a 
radio so he could be contacted by the front desk should anyone ask 
for towels, an extra cot, or some other need. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner rented a room above the restaurant and ate there  
regularly. He wasn't violent in any way, and his criminal record 
appears limited to drug charges, four of them filed in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some tourists in Yosemite said that despite Stayner's  
arrest, questions about the case left them jittery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely extra precautious of my surroundings and aware  
of my environment,'' said Shannon Schirack, 29, from Canton, Ohio, 
spending a few days at the park with friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're more on edge not knowing whether the case has been  
solved.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Hatch: 'Don't Count Me Out' </HEADLINE>

<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Conceding he's starting late and will be  
badly outspent, Sen. Orrin Hatch said today that he would build a 
``skinny cat'' network of small contributors to aid his quest for 
the Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't count me out,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're going to find there's going to be great  
groundswell,'' said Hatch, R-Utah. ``I guarantee you there's going 
to be a race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch was wrapping up a two-day swing in Iowa, where precinct  
caucuses open the nominating season. He met privately with key 
activists, spoke at a suburban house party and toured a local 
dairy, chatting with workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ending his swing, Hatch proclaimed himself satisfied. Another  
Iowa swing is on tap for the weekend. ``I'm the underdog, there's 
no question about it,'' said Hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch stunned many when he joined the race just three weeks ago,  
with rival candidates having been in the race for months and in 
some cases years. He joined a race where Texas Gov. George W. Bush 
holds a commanding lead in money and the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the heavy attention he's getting, Bush will see  
inevitable mistakes blown out of proportion, Hatch said, pointing 
to ridicule handed to former Vice President Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are going to Quayle-ize George W. Bush for every gaffe he  
makes,'' said Hatch. ``And there are going to be gaffes because 
this is the big leagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conceding that the GOP establishment is with Bush, Hatch said he  
would build a network of small contributors and supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we can do that, we're going to have a skinny cat  
campaign,'' said Hatch. ``He's got all the fat cats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his opening swing, Hatch was winning at least some converts.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a new face in Iowa and I think that's refreshing,'' said  
Doug Anderson. ``There's a lot of them we've been seeing time after 
time after time. I think he has an opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch offers a sharply conservative package of tax cuts and  
crime crackdowns, and says he brings a national reputation to the 
campaign trail. He's chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and 
has had a high-profile role in the confirmation battles of Supreme 
Court nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	While others in the large GOP field offer a similar mix of  
ideas, Hatch drew a distinction. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're good guys and any one of those would make a good  
president,'' said Hatch. ``None of them can win and they all know 
that. We know that very few of these people have a chance of 
winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to Bush, Hatch said, ``The difference between him and me  
is he has four years of experience as governor of Texas,'' said 
Hatch. ``I have 23 years of working on these problems. My only 
worry is that over the long run he's not going to be able to hang 
in there because of a lack of experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said he's built a reputation for being able to work across  
partisan lines, pointing to his ``fabled odd couple'' relationship 
with liberal Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hatch and Kennedy have done an awful lot of health care  
legislation in this country,'' said Hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to starting late, Hatch faces a serious scheduling  
problem, and a big test looming very quickly in a high-profile 
straw poll next month. While other rivals are working virtually 
full-time organizing for that straw poll, Hatch finds himself tied 
to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got one of the heaviest agendas in all of Washington,''  
said Hatch. ``That's a real problem for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Hatch vowed to compete in that straw poll and in Iowa's  
leadoff caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think we may just surprise some people,'' said Hatch.  
``Let's hope we can meet the low expectations that are expected 
right now.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Hatch: No Litmus Test on Judges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Orrin Hatch, a sharply conservative  
abortion foe who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, says he 
would not impose ``litmus tests'' on judicial nominees if he wins 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next president is going to select three nominees to the  
Supreme Court,'' said Hatch, R-Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any self-respecting Republican candidate should  
bind himself or herself to any litmus test issues,'' he said. 
``Anybody who says they're going to deprive a loyal, dignified, 
decent Republican or Democrat from serving their country because of 
any one issue is wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch made his comments Sunday as he opened a two-day campaign  
trip to Iowa, where precinct caucuses launch the presidential 
nominating season. This is Hatch's first trip to the state since 
his announcement last month that he would explore a possible bid 
for the Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	In his initial public appearance he spoke to about 100 people  
gathered for a suburban barbecue, acknowledging his long-shot 
status. 
</P>
<P>
	``My life has been a life of miracles,'' Hatch said.  
</P>
<P>
	During his tenure in the Senate, Hatch has gotten most attention  
from his Judiciary Committee posts during confirmation battles over 
Supreme Court justices. 
</P>
<P>
	That has turned into an issue in the Republican presidential  
campaign, with more conservative candidates arguing for imposition 
of a requirement that judicial nominees take anti-abortion stands. 
More moderate candidates -- such as Texas Gov. George W. Bush -- have 
rejected that argument. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said his experience in dealing with the courts is a  
strength he brings to the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know more about it than anybody running for president  
today,'' Hatch said. ``I've handled the judgeships for 23 years. I 
know what it takes for great Supreme Court justices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch's plunge into the GOP race surprised many because it came  
months -- and in some cases years -- after rival candidates began 
running. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged he trails badly in money and organization, but  
insisted he can make a race of a nomination fight where Bush has a 
big lead in most polling. He spent Sunday meeting privately with 
key activists and attending a suburban barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll make a race out of this thing,'' Hatch said. ``I think  
it's time in the Republican Party that we pick a candidate who is a 
candidate of the people, and not a candidate of the 
establishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush has dominated the financial field by raising $36  
million, Hatch said he would seek smaller contributions that will 
add up. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can get a million people to give me 36 bucks, I'm going  
to win this thing,'' Hatch said. ``Almost everybody can afford 36 
bucks. I'll take it to George W. Bush and Gore and Bradley like 
nobody ever thought you could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch entered the race only weeks before a high-profile straw  
poll Aug. 14. Hatch conceded he was urged by many not to 
participate in the straw poll because he hasn't had time to put 
together an organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think we have any choice because we think we have to  
get involved,'' Hatch said. ``We think we may just surprise some 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch is lacking in another resource: time, a scarce commodity  
for someone heading a major committee. He was forced to scale back 
his first swing because of votes scheduled in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big problem for me because I'm not going to fail to do  
my duty there,'' Hatch said.

<HEADLINE> Bailey Arrives Late to Pan Am Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Olympic sprint champion Donovan Bailey  
arrived at the Pan Am Games on Monday, almost 24 hours after the 
men's 100-meter race, still in the middle of a storm of criticism 
over skipping the race. 
</P>
<P>
	But an unapologetic Bailey pointed the finger squarely at  
Canadian officials, saying it wasn't his fault he wasn't picked for 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a choice made by myself. I wasn't selected,'' he  
said simply. 
</P>
<P>
	The former world record holder has taken a public relations hit  
over missing the games' marquee track event. He will still run in 
the 400-meter relay, and reportedly received a $200,000 promotional 
fee from organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	After a workout Monday afternoon, a smiling Bailey ducked  
critical questions the way Wayne Gretzky dodged bodychecks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said this a thousand times: I wasn't selected,'' he said.  
``After I was not selected (following last month's Canadian track 
and field championships), then I decided to take a couple of days 
off and rest. If I was selected, then I would have gone directly 
back to Austin (Texas) to train and prepare for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't make a decision after I've been sitting at home and  
resting for a week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canada was allowed two sprinters in the games. After Bailey  
finished third at the nationals, Athletics Canada selected Bruny 
Surin and Brad McCuaig, the two runners who beat him, for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	But Surin soon dropped out and Canadian track officials asked  
Bailey to run as the second Canadian. He refused. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're beating this up and you understand you're not getting  
anywhere with it,'' Bailey said. ``I'm in no control of the 
selection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said Pan Am organizers have been understanding about his  
predicament and don't subscribe to ``this blame Donovan stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Pan Am people have been very good in acknowledging  
that it had nothing to do with me,'' he said. ``I think they 
understand there's a selection process and a selection committee 
and that's what their responsibility is. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Pan Am organizers are happy with what I've done.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Pirnie, Canada's track and field coach for the games, said  
his hands were tied when it came to selecting the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Athletics Canada has so many lawsuits over selections that we  
feel we're backed into a corner. That's what happens when you have 
lawyers pick your team for you,'' Pirnie said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In hindsight, it would have been great to name the relay team  
and announce the 100-meter guys later. But there was pressure to 
announce the whole team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pirnie also said he wished Surin had made his intentions clear  
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey received support Monday from veteran sprinter Angela  
Bailey (no relation), who has returned to top-level competition at 
the age of 37. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to know a lot about Athletics Canada before you can  
judge him,'' she said. ``Donovan is reacting to how he was treated 
by Athletics Canada. That's all there is to it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to clean up their act.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bailey practiced with the relay team Monday and said he was fit  
and ready to run fast. ``I think I'm in as good a shape now as I 
was last year at this time.''

<HEADLINE> Wilson Provides Power for Marlins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Preston Wilson might be the National League Rookie  
of Year. Then again, he might not even be the best rookie on his 
own team. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, Wilson is one reason the Florida Marlins are  
optimistic the future will be much better than the present. 
</P>
<P>
	Long regarded a top prospect, Wilson provides the power in the  
Marlins' youth movement. The 25-year-old stepson of former big 
leaguer Mookie Wilson began this week leading all major league 
rookies with 18 homers and a .545 slugging percentage to go with a 
.295 average and 47 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never doubted my ability,'' Wilson said. ``But every time  
you have some success, it erases doubts in everyone else's mind. 
Hopefully it'll give this organization more confidence in me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins always liked Wilson, which is why they acquired him  
last year in a trade that sent catcher Mike Piazza to the New York 
Mets. But for any skeptics, Wilson's recent play has been pretty 
persuasive. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden, people are talking about Preston Wilson for  
rookie of the year,'' Florida manager John Boles said. ``If he hits 
.280 with 30 homers, there aren't a lot of rookies who do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race for the award will lend a little drama to the final two  
months of the Marlins' season. They have the second-worst record in 
the majors, but they also have four of baseball's top rookies. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Aven, Wilson, Alex Gonzalez and Kevin Millar began the  
week 1-2-3-4 on the team in RBIs. Aven and Millar were hitting 
above .320, and Gonzalez made the National League All-Star team at 
shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said his vote for Rookie of the Year goes to Gonzalez.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of candidates,'' Wilson said. ``It's nice to  
think I've got a shot at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson charged into contention in the past month, reaching base  
in 21 consecutive games through Sunday and hitting .449 during that 
stretch to hike his average from .249 to .295. He began the week 
with a 12-game hitting streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hitters go through stretches like this where you're feeling  
comfortable and seeing the ball well,'' he said. ``And there are 
also times it seems like they're throwing a pea up there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson's big swing means slumps are inevitable, but the Marlins  
regard him as a potential 50-homer hitter, which doesn't sound 
outlandish to those who have watched him rip one ball after another 
over the past month. Last Friday against Milwaukee, for example, 
Wilson went 4-for-5, and his only out came on a leaping catch by 
Geoff Jenkins on the warning track. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he hits the ball he has a lot of success, because he hits  
it so hard,'' Boles said. ``It sounds different coming off his bat 
from most hitters. The key for him is contact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lean but muscular Wilson hit .252 with 83 homers in six  
minor league seasons, mostly in the Mets' organization. He struck 
out 489 times in 372 games and began this week with a team-high 86 
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wilson has made better contact lately by shortening his  
swing with two strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's becoming a better hitter,'' Boles said. ``He's very  
intelligent, he's a hard worker and he listens to instruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he's flirting with .300, Wilson is more concerned about  
driving in runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The batting average just happens,'' he said. ``If you hit .260  
and drive in 130 runs, nobody is going to say anything about your 
batting average. Runs win games; hits don't.''

<HEADLINE> Jerry Jones Plays Tough With Picks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones  
once thought he was beating the system by signing rookies before 
the draft was even over. Now he's going to the other extreme. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys opened training camp Monday without having signed  
their top two picks and a sixth-round selection. Three other 
rookies agreed to deals Monday and late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones became rather animated as he detailed his new strategy  
during opening remarks of a kickoff news conference at Midwestern 
State University. He brought up the subject himself, asked his own 
questions and by the end was unconsciously rapping his knuckles on 
a table for emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to drive this process; we don't want to be driven,''  
said Jones, explaining that those mid-draft negotiations of 
yesteryear ended up costing the team dollars against the salary 
cap. ``We deliberately set it up so we'd be in the position we're 
in now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unsigned players are defensive lineman Ebenezer Ekuban,  
offensive lineman Solomon Page and receiver Mar Tay Jenkins. 
Last-minute deals were struck with linebacker Dat Nguyen, receiver 
Wane McGarity and defensive lineman Peppi Zellner. Seventh-round 
pick Mike Lucky, a tight end, was the only early bird, signing last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seriously hurts a rookie not to be in training camp the  
very first practice and not to be here for the very first 
meeting,'' Jones said. ``You say, ``Doesn't it hurt the team?' Yes 
it does, but not as much as if we gave them what the agent for the 
rookie wanted us to be giving him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Jones is normally a trend-setter in NFL business moves,  
he's joining the crowd on this one. Ekuban, the 20th overall pick, 
was one of 20 first-rounders without contracts as of early Monday. 
His market value is still being determined as the picks closest to 
him who have signed were Nos. 18 and 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas reportedly is offering Page a four-year deal with a  
$780,000 signing bonus; he'd like $50,000 to $100,000 more or a 
three-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenkins will likely have to settle for whatever the cap-strapped  
Cowboys have left. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to make a decision: is the short-term benefit of  
having (a player) in camp worth what we gave up that we didn't feel 
we had to give up?'' Jones said. ``The bottom line is you can get 
every rookie in you want. We just don't want to pay that high a 
price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before he got rolling on that subject, Jones proclaimed this  
past offseason the most productive in his 11 years as the team's 
owner and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The highlights included signing veteran starters at receiver  
(Rocket Ismail), offensive line (Mark Stepnoski) and linebacker 
(Quentin Coryatt), plus trading for receiver James McKnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we have made tremendous progress in acquiring  
talent at positions where we really wanted to fill a need,'' Jones 
said. ``We were very aggressive, probably the most aggressive we've 
been. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like this team and the exciting year that lies ahead.''  
</P>
<P>
	Although veterans aren't due until Thursday, several will be  
around Tuesday and Wednesday. They're expected to work out on the 
side while coaches dedicate their attention to the youngsters and 
other newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes it a cleaner practice when you don't have to say your  
older guys `Step out of the way and let these younger guys take 
some reps,''' second-year coach Chan Gailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leon Lett and Deion Sanders, the anchors of Dallas' defense,  
won't be taking part in two-a-days any time soon. Lett is suspended 
indefinitely and Sanders has a mysterious toe injury that's slow to 
heal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said he hopes commissioner Paul Tagliabue will announce  
early in camp when Lett can return, but he doesn't know when a 
decision will be made. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders has been running on machines that help him safely  
distribute his weight. He will soon begin straight-ahead running 
without technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's progressing,'' Jones said. ``I'm told we won't know  
anything really definitive until he starts pushing off, cutting, 
getting into football situations and reacting accordingly.''

<HEADLINE> Boston Housing Settles Bias Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Omayra Claudio says she knew it was time to leave  
home when her landlord -- the Boston Housing Authority -- took months 
to clean off the swastikas someone had painted on her door. 
</P>
<P>
	She and other public housing tenants won some measure of relief  
Monday when the housing authority agreed to pay $1.5 million to 
settle racial discrimination charges filed by Claudio and 12 other 
residents, all of them black or Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged incidents took place between 1992 and 1996 at two  
housing projects in south Boston and Charlestown that were almost 
entirely white before the housing authority began desegregating 
them in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement provides $650,000 for the 13 plaintiffs, $500,000  
for attorneys' fees, and $350,000 for other public housing tenants 
who come forward with claims of racial harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement comes six months after a federal investigation  
uncovered a pattern of ``systemic discrimination'' between 1992 and 
1996 by the housing authority -- the first time the U.S. Department 
of Housing and Urban Development ever made such a charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Reina Rodriguez, 30, who lived in the Old Colony public housing  
development in south Boston until 1995, said white tenants 
repeatedly vandalized her car, shouted racist insults at her and 
her three children, and scrawled racist graffiti outside her door, 
with a drawing of a lynching and the words, ``We're going to kill 
all you niggers if you don't leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also said white tenants tied her door shut from the outside  
with a rope when she was nine months' pregnant. She said the 
housing authority repeatedly ignored her transfer requests. 
</P>
<P>
	Claudio, 27, whose parents came from Puerto Rico 20 years ago,  
said she and her four children suffered three years of racial 
harassment while living in the Bunker Hill development. She said 
harassment was so bad she feared walking a block to the store 
because white tenants would make racial insults or spit on her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping they'll make some changes now,'' said Claudio.  
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also called for the BHA to take specific steps to  
prevent any further incidents. This steps include increasing police 
patrols to deter racial harassment; cracking down on racist 
graffiti; hiring two people to investigate civil rights complaints; 
providing civil rights training for employees and tenants; and 
keeping track of reports of racial bias. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Henriquez, who took over the BHA in 1996, said she  
welcomed the settlement because it included many of the reforms the 
BHA was already implementing.

<HEADLINE> Abbott Says He Is Retired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Jim Abbott, released by the Milwaukee Brewers on  
Friday, said his baseball career is over, barring a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've come to the end, baseball-wise,'' Abbott told the  
Detroit Free Press from his home in California on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander said it's time for him to move on ``and look in  
other areas and aspects of life. It's time to admit reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott had a 2-8 record and a 6.91 earned-run average when he  
was released by the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott said he has concluded in the past few weeks he can no  
longer pitch effectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fulfilled. I feel satisfied,'' he said. ``My career  
wasn't always great, but it was wonderful. I learned so many 
lessons and had so many great friends and experiences. I don't feel 
the emptiness that I felt after I was released by the Angels a few 
years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott, born without a right hand, was a collegiate star at  
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll always be looked at as having played with one hand,''  
Abbott said. ``There's an accomplishment to that that I can be 
proud of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He played for the United States team that won the baseball  
tournament at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. He then skipped the 
minors and went straight to the California Angels. He later pitched 
for the New York Yankees, pitching a no-hitter in 1993, and the 
Chicago White Sox.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Computer Business Grows Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif (AP) -- Compaq Computer, struggling with  
executive turmoil and sharp competition, barely held its three-year 
lead as the top personal computer vendor in the world during the 
second quarter of 1999, according to market research companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compaq certainly has some issues. They weren't really prepared  
for this whole subsidized free PC marketing blitz that happened,'' 
said International Data Corp. analyst Christine Arrington in 
Framingham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	After leading the industry with inexpensive personal computers  
in the early 1990s, Compaq's profits have plunged as competition 
has flourished in the low-end market, and Internet services are 
giving away PCs to people who sign up for their services. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, released Monday, show that worldwide shipments rose  
25.6 million, a 27 percent increase over the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq managed to capture 14.6 percent of the worldwide market,  
but in the U.S. Compaq retained a very narrow lead -- one-third of 
one percent -- over arch rival Dell Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In the U.S., Dell's unit volume increased 55 percent as the  
company expanded. IBM rose to the No. 3 spot in the U.S. reporting 
70 percent growth over the same period last year, according to IDC. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Smulders, a senior analyst at Dataquest Inc. in San  
Jose, said international growth reflected recovering markets in 
Asia and South America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demand in the Asia-Pacific region was driven by a return in  
business confidence together with Internet-related consumer PC 
demand,'' he said. ``The Latin America market also did well as the 
Brazilian market shows signs of recovering from the exchange rate 
crisis in January and continued strength in Mexico.''

<HEADLINE> No Charges Yet in Tobacco Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Justice Department officials are nearing a  
decision to end their criminal investigation of the tobacco 
industry without charges but are debating whether the evidence they 
gathered can now be used to prepare a civil lawsuit, a senior 
department official says. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision to close the criminal case has been anticipated for  
several months. Among subjects the investigation looked into was 
whether industry executives lied either to Congress or the Food and 
Drug Administration about their knowledge of nicotine's 
addictiveness or how it was used in the manufacture of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional testimony from tobacco executives was  
delivered April 14, 1994, and the statements to the FDA were made 
as late as June of that year. In both cases, the five-year statute 
of limitations ran out this year without charges being filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno has authorized the department's  
civil division to prepare a lawsuit to recover billions of dollars 
spent by federal health insurance programs to treat tobacco-related 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	A task force of civil division lawyers is studying 200,000 pages  
of industry documents disclosed during a Minnesota lawsuit against 
the tobacco companies. As the industry settled with most state 
governments, Minnesota received $6.6 billion to drop its suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The formal ending of the criminal investigation has been delayed  
in part by the debate over whether to transfer to the civil task 
force the industry documents and other evidence obtained during the 
criminal grand jury investigation, according to the department 
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Because grand juries have more power to compel disclosure of  
information than plaintiffs in civil lawsuits, it is unusual, 
though not unheard of, for such transfers to occur. 
</P>
<P>
	A transfer would require permission for a limited exception to  
grand jury secrecy rules from Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, who, as 
the chief U.S. District Court judge here, supervises the grand jury 
that heard evidence in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Without question, the tobacco companies would oppose such a  
transfer if Johnson allowed them to state a preference. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration partially averted a potential roadblock  
Friday in its efforts to obtain extra funds to bring the case. The 
Justice Department has sought $20 million for the fiscal year 
beginning Oct. 1 to pay for 40 lawyers and expert witness fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate removed language from its report on the Justice  
appropriations bill that could have barred spending any money on 
the lawsuit, but the bill still does not provide the requested $20 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said last week she has enough attorneys to file a lawsuit  
but hopes to persuade Congress to provide the extra money to ensure 
the government makes the best case it can in court.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Challenges Cable Ordinance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- AT&AMP;T filed a lawsuit Monday  
challenging an ordinance forcing it to open up it's high-speed 
cable network to competing Internet Service Providers. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit says the Broward County ordinance violates federal law  
prohibiting local cable franchising authorities from imposing 
access obligations on cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, AT&AMP;T's suit says the ordinance interferes with  
``the First Amendment rights of cable operators to determine the 
particular services or content that they will offer their viewers 
over those networks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit maintains the Broward ordinance also violates Florida  
law because the regulation of telecommunications companies falls 
only within the jurisdiction of the Florida Public Service 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has argued that it is making major investments in upgrading  
cable systems and should be allowed to recoup its investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Rosenblum, AT&AMP;T vice president-law, said ``the FCC wisely  
concluded that regulating Internet access in this manner was not 
only unnecessary, it would reduce investment and delay new 
services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Communications Commission chairman William Kennard has  
advocated a national policy on high-speed, or ``broadband,'' 
Internet access and has urged municipalities against coming up with 
their own regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The ordinance, passed two weeks ago by the Broward  
commissioners, was a setback for AT&AMP;T, which has spent billions 
buying cable companies to create a national network for local 
telephone and high-speed Internet service. It lobbied extensively 
to kill the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit names TCI of South Florida Inc. and MediaOne of  
Greater Florida Inc. as the plaintiffs. Earlier this year, AT&AMP;T 
bought Tele-Communications Inc. and reached an agreement to buy 
MediaOne Group Inc., MediaOne's parent corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T is involved in a similar fight in Portland, Ore. That  
city's ordinance was upheld by a federal judge and AT&AMP;T has 
appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco's city supervisors voted Monday night to hold off  
any action on the issue, pending the outcome of the Portland case.

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Threaten Montana Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Fires burning through forest, brush and grassland across the  
West threatened a Montana ranch town today and briefly chased 
people from their homes in a Southern California community. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montana blaze had covered 16,000 acres as of today and  
burned to within a mile of Musselshell, population about 50. 
</P>
<P>
	``The town of Musselshell is still threatened, but we don't have  
an evacuation order in place,'' fire information officer Mary 
Lunsford said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranchers outside the small central Montana town of Musselshell  
evacuated horses and cattle Sunday, and some were prepared to leave 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just take it moment by moment,'' said Barbara Jenkins, a  
caretaker for a 5,000-acre spread. 
</P>
<P>
	A force of some 200 firefighters stepped up efforts today to  
take advantage of lower temperatures and a forecast lull in the 
wind. Temperatures hit record lows today across central Montana, 
including 39 degrees at Lewistown, about 75 miles from Musselshell. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really going to hit it hard today, because tomorrow  
winds are back up and temperature goes up,'' Lunsford said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was started by lightning Saturday night, and jumped  
across highway U.S. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's dangerous, hard and frustrating,'' said Paul May, fire  
program manager with the state Department of Natural Resources and 
Conservation. ``You think you're taking care of it, but the wind 
switches and you're off to the races again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A fast-moving fire in the San Bernardino National Forest near  
Adelanto, Calif., about 70 miles northeast of Los Angeles, damaged 
several structures, killed sheep and other livestock and forced 
several dozen families to leave their homes. Most residents were 
allowed to return late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just kind of scary. You think 'Boy, you're going to lose  
everything.' You just grab your animals and go,'' said resident 
Langsdon Canright, who fled with his horse. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were reported and no homes were destroyed.  
</P>
<P>
	``In 45 minutes we were running for our lives,'' said tearful  
resident Joan Van Horn. ``The fire was in the meadow right in front 
of me. We couldn't see to get out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze was 20 percent contained late Sunday but there was no  
estimate on when it would be fully encircled. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in Southern California, an estimated 2,000  
firefighters had managed to contain about 90 percent of a blaze 
that had burned 14,500 acres over the past week north of Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire crews in Nevada had to watch for rattlesnakes as they  
battled a 15,500-acre in brush, pines and grass about eight miles 
east of Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's creepy,'' said Sharon Sweeney, a Forest Service official  
sent from Oregon to help with communications efforts in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire east of Reno was completely surrounded Sunday and crews  
expected to have it extinguished sometime today. Smoke was visible 
in downtown Reno during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters also had contained a 15,500-acre blaze about 30  
miles southeast of Fallon, Nev., some 60 miles from Reno. That fire 
was started Thursday by bombs dropped on a training range at the 
Fallon Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sparsely settled area along the Nevada-Utah state line, a  
range fire was under control after burning more than 32,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of northern Nevada is very, very dry,'' Forest Service  
spokeswoman Sharon Sweeney said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters in Utah hoped to complete containment lines tonight  
around a fire that charred 3,000 acres of thick oak brush and 
sagebrush about 27 miles northeast of Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire near Henefer was 60 percent contained Sunday evening  
after it burned to within 20 feet of two homes.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Sign Elton Brand for 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Elton Brand, the NBA's top draft pick, signed a  
three-year contract Monday with the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	A team source who spoke on condition of anonymity said Brand  
signed for a package that totals about $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really excited to be with the Bulls and I'm looking  
forward to joining (coach) Tim Floyd and the rest of the team in 
Utah,'' Brand said in a statement released by the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls are playing in the Rocky Mountain Summer League in  
Utah, and Brand was expected to report on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8, 260-pound forward spent the last month playing  
with the U.S. national team in the Olympic-qualifying tournament in 
Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize the expectations that come with being the overall  
No. 1 draft pick, and I'm going to work hard to live up to those 
expectations,'' Brand said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls got the first pick by winning the draft lottery  
drawing on May 22. They finished 13-37 during the season and got 
into the lottery by virtue of not making the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls were six-time NBA champions in the 1990s, but slipped  
to near the bottom of the league when Michael Jordan retired and 
All-Star Scottie Pippen was traded. Role players such as Dennis 
Rodman, Luc Longley, Steve Kerr also left the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Their .260 winning percentage was the lowest in franchise  
history, beating out the 1975-76 squad, which finished 24-58 with a 
.293 winning percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Their average of 81.9 points was the lowest scoring average in  
NBA history since the inception of the shot clock. Entering this 
season, the lowest average was 87.4 points in 72 games by the 
Milwaukee Hawks in 1954-55, the season the clock was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, a unanimous AP All-American this spring, averaged 16.2  
points, 8.9 rebounds and 1.88 blocks his two years at Duke. As a 
sophomore, he led the Atlantic Coast Conference in scoring with a 
17.7 average and rebounding with a 9.8 average. Brand averaged 17 
points and 9.2 rebounds in six NCAA tournament games as Duke 
finished as the 1999 runnerup. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago's other first-round selection, Ron Artest of St. John's,  
signed a three-year pact on July 15.

<HEADLINE> Autogrill Offers Host Marriott Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italy's Autogrill SpA plans to offer $529 million in  
cash for the U.S.-based airport restaurant concessionaire Host 
Marriott Services Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Autogrill, a highway restaurant company controlled by the  
apparel retailer Benetton, said in a statement Monday that the 
buyout offer had been unanimously approved by the board of Host 
Marriott Services. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged group would have activities in North America, Europe,  
Australia and Asia, and Autogrill says it would be the world's 
biggest restaurant operator catering to travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	The $15.75 a share cash offer represents a 61.5 percent premium  
over Host Marriott Services' closing price of $9.75 a share Friday 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Autogrill has 652 restaurants and bars and is Europe's biggest  
restaurant group catering to travelers. It recently won the rights 
to use the Burger King brand in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bethesda, Md.-based Host Marriott Services is the U.S. leader in  
restaurant concessions and is present in nearly 200 locations. It 
operates in 18 of the 20 biggest American airports and has rights 
to the brands Burger King, Pizza Hut and Starbucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Autogrill said its offer would start Aug. 2 and must be accepted  
by two-thirds of HMS shareholders to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
	It plans to operate in five main areas: highway restaurants,  
airports, shopping centers, railway stations and quick-service 
urban outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the combined sales of the two groups reached an  
equivalent of over $2.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> Gonzaga Promotes Few to Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Gonzaga University athletic director Mike  
Roth didn't have to look too far to find the new men's basketball 
coach. Mark Few's office is located down the hall from Roth. 
</P>
<P>
	Associate head coach Few was named Monday to replace Dan Monson,  
who was named coach at Minnesota on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Few, 36, is entering his 11th season with the Gonzaga program.  
The Oregon graduate started as a graduate assistant, then spent 
eight years as assistant coach. He was named associate head coach 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a no-brainer,'' Roth said. ``We didn't need to do a  
search, we wouldn't find a better coach than Mark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contract terms were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the biggest day outside of my marriage,'' Few told a  
roomful of current and former players. ``This is a dream job with 
the type of guys we have here. The beat will continue on from last 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few's recruiting and game preparation helped the Bulldogs to 170  
wins, five West Coast Conference championships and five trips to 
postseason play in the past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of the Bulldogs' top ten players return to a team that  
finished with a 28-7 record and made it to the Elite Eight before 
falling to eventual champion Connecticut in last year's NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Few, who was recently recruiting in California, said that even  
with the changes, the returning players and players who have 
already signed plan to stay at Gonzaga. 
</P>
<P>
	Few, who was in charge of scheduling games before his  
appointment as head coach, put together the toughest schedule in 
the program's history for the upcoming season. The Bulldogs have 
road games against Cincinnati, Temple, UCLA and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an assistant I put together the toughest schedule in  
Gonzaga history, and I had every intention playing it as an 
assistant,'' Few joked. ``This is the type of schedule our guys 
want to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzaga opens its season Nov. 6 against a team of alumni.

<HEADLINE> Braves Lose Javy Lopez to Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves have been hit with another  
major injury, losing catcher Javy Lopez for the season with an 
injury to a ligament in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big blow,'' GM John Schuerholz said Monday night during  
Atlanta's 6-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. ``We'll miss 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Braves orthopedic surgeon Dr. Joe Chandler examined Lopez on  
Monday and made the determination that the two-time All-Star needed 
to undergo surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Chandler ... decided that surgery is necessary to repair  
the damage that has been done,'' Schuerholz said after returning 
from the Hall of Fame ceremonies. ``Javy will have the knee 
repaired and strengthened so he can be 100 percent for next 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez is hitting .317 with 11 home runs and 45 RBIs in 65 games.  
</P>
<P>
	Before the season even began, the Braves lost first baseman  
Andres Galarraga for the season with cancer and closer Kerry 
Ligtenberg, who had 30 saves in 1998, to elbow surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, the Braves reacquired catcher Greg Myers in a  
trade with the San Diego Padres to replace Lopez on the roster, 
sending minor league right-hander Doug Dent in exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta also said rookie left-hander Odalis Perez, placed on the  
15-day DL Friday, will have surgery to repair a torn medial 
collateral ligament in his left elbow and will miss the rest of the 
season. Perez will miss at least a year following the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, replaced as the No. 5 starter in the rotation, was 4-6  
with a 6.00 ERA in 18 games, 17 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, outfielder Brian Jordan, one of Atlanta's two  
All-Stars this season, will miss at least the next three games with 
a pinched nerve in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of times when I've thrown the ball lately, I've had a  
tingling in my right hand,'' said Jordan, who had a cortisone 
injection in his right wrist prior to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan is hitting .291 with 18 home runs and 79 RBIs in 97  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Braves trainer Dave Pursley said Jordan has been having problems  
with his entire right side, his back, shoulder, elbow, wrist and 
hand. He said Jordan would miss 3-5 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Odalis is gone (for the season), I think, but we were lucky to  
get Myers,'' manager Bobby Cox. ``That covers us for catching and 
Jordan will be in the lineup one of these days. 
</P>
<P>
	John Smoltz, who is 8-3 this season despite two trips to the  
15-day DL, pitched well Saturday against Philadelphia in his first 
start back from his latest visit to the DL and is expected to start 
against the Phillies on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers, 33, hit .289 with three homers and 15 RBIs in 50 games  
for the Padres this year. He appeared in nine games for the Braves 
in September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Dent, acquired by the Braves in 1997, was 4-5 with a 3.44 ERA in  
17 games for Class A Macon.

said Monday that he had no intention of abandoning the GOP for the 
Reform Party, as Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, the highest-ranking elected official of the Reform  
Party, said Sunday that the Arizona senator would make a strong 
Reform candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although I am flattered by his kind words, I would instead ask  
him and his supporters to consider pursuing our shared reform 
agenda through the party to which I am a proud and loyal member -- 
the Republican Party,'' McCain said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the Republican Party ``the real party of reform.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to reach out to Reform Party members and  
reform-minded voters everywhere to support my candidacy for 
president because our cause is greater than partisan politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain trails Republican front-runner George W. Bush in recent  
public opinion polls and in fund-raising. Sen. Bob Smith of New 
Hampshire quit the Republican Party earlier this month and said he 
would continue to campaign for the White House as an independent.

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Publishing magnate Steve Forbes ran up  
$110 in parking fines during a campaign stop in Cherokee, where one 
of his buses pulled up in a no-parking zone and another stopped in 
a space reserved for the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes was in Cherokee, a town of 6,000 people in northwest  
Iowa, on July 15 for an event at the Brown Stone Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Marilyn Turner, acting director of Iowa's Commission for Persons  
with Disabilities, told the Ottumwa Courier it ``sets a bad 
example'' for presidential candidates or anyone else to use a 
handicap-accessible parking space illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to be perceived as a lawbreaker, no one does,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes spokesman Mike Riley said the check for the fines was  
mailed July 16. He declined to answer questions about why the 
violation occurred.

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Sen. Orrin Hatch disputed a new poll  
showing him trailing Texas Gov. George W. Bush in Utah, and offered 
this assessment of the Republican presidential race: ``If Bush and 
I went head to head in Utah, I'd kick his tail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wrapping up a two-day campaign swing in Iowa, where precinct  
caucuses launch the presidential nominating season, the Utah 
senator was asked about a poll published by The Salt Lake Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	In that survey, 30 percent said they favored Bush and 20 percent  
backed Hatch. Nearly a third hadn't made up their minds. The survey 
was conducted for the newspaper by Valley Research. The telephone 
survey of 511 people statewide was conducted July 12-15 and had a 
margin of error of 4.5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said other media polls showing him beating Bush in Utah.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the last poll, I was ahead of George Bush by quite a bit,''  
said Hatch.

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Republican presidential candidates have  
rented nearly every air-conditioned bus available in Iowa to carry 
their supporters to the Aug. 14 GOP straw poll in Ames. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates are looking for buses as far away as Chicago, bus  
company and campaign officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican officials estimate that 10,000 to 12,000 people will  
take part in the straw poll, considered an early test of candidate 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	The buses that roll into Ames for the event at Hilton Coliseum  
could number in the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have enough buses in Iowa to cover them all,'' said  
Jim Breining, the owner of Five Oaks Charter of Des Moines. He 
already has lined up more than 40 buses, including nine of his own, 
to transport supporters of Texas Gov. George W. Bush. And he's 
still looking for more of the 47-passenger vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's slim pickings out there,'' he said. ``It's like looking  
for corn in a field after the picker has gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Kochel, general manager of Iowa Coaches, said about 45  
buses will be used to haul former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander's 
supporters to Ames. 
</P>
<P>
	Monte Shaw, the director of Elizabeth Dole's Iowa Campaign, was  
tight-lipped about her plans. ``I would love to know exactly how 
many buses every campaign has got and where they're coming from,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Haus, an adviser to Steve Forbes, said delivering busloads  
of supporters to the straw poll is a good organizational test prior 
to the Iowa caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been no small task to get buses,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The presidential politicking ``really puts Iowa at an advantage,  
and it's good for business,'' Breining said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to get your money up front, though,'' warned Duane  
Grooms of Logan, owner of Crusader Coach Lines. ``If they lose, it 
gets hard to find them.''

<HEADLINE> CBS Defends Its Record on Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- With minority characters featured in 12  
of 19 programs in its fall lineup, CBS has worked harder than other 
networks to include non-whites, network executive Leslie Moonves 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can, we will do more ... but CBS stands alone as the No. 1  
network aware of its responsibility in this area,'' Moonves said 
Sunday during the summer meeting of the Television Critics 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The four major networks, including CBS, have come under fire  
from minority groups for fielding a nearly all-white lineup of new 
fall shows. CBS executives will meet next month with the NAACP to 
discuss the issue, said Moonves, president and chief executive 
officer of CBS Television. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS already is the home of Bill Cosby, (``Cosby''), Cheech Marin  
(``Nash Bridges''), Della Reese (``Touched by an Angel'') and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS boasted about two new shows: the fall series ``Now and  
Again,'' featuring black actor Dennis Haysbert as a scientist, and 
``City of Angels,'' a midseason hospital drama starring Vivica A. 
Fox and Blair Underwood, both black. 
</P>
<P>
	``City of Angels'' is from veteran producer Steven Bochco  
(``Hill Street Blues,'' ``L.A. Law,'' ``NYPD Blue'') who said a 
major reason for doing it was to use the many black actors, writers 
and directors ignored by the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's this extraordinary talent pool underutilized in our  
business, both in New York and Los Angeles,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Warren, who played police Officer Bobby Hill in ``Hill  
Street Blues'' and will star in ``City of Angels,'' lamented 
television's lack of progress since a two-decade-old study on the 
lack of racial inclusiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're asking the same question that was asked 22 years  
ago, something needs to be done,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paris Barclay, the black co-creator and co-executive producer of  
``City of Angels,'' blamed the dearth of minorities on TV producers 
living in upscale white enclaves such as Malibu, Brentwood and 
Bel-Air. They don't know blacks and feel uncomfortable working with 
them, he argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochco called the lack of minorities on TV a function of  
economics rather than racism. 
</P>
<P>
	Since audiences failed to watch shows such as ``Paris,'' a drama  
Bochco produced a decade ago starring James Earl Jones, or the 
scrapped 1995 family drama ``Under One Roof,'' networks don't want 
to take the risk again, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``City of Angels'' carries the burden of proving a largely black  
cast can appeal to all viewers, Bochco acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very conscious of the significance of the show,'' he said.  
``I hope I'm not being naive that if we make a good show, the color 
of the characters will recede in importance.''

<HEADLINE> Griffey Focusing on Pitching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- After receiving three contract offers from the  
Seattle Mariners, Ken Griffey Jr.'s focus seems to be on ERAs more 
than dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, signed through the 2000 season, was offered a $72  
million, five-year extension last September, a $105 million, 
seven-year deal in April and an eight-year package last week, The 
Seattle Times reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper attributed the offers to unidentified sources and did  
not report the value of the latest package. 
</P>
<P>
	``What about my pitching?'' the paper quoted Griffey as saying  
to team president Chuck Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, Griffey and Alex Rodriguez made clear they wanted a  
winning team. General manager Woody Woodward added one pitcher who 
has stayed healthy, closer Jose Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Mariners have foundered and trail the first-place Texas  
Rangers by 11 games in the AL West, hurt by a weak bullpen. They 
dealt outfielder Butch Huskey to Boston for a minor league pitcher 
on Monday and don't have much time for more moves with Saturday's 
trade deadline approaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``An important week?'' Griffey told the Times. ``This was an  
important season. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey and Rodriguez both are eligible for free agency after  
the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alex and I gave them a warning'' in October, Griffey said. ``I  
told them, `This is the year.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	He knows he'll get his money.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's all about having a goal and being able to achieve that  
goal,'' Griffey said. ``I have the hammer, I know I do. And there's 
nothing the Mariners can do or say. They've got to show Alex and 
(me) they want to go out and get people to help us win. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Put) together a team that every day, we can go out feeling we  
have a chance to beat the other club. It's a 25-man thing, a team 
feeling that in early August, we're the team everyone is chasing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey has kidded about playing elsewhere in the past. Lately  
there's more such talk, with less laughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Have you seen the standings?'' he asked. ``What's Woodward  
done about that? What's to laugh about?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He seems angry, claiming the team has concentrated on the  
business end rather than players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Organizations have forgotten a team is a family. All they  
worry about now is corporate sponsors,'' he said. ``Not just in 
Seattle. All over. Baseball is more of a business now, and that 
bothers me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's beginning to see his father's life reflected in his own.  
Ken Griffey Sr. played for the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until I was 8, I got used to (my dad) being home. Then I  
didn't see him summers until I was 19. Actually I never saw that 
much of him until we played together in 1990.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey talks about playing in the Midwest, where he could fly  
home to Florida on off-days, or being with a team that has spring 
training in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	He thinks Seattle may deal him if he doesn't agree to an  
extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't trade me in the offseason,'' Griffey said, ``I  
don't think I'll make it through spring training.''

<HEADLINE>  Boxer Fernando Vargas Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- Junior middleweight boxing champion  
Fernando Vargas was arrested for investigation of assault with a 
deadly weapon and burglary, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas, 21, of Oxnard, Calif., was arrested with four other men  
shortly after 6 a.m. Sunday in Summerland, said Santa Barbara 
County sheriff's Sgt. Bill Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas successfully defended his International Boxing Federation  
junior middleweight title July 17 in a bout with Raul Marquez in 
Nevada. He earned $500,000 with the win, his 17th straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe Vargas and the others entered a man's home  
and attacked him. The victim, whose name was withheld, suffered 
minor injuries but did not require hospitalization, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Summerland is an unincorporated county area.  
</P>
<P>
	Vargas and the other men, ages 20 to 28, were released after  
posting bail of $10,000 each, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to assault and burglary, they were also booked for  
investigation of conspiracy to commit a crime. Authorities declined 
to reveal what type of weapon was used in the attack, but said it 
was not a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	An arraignment for Vargas has been scheduled for Aug. 23.  
</P>
<P>
	Vargas wants to unify the junior middleweight division and hopes  
to fight undefeated welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of the 1996 U.S. Olympic boxing team, he emerged as a  
potential star in the sport in December 1998 when he stopped 
veteran Yory Boy Campas of Mexico to win the IBF junior 
middleweight championship. He won the bout only five days after his 
21st birthday and in his 15th professional fight.

	Handyman Confesses to Killing  
</P>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The FBI says a maintenance man who is  
a suspect in four killings at Yosemite National park has confessed 
to the brutal murder of a naturalist. The agency says handyman Cary 
Stayner confessed to beheading Joie Ruth Armstrong after he was 
tracked down by agents over the weekend. Stayner, 37, is to be 
arraigned this afternoon in that crime. He is also the prime 
suspect in the murders of three Yosemite sightseers, the FBI said,

shuttered houses mourned the victims of the worst single act of 
violence since peace formally came to Kosovo. The new reports of 
ethnically inspired violence added to the difficulties of 
re-establishing Serb-Albanian trust. NATO forces reported several 
violent incidents, including an exchange of gunfire last night

Authorities said anywhere from 200 to 500 people took part in the 
rioting, setting fires and looting vendors in what some 
concert-goers claimed was in retaliation for high prices. The 
rioters used equipment and vendors' booths as fuel for the 
bonfires, turning them into raging infernos. Hundreds of state 
troopers in riot gear eventually calmed things down.

eastward through the Ohio Valley, and over parts of the Southeast. 
The heat is continuing for a sixth straight day today in Illinois,

	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A new survey indicates states have their

conservative revenue forecasting and prudent management. The 44 
states that provided information to the National Conference of 
State Legislatures ended fiscal year 1999 a total of $33.4 billion 
in the black. The number combines general fund ending balances with 
reserve funds and represents 9.4 percent of 1999 state general fund 
spending, the survey showed. That tops the previous high of 9

that sales of existing single-family homes jumped 10.6 percent in 
June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.53 million units, 
the highest level ever. The big jump in sales in June followed two

Colombia, where rescuers tried to reach what might be the wreckage 
of a U.S. spy plane lost on an anti-narcotics mission. Visiting the 
world's No. 1 cocaine-producing country, Barry McCaffrey said peace 
talks to end the nation's 35-year conflict would only work if 
Colombia's security forces were strengthened against the threat of 
``narco-guerrillas.'' America should provide more battle 
helicopters and training for Colombian military and police units, 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Cisneros Tapes Can Be Used </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Recordings secretly made by former Housing  
Secretary Henry Cisneros' ex-mistress may be used at his upcoming 
conspiracy trial, a federal judge ruled Monday, sweeping aside 
defense arguments that the tapes constitute ``phony'' evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes are at the heart of the independent counsel's case  
that Cisneros, while under consideration for a Cabinet post in the 
Clinton administration, conspired with one-time paramour Linda 
Jones to conceal details of his more than $250,000 in payments to 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin rejected the  
defense's extensive effort to throw out the tapes, which captured 
conversations in which Cisneros and Ms. Jones discussed the 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, permitting Independent Counsel David Barrett to  
use 22 tapes in their entirety and portions of four others, settles 
the last major issue remaining before Cisneros' September trial on 
conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges. He has pleaded 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sporkin's ruling follows a 13-day pretrial hearing on the tapes'  
admissibility, during which prosecutors, who initially pressed to 
use 34 of the 88 tapes that Ms. Jones recorded, scaled back their 
request to 26. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court finds that the vast majority of the tapes contain  
reliable and accurate representations of the conversations that 
occurred between (Ms. Jones) and Cisneros between April 1990 and 
December 1993,'' the judge wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros ``has presented no direct evidence that the voice on  
the tapes is not his, nor that the statements attributed to him are 
inaccurate,'' Sporkin added. 
</P>
<P>
	While allowing prosecutors the leeway to use 22 tapes in their  
entirety, Sporkin limited the use of four others, saying they bore 
signs of ``obvious alteration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During four days on the witness stand, Ms. Jones testified that  
she edited as many as 10 of the 88 tapes of her phone conversations 
with Cisneros that she later turned over to federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she performed the editing -- and destroyed all 88  
originals -- because she feared legal repercussions if she didn't 
delete passages in which she threatened to reveal their financial 
arrangement if Cisneros stopped paying her. She also said she 
removed some sexually suggestive passages and those dealing with 
uninvolved parties. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate reaction to the ruling from Barrett's  
office or Cisneros' team. They all refrained from public comment 
during the pretrial hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	On the tapes, made as the relationship soured, Cisneros can be  
heard explaining to Ms. Jones how he had described the payments 
when he spoke to the Clinton transition team and the FBI agents 
conducting his Cabinet background check. 
</P>
<P>
	During that background check, Cisneros acknowledged giving Ms.  
Jones financial support after their extramarital affair burst into 
public view in 1988, costing her marriage and career as a political 
fund-raiser. But prosecutors contend he falsely told the FBI he 
never paid her more than $10,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-count indictment against Cisneros alleges he paid her  
more than $264,000 between 1990 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	During the marathon pretrial hearing, once billed as a two-day  
event, Cisneros' legal team labored vigorously to quash use of the 
tapes -- noting that the government's own tape expert found that all 
88 tapes were copies, in some cases altered, of since-destroyed 
originals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tapes, as we all know, are very powerful evidence,'' said  
Cisneros lawyer Brendan Sullivan. ``Tapes that are altered are 
powerfully misleading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sporkin also rejected the defense's claim that the tapes were  
inadmissible under federal wiretapping statutes that preclude the 
use of evidence made with unlawful intent. He said he found no 
evidence that Ms. Jones had such intent in making the recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	In a preview of their likely trial tactics, Cisneros' lawyers  
waged an all-out assault on Ms. Jones' credibility during the 
hearing. They elicited admissions that she lied numerous times to 
the FBI and Internal Revenue Service agents investigating Cisneros, 
as well as to the independent counsel's office, a Texas court and 
even her own lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones is serving a 3 1/2-year prison sentence after she ran  
afoul of the independent counsel, in part because she 
misrepresented the tapes as unaltered originals. Now she is 
cooperating with the prosecutors who put her behind bars, hoping to 
gain a sentence reduction.

<HEADLINE> NFLPA Begins Hearing on Agent Black </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The NFL Players Association's  
disciplinary committee met by phone with sports agent William 
``Tank'' Black for nearly four hours Monday to discuss a complaint 
the union filed against him. 
</P>
<P>
	NFLPA attorney Richard Berthelsen said the committee, composed  
of players Trace Armstrong, Robert Smith and Richard Harvey, will 
hear more testimony Tuesday and should decide Black's fate this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Under NFLPA rules, the committee could suspend or revoke Black's  
license. If so, Black could appeal to an arbitrator. He also has 
filed a lawsuit against the union, claiming its disciplinary 
process is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the NFLPA filed a disciplinary complaint against Black,  
accusing his company, Professional Management Inc., of making cash 
payments to Florida players while they were still eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Gators player Johnny Rutledge has publicly stated that he  
received improper payments from Black's company. 
</P>
<P>
	Black denies any impropriety. Earlier this month, he filed a  
detailed response to the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Black and his attorney, Leonard Mungo, had a chance to explain  
the response during the telephone conversation. Berthelsen said it 
was cut short because the players had to attend practice at their 
respective training camps.

<HEADLINE> Missing Army Plane Found in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A missing U.S. Army plane appears to  
have slammed into an uncharted mountain in Colombia, probably 
killing all five Americans and two Colombians on board, a top U.S. 
official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers spotted wreckage Sunday on a mountain near the  
southwestern border with Ecuador that they believe is from the 
reconnaissance plane that disappeared Friday on an anti-narcotics 
mission over rebel-controlled territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew of the plane ``have probably lost their lives in a  
fatal accident.'' Barry McCaffrey, the Clinton administration's top 
anti-narcotics official, told reporters in the capital, Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll know more today,'' when a ground team will be sent to  
the wreckage, which has so far been seen only from the air because 
of the rugged terrain, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, McCaffrey told The Associated Press that it ``appears  
as if it (the plane) probably flew into a mountain, an unmarked 
mountain, in bad weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey began a two-day visit to Colombia today to discuss his  
proposal to increase U.S. anti-narcotics aid to the region by as 
much as $1 billion. The new aid would include stepped up support to 
Colombia's police and army to better stand up to 
``narco-guerrillas,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Army has not released the names of the five soldiers,  
who are based at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas. Two unidentified 
Colombian air force officers were also on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials say their Havilland RC-7 was on a routine  
counternarcotics mission over a rebel-dominated area where drug 
crops are grown when it disappeared from radar screens. 
</P>
<P>
	Its disappearance, however, was likely to heighten speculation  
in Colombia that Washington is getting deeply involved in the 
country's 35-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	American officials have repeatedly stressed they have no  
interest in giving counterinsurgency aid or sending American troops 
to fight in the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	But the perception among many Colombians that intervention is  
possible has grown amid steady rebel advances, frequent visits to 
Bogota by high-ranking U.S. officials and growing U.S. support to 
the Colombian military -- whose main activity is fighting the 
guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia, the world's No. 1 source of cocaine and a growing  
exporter of heroin, is the primary focus of U.S. anti-narcotics 
operations in the hemisphere. Aid this year tripled to roughly $300 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Army also is helping to train and equip a new,  
1,500-member counternarcotics battalion. The new force will operate 
largely in the rebel-dominated south, where the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, partly finances itself by taxing the 
peasants who grow drug crops and protecting traffickers' airstrips 
and laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government also recently began sharing intelligence on  
rebels with the army units taking part in anti-narcotics 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	FARC units often fire on crop-dusting planes, but there was no  
immediate evidence to suggest that the U.S. reconnaissance plane 
was attacked.

<HEADLINE> Chess Master Breaks Color Barrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Maurice Ashley talks about chess the way some  
people describe their favorite poem or painting. ``It has a 
majesty; it has a mystical beauty,'' he says. ``The pieces come 
alive when you know what they can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashley has devoted his life to chess, and at 33, he has caught a  
dream -- and made history. This spring, moving his bishop against an 
opponent's queen, he fulfilled the final requirements for becoming 
a chess grandmaster, the game's highest rank. He is the first black 
person ever to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just been a whirlwind,'' Ashley says, pausing to reflect  
at the Harlem middle school where he coached a chess team until 
1997. ``I've been thrilled and ecstatic and on a high and unable to 
sleep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are only 45 grandmasters in the United States and 470  
worldwide. So joining the uppermost ranks of the elite and clubby 
chess world wasn't easy for a Jamaican immigrant who spent much of 
his adolescence honing his game in Brooklyn's Prospect Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maurice almost did it by himself,'' says Jerald Times, a chess  
devotee who met Ashley in the park a decade ago. ``He didn't have a 
whole Russian chess school, didn't have grandmasters training 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashley's casual childhood interest in chess got serious when he  
played a high school friend nearly 20 years ago. ``He just crushed 
me, and I couldn't believe it,'' Ashley recalls with a laugh. ``We 
don't take any beatings lying down in my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So at age 14 he stuck his nose into a strategy book and fell in  
love. ``I was electrified by the game,'' he says. ``I found my 
passion in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashley's young game wasn't good enough to get him on the team at  
Brooklyn Technical High School. Defiant, he joined the Black Bear 
School of Chess, a group of obsessed teens and twentysomethings who 
played rough-and-tumble games in Prospect Park for hours on end. 
</P>
<P>
	He earned an undergraduate degree in English at City College and  
later coached the Mott Hall Dark Knights, a Harlem middle school 
chess team. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashley loved sharing his passion with young players, and the  
team won three national championships. But ``there was something 
that was missing,'' he says, ``and that was my own aspirations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fall 1997, he took leave from the Harlem Educational  
Activities Fund, which sponsors the middle school program and 
others in the neighborhood. With financial support from the group's 
president, Ashley devoted himself to chess full time, studying at 
his home in the Park Slope neighborhood and flying to tournaments 
in Germany, France and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	A natural competitiveness nurtured early on by an immigrant  
mother anxious to see him succeed kept Ashley focused and working 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
	Competitors say he's a cagey, aggressive player who never misses  
a chance to gain an advantage on the board. ``You feel that if you 
make the slightest mistake, you're going to get crushed,'' says 
Times, Ashley's longtime chess pal. 
</P>
<P>
	The new grandmaster's intensity isn't always visible. During  
matches, he'll often lean his elbows on the table and hold his head 
in his hands as he analyzes the board; other times he leans back, 
looking relaxed, as he ponders the pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Ashley's single-minded devotion paid off. At a  
tournament at the Manhattan Chess Club, which counts several 
grandmasters among its members, Ashley joined their ranks. He lost 
a second-round game to the tournament's lowest-ranked player, but 
he rebounded to second place, earning the points he needed for 
grandmaster status. 
</P>
<P>
	The coveted title is earned by meeting rigorous requirements in  
high-level tournaments within a set period of time. Ashley's 
victory carries special meaning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stereotype in this country is that African-Americans don't  
do well at things like chess,'' he says. ``I know how brilliant 
black people are ... and I feel like my achievement is a small drop 
to add to the wonderful intellectual greatness of our heritage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes his victory will inspire young minority players,  
especially his former students at Mott Hall. Ashley still strolls 
smiling through the chess room there, giving tips and pushing the 
serious young players to think hard about every move. The kids say 
he's become a role model. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because he did it, he made me believe that I could do it,  
because we're both minority,'' says Brian Ovalle, a seventh-grader 
with roots in the Dominican Republic. ``It's like when Jackie 
Robinson broke the color barrier. They didn't believe he could do 
it, but he broke through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashley would have liked to have a black grandmaster to emulate  
when he was young. ``It was tough ... not seeing any black faces,'' 
he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I've been blessed to do is show what's possible.''

<HEADLINE> Canadian Manager Ejected From Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Canadian manager Ernie Whitt was at  
wits' end, fuming and arguing with the umpires over the rules. 
First he was ejected and then he was rejected when international 
baseball officials said no to his written protest. 
</P>
<P>
	During the bizarre 30-minute delay Monday, his team -- trailing  
by three runs -- got a spark from the irate manager. Canada scored 
four runs in the bottom of the 11th inning and stunned the United 
States 7-6 in the Pan American Games baseball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess they make the rules up as they go along,'' Whitt said,  
carrying a rulebook with him after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	After the U.S. team went ahead 6-3 in the top of the 11th, Whitt  
walked to the mound to talk with pitcher Chad Ricketts. He'd also 
visited Ricketts in the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	``According to the rules, you are allowed three free trips to  
the mound, plus an additional trip for every three innings you play 
in extra innings. And when you take a pitcher out, it doesn't count 
as a trip,'' Whitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I went out in the 10th, it should have been my first trip  
to the mound. According to the rules, I still have three more trips 
I could burn, but the umpire came out and told me I had to remove 
the pitcher at that time and that's when I blew up. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a little language difference. ... He was persistent.  
He went to the IBA and the IBA withheld it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving Whitt's written protest, International Baseball  
Association officials and the umpires huddled underneath the 
stadium. The protest was disallowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitt had to leave the field, although he could be seen peeking  
up the tunnel when Canada staged its rally -- tying on Andy 
Stewart's three-run homer and winning when Stubby Clapp's 
bases-loaded pop fell between two American fielders. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitt said officials told him that after nine innings, the three  
initial trips are gone -- a point Whitt says is not made in the rule 
book -- and there is only one free trip remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still upset, but it's nice to come back and get the win.  
If we have rules, let's abide by them. It gives them something to 
clarify,'' Whitt said/ 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. manager Buddy Bell admittedly was confused.  
</P>
<P>
	``It really doesn't make sense to me,'' Bell said. ``But nobody  
asked me about it. So I don't think they care what I think. That 
didn't cost us the game. But it's something that needs to be looked 
at,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little excessive, I would think.''

<HEADLINE> Patrick Kennedy Thanks Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Speaking for his grief-stricken  
relatives, U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy on Monday thanked Americans 
for their expressions of sympathy over the death of his cousin, 
John F. Kennedy Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made an enormous difference in my family's ability to cope  
with this very tragic loss,'' said Kennedy, 32, a son of U.S. Sen. 
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Returning to Rhode Island after a weekend of mourning at the  
Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Mass., the Democrat voiced 
gratitude for an ``overwhelming'' outpouring of condolences. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Kennedy's cousin, Joseph P. Kennedy II, a former  
congressman from Massachusetts and son of Robert F. Kennedy, also 
had words of thanks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been such an overwhelming outpouring of kindness  
from so many people that it was very touching for all of our 
family,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr.'s private plane crashed into the ocean off Martha's  
Vineyard, Mass., on July 16, killing him, his wife Carolyn Bessette 
Kennedy and her sister Lauren Bessette. 
</P>
<P>
	When divers retrieved the body of JFK Jr. from the sea, Rep.  
Kennedy accompanied his father and his brother, Edward Kennedy Jr., 
to the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``I loved my cousin John dearly and I am so grateful for the  
relationship I had with him,'' Rep. Kennedy said. ``I feel the loss 
immensely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a stop at a senior center in Woonsocket named after the late  
President John F. Kennedy, Patrick Kennedy said he wanted to ``make 
sure everyone knew we were so grateful for their thoughts and 
prayers.''

<HEADLINE> Yosemite Suspect Has Kidnapping Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MERCED, Calif. (AP) -- The FBI's suspect in the brutal slaying of  
a woman at Yosemite National Park is the brother of a young man who 
shocked the nation with his story of being kidnapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Murder suspect Cary Stayner is a brother of Steven Stayner, who  
in 1972 was snatched off a Merced street at age 7. He remained 
missing for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Stayner was reunited with his family in 1980, hailed as a  
hero for finally going to police when his abductor kidnapped 
another boy. But as if he lived his short life under a cloud, he 
died in 1989 in a collision with a hit-and-run driver. He was 24. 
</P>
<P>
	It was as if Stayner's life was split in three -- his early years  
growing up in a working-class family of seven, his lost years with 
kidnapper Kenneth Parnell and the time back with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Parnell, a convicted child molester, kept his hold on Stayner by  
showering him with gifts and telling him his parents could no 
longer afford him. 
</P>
<P>
	Their years together ended when, as a 14-year-old, Stayner went  
to police with a 5-year-old boy Parnell had kidnapped two weeks 
earlier. Steven said he didn't want the younger boy to suffer the 
same abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	While no sex charges were filed against Parnell in the Stayner  
case, Stayner testified at the trial that he was regularly sexually 
abused during the period they lived in motels and trailer parks and 
was ordered to call Parnell ``Dad.'' Parnell was convicted of 
kidnapping and served five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner was initially riddled with guilt about turning in his  
abductor and then angry about his lost family. 
</P>
<P>
	A fitful student, the resurrected Stayner juggled book offers  
and a slew of traffic citations. He married and fathered two 
children and had a walk-on part as a police officer in the 
television miniseries about his case, ``I Know My First Name is 
Steven.'' which was broadcast in May 1989 on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	He told an interviewer, ``My hope with the movie is that some  
kid sees it and gets up the nerve to tell someone and try to come 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But later that year, he met a tragic end while driving a  
motorcycle on a suspended license. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven's siblings ranged from age 4 to 12 when he was kidnapped  
and lived their own ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Steve came home, everybody else all got shoved in the  
background and here's this hero,'' said his mother, Kay. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner's sister, Jody, told mourners at his funeral that Steven  
``brought our broken-hearted family together.'' But his minister 
said the family felt like it had to share him with a curious 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	When Steven died, Mrs. Stayner said she felt like her son had  
been ``loaned to us.''

<HEADLINE> Vermeil Glad 49ers Signed Phillips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Despite all of Lawrence Phillips' problems in  
St. Louis, Rams coach Dick Vermeil heartily recommended that the 
San Francisco 49ers sign him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good, I'm glad,'' Vermeil said Monday when told Phillips'  
signing was official. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil said he spent a day at the home of 49ers general manager  
Bill Walsh about 10 days ago and that the topic came up. Vermeil 
would have taken Phillips back if not for the critical firestorm he 
would have faced from fans who haven't forgotten all of the running 
back's problems after being the sixth pick of the 1996 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said `Bill, if I were you, I'd sign him,''' Vermeil said.  
``There would be no hesitation. You're going to get ridiculed and 
different groups are going to be upset with you, but you can't 
please everybody. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all forget it when he runs for 125 yards and does things  
in the community and he grows up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips rushed for 1,265 yards and scored 13 touchdowns in 25  
games with the Rams before being released in November 1997. His 19 
months in St. Louis were marked by three arrests and 23 days in 
jail for violating probation after a drunken-driving arrest in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	But the only downside Vermeil could see to the signing is it  
means the Rams will have to face Phillips, who signed for two years 
with incentives, twice a year. Vermeil didn't seem worried about 
it, citing the 49ers' 17-game winning streak against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been beating us for a long time, so I don't know what  
difference one guy could make,'' Vermeil said. ``I'm sincerely 
happy for the kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams practiced for the fourth day without holdout running  
back Marshall Faulk while negotiations continued on a new deal. 
Vermeil said Rams executive vice president Jay Zygmunt and Faulk's 
agent, Rocky Arceneaux, had been scheduled to meet Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk wants a bigger signing bonus than the $8 million the Rams  
have offered. There's also been speculation that Faulk might want 
to avoid the team's weekend scrimmage against his former team, the 
Indianapolis Colts, in Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't talked to Marshall since our last minicamp, so I  
can't tell you,'' Vermeil said. ``Normally, these things have 
something to do with money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Trent Green said he would be looking forward to such  
a meeting if he were the player in question. 
</P>
<P>
	``You think of the competitive nature of guys and wanting to go  
out and prove yourself,'' Green said. ``I would imagine he would 
want to come back jsut to go against them and prove they didn't 
make a good decision in trading him away.''

<HEADLINE> Bears' Enis Eager To Take Hits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- Curtis Enis hunkers down behind the  
line of scrimmage, a gleam in his eye as he checks out the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	He barrels forward when the ball is snapped, hoping someone  
tries to get a hand on him so he can make them think twice about 
doing it again. Forget the surgically repaired knee. The running 
back has been itching to do some bumping and scraping since 
November, and he finally got his wish Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's almost like a magnet,'' Chicago Bears coach Dick Jauron  
said. ``When he gets to the line of scrimmage, he looks like he's 
seeking a body to hit, and I think that's a good sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enis took part in full-speed, light-contact drills Monday, the  
first time he's been hit since he blew out his knee last Nov. 8 
during his first NFL start. It was only a handful of plays, and 
full contact won't come for at least another week, but it's a 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least he's in there getting thudded. He'd like to go more,  
but we're going to keep along this path,'' Jauron said. ``He has a 
high energy level and he's got a lot of power in that body. I think 
he's really looking forward to letting it go on the football field. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we've got to bring him along,'' Jauron added. '' ...  
Certainly, we'd like to be further ahead, but he did suffer the 
injury and we do have to take that into consideration every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While this is only training camp, and the Bears' defense knows  
not to get too rough with the fifth pick in last year's draft, Enis 
played with the enthusiasm of a child who's been given a new toy. 
He ran straight at the defense as if he'd never been injured. He 
added a little bit of a strut when he got by somebody and into the 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
	He had so much energy you'd have thought the Bears were trailing  
the Green Bay Packers by a touchdown with the playoffs on the line. 
He yelled at himself when he did something wrong, grumbling so 
loudly fans on the sidelines could hear him. Then he'd laugh, 
flipping the ball back to someone as he ran back to the line of 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't give myself a chance last year to come out here and  
be productive for this organization,'' said Enis, who missed almost 
all of training camp last year in a bitter holdout. ``I came in 
feeling sorry for myself. I came here feeling somebody owed me 
something. I came here feeling like the world was against me. I 
made my bed hard and I had to sleep on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I said, this year, I'm going to come out here and be myself  
and give myself the opportunity to just play football and have 
fun,'' he said. ``But first and foremost, just play with my heart. 
Come out here and enjoy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that's what he's doing. Whether he's running around the  
field or driving his big, black Hummer with the radio blasting so 
loud it makes the car shake, he has a permanent smile on his face. 
He jokes with his teammates and is the new media darling. 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing that would make life better is if he could play  
without any restrictions. But that will come. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely need to keep things in perspective and remember  
what's important,'' he said. ``And that's making sure I stay on 
point with getting in shape and doing all my rehab. So come Sept. 
12, I'll be ready to do it all against Kansas City.''

<HEADLINE> Baseball Umpires Sue Leagues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Less than two weeks after saying they would quit  
en masse, umpires turned around and sued baseball Monday for the 
right to withdraw their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 14-page complaint filed in U.S. District Court in  
Philadelphia, the Major League Umpires Association also accused the 
American League and the commissioner's office of saying they intend 
to withhold termination pay of up to $400,000 per umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires, whose resignations are set to take effect Sept. 2, also  
claimed baseball has offered them up to $2 million in future gains 
if they join a dissident group in the union that is trying to fire 
its negotiator, Richie Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	They also said several baseball officials are spreading ``false  
and misleading statements to umpires about deadlines to accept 
resignations, deadlines to offer rescissions of resignations and 
deadlines to reject rescissions of resignations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far, 23 of 32 AL umpires intend to stay on; only three of  
their 36 NL counterparts say they will stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners have hired more than 20 new umpires from the minor  
leagues as of Sept. 1. The Triple-A umpires had been working as 
vacation fill-ins in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Edmund V. Ludwig,  
who three years ago issued a court order that prevented umpires 
from striking in the postseason. Umpires threatened a strike after 
Roberto Alomar spit at umpire John Hirschbeck and was given just a 
five-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, umpires want a court order that gives them until  
Sept. 2 to withdraw their resignations. They also want Ludwig to 
declare that owners have engaged ``in numerous and serious unfair 
labor practices'' and to declare that mass resignations are a legal 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far, 14 of the 56 umpires who resigned have withdrawn their  
resignations. One high-ranking baseball official, speaking on the 
condition he not be identified, said Monday the sport would 
continue to accept withdrawals, but only until all vacancies are 
filled. 
</P>
<P>
	At least four more minor league umpires were hired Monday,  
another baseball official said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual twist, umpires accused owners of wrongfully  
agreeing to give Larry Barnett more termination pay than the labor 
contract requires. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett, who with 31 years of service is baseball's senior  
umpire, agreed to retire after this season for $550,000 -- $150,000 
more than the AL was required to give him. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL also has been negotiating for the retirements of Dale  
Ford, Ted Hendry, Ken Kaiser and Durwood Merrill, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires also asked the court to declare the current labor  
agreement, set to expire Dec. 31, had been abandoned by the AL and 
NL because commissioner Bud Selig is trying to shift supervision of 
umpires from the leagues to Sandy Alderson in the commissioner's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires chose the resignation tactic because their current labor  
deal has a no-strike clause, and they feared owners would lock them 
out after it expires. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips declined comment, as did Selig.

<HEADLINE> US, Canada Get OK for Beef Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The United States and Canada received final  
approval Monday for $124 million in sanctions against the European 
Union in the dispute over hormone-treated beef, trade officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government planned to start imposing the 100 percent  
tariffs on Thursday, pending the approval from the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Products targeted include Italian tomatoes, Danish ham and  
French Roquefort cheese, goose liver and truffles. The reprisals 
will effectively price the items out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Ambassador John Weekes told the meeting that his  
country would issue a list of targeted products before the end of 
the month after consultations with domestic industry officials. 
Canada was open to discussions about compensation, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU has banned imports of beef treated with certain hormones  
for the past 11 years because of fears that the drugs could cause 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO ruled that Brussels was acting illegally and ordered it  
to lift the ban, but the EU refused to comply, insisting instead 
that it will carry out more tests to prove that its ban is 
justified. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of arbitrators earlier this month ruled that the United  
States was entitled to impose sanctions totaling $116.8 million per 
year in retaliation for beef producers' loss of trade, Canada was 
awarded $7.7 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never like to, but sometimes we have to do something that  
isn't pleasant with one of our major trading partners,'' said U.S. 
Ambassador Rita Hayes. ``We hope that we will be able to sit down 
and work out quickly a negotiated solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EU officials said they were disappointed that the United States  
had not agreed to an offer of compensation to head off sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Under that approach, legal trade barriers on other U.S. products  
would have been lowered to expand American sales in the EU market. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes said compensation would only have been a temporary  
solution and the United States was more interested in settling the 
dispute for good. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is already enforcing another $191.2 million  
per year of sanctions against the European Union in a long-running 
dispute over bananas.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Challenges Cable Ordinance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- AT&AMP;T is taking another local  
government to court over an ordinance forcing the 
telecommunications giant to open up its high-speed cable network to 
competing Internet service providers. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lawsuit filed Monday, AT&AMP;T says the Broward County  
ordinance violates federal law prohibiting local cable franchising 
authorities from imposing access obligations on cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also maintains the ordinance is illegal on First  
Amendment grounds and because the regulation of telecommunications 
companies falls only within the jurisdiction of the Florida Public 
Service Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has argued that it has spent billions buying cable  
companies to create a national network for local telephone and 
high-speed Internet service and should be allowed to recoup its 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is involved in a similar fight in Portland, Ore.  
That city's ordinance was upheld by a federal judge and AT&AMP;T has 
appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco's city supervisors voted Monday night to hold off  
any action on the issue, pending the outcome of the Portland case. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Communications Commission chairman William Kennard has  
advocated a national policy on high-speed, or ``broadband,'' 
Internet access and has urged municipalities against coming up with 
their own regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard, in a statement Monday, praised the San Francisco  
decision: ``We are pleased that the city of San Francisco has 
recognized that the best way to bring customers faster Internet 
access is by unleashing innovation and entrepreneurial spirit, not 
armies of lawyers and regulators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed Monday names TCI of South Florida Inc. and  
MediaOne of Greater Florida Inc. as the plaintiffs. Earlier this 
year, AT&AMP;T bought Tele-Communications Inc. and reached an agreement 
to buy MediaOne Group Inc., MediaOne's parent corporation.

<HEADLINE> Editor Leaving Medicine Journal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- The New England Journal of Medicine's top  
editor is leaving amid a dispute over the owners' practice of using 
the journal's prestige to sell unrelated publications. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer, 66, will begin a seven-month sabbatical  
on Sept. 1 and step down when his current contract with the journal 
ends on March 31, 2000, said Dr. Jack T. Evjy, president of the 
Massachusetts Medical Society, which owns and publishes the 
journal. His contract was not renewed. 
</P>
<P>
	The departure was prompted by differences in opinion over  
administrative and publishing issues, Evjy said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe reported the decision stemmed from a  
controversy over ``branding,'' in which publications are advertised 
as produced by the ``publishers of the New England Journal of 
Medicine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While technically accurate, journal editors say they resent that  
their publication is being used to sell literature that they don't 
control and whose accuracy they cannot verify. Some of the 
publications are aimed at consumers, while are marketed to doctors. 
Kassirer, a kidney specialist, challenged the society on branding 
and other issues, according to the Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Kassirer is credited with many accomplishments during his  
eight-year tenure at the journal, including simplifying the 
publication's format and expanding its role outside the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John T. Harrington, dean of Tufts Medical School, resigned  
from the Medical Society's publications committee two weeks ago to 
protest the handling of the Kassirer case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Control of the journal is slipping to the bean counters,'' he  
told the Globe. ``This is a spectacular example of money beating 
medicine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the apparent rift, Kassirer said he was thankful for the  
Medical Society's financial support for his efforts to modernize 
the journal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am honored to have served as editor in chief of the New  
England Journal of Medicine and privileged to work with editors and 
staff who have never deviated from their singular focus on 
quality,'' he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	An interim editor will likely be announced in the next two  
weeks, according to Frank Fortin, spokesman for the Massachusetts 
Medical Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortin refused to comment on what issues divided Kassirer and  
the society. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Dr. George Lundberg was fired from the Journal of  
the American Medical Association for publishing a 1991 survey of 
college students on whether oral sex constitutes sex. The 
association objected to the timing of the publication to coincide 
with President Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg, who now edits the online journal Netscape General  
Medicine, said he understands Kassirer's predicament. 
</P>
<P>
	``During these days of profound conflict between the business  
and professional components of medicine, ... an editor dedicated to 
professionalism in a professional society might take issue with 
what might be perceived as excess business ambition,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  49ers Gamble, Signing Phillips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) -- Putting their needs on the field ahead  
of his history of trouble, the San Francisco 49ers on Monday signed 
running back Lawrence Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hope is that his deep troubles are behind him,'' general  
manager Bill Walsh said in announcing the signing at the University 
of the Pacific, where the team opened its training camp. ``Lawrence 
will come to the 49ers with a clean slate, as far as football is 
concerned. I expect him to do quite well here. I think you'll find 
him to be very pleasant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips was signed to two-year deal worth $1.75 million,  
including a $425,000 signing bonus. He can earn more through 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	At least some of that money will be going to the league to pay a  
fine for violating the NFL's violent crime policy. Commissioner 
Paul Tagliabue, in a meeting with Phillips two weeks ago, cleared 
him to play, but told him he would be subject to the fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Phillips: ``This is a great opportunity. I don't intend to  
screw it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh conceded the 49ers were taking a chance on a player whose  
career is in jeopardy after he was released by two NFL teams in 
less than a year. But he denied it was a panic move by a team that 
lost its top running back, Garrison Hearst, to a potentially 
career-threatening injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this a desperate move? Hardly,'' Walsh said. ``It's a  
business move, one we've thoroughly researched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that he believes he's a risk worth taking.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would sign myself, yes,'' said Phillips when asked to put  
himself in an NFL general manager's shoes. ``I don't see this as a 
risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To those who continue to believe he'll only bring problems,  
Phillips said, ``All you can do is try to prove them wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rap sheet on Phillips is long and disturbing, however.  
</P>
<P>
	Phillips pleaded no-contest to assaulting a former girlfriend in  
college, was arrested three times during 19 months with the St. 
Louis Rams and was released by the Miami Dolphins four weeks after 
a woman claimed he struck her when she refused to dance with him in 
a nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	But Phillips' strong performance in NFL Europe sparked renewed  
interest, and the 49ers edged Buffalo in bidding for him. Some 
teams in need of running backs, Cleveland and Baltimore among them, 
were leery and chose to not pursue him. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said he thinks the 49ers can provide a good environment  
for Phillips. But he also said he has warned Phillips he will be 
cut at the first sign of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old running back will try to fill the void left by  
the loss of Hearst. Hearst had surgery Saturday to treat 
circulatory complications following a broken left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst was San Francisco's most dynamic threat last season,  
rushing for a team-record 1,570 yards. He was hurt on the first 
play during last January's playoff loss at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers hope Hearst can return in early December, but coach  
Steve Mariucci said the team must be prepared to play this season 
without him. 
</P>
<P>
	With no capable backup -- the team allowed Terry Kirby to leave  
as a free agent -- the 49ers added running backs Charlie Garner and 
Travis Jervey and put aside their misgivings about Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers also filled a need on their defensive line Monday when  
Reggie McGrew, the former Florida star and and the 49ers' top draft 
pick last April, signed a seven-year, $7.4 million contract. The 
deal included a $2.5 million signing bonus and will void after four 
years if McGrew meets certain playing time clauses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams made Phillips the sixth overall selection in the 1996  
draft despite his record of violence at Nebraska. While on 
probation at Nebraska, he was arrested for drunken driving in 
California, leading to a 23-day jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Rams, he was a bust on the field. Coach Dick Vermeil,  
tired of repeated fines for missed meetings and other disciplinary 
problems, cut Phillips in November 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips signed with Miami in December 1997, but never  
established himself. He was cut a year ago, soon after the 
nightclub episode. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to save his career, Phillips joined Barcelona of NFL  
Europe and became the league's first 1,000-yard rusher. He 
reportedly has embraced religion and become a vegetarian, dropping 
more than 20 pounds to become a lighter, faster back. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh, while once discussing draft philosophies, said he would  
never have drafted Phillips because of his problems. But he says 
circumstances are different. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made some strong statements in the past about people like  
Lawrence Phillips being on a team, and I feel like George Bush 
saying, `Read my lips. No new taxes,''' Walsh said last week. ``But 
times change, he's changed, and we have a need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By completing the negotiations with McGrew, the 49ers ensured he  
will be on hand for the team's first training camp workout Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reggie wanted to play. He's not about holding out,'' coach  
Steve Mariucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco is counting on the 6-foot-1, 300-pound McGrew to  
step in at defensive tackle in place of Bryant Young, who broke his 
right leg during a Nov. 30 game against the New York Giants. Young 
plans to play with the metal rod that doctors inserted in his leg 
to stabilize it but he's not expected to return until midseason.

<HEADLINE>  49ers Gamble, Signing Phillips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) -- Putting their needs on the field ahead  
of his history of trouble, the San Francisco 49ers on Monday signed 
running back Lawrence Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hope is that his deep troubles are behind him,'' general  
manager Bill Walsh said in announcing the signing at the University 
of the Pacific, where the team opened its training camp. ``Lawrence 
will come to the 49ers with a clean slate, as far as football is 
concerned. I expect him to do quite well here. I think you'll find 
him to be very pleasant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips was signed to two-year deal worth $1.75 million,  
including a $425,000 signing bonus. He can earn more through 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	At least some of that money will be going to the league to pay a  
fine for violating the NFL's violent crime policy. Commissioner 
Paul Tagliabue, in a meeting with Phillips two weeks ago, cleared 
him to play, but told him he would be subject to the fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Phillips: ``This is a great opportunity. I don't intend to  
screw it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh conceded the 49ers were taking a chance on a player whose  
career is in jeopardy after he was released by two NFL teams in 
less than a year. But he denied it was a panic move by a team that 
lost its top running back, Garrison Hearst, to a potentially 
career-threatening injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this a desperate move? Hardly,'' Walsh said. ``It's a  
business move, one we've thoroughly researched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that he believes he's a risk worth taking.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would sign myself, yes,'' said Phillips when asked to put  
himself in an NFL general manager's shoes. ``I don't see this as a 
risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To those who continue to believe he'll only bring problems,  
Phillips said, ``All you can do is try to prove them wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rap sheet on Phillips is long and disturbing, however.  
</P>
<P>
	Phillips pleaded no-contest to assaulting a former girlfriend in  
college, was arrested three times during 19 months with the St. 
Louis Rams and was released by the Miami Dolphins four weeks after 
a woman claimed he struck her when she refused to dance with him in 
a nightclub.

<HEADLINE> Sturm Outbids Elway for Nuggets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- John Elway's life after pro football will not  
include an ownership share of the Denver Nuggets and Colorado 
Avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	A group headed by billionaire Donald Sturm beat out Elway and a  
Saudi Arabian princess Monday, winning the chance to bid against a 
Wal-Mart heiress for the rights to the Nuggets and Avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sturm group offered $461 million for Ascent Entertainment  
Group's two teams and its Pepsi Center arena, which is to open this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway's business manager, Jeff Sperbeck, declined to reveal the  
amount of the bid submitted by the retired Broncos quarterback, 
Denver financier Bjorn Erik Borgen and Colorado ski mogul George 
Gillett. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Neinas, Ascent's acting chairman and chief executive  
officer, said the group made the highest bid, had the best 
financing and met the ownership standards of the NBA and NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Princess Thara Al Saud offered $450 million in cash, said  
Valerian Butler Smith III, chairman of New York-based Ashland 
Capital Holdings and the princess' principal investment manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the princess wants him to speak with NBA commissioner  
David Stern about acquiring another team. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's sad because she loved Denver, but she is proactive and  
positive and moving forward,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step comes Wednesday when the Sturm group will compete  
with Bill Laurie and his wife, Nancy, heiress to the Wal-Mart 
retail fortune, in a live auction to determine the new owner. The 
auction will proceed in $1 million increments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be surprised if it goes higher yet,'' said Murray  
Arenson, a securities analyst with Dallas-based Hoak, Breedlove, 
Wesneski and Co. ``Is it still reasonable at $480 million or $500 
million? Potentially, yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ascent decided on an auction after shareholders criticized its  
plan to sell the assets to the Lauries for $400 million in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders claimed the assets should have fetched a higher  
price, and they filed two lawsuits. A third suit was filed by a 
businessman who said the Lauries backed out of an agreement to sell 
the Avalanche to them for $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Ascent agreed to settle by calling for an open  
auction after reopening the bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Webb, spokesman for the Lauries, said the new owner of the  
Nuggets and Avalanche must guarantee that if either team leaves 
Denver in the next 25 years, the owner will reimburse the city the 
cost of and bringing a new team to Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm, a Colorado banker, was part of an investor group that  
rescued Continental Airlines from bankruptcy in the 1980s, and 
since has moved into telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm was among those who bid for the sports assets this spring,  
allegedly bidding $440 million. He complained when the deal was 
handed to the Lauries at a lower price.

<HEADLINE> Dozens Hurt As Car Hits Restaurant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINSLOW, Maine (AP) -- An 87-year-old driver who injured more  
than two dozen people when she plowed into a busy restaurant could 
have done far more damage, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a miracle no one was killed,'' Winslow police Lt.  
Richard Grindall said after the crash yesterday at the Lobster Trap 
&AMP; Steakhouse restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently panicking after striking two cars in the parking lot,  
Marie Wyman drove her 1992 Buick Regal into the restaurant's dining 
room, throwing tables, chairs and people aside, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The car struck a wall, breaking a plate-glass window. Then Mrs.  
Wyman backed up about 25 feet and hit another wall before coming to 
a stop, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen people were taken to hospitals, although only one was  
admitted, for rib fractures. About 15 others were treated at the 
scene for cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounded like a bomb,'' said Henry Breton of Manchester, who  
was eating lunch when the car barreled through. ``People were lucky 
they didn't get trapped under the car. She'd have killed them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Damage was estimated at $50,000.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked today why she had hit the accelerator, Mrs. Wyman said,  
``It stuck.'' She didn't elaborate. But Grindall said today 
witnesses did not hear the sort of revving of the engine that that 
would suggest a stuck accelerator. 
</P>
<P>
	Grindall said there are no plans to file charges against Mrs.  
Wyman, but authorities will contact state motor vehicle officials 
about whether to suspend her driving privileges. 
</P>
<P>
	Winslow is about 20 miles north of Augusta.

<HEADLINE> Rams Trying To Keep Bruce Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MACOMB, Ill. (AP) -- Isaac Bruce gets royal treatment in training  
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	He can sit out drills and go at his own pace. Others sweat,  
going over assignments again and again. Not Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Rams have a goal: They want their star receiver  
healthy for the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, Bruce missed 15 games the last two seasons with  
hamstring problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing about Isaac is at times he practices so hard that he  
hurts himself,'' cornerback Todd Lyght said. ``With the workload we 
have, sometimes you have to pace yourself. You can't be at full 
throttle all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receivers coach Al Saunders had a daily schedule for Bruce  
in the weeks between the final minicamp in June and the start of 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Saunders is really hands-on. He has a habit of running  
downfield with his receivers, calling out blocks as he goes, so 
Bruce is never far away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm about two feet from him most of the practice,''  
Saunders said. ``So I don't know if I can watch him any closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders' read on Bruce, who was spectacular in 1995 and '96  
with 203 receptions, 3,119 yards, 20 touchdowns and a Pro Bowl 
berth: ``It looks like he's in pretty good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce's read on all the attention: ``I can handle it for right  
now. I'm going to get antsy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce caught more passes (224) than any player in NFL history  
his first three seasons. Six times he's caught more than 10 passes 
in a game, with a high of 15 for 210 yards against Miami in 1995, 
and four times he's topped 200 yards in receiving. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed almost all of the first five games in 1997, falling  
from 84 to 56 catches. Last year was a disaster. He played in only 
five games and caught 32 passes for 457 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	After such a stretch, it's only natural he'd have doubts.  
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of creeps in, but I push it away like I'm supposed  
to,'' he said. ``It's something I can't worry about, so I just go 
out and do what I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And when he's healthy, he does an awful lot.  
</P>
<P>
	``Injuries are part of the game and that's what happened to  
me,'' Bruce said. ``Anytime I'm on the field, I'm very productive. 
My talent and skill level haven't diminished at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of Bruce's problem is not knowing how or when to slow down.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, he has a problem,'' coach Dick Vermeil said. ``Last  
year we left it up to him, but he's a worker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams picked wide receiver Torry Holt in the first round. On  
the day Holt signed a five-year, $10 million contract, Vermeil said 
Holt had the ``ability to be equivalent'' to Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce said his motivation comes from within.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always hungry,'' he said. ``I've been hungry when I was  
sitting on the sidelines even when I was playing and the defense 
was on. I don't think I get any hungrier than normal.''

<HEADLINE> Albert Belle Finally Gets Cheers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Albert Belle finally got the love he was  
seeking -- a standing ovation during which the hometown fans chanted 
``Al-bert! Al-bert!'' in genuine admiration. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 24 hours earlier, Belle was booed vociferously when he  
seemed to lope after a drive off the right-field wall, turning a 
routine double into a triple. 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, Belle has evoked all sorts of emotion at Camden  
Yards during his first season with the Baltimore Orioles. Through 
it all, Belle kept his feelings to himself, with the exception of a 
few handwritten signs on the side of his locker. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those placards, posted after the All-Star break, read:  
``Half-a-year down, 4 1/2 years to go so don't fight it and show me 
some LOVE!!!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sign was directed at the Baltimore media, but the sentiment  
apparently extended toward the city's fickle fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle put down his markers and sat behind a microphone Sunday,  
ending his silence after putting on the kind of performance the 
Orioles expected when they bestowed a five-year, $65 million 
contract on the surly slugger last December. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle hit three homers, drove in six runs and was in the middle  
of the game-winning uprising in the 11th inning as the Orioles won 
their sixth straight, rallying behind Belle to beat Anaheim 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving his first standing ovation since opening day,  
Belle marked the occasion by speaking in front of cameras and 
reporters for the first time since spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he planned to remain in Baltimore for the length of his  
contract and explained that he can't always go 4-for-4 and carry 
the team on his back, as he did Sunday. He also criticized the fans 
who taunt him during those times when he fails to live up to his 
reputation as one of the best hitters in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to get a hit every time in clutch situations,  
but over the course of the season I'll get a lot of clutch hits,'' 
he said. ``I'm disappointed it's come to a time when they boo me. 
... And then to turn around and have the nerve to cheer for you, 
that's the way baseball goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not much has gone according to plan for the Orioles and Belle  
this season. With Belle accounting for a big chunk of the team's 
$78.5 million payroll, the Orioles expected to press the New York 
Yankees for the AL East title. 
</P>
<P>
	But by June 12, Belle was batting .249 and the Orioles were 12  
games under .500. Although the Yankees comfortably lead the 
division, Belle is now batting .283 with 24 homers and 69 RBIs and 
Baltimore is within 8 1/2 games of a wild-card spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We dug ourselves a hole and now we have to our way out. We  
have a lot of ground to cover,'' Belle said. 
</P>
<P>
	With a hot bat, Belle can help. Before Sunday, his career in  
Baltimore was defined by his dugout argument with manager Ray 
Miller, his occasional jog to first base on grounders, the beer 
bottle he threw through a television in the visitors' clubhouse at 
Tropicana Field, his obscene gestures to fans in the Camden Yards 
bleachers on June 4 and his effort to boycott an exhibition game 
against the Orioles' Triple-A affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	But the guy can hit, and he showed his spunk Sunday by initially  
refusing to go to first base in the 11th inning after being hit by 
a pitch. Miller said he would be delighted to have Belle around for 
as long as he's the manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he's not the eloquent speaker that some writers would  
want him to be, but he comes to play every day and tries to beat 
your butt and he doesn't make any excuses,'' Miller said. ``I like 
players like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Orioles don't complete their turnaround, there's a good  
chance Belle will outlast Miller in Baltimore. Regardless, Belle 
steadfastly insists he isn't going anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why I put the sign up in my locker -- 4 1/2 more years,''  
he said. ``I'm not going anywhere.''

<HEADLINE> EU Apologizes to Formula One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Formula One racing received an apology  
from the European Union on Monday for leaking documents suggesting 
Grand Prix races are a monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU's executive commission promised such leaks to journalists  
would not happen again. 
</P>
<P>
	FIA, the organization governing Formula One, had sued for libel,  
contending there have damaging leaks for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``An apology of this nature from the commission is believed to  
be unprecedented,'' FIA said in a statement from its headquarters 
in Geneva, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The apology, however, does not resolve the matter of whether  
Grand Prix race organizers have restricted competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the commission warned Bernie Ecclestone, the most  
powerful man in European auto racing, that FIA is being 
investigated for ``abusing its dominant position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said contracts concerning the auto sports  
business infringed European Union competition law. Reopening the 
contracts could hamper Ecclestone's plans to finance his business. 
</P>
<P>
	FIA also threatened to pull its business from any track that had  
a competing race, the commission said.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Begin Internet Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles on Monday began offering  
their own dial-up Internet service, with vanity e-mail addresses 
and the offer of exclusive chat sessions with coaches and players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles say the service is the first of its kind for Major  
League Baseball. But the Ravens and PSINet started a similar 
service for football fans in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The e-mail addresses, for example, could be joe@theorioles.com  
or biggestfan@theorioles.com. Plans call for online chat sessions, 
live cameras during batting practice and the ability to listen in 
during preseason draft sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to give people stuff they can't get from being  
behind home plate,'' said Spiro Alafassos, director of ballpark 
entertainment for the Orioles. ``It's really your `in' into the 
front office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The service costs $14.95 per month for unlimited access. For

<HEADLINE> Study Probes Defibrillator Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- People with implanted defibrillators can walk  
through antitheft systems like those at stores and libraries 
without fear of getting an extra shock to the heart -- if they don't 
linger, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The research follows last year's warning by the Food and Drug  
Administration that electromagnetic fields emitted by metal 
detectors and antitheft systems can in rare instances interfere 
with implanted devices such as defibrillators and pacemakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study looked only at defibrillators and antitheft  
systems, not metal detectors. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is absolutely no danger from a slow stroll through the  
gates, even if it takes 10 or 15 seconds,'' said Dr. Douglas Zipes, 
a professor of medicine at the Indiana University School of 
Medicine in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	However, if a person with a defibrillator takes longer, he or  
she could experience an unnecessary electric shock to the heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our advice: Don't lean, don't linger, don't worry,'' Zipes  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were published in Tuesday's issue of Circulation, a  
journal of the American Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The research was funded in part by a grant from an electronics  
company that makes antitheft systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Implanted defibrillators, which cost about $25,000 each, send  
electrical impulses to slow down or speed up a patient's heart, 
depending on what's needed. Pacemakers, at about $5,000 each, 
strictly speed up slow-beating hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers looked at 169 patients with implanted defibrillators  
and found no problems with a normal walk through the security 
gates. 
</P>
<P>
	But when patients stood within 6 inches of the antitheft systems  
for two minutes, seven of the 169 experienced problems with their 
implants that indicated they had or might have gotten an 
unnecessary shock. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 400,000 people have implanted defibrillators.  
</P>
<P>
	An expert not involved in the study, Dr. Lewis A. Lipsitz of  
Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for the Aged at Harvard Medical 
School, said: ``It's reassuring and comforting that 
(defibrillators) will not be falsely triggered by common security 
devices that people walk through every day.''

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall Slightly / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell slightly Monday on fears that  
this week's economic reports on employment costs and gross domestic 
product will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to 
stave off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 3/32  
point, or $0.94 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 6.03 percent from 6.02 percent late 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short- and intermediate-term  
Treasury securities were down 1/32 point across the board, reported 
Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.66 percent as the  
discount was unchanged at 4.54 percent. Six-month yields were 4.70 
percent, as the discount was unchanged at 4.53 percent. One-year 
yields were 5.02 percent as the discount rose by 0.01 percentage 
point from late Friday to 4.77 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.06 percent from 5 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 8/32 to 118 23/32. The average yield to 
maturity rose to 5.53 percent from 5.53 percent.

<HEADLINE> India: All Rebels Out of Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Indian soldiers swept the last rebels  
from their side of the disputed Kashmir region today after killing 
32 guerrillas in weekend fighting and losing seven of their own 
men, the army said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the intruders have now been evicted and there is no  
Pakistani presence in Indian territory,'' said Lt. Gen. N.C. Vij, 
director-general of military operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sporadic shelling, however, continued on both sides, with the  
Pakistanis targeting some forward Indian posts, Vij said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to maintain extra vigil and will remain in a  
state of full preparedness to face any eventuality,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this year, hundreds of Islamic fighters seized  
mountaintops inside the Indian-held part of the frigid northern 
territory. In May, India launched a campaign to evict the 
infiltrators, most of whom left after India and Pakistan agreed to 
halt the fighting two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	However, skirmishes continued in a few areas along the 110-mile  
battle zone. By Sunday, India was on its way to clearing the area 
after taking control of the strategic Dras region, the army said. 
Troops today pushed the remaining guerrillas out of Batalik and the 
Mushkoh Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	India recaptured Dras on Sunday after taking Sando Top and Zulu  
Top, the only two peaks in the region that remained under rebel 
control, the army said. 
</P>
<P>
	In weekend fighting, six of the seven Indian dead were killed by  
land mines and 13 others were wounded in mine blasts, the army 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	India accuses Pakistan of training and arming the Islamic  
militants, and says the infiltrators were mostly Pakistani 
soldiers. Pakistan denies the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Since gaining independence from Britain in 1947, India and  
Pakistan -- the world's newest nuclear powers -- have fought two wars 
for control of the territory.

<HEADLINE> Ministers, U.S. Agree on N. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Foreign ministers from Asia and the United  
States agreed today to urge North Korea not to launch another test 
missile, saying it would threaten regional security, a Japanese 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before arriving at Asia's annual security conference, Secretary  
of State Madeleine Albright called the Korean peninsula ``perhaps 
the most dangerous place on earth today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If North Korea launches a test missile, as analysts say the  
Pyongyang government is preparing to do, it would have ``a negative 
impact on regional security,'' said Japanese government spokesman 
Yasuhisa Kawamura. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, North Korea launched a three-stage rocket that flew  
over Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Another missile launch would make it difficult for Japan to  
continue financial support for a $1 billion North Korean nuclear 
energy project, Kawamura said. That project was planned to dissuade 
North Korea from developing its own nuclear programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministers also agreed that a six-nation dispute over the  
Spratly Islands in the South China Sea is ``not an immediate 
threat'' but requires attention, said Kawamura. 
</P>
<P>
	The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which is hosting the  
annual regional forum, is preparing a code of conduct for the 
governments that claim portions of the islands, believed to be rich 
in minerals and oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The third major topic of discussion today was East Timor.  
Albright expressed concern about recent violence in the Indonesian 
territory, saying it threatened to prevent a fair vote on 
independence for the former Portuguese colony from taking place as 
scheduled next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look to the Indonesian government to meet its obligation to  
create a secure and credible environment for the August vote,'' 
Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	In separate talks during the forum, the United States and China  
remained at odds over NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 
Belgrade, Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said she and Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan  
agreed a crisis over Taiwan's recent claim of statehood must be 
resolved quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	China has expressed indignation over Taiwanese President Lee  
Teng-hui's recent suggestion that there should be 
``state-to-state'' relations. Lee's comments appeared to undermine 
the so-called ``one-China'' policy, under which the mainland and 
Taiwan have long coexisted. 
</P>
<P>
	Tang refused to rule out force as an option and cautioned the  
United States to avoid doing anything that would ``fan the flames'' 
of Taiwanese independence. U.S. law requires Washington to sell 
Taiwan defensive weapons and treat threats against the island as a 
matter of grave concern, although it is vague on whether U.S. 
forces would help defend the island. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there occurs any action for Taiwan independence and any  
attempt by foreign forces to separate Taiwan from the motherland, 
the Chinese government and people will not sit back and do 
nothing,'' Tang said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said the stakes in a territorial dispute over the  
Spratly Islands in the South China Sea were too high for the United 
States to sit on the sidelines and watch tensions rise. 
</P>
<P>
	But Malaysia and China said the dispute concerns only the six  
governments that claim the islands and should not be discussed by 
all 20 countries attending the ASEAN Regional Forum. The islands 
are considered particularly valuable because they straddle vital 
sea routes and fishing areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian financial problems and help for the poor were also on the  
agenda. Other issues included human rights abuses and drug 
smuggling in Myanmar, an ASEAN member, and continuing strife along 
the India-Pakistan border. 
</P>
<P>
	ASEAN consists of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,  
Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	They meet annually in the ASEAN Regional Forum with the United  
States, Russia, China, Japan, Australia, Canada, the European 
Union, South Korea, India, New Zealand and Mongolia.

<HEADLINE> Texas Instruments To Buy Unitrode </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Texas Instruments Inc. said Monday it will buy  
Unitrode Corp., which makes power-management parts used in analog 
semiconductors, in a stock deal valued at about $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas-based semiconductor giant said the acquisition will  
strengthen its lineup of analog products for the mass market. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of directors of both companies have approved the deal,  
which TI expects to complete in the second half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Unitrode's main products cover power supply control, interface,  
and battery management components used in portable devices such as 
cellular phones and notebook computers. 
</P>
<P>
	TI said Unitrode, with about 840 employees, will continue to  
operate from its New Hampshire headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is based on Unitrode's closing stock price Friday of  
$38.60 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Unitrode shares rose 29.9 percent, or $8, to $34.75 on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Signs of 'New Era' in Investing / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's not one of those things you can measure  
precisely, but it's there -- a sense of relief and freedom from all 
those old rules and admonitions that governed economic society. 
</P>
<P>
	It's palpable. You can feel it in the stock market, for  
instance, where investors are freed from the old-fashioned notion 
that it takes profits to elevate the price of a stock. 
</P>
<P>
	In the old days, a decade or so ago, the marketplace was  
weighted down by so many old criteria and ancient fears that you 
didn't dare make a move without consulting a white-haired expert. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, investors can express their new freedom by turning tip  
into transaction simply by going on line and punching a few keys, 
thus ignoring all the warnings that applied to the past. 
</P>
<P>
	You can witness it in housing, where existing homes are traded  
in numbers never before seen, because a title deed is viewed as a 
security to trade, not just a roof overhead as in the old days. 
</P>
<P>
	And so, investment conscious, status-seeking techies sell their  
perfectly adequate 4 bedroom, 2 1/2 bath standard product for an 
innovative, 6 bedroom, 4 bath castle with swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, those of lesser incomes can play the game too, since  
freedom from bank regulations means you can borrow most of the 
equity in the house to spend, or perhaps to invest in stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	You can see it in automotive sales, now running at a record  
pace, where sound, 1 1/2-year-old vehicles are exchanged for new ones 
because -- well, you don't wear a polyester tie with a silk suit and 
you don't park a Yugo in the driveway of a mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	You can read the new sense of freedom on the covers of the  
popular magazines, and you can see it in affluent neighborhood tag 
sales, where unused gym equipment, bought on impulse, is dumped. 
</P>
<P>
	Or experience it at the casinos, or hear economic consultants  
explain to legislators how gambling and lotteries can substitute 
for productive industries as a secure source of revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Washington, where a government that for more than two  
decades couldn't raise enough taxes to keep pace with its outflow 
now has such an inflow it's at a loss on ways to spend it. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless there is some other, obscure reason, the zero savings  
rate also reflects the sense of freedom from the past's rules of 
conduct, the sort of rules that warned of rainy days to come. 
</P>
<P>
	While those brought up under the old rules believe with  
unshakable conviction that recessions follow expansions, in the new 
view, such ugly cycles have been tamed by modern monetary genius. 
</P>
<P>
	The current expansion has lasted through most of the 1990s, and  
it is likely to continue for many months more, and each month that 
is added to the string seems to add a new layer of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing like it has occurred in the memory of anyone alive  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	You can view it in the Cape Cod harbors, or in Benton Harbor,  
Mich., Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Biloxi, Miss., or Marina Del Ray, 
Calif., from whence the big boats, ever larger, sail off into the 
sunset.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Urge Farm Relief Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Here's a forecast farmers and taxpayers can  
count on: With crop prices the lowest they've been in years, the 
cost of bailing out the troubled agricultural economy is going up, 
way up. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm-state Democrats proposed a $10 billion aid package Monday,  
$4 billion more than Congress gave farmers last fall during the 
first year of the farm economy's current slump. 
</P>
<P>
	And Republicans, who once insisted on waiting until this fall  
before doing anything for farmers, said they were preparing a 
package of their own that could cost at least $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm-state senators are pressing to take up the issue next week  
before Congress leaves for its long August recess. The money would 
be added to an annual appropriations bill for the Agriculture 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will work out something, I think, when the time comes,  
whether it's before or after the recess, and farmers will benefit 
from the actions we take,'' said Sen. Thad Cochran, a Mississippi 
Republican who chairs the Senate agricultural appropriations 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The agricultural economy is mired in its worst slump in over a  
decade because of a worldwide grain glut that shows no signs of 
easing this year. Soybean prices are at their lowest levels since 
the early 1970s, and prices for corn and wheat aren't much better. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not just an agricultural crisis. It's a crisis of  
rural America, the magnitude of which has exceeded even last 
year,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA already expects to pay farmers nearly $8 billion in crop  
subsidies this year in addition to $5.6 billion in direct payments 
guaranteed under the 1996 farm bill. But farm groups are asking for 
up to $17 billion in emergency aid, saying many producers are at 
risk of going out of business this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got farmers that are hurting and ... something needs to  
be done to show them that Congress can get started on this,'' said 
Dave Lane, a spokesman for the American Farm Bureau Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans worry about getting into a bidding war with  
Democrats and have pressed the Clinton administration to come up 
with its own proposal. Last fall, GOP leaders proposed a $4 billion 
package only to have it vetoed by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee,  
Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., proposed holding three days of hearings 
next week so lawmakers could get a better idea how much assistance 
is needed and how it should be distributed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats rejected the idea, and at least one Republican,  
Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, said he didn't want to wait either. 
Congress needs to signal farmers as soon as possible that help is 
on the way, Grassley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic aid package includes $5.6 billion in direct  
payments to farmers, doubling what they are already scheduled to 
get, along with $1.3 billion in trade assistance, $400 million in 
crop-insurance discounts, and a variety of other aid to producers 
of certain crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also want Congress to rewrite the 1996 farm law,  
popularly known as ``Freedom to Farm,'' which ended a 
Depression-era system of price supports. Republicans so far have 
refused to reconsider the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional debate is playing out against the backdrop of  
the 2000 presidential campaign in Iowa, the site of the first 
caucuses, where Republican Gary Bauer recently criticized GOP 
congressional leaders for not moving more quickly on a bailout. 
Democrats circulated his comments in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The farm economy quickly faded as an issue in the 1998 elections

	``We're just going to have to wait and see whether there is more  
and more anger in the agricultural community and whether it's aimed 
at House incumbents, or at Freedom to Farm, or at foreign

Stuart Rothenberg.

<HEADLINE> At Least 23 Deaths from Heat Wave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scorching heat gripped the eastern third of the country on  
Monday, continuing a hot spell that has been blamed for at least 24 
deaths -- including an elderly Illinois woman found inside her 
102-degree home. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasts say there's no immediate relief in sight.  
</P>
<P>
	Heat advisories were posted Monday from Kansas eastward through  
the Ohio Valley, and over parts of the Southeast. Temperatures 
throughout the region hit the 90s and reached triple digits with 
the heat index. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather was blamed on eight deaths in Cincinnati over the  
weekend, 11 deaths in Illinois in the past week and five in 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	In West Peoria, Ill., a neighbor found the body of 82-year-old  
Helen Lane on Saturday. All the windows in her home were closed and 
her air conditioner had broken; the temperature inside was 102. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the Cincinnati victims were found in homes where the  
temperatures were about 98. 
</P>
<P>
	``The heat's not going to go away,'' Hamilton County (Ohio)  
Coroner Carl L. Parrott said. ``Unless people modify their 
behavior, there will be more deaths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois death count included two young boys -- ages 2 and 1 1/2  
-- found last week outside their home in their parents' sweltering 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures reached 100 degrees in St. Louis on Monday, making  
it the hottest day of the 12-day span of 90-plus degree weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitals in the city were reporting high numbers of cases of  
heat stress. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York state, more than 1,000 people were treated for heat  
exhaustion and dehydration at the three-day Woodstock '99 concert. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat has also increased demand for air conditioning and  
tightened supplies of electricity.
