<HEADLINE> Report: Louisville After Pro Teams  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HOUSTON (AP) -- The city of Louisville is pursuing the Houston Rockets, the
WNBA Comets and the ThunderBears arena football franchise, a television station
reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Louisville officials have called Rockets management to let the team know of
their interest in luring the franchises to their city, KRIV-TV in Houston
reported Tuesday night, citing unidentified sources.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawyer representing Louisville in relocation negotiations, Bruce Miller,
told the station he is talking with four NBA teams, but did not name them.
Miller said Louisville plans to build a new arena.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a team that is interested in talking and has requested a formal
proposal from us. We are in the process of completing it," Miller said. "I don't
want any inference to be drawn that it is a team in Houston because that could
be significantly wrong."
</P>
<P>
	   Rockets' chief operating officer George Postolos also declined to say which
cities have contacted the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston voters rejected a referendum for a new arena in November. Les
Alexander, who owns all three teams, has said he must have an arena to be
competitive.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we lost the referendum in November, we said that we are going to take
a step back and look at our alternatives and that includes fielding inquiries
from other cities," Postolos told the television station. "We have received a
number of inquiries and we will respond to those. We don't intend to comment
beyond that."

<HEADLINE> Longer-Acting Presriptions on Way  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- When Adrienne Collis learned her daughter Shannon was
shorter than normal due to a growth hormone deficiency, doctors recommended a
medicine that could help.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem was the human growth hormone sold since 1985 had to be given by
injection every day.
</P>
<P>
	   But Collis was allowed to take an experimental version that only had to be
injected twice a month. It worked, and Shannon, now 13, grew four inches over
the past two years and is now 4 feet 7 inches.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's hard for a parent to give their kid a shot, so it's fabulous that we
don't have to worry about it every day," said Adrienne Collis of El Segundo,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   The long-acting formula, called Nutropin Depot, is one of several
longer-acting prescription drugs coming to market that can be taken once a week
or even less often.
</P>
<P>
	   By the end of next year, longer acting versions of existing medicines will
be available to treat osteoporosis, depression, anemia as well as growth hormone
deficiency.
</P>
<P>
	   The move to longer-acting drugs is intended to make sure people take their
pills, particularly the elderly who often are prescribed multiple drugs to deal
with chronic illnesses. Patients who fail to take all their prescription are
less likely to maintain their health or recuperate faster from an illness,
studies show.
</P>
<P>
	   But there could be a downside to once-a-week doses.
</P>
<P>
	   Some pharmacy experts caution that people may have trouble remembering to
take their drugs if the medication is not part of a daily routine. And they
worry that longer-acting drugs remain longer in the bloodstream, which could
magnify any side effects.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some drugs can be tolerated well once a week, while others may increase the
risk of toxicity," said Dr. Charles Flexner, associate professor of clinical
pharmacology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   Less frequent dosing, though, is a welcome change for people like Shannon
Collis who require injections.
</P>
<P>
	   By this summer, Genentech Inc. plans to launch the twice-a-month version of
Nutropin Depot, which was approved in December by the Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Because human growth hormone is often given to children for many years,
getting a weekly shot instead of daily "is the biggest new development since the
development of human growth hormone itself," said Dr. Mitchell Geffner, chief of
pediatric endocrinology at the Mattel Children's Hospital at the University of
California-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug companies believe more patients will take all of their medicine if they
only need one dose a week, meaning fewer pills will sit unused in medicine
cabinets, leading to a rise in sales of refills. Companies also are expected to
be able to charge more for the newer medicines. Prices have yet to be set for
the new series of longer-lasting drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   "The logic is pretty compelling," said Dr. Marty Silverstein, who leads the
health group at the Boston Consulting Group. He said at least 25 percent of
prescriptions are wasted because people don't take all their medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other companies developing longer-acting drugs, Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. this
spring is expected to apply for FDA approval for a weekly version of its
top-selling antidepressant Prozac, now given once-a-day. Merck &AMP; Co. is awaiting
FDA approval for a weekly version of its once-a-day osteoporosis pill Fosamax.
Amgen and Johnson &AMP; Johnson are also working on weekly drugs to treat anemia in
patients receiving chemotherapy and kidney dialysis.
</P>
<P>
	   "History tells us the drugs with the better formulations that are more
patient-friendly win hands down," said Steve Arlington, head of pharmaceutical
research at the PriceWaterhouseCoopers consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug companies have been able to develop longer-acting medicines by using
higher dosages and altering the mechanism in which the medicine is released into
the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
	   Still years away is the development of once-a-lifetime drugs with the help
of gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
	   Health insurers also are helping fuel the need for medicines given less
frequently. "Insurance companies want to make sure people take the drugs they
are paying for," said Stephen Tang, a national director of A.T. Kearney health
care consulting practice.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug companies have some experience with drugs taken less than once a day.
For example, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn makes the injectable contraceptive Depo Provera,
which is taken once every three months. Though Depo Provera has been used in the
United States since 1992, sales still lag far behind daily birth control pills.
Analysts say women don't want to be bothered going to the doctor's office.
</P>
<P>
	   But injections at home are a convenience for youngsters like Shannon Collis,
who gets a shot of growth hormone every other Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Collis said if she had to get an injection of growth hormone every day it
would interfere with her taking trips such as visiting relatives overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know its helping me because I've grown," she said. "The shots kind of
hurt, but I don't have to worry about it every day."

<HEADLINE> Small Grocers Battling Superstores  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSH HOFFNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FLASHER, N.D. (AP) -- The only grocery store in this small southwestern
North Dakota town hasn't changed much in the last 45 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Workers still greet every customer by their first name. And when not serving
customers, the owners can be seen behind the counter butchering meat.
</P>
<P>
	   But D &AMP; P Foods owners Dennis and Pam Hatzenbuhler are faced with a dilemma
that all the down-home service in the world can't overcome.
</P>
<P>
	   They and other mom-and-pop stores are struggling to compete with
supermarkets and retailers like Wal-Mart, and, to make matters worse, it's
getting harder to stock the shelves as suppliers find it inefficient to deliver
to isolated areas.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're fighting tooth and nail," said Dennis Hatzenbuhler, who has owned D &AMP;
P Foods with his wife for 17 years in Flasher, a town of about 300.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't know if they (suppliers) can justify coming out this far. They
tend to think we're out here in the wilderness," he said. "All these big guys
are competing against each other, and us small, individual retailers are getting
our throats cut."
</P>
<P>
	   The number of small grocery stores in the United States dropped 40 percent
from 1988 to 1998, according to the Food Marketing Institute. The number of
chain supermarkets increased 15.9 percent during the same time period. Small
stores made up 42.3 percent of grocery stores in 1988, compared with 29.8 in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Lynn Nottestad, who is closing what was the town of Maddock, N.D.'s only
grocery store, blames the struggling farm economy and local residents who are
driving to nearby cities to shop.
</P>
<P>
	   But rigid suppliers have compounded his troubles by requiring him to buy
full cases of products, making it virtually impossible for him to sell
everything.
</P>
<P>
	   "Maybe if we got two cases of lettuce for the week, we'd throw out one,"
Nottestad said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hatzenbuhlers' supplier, Hartz Foods of Thief River Falls, Minn., served
70 grocery stores in North Dakota and about 100 in Minnesota before filing for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month. Company President Paul Nelson said
sales have dropped 60 percent in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Small stores also are undercut because they don't get food displays that are
common in supermarkets. Food and beverage makers such as Frito-Lay or Coca-Cola
are known to pay supermarkets for eye-level shelf space at the end of aisles,
allowing stores to sell products at discount prices.
</P>
<P>
	   The practice has resulted in a federal investigation because some say it
drives small stores out of business and hurts customers by limiting competition.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatzenbuhler admits it's difficult to compete with supermarkets, but he
tries provide a full-service business. The store, built in 1954, has five aisles
and sections for bakery, produce, meat and personal care items. The
Hatzenbuhlers rent videos, and they run an adjoining craft store.
</P>
<P>
	   They also provide customer service that supermarkets cannot match: If a
school activity runs out of food for an evening event, Hatzenbuhler opens the
store. If a local club is short on steaks for a fund-raising supper,
Hatzenbuhler saves the day.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'd be plum lost without a grocery store here," said Ernie Hinderer, a
Flasher resident and loyal local shopper.
</P>
<P>
	   But Hatzenbuhler said that sentiment is eroding as larger cities become
one-stop shopping destinations for people who used to make a trip up and down
small-town Main Street for their needs.
</P>
<P>
	   "The grocery business used to be a fun business, but now it's just a
stressful business," Hatzenbuhler said. "Customer loyalty is a thing of the
past."

<HEADLINE> Cisco Earns Up 53 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By CLIFF EDWARDS AP Technology Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- On the same day it reported stronger earnings and a
stock split, Cisco Systems said the Y2K issue is largely behind it and analysts
predicted another strong year.
</P>
<P>
	   As worries about computer disruptions from the Year 2000 date change
subside, corporations will boost their technology spending and help Cisco, which
makes equipment to conduct commerce on the Web.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Cisco beat Wall Street forecasts again with its latest quarterly
results, posting a 53 percent increase in sales.
</P>
<P>
	   The company reported that operating income rose to $906 million, or 25 cents
a share, in its second quarter ended Jan. 29. Those numbers compare with $609
million, or 17 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income, which includes acquisition-related costs, goodwill writeoffs and
investment gains, rose from $825 million from $282 million in the year-ago
period. Sales, meanwhile, totaled $4.35 billion, jumping from $2.95 billion a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors had expected an operating profit of 24 cents a share in the latest
quarter, according to a survey of analysts by First Call/Thomson Financial. In
addition to beating that number, the results also matched the unofficial
"whisper" estimates that circulate on Wall Street and the Internet before a
major earnings report.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Internet revolution momentum continues to accelerate across all
geographies," said John Chambers, the company's president and chief executive.
"Our goal continues to be to grow as fast, or faster, than the rest of the
market."
</P>
<P>
	   Cisco has emerged as one of the most consistent growers in the technology
industry because of soaring demand for its switches and routers, which are used
to direct communications traffic for both corporate computer networks and the
broader, public networks run by telecommunications companies and Internet
service providers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think there is a whole lot new or different here," said Nutmeg
Securities analyst Andy Schopick. "The company's business continues to grow very
nicely."
</P>
<P>
	   Cisco's operating earnings for the latest quarter excluded certain one-time
expenses and gains that left the company with a net profit of $825 million, or
23 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income for the first six months of the year totaled $1.25 billion, or 34
cents a share, up from $791 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier. Net
sales rose 52 percent to $8.26 billion from $5.44 billion.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Earns $173M  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna, the nation's largest health insurer, posted
stronger-than-expected fourth quarter profits, but warned it was having trouble
controlling rising medical costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hartford, Conn.-based company said its fourth quarter operating profit
excluding one-time items rose 30 percent to $173 million or $1.18 per share,
from $144.5 million or 91 cents a share in the same period a year ago. Results
beat Wall Street estimates by eight cents, according to First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income in the fourth quarter was $134.5 million or 92 cents a share,
down from $231.8 million or $1.50 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues rose 46 percent to $6.3 billion from $4.29 billion, largely
reflecting Aetna's purchase of Prudential Health Care in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said Aetna was only able to surpass earnings forecasts due to the
sale of an insurance subsidiary in Brazil and lower-than-expected taxes in
several countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna's stock has been under pressure since last fall when the company
became subject to several class action suits filed by the same trial attorneys
who won big awards against the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has also had more difficulty than expected in turning around the
money-losing Prudential business.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna has also had to wage a public relations battle to maintain its image
against consumers groups and medical providers who argue the company skimps on
care.
</P>
<P>
	   "The earnings reflect the difficult nature of the business especially for a
company that is under attack from so many outside sources," said David Shove, an
analyst with Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   In a key indicator of financial health, Aetna spent 95.3 cents of each
dollar received in premiums on health care costs in treating seniors, up from
92.6 cents a year ago, signaling they are spending they are spending more money
on health care costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Due to its purchase of Prudential Healthcare, the number of members in Aetna
U.S. Healthcare, the company's health insurance division, rose by 5.1 million
people in 1999 to 21 million. But number of members is expected to fall
dramatically this year due to the company raising premiums to keep up with
rising medical costs.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, Aetna's operating income rose 19 percent to $676.4 million
or $4.44 per share from $567 million or $3.52 per share in 1998. Net income was
$716.9 million or $4.72 per share, down from $848.1 million or $5.41 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues in 1999 rose 28 percent to $26.5 billion from $20.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> Nike Warns on Expectations  </HEADLINE>
    By WILLIAM McCALL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Nike said it still expects earnings per share to
grow 20 percent, but warned its results may fall short of expectations for
fiscal 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The athletic shoe maker said in a statement Tuesday it has fared well
despite a shakeout in the U.S. retail industry. But Nike president Tom Clarke
said that annual earnings per share could fall below the current estimates of
$2.08 by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding a restructuring charge, Beaverton-based Nike earned $1.66 per
share in fiscal 1999, which ended May 31. A 20 percent increase would mean
earnings of about $1.99 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Clarke said many of Nike's retail partners in the U.S. have experienced a
slump in footwear sales, causing them to close many of their stores.
</P>
<P>
	   A number of analysts had already expressed concern about domestic sales for
Nike with some of its principal outlets, including Venator, cutting back orders
and other companies such as Just for Feet closing stores.
</P>
<P>
	   When Nike announced its second-quarter earnings in December, it said that
orders in the United States were down 8 percent, noted John Shanley of First
Security Van Kasper.
</P>
<P>
	   "What you seeing in the weakness of Nike futures orders in the U.S. is a
clear reflection of retail shrinkage," Shanley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nike chairman Phil Knight had warned in December that the consolidation of
the U.S. retail market "may have an adverse effect on our revenues in the short
run," but that in the long term it would strengthen business for Nike and
retailers.
</P>
<P>
	   Clarke remained optimistic Tuesday about overall growth for Nike, with
strong sales expected in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   Jennifer Black of Black &AMP; Co. in Portland said the consolidation of smaller
sports shoe retailers would be painful in the short term for Nike -- but she
agreed with Knight that will improve the health of the industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this is a pretty conservative outlook," she said. "It has really
dampened their enthusiasm. But in the long term, they are the dominant player."

	   EDINBORO, Pa. (AP) -- The United States won four of the first five matches
to defeat Russia 17-16 in exhibition wrestling Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	The Americans took a 15-7 lead, getting 1996 Olympian Lou Rosselli's 5-3
decision over Maxim Molonov at 54 kilograms. Rosselli, a former All-American at
Edinboro, is ranked second in the United States

Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> College Protests Spread in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Administrators started returning to Mexico's largest
university Tuesday, two days after a police raid ended a 9 1/2-month occupation
by striking students.
</P>
<P>
	   But while courts freed most of the 745 people arrested in Sunday's raid, the
turmoil at the National Autonomous University spilled into national politics and
onto other campuses in the Mexican capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Students at other city universities demonstrated in favor of strikers still
imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico City's leftist mayor, Rosario Robles, appeared in television
advertisements to denounce the federal raid on the 270,000-student school known
by Spanish acronym, UNAM. She demanded freedom for all those arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To avoid making Mexico City a victim of a conflict ... it is urgent that
the Federal Preventative Police leave the university installations and that the
detained students be freed,'' said Robles, herself a UNAM graduate.
</P>
<P>
	   With a presidential election in July nearing, federal officials suggested
Robles' opposition-party city government had shirked its responsibility by
refusing to help retake the school.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal police on Tuesday turned over several parts of the campus to
university officials, who drove past barricades to tour structures emblazoned
with revolutionary slogans. Some buildings had been carefully maintained by
strikers; others had been looted and were strewn with garbage.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal attorney general's office announced that 579 of the adults
arrested Sunday had been freed, though some might face other charges. Another 77
minors were turned over to the juvenile court system.
</P>
<P>
	   Still in jail were 89 strike leaders and supporters, mostly on charges of
seizing public buildings or theft. Another 86 people have been held on various
charges since a violent clash on Jan. 26 at one of the university's high
schools. Late Tuesday, 85 of those suspects were ordered held for trial and one
was released.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike began last April to protest an increase in UNAM's minimal tuition
and other reforms. University officials quickly backed off on the tuition issue,
but radicals controlling the strike committee pressed ahead with the strike,
seeing it as part of a struggle against free-market economic policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Insisting on freedom for those arrested, faculty and students on Tuesday
staged a one-day strike of support at another school, the Metropolitan
Autonomous University's campus in northwestern Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
	   Students at the two other campuses of that university, which has about
45,000 students in all, also were voting on whether to join the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of members of the UNAM strike committee met Monday in a plaza at
the Metropolitan campus in southern Mexico City, denouncing the police raid and
pledging to continue the strike.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have confidence in our comrades, knowing that no one with a minimum of
dignity and conscience would set foot in a classroom taken violently by military
police in violation of the university's autonomy,'' the strike council said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   UNAM Rector Juan Ramon de la Fuente has urged officials to drop charges
against those arrested Sunday or at least to be lenient.

Interior Secretary Diodoro Carrasco told reporters Tuesday: ``This is not a

College Protests Spread in Mexico
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Administrators started returning to Mexico's largest
university Tuesday, two days after a police raid ended a 9 1/2-month occupation
by striking students. But while courts freed most of the 745 people arrested in
Sunday's raid, the turmoil at the National Autonomous University spilled into
national politics and onto other campuses in the Mexican capital. Students at
other city universities demonstrated in favor of strikers still imprisoned.
Mexico City's leftist mayor, Rosario Robles, appeared in television
advertisements to denounce the federal raid on the 270,000-student school known
by Spanish acronym, UNAM. She demanded freedom for all those arrested.

Clinton Wants Puerto Rico Vote
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- President Clinton has asked Congress for $2.5
million to hold another vote on whether Puerto Rico should become a U.S. state,
the White House said Tuesday. The referendum could be held as early as October
if Congress approves the request, said Jeffrey Farrow, Clinton's main adviser on
the Caribbean U.S. territory. It was included in the White House's fiscal 2001
budget, which was presented Monday. Puerto Rico became a U.S. territory when the
United States wrested it from Spain during the Spanish-American War of 1898.

Bush Wins Delaware Primary

	   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush won Delaware's
presidential primary Tuesday and earned a badly needed boost into a Southern
showdown, even as antagonist John McCain burnished his insurgent candidacy by
finishing second in a state where he did not campaign. A weak third-place finish
by Steve Forbes doomed his candidacy. A senior adviser, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said aides were recommending that the candidate depart the race --
and he was likely to do so. "I think this is a piece of good news that will buoy
our supporters," Bush, the Texas governor, told The Associated Press after
securing the state's 12 delegates.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a dramatic demonstration of the Internet's
vulnerabilities, electronic vandals disrupted some of the Web's most popular
sites Tuesday by using dozens of powerful computers to spew out a crippling
flood of false data. Internet sites under unprecedented attack included those of
eBay, Amazon and CNN, all in assaults similar to one that overwhelmed Yahoo! a
day earlier. A fifth prominent Internet company, Buy.Com, also was crippled for
hours earlier Tuesday in a similar attack against its Web site. All the
companies said hackers did not gain access inside their computers or retrieve

Four Escape From Afghan Airliner
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Four men dropped from the cockpit window of a
hijacked plane and ran to safety Tuesday night, fleeing the Afghan aircraft that
has been parked for two days while negotiators seek the release of more than 150
passengers. They were being questioned after receiving medical attention, and
appeared to have suffered no serious injuries, said Joe Edwards, an Essex Police
assistant chief constable. The aims of the hijackers, believed to be Afghans,
remained unclear. Speculation ranged from an elaborate play for political asylum
to a bid to win the release of Ismail Khan, a former regional governor in
Afghanistan.

Linch. The other person on the plane, who was not identified, was also killed.
The other plane, a four-seat Cessna 172, crashed into a nearby street, killing

nation's elite Tuesday night, getting 11 points and 18 rebounds from Mike Miller
in a wire-to-wire 90-73 victory over No. 11 Kentucky. It was the fourth straight
win for Florida (18-4, 7-2 Southeastern Conference), which pulled into a
three-way tie for first in the SEC East with Kentucky (17-6, 7-2) and No. 8
Tennessee. The Wildcats came in as arguably the hottest team in the nation,
having gone 13-1 since splitting their first eight games and brought up
questions as to whether the dynasty was in decline.

	   GRAND MARAIS, Minn. (AP) -- Defending champion John Barron of Willow,
Alaska, held the lead Tuesday in the 400-mile John Beargrease Sled Dog Marathon
along the North Shore of Lake Superior.
</P>
<P>
	Barron was the first to leave Devil's Track Landing, 13 miles north of Grand
Marais, the seventh checkpoint of the race. He also was the first to arrive at
the next stop, Grand Portage, 58 miles away.
</P>
<P>
	Barron and his team pulled into Grand Portage at 9:16 p.m., 33 minutes ahead of
Mark Stamm of Riverside, Wash.
</P>
<P>
	Two other mushers joined them shortly afterward. Doug Grilliot of Willow,
Alaska, pulled in at 10:11 p.m., and Steve Rasmussen of Melrose arrived 11
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
	All mushers must take a six-hour layover when they reach Grand Portage before
heading back to Devil's Track Landing for the finish. The winner could reach the
finish line by midday Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	The race, which began Sunday in Duluth, will end at Devil's Track Landing
instead of Grand Marais. Race officials shortened the course by 13 miles because
of warm weather and deteriorating conditions closer to the lake.

<HEADLINE> Mighty Ducks 5, Kings 3  </HEADLINE>
    By KEN PETERS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski started a four-goal
outbreak in the second period with his first NHL goal and the Anaheim Mighty
Ducks went on to a 5-3 victory Tuesday night over the Los Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
	   Oleg Tverdovsky, another defenseman, and Steve Rucchin had a goal and an
assist each for the Mighty Ducks, 3-0-2 in their last five games.
</P>
<P>
	   Vishnevski, appearing in his seventh NHL game, scored on a power play midway
through the second period to snap a 1-1 tie. His slap shot from the top of the
right circle sailed past Kings goalie Stephane Fiset, who was screened.
</P>
<P>
	   Tverdovsky followed with his seventh goal, extending his point-scoring
streak to eight games and tying J.J. Daigneault's club record for defensemen.
</P>
<P>
	   Rucchin got his 10th goal on a power play, and Paul Kariya added his 31st as
the Mighty Ducks opened a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Anaheim scored its five goals on just 14 shots, and had only 15 to the
Kings' 21 in the first two periods. For the game, the Mighty Ducks were outshot
34-21.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mighty Ducks continued to click on the power play, with Rucchin's goal
giving them nine in their last 23 opportunities with the man advantage, and they
have scored two power play goals in four of their last five games.
</P>
<P>
	   Anaheim's other goal was by Matt Cullen, his ninth, just 2:49 into the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Jozef Stumpel answered for the Kings with his sixth goal less than four
minutes later, but Los Angeles didn't score again until Glen Murray got his 18th
goal 2:33 into the final period.
</P>
<P>
	   Five minutes later, Bryan Smolinski pulled the Kings within 5-2 with his
16th goal, equaling his total with the New York Islanders last season.
</P>
<P>
	   Tverdovsky gave Anaheim a 3-1 pad with 6:27 left in the second period,
knocking in a rebound of Mike Leclerc's shot. Rucchin increased the lead just
2:24 later when Teemu Selanne, behind the goal line, fed him a perfect pass 15
feet in front of the net.
</P>
<P>
	   Less than three minutes later, Kariya came free on a breakaway, skated down
on Fiset, and beat him with a shot between the pads.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first time the Mighty Ducks scored four goals in a period since
March 26, 1999, against Dallas, and marked the first time the Kings surrendered
more than three goals in one period at home.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame AD Wadsworth To Resign  </HEADLINE>
    By JR ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Perception is everything at Notre Dame. And the
prevailing perception is that there's a problem in the athletic department.
</P>
<P>
	   So athletic director Mike Wadsworth knows his departure is as much about
image as anything else.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a broad perception out there that's a problem, and perception is
very important," Wadsworth said Tuesday. "Notre Dame has an outstanding
reputation nationally and internationally. Anything that threatens that, it's
the responsibility of the board of trustees and the officers of the university
to look at it.
</P>
<P>
	   "The best way of dealing with that is turn the page and start fresh."
</P>
<P>
	   After a series of embarrassing incidents the last several years, including
being put on probation by the NCAA, Notre Dame cleaned house as part of a
"restructuring" of the athletic department. Wadsworth will step down after a
tumultuous five years, and executive vice president E. William Beauchamp will no
longer oversee the department, ending a decades-old practice.
</P>
<P>
	   Wadsworth said Tuesday he would've preferred to stay on another year after
his contract is up this summer, but that wasn't part of the university's plan.
</P>
<P>
	   "They knew I'd been contemplating leaving sometime in the near future, and
they obviously had had some discussion about what they wanted to do in terms of
starting with a fresh page," said Wadsworth, reached at a hotel in Philadelphia,
where the men's basketball team was to play Villanova on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The more surprising move was university president the Rev. Edward A.
Malloy's decision to assume control of the athletic department, stripping
Beauchamp of responsibilities he'd had for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
	   After more than 50 years in which the university vice president oversaw
athletics, the athletic director will now report directly to Malloy. The
university president will be in charge of every major decision, including
chairing the committee that will look for Wadsworth's successor.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've always been involved in the major decisions," Malloy said. "But it
will be a clearer line of reporting."
</P>
<P>
	   Wadsworth's departure could mark the end of a sometimes embarrassing period
in the university's storied history that includes Lou Holtz's departure, former
assistant Joe Moore's age discrimination suit and Notre Dame's discussion with
the Big Ten about joining the conference and ending football's independent
status, which outraged many alumni.
</P>
<P>
	   Wadsworth will also forever be linked to former booster Kimberly Dunbar,
whose relationship with more than a dozen players eventually led to the
university's first major NCAA rules violation and probation.
</P>
<P>
	   Malloy said the university has been considering the changes in the athletic
department for sometime, but the NCAA probation accelerated the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the university escaped any penalty for institutional control, the
report still chided some football coaches for not doing enough to investigate
the relationship between Dunbar and more than a dozen players over a five-year
period.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you have some of the problems that we've talked about that are
particularly damaging to this broad perception, sometimes you want to take steps
because you feel it's necessary to change the perception," Wadsworth said.
</P>
<P>
	   Beauchamp did not return a call seeking comment Tuesday. But Wadsworth said
he always felt the university had appropriate control over the athletic
department under the old system.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Union Calls Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co. engineers and technical workers will strike on
Wednesday after last-ditch talks with a federal mediator failed to bring
agreement on a labor contract, a union spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   "They offered nothing" during the latest negotiations, the spokesman, Bill
Dugovich, said late Tuesday. The strike was to begin at 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously we are disappointed that we were unable to reach an acceptable
solution through the course of mediation in the past two days," Boeing spokesman
Peter Conte said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the aerospace giant plans to maintain operations, but a strike could
affect production.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clearly if several thousand do choose to strike there could be an impact to
operations," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The union represents 22,352 engineers, scientists, manual writers, computer
software designers and technicians covered by its contracts, mostly in Seattle
area. About 13,000 are actually members of the Society of Professional
Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA).
</P>
<P>
	   Union members rejected the company's latest three-year contract offers last
week. Dugovich said the strike was called by Charles Bofferding, SPEEA's
executive director.
</P>
<P>
	   The final effort to settle the dispute began Monday when C. Richard Barnes,
head of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, convened talks. They
broke off Tuesday, and it was unclear whether more talks were planned.
</P>
<P>
	   The union has sought more guaranteed pay raises and bonuses similar to those
received by production workers represented by the Machinists union. Boeing has
insisted on mostly selective pay hikes, reductions in life insurance benefits
and some changes in health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing made its first contract offers Nov. 11. The old contract expired Dec.
1.

<HEADLINE> Four Escape From Afghan Airline  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROLINE BYRNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Four men dropped from the cockpit window of a
hijacked plane and ran to safety Tuesday night, fleeing the Afghan aircraft that
has been parked for two days while negotiators seek the release of more than 150
passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   In the darkness shortly before midnight, the men used a rope to help lower
themselves about 20 feet to the tarmac of Stansted airport.
</P>
<P>
	   They were being questioned after receiving medical attention, and appeared
to have suffered no serious injuries, said Joe Edwards, an Essex Police
assistant chief constable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The negotiations with people on board the plane continue,'' said Edwards.
``The mood on board remains calm.''
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities had said the four appeared to be hostages, and Edwards noted
they knew how to open the cockpit's right front window. He said, however, it was
too early to say if the men were crew members.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, negotiators warned that the talks, which gained the release of a
ninth hostage during the day Tuesday, could go on for days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The negotiations are going forward in a professional way, in a fairly calm
way,'' said John Broughton, an Essex Police assistant chief constable. ``The
principal concern here is the safety of the passengers on board that aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
	   The aims of the hijackers, believed to be Afghans, remained unclear.
Speculation ranged from an elaborate play for political asylum to a bid to win
the release of Ismail Khan, a former regional governor in Afghanistan detained
since 1997 by the country's ruling Taliban movement.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about a potential asylum bid, Broughton said: ``In talking around the
issues, there are a lot of things raised.'' He would not elaborate, saying only
that the hijackers, who controlled the plane at Stansted Airport 25 miles north
of London, had made no ``formal demands.''
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the negotiations involved what Broughton called housekeeping issues,
such as the delivery of water and food to the Ariana airlines plane.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've done everything we can to keep the conditions on the aircraft
habitable,'' said Edwards. ``We're talking all the time about what's the
condition of people and how are the children.''
</P>
<P>
	   A London representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees arrived
at Stansted as an observer, police said Tuesday evening. She would not be a
negotiator, but would bring to the crisis the strength of the U.N.'s expertise
on the situation in Afghanistan, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boeing 727 had been headed to the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif
from the Afghan capital, Kabul, when it was seized early Sunday. It then began a
meandering journey across the former Soviet Union, stopping in Uzbekistan,
Kazakstan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   According to some of the 22 passengers released before the plane landed at
Stansted early Monday, the hijackers are eight young men armed with pistols,
grenades and daggers. Edwards said former hostages that authorities have talked
to have said there were between six and 10 hijackers.
</P>
<P>
	   They were believed to still be holding more than 150 hostages, including 21
children. All the passengers were believed to be Afghans.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight passengers were released at Stansted on Monday, including two infants
who were treated for dehydration. The man released earlier Tuesday, an
asthmatic, had complained of feeling ill, Broughton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The freed hostages have said they were treated well, authorities said. One
told reporters the hijacking started somewhat quietly 20 minutes into the
flight, with the armed men calmly telling passengers to put their hands on their
heads.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people we are talking to are remarkably calm and that's really
important,'' Edwards said. ``The atmosphere is one of control, people behaving
rationally. That's going to help an awful lot.''
</P>
<P>
	   All six Iraqi men at the center of Britain's last hijacking drama -- a 1996
case involving a Sudanese airliner -- remain in the country as asylum-seekers,
the British government confirmed Tuesday. Those men held 197 people hostage for
seven hours at Stansted.
</P>
<P>
	   They were convicted in 1997 and sentenced to between five and nine years in
prison. But they were cleared on appeal a year later after a court ruled the
trial judge was wrong to bar jurors from considering their defense -- that they
were acting under ``necessity'' as opponents of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's
regime.
</P>
<P>
	   The men had claimed they stormed the plane in a desperate bid to enter
Britain and seek asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghanistan is one of the top sources of asylum seekers in Britain. An
average of 360 applications a month has been lodged by Afghans since October.
Refugee status is granted in about a third of cases.

	   FAJARDO, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Enduring a succession of interviews with a
ready laugh and a brilliant smile, Ricky Martin is a man on a mission: to

</P>

	   But swiftly, seamlessly and sincerely, talk turned to the loftier themes
that drive him with a passion. Since he burst into the mainstream with a
showstopping performance of ``The Cup of Life'' at last year's Grammys, the San
Juan-born Martin has emphasized his Puerto Rican origins from every stage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's part of my flesh, and I need to share it. It's about letting people
know the beauty of my island,'' said Martin, 28, a sex symbol causing something
of a frenzy as he prepares for his first concerts at home since his rise to
megastardom.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unfortunately, there are classics in the theater about Puerto Rican
gangs,'' Martin lamented -- apparently referring to ``West Side Story'' and its
depiction of Puerto Ricans in New York that remains a source of bitterness here.
``It's very important for everyone to get rid of stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Does he feel it a duty to take a stand?
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a mission. We have the opportunity to talk to masses of people ...
Let's create some consciousness, and let's talk about humanitarian issues ...
Yes, I'm a leader. A lot of people follow my career, follow my music, and I have
to let them know (what) I'm concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
	   What about the issue that defines and drives politics in Puerto Rico: the
future status of this U.S. territory whose 4 million Spanish-speaking people are
U.S. citizens who receive billions in federal funds and serve in the U.S.
military but cannot vote for the U.S. president?
</P>
<P>
	   Martin said he voted in the 1998 referendum in which voters rejected U.S.
statehood, but he refused to reveal whether he supported statehood, independence
or the in-between status quo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let's not go there,'' was his Americanized reproach.
</P>
<P>
	   Does he view Puerto Rico as a separate country?
</P>
<P>
	   Pause. Then, with quiet determination: ``Yes. I do. I do. I do.''
</P>
<P>
	   Does the Miami resident feel American?
</P>
<P>
	   No pause. ``I'm Puerto Rican. In America, I never felt American. I don't
know -- it's like going to China and trying to feel Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
	   In recent months, Martin joined the struggle to expel the U.S. Navy from its
bombing range in outlying Vieques Island. It was partly successful: President
Clinton has ordered the Navy out in three years, pending a referendum among the
9,400 residents. Martin pushed the issue as best he could, including during a
recent visit at the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   From a cliffside hotel suite, Martin gazed at Vieques, clearly visible
across seven miles of deep blue waters where the Atlantic Ocean meets the
Caribbean Sea.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What comes to mind when I look at Vieques?'' he said thoughtfully. ``Just
a beautiful island with amazing people who deserve a little bit of serenity and
tranquility.''
</P>
<P>
	   Martin said he would visit Vieques during his two-week stay.
</P>
<P>
	   But the highlight -- much different from previous, low-key forays home --
will be a three-concert weekend blitz in San Juan, his first performances here
in two years.
</P>
<P>
	   It is the talk of all Puerto Rico. Security is tight. The media is baying. A
battalion of bodyguards, publicists and aides control access -- and image --
with ruthless efficiency. At interviews, photographers were banned and publicity
shots distributed. During the concert itself, photographers will be allowed in
only for a few songs.
</P>
<P>
	   But when Martin hears of a 4-year-old fan who would love a special picture,
his face lights up. His 6-foot-1-inch frame leaps out of his seat. The handlers
freeze. ``Let's do it!'' he commands an aide.

<HEADLINE> Study: Optimists Live Longer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP) -- Optimists, on average, live longer than pessimists,
according to a Mayo Clinic study published this week.
</P>
<P>
	   It's not a definitive study, but the research suggests optimism can lead to
success at work, school, sports, health and longevity.
</P>
<P>
	   "What is happening in the mind is strongly influencing the body, or the
final outcome of the body, which is death," said Toshihiko Maruta, a Mayo
psychiatrist and one of the authors of the study in the journal Mayo Clinic
Proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   The research is derived from questionnaires answered by Mayo Clinic patients
and more than 800 Olmsted County residents between 1962 and 1965. Follow up
questionnaires show that regardless of age or sex, the most pessimistic among
them tended to die earlier than the most optimistic.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, every 10 point increase in the "pessimism scale" resulted in a 19
percent increase in premature death, Maruta said.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers determined that, like high cholesterol or obesity, pessimism is
a risk factor for early death, even after other risk factors such as age and
gender were factored out, Maruta said.
</P>
<P>
	   No known study begins to explain why pessimism and poor health might be
related but "a lot of work is being done on that topic," said Charles Carver, a
psychologist at the University of Miami who studies motivation and coping
responses to adversity.
</P>
<P>
	   A problem for researchers is the number of ways to define and measure
pessimism and optimism. For example, Carver applies a simple definition -- do
you have good or bad expectations for the future? Other researchers focus on
interpretation of the past.
</P>
<P>
	   "Optimism is good for you," Carver said. "On that part there is no question.
But whether it keeps you alive longer or not is unknown."
</P>
<P>
	   Maruta's research didn't surprise David Lykken, a professor of psychology at
the University of Minnesota and author of the book "Happiness."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a well-known fact that happy people don't get sick as often, and, when
they do get sick or injured, they recover more quickly," Lykken said. "That is
thought to be one of the main reasons why we tend to be a happy breed.
</P>
<P>
	   "Grouches and grumblers didn't do as well when they got sick or were
searching for a mate. Nobody wants to be around them."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Said Has Biological Weapons  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- As a new U.N. commission prepares to take over Iraq's
disarmament, some of the key questions it is likely to want answered center on
Baghdad's biological weapons program -- and a U.S. arms control expert has
raised some new issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Milton Leitenberg, an expert on biological weapons, said Tuesday that
information he recently obtained indicates Iraq may have a biological warfare
agent that it kept secret from U.N. weapons inspectors -- and that was never
discovered.
</P>
<P>
	   From available evidence, he said, it is impossible to determine what the
additional agent is.
</P>
<P>
	   But Leitenberg said the evidence for two possible bacterial agents -- the
plague, which is deadly, and brucella, which causes serious illness -- seems
weaker than for a viral agent.
</P>
<P>
	   A secret biological agent may also indicate a possible production facility,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ``suspect'' area Leitenberg's information points to is the 6-mile-long
Salman peninsula in a bend of the Tigris River southeast of Baghdad that once
included a military research institute and animal testing center. U.N.
inspectors have visited the area, but were barred from digging.
</P>
<P>
	   Leitenberg, a senior fellow at the Center for International and Security
Studies at the University of Maryland, stressed that the possible new agent and
site would be ``two small additions'' to a lengthy report compiled by the U.N.
Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, in January 1999. The report detailed Iraq's
failure to disclose its full biological warfare program.
</P>
<P>
	   He said his information came mainly from former members of UNSCOM, and
included ``a very small bit'' from two Iraqi defectors interviewed by his
sources.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. Security Council created UNSCOM to destroy Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction after the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Economic sanctions imposed by the
council after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait cannot be lifted until weapons
inspectors certify that Iraq is disarmed.
</P>
<P>
	   When UNSCOM inspectors first arrived in Iraq in 1991, the government denied
it had a biological warfare program. But in July 1995, Iraq admitted producing
offensive biological weapons after the head of the country's weapons programs,
Hussein Kamal al-Majid -- a son-in-law of President Saddam Hussein -- defected
to Jordan. It said all biological weapons were destroyed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of the four weapons areas -- nuclear, missile, chemical and biological --
Iraq concealed and lied about its biology weapons program to a larger extent
than any other,'' UNSCOM's former chief inspector, Richard Butler, said Tuesday.
``What that has always suggested to me is that the program was viewed by them as
very precious -- and one that they would keep the international community away
from at virtually any cost.''
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq maintains that it has completely disarmed and has demanded the
immediate lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   Butler said he authorized international experts to investigate Iraq's
declarations on its biological weapons program on four occasions between 1997
and 1999. ``Each time those experts concluded that Iraq's declaration was simply
not credible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   UNSCOM inspectors left Baghdad in December 1998, just before the United
States and Britain launched airstrikes because of Iraq's failure to comply with
the inspections. The Iraqi government banned UNSCOM from returning.
</P>
<P>
	   After a year of protracted debate, the Security Council in December
established a new U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, or
UNMOVIC, which will be headed by Hans Blix, former director general of the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
	   He is scheduled to begin work on March 1, and after setting up UNMOVIC, his
first task will be to spell out the remaining arms questions that Iraq must
answer.
</P>
<P>
	   Arms experts hope the focus will be on biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   UNSCOM's detailed report on Iraq's biological weapons lists biological
agents Iraq produced, including botullinum toxin, anthrax and ricin, which are
deadly; gas gangrene, which rots flesh; and aflatoxin, which causes liver
cancer. Baghdad also said it did research on rotavirus, which causes diarrhea,
and hemorrhagic conjunctivitis virus, which affects the eyes.
</P>
<P>
	   The report cites Iraq's failures to account for all stocks of biological
agents and the material used to ``grow'' the agents. Inspectors said, for
example, that they believe Iraq produced three times the amount of anthrax and
16 times more gas gangrene than Baghdad declared.

<HEADLINE> ABC's 'Millionaire' a Potent Weapon  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Four editions of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" -- three
regular airings and a special -- were among the most-watched programs on
prime-time TV last week. That special edition angered one of ABC's rivals.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC scheduled it to air Wednesday, opposite NBC's game show, "Twenty One."
Regis Philbin's quiz show crushed NBC's newcomer, 28.3 million viewers to 8.3
million viewers, Nielsen Media Research said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC Entertainment President Garth Ancier later told The New York Times that
ABC's special "Millionaire" was a "cheap shot."
</P>
<P>
	   "If they continue to do this, at some point they can do tremendous damage to
this business," Ancier said.
</P>
<P>
	   Judging by last week's ratings, "Millionaire" has much less impact on more
established shows that air in the same time slot. That's an indication that the
quiz show is bringing in a lot of new viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, Fox's Sunday airing of "The X-Files" was actually up 500,000
viewers from its season average. "Missing Pieces," CBS's Sunday movie from this
week, was only 400,000 viewers off the network's average for its weekly movie.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS's "JAG," which was also shown opposite the special "Millionaire" last
Wednesday, was down 500,000 viewers from its average. And NBC's "Frasier,"
though it has clearly been hurt by "Millionaire" this season, was last week's
eighth most-watched show in prime-time.
</P>
<P>
	   For the week, ABC led with 15.9 million average prime-time viewers (10.2
rating, 17 share). CBS (8.8 rating, 14 share) and NBC (8.7, 14) both had 12.5
million viewers. Fox had 8.5 million viewers (5.5, 9).
</P>
<P>
	   UPN led the mini-networks, and has now slipped by its rival, the WB, in
average viewership this season. Last week, UPN had 4.2 million viewers (2.9
rating, 5 share), the WB had 3.6 million viewers (2.7, 4) and Pax TV had 1
million viewers (0.8, 1)
</P>
<P>
	   NBC's "Nightly News" led the evening news competition with 11.7 million
viewers (8.6 rating, 17 share), ABC's "World News Tonight" had 11 million
viewers (7.9, 15) and the "CBS Evening News" had 9.2 million viewers (6.8, 13).
</P>
<P>
	   In late night, absence may be making David Letterman's fans grow fonder --
or maybe they don't miss him at all. Monday night's special "Backstage" edition
of the "Late Show" with Julia Roberts and the ubiquitous Philbin -- a stopgap
while waiting for Letterman to return from heart surgery -- had higher overnight
ratings than any new show by Letterman on Mondays this season.
</P>
<P>
	   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of the nation's
estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the percentage of in-use
televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
	   For the week of Jan. 31-Feb. 6, the top 10 shows, their networks and ratings
were "ER," NBC, 19.0; "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" (Tuesday), ABC, 19.0; "Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire" (Thursday), ABC, 17.9; "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire" (Wednesday), ABC, 17.6; "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" (Sunday),
ABC, 17.1; "Friends," NBC, 15.6; "The Practice," ABC, 14.6; "Frasier," NBC,
14.0; "Touched By an Angel," CBS, 13.7; "Everybody Loves Raymond," CBS, 12.5.

<HEADLINE> Study Looks At McGwire's Supplement  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDSEY TANNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- The over-the-counter supplement used by Mark McGwire raises
testosterone above normal levels and could be hazardous, according to a new
study financed by major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
	   A study last year found that androstenedione had no effect on testosterone
levels or strength and instead may promote breast enlargement, heart disease and
cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   The new study lasted just one week and did not measure whether andro can do
what promoters have claimed -- make bigger muscles. But the researchers said
andro could have that effect because it increases levels of the male hormone.
</P>
<P>
	   "If a patient of mine came to me and asked whether he should take
androstenedione, I would caution against it simply because we don't know what
the long-term effects are," said Dr. Benjamin Leder, the Harvard University
endocrinologist who led the study, published in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Side effects of elevated testosterone levels include acne, male pattern
baldness and a decrease in "good" cholesterol, which could lead to heart
disease. In women, high testosterone can also cause increased body hair,
deepening of the voice and other male characteristics.
</P>
<P>
	   Androstenedione supplements are made of a naturally occurring steroid
hormone the body uses to make testosterone. When supplements of testosterone are
taken in high doses, they are known to have an anabolic effect -- increasing
muscle size and strength.
</P>
<P>
	   Andro sales soared after McGwire acknowledged using it in 1998, the year he
hit a record 70 home runs for the St. Louis Cardinals. He has since said he has
stopped using it.
</P>
<P>
	   Andro is considered a dietary supplement, but the federal government is
reviewing whether it should be reclassified as a steroid, which would remove it
from store shelves and make it available by prescription only for legitimate
medical uses.
</P>
<P>
	   It is banned by the Olympics, the NCAA, the NFL and the men's and women's
tennis tours, but not by major league baseball. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig
has been awaiting the Harvard study results to decide whether to take a stronger
stance.
</P>
<P>
	   Selig said Tuesday that the new study "appears to be a significant
contribution to the science surrounding its use," but he and players union head
Donald Fehr both said more research is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   The study of 42 men found increases in testosterone levels when andro was
taken for seven days in a single daily 300-milligram dose -- an amount that is
probably far smaller than what athletes and bodybuilders use.
</P>
<P>
	   The subjects, ages 20 to 40, were divided into three groups and received
either no androstenedione, 100 mg daily or 300 mg daily.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 300 mg group, testosterone levels in the blood increased by an
average of 34 percent by the seventh day, though levels had returned to normal
by the following day. The lower dose had no significant effect on testosterone
levels, though levels of the female hormone estrogen increased substantially
with both doses.
</P>
<P>
	   An eight-week Iowa State University study published last year in JAMA found
no increased testosterone levels with 300 mg, but the dosages were given in 100
mg increments three times daily. The authors of that study and the new research
said the dosage differences probably explain the new findings.
</P>
<P>
	   The Iowa study also found that andro increased levels of estrogen, which in
men can result in breast enlargement and other feminizing effects.
</P>
<P>
	   The new study results "will be factored into the federal review of the
proper classification" for andro, said Robert Housman, deputy director for
strategic planning for White House drug adviser Barry McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Gary Wadler, an associate professor at New York University's medical
school who has worked with McCaffrey, said the findings should come as no
surprise. He advocates reclassifying androstenedione as a prescription drug.
</P>
<P>
	   "We now see what we all knew, just being in the business," he said.

<HEADLINE> Study: Texts Lack End-of-Life Care  </HEADLINE>
    By KATE N. GROSSMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Top medical textbooks generally don't include enough
information on how to care for patients at the end of their lives, researchers
reported today in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Previous studies have concluded that many patients die in pain unnecessarily
or in hospitals rather than at home. Inadequate training has been blamed for the
deficient care -- and doctors have reported increasing anxiety about treating
dying patients.
</P>
<P>
	   "The information exists, but it's not being relayed" to medical students,
said Dr. Michael Rabow, the study's lead author and an assistant professor of
medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. "Pain goes untreated
primarily because the focus is on extending life."
</P>
<P>
	   Textbooks covering surgery, AIDS and oncology were the worst offenders,
researchers said. Textbooks with the highest percentage of helpful end-of-life
care content -- such as social and spiritual issues and ethics -- were in family
medicine, geriatrics and psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
	   Textbooks are especially important because they help "establish the standard
practice for health care," Rabow said. In addition for being used to train
medical students and residents, textbooks also are a reference for more
experienced doctors.
</P>
<P>
	   Rabow and his colleagues reviewed 50 best-selling medical textbooks from a
variety of specialties, including several diseases that often lead to death.
They assessed the information available in the textbooks in 13 areas --
including pain management, psychological issues, ethics and physician roles.
They rated the material in each textbook as helpful, minimal or absent.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the researchers found helpful information in about one-fourth of
those 13 categories. No information was found in half of the categories.
</P>
<P>
	   Textbooks with the least end-of-life content included those on infectious
diseases and AIDS -- 70 percent of the expected content was absent; and oncology
and hematology -- 62 percent of the content was missing.
</P>
<P>
	   Primary care medicine and psychiatry had the highest percentage of helpful
content -- 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Nicholas Christakis, who was not involved with the study and specializes
in hospice and palliative care at the University of Chicago, said the study
confirmed that "Americans die needlessly bad deaths."
</P>
<P>
	   "Textbooks are not the only problem or the magic bullet that will solve it,
but it's an important step," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The authors did say that some changes are already under way. Publishers are
commissioning updates in end-of-life content in textbooks in nursing, pediatrics
and psychiatry and in two medical textbooks.
</P>
<P>
	   And, the authors report, national accreditation and licensing organizations
are increasingly requiring a higher standard of competence in end-of-life care.

<HEADLINE> Asian Hipsters: Japan Hot, U.S. Not  </HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM FOREMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Bouncy Japanese pop tunes fill the air with the smell
of traditional Chinese pot-sticker dumplings sizzling in a streetside cart in
Taipei's Hsimenting shopping district.
</P>
<P>
	   The mix of cultures continues on the ground, where Taiwanese teen-agers
cruise the square dressed much like their peers in Tokyo: platform moon boots,
bright pink sweaters, droopy leg-warmer socks and stiff horizontal pigtails that
jut out from their heads.
</P>
<P>
	   Hipsters are wearing the same things in other major Asian capitals, just one
of the many signs that the region that was once crazy about America is in the
tight grip of a Japanese culture invasion. Hello Kitty is cool, Mickey Mouse is
not.
</P>
<P>
	   The growing popularity in recent years of seemingly all things Japanese --
from music and soap operas to noodles and cartoons -- is remarkable considering
many Asians are still bitter about Japan's brutal occupation of much of the
region before the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the history, 13-year-old Kim Tong-ui said his classmates in Seoul,
South Korea, were obsessed with Pokemon trading cards from Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you don't know about Pokemon, no one will talk to you at school,'' Kim
said, browsing at the bustling Techno-Mart shopping center, where several stores
specialize in selling Japanese goods.
</P>
<P>
	   In Taipei, cable TV companies offer at least three channels dedicated to
Japanese news, cooking, soap opera and game show programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Hong Kong teen-ager Pinky Ho said she spends about $25 a week on Japanese
products. ``They're so cute,'' the 17-year-old said, pulling out Japanese
cartoon pens and a pencil case from her made-in-Japan school bag.
</P>
<P>
	   Fights recently broke out at some McDonalds restaurants selling Hello Kitty
dolls in Singapore, famous for its orderly society. Among the thousands that
lined up to buy the white, round-faced Japanese felines was a group of
housewives that began camping out at 4:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   In her busy Taipei ``Spy Man'' boutique, Vi Vi Chen, 21, scrunched up her
nose when she talked about American style and how the Japanese look was better.
</P>
<P>
	   ``American fashion is drab and simple, just jeans and a t-shirt,'' said the
pigtailed Chen, wearing a fuchsia and pink striped sweater, canvas sneakers and
blue jeans cuffed with fake purple leopard fur.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Japanese clothes have more variety in style and shape and the colors are
brighter,'' she said, pointing to a purple, pink and white fuzzy sweater hanging
on her shop's wall.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the vintage clothes on Chen's racks can also be found in trendy
stores in New York, Los Angeles or London -- where the styles may even have
originated.
</P>
<P>
	   Chen wasn't aware of this because, like many Asian youth, she only keeps a
tight focus on Japan, which for years has served as a culture filter for the
region -- sorting through the flow of products from the West and modifying them
to fit Asian tastes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Japan is closer geographically and the culture is more similar, so it's
easier for Asians to accept their products,'' said Winnie Lan, research director
for Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Company in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   Lan said the Japanese also have a knack for making high quality goods that,
like Hello Kitty, are ``cute,'' a quality that's hard to describe but one that
American products often lack.
</P>
<P>
	   The plump little cat appeals to the Asian sensibility, which values
tenderness and innocence, while Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are more outgoing
and independent, like Americans, Lan said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hello Kitty seems to need your care, but Mickey Mouse doesn't. He's fine
without you,'' Lan said.
</P>
<P>
	   A little more than five decades ago, East Asia was the target of a different
Japanese invasion -- a brutal military one. Japan ruled the Korean peninsula
from 1910 to 1945 and occupied Taiwan for 50 years until the end of World War II
in 1945.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Japan's occupation, Koreans and Taiwanese had to speak Japanese and
adopt other forms of their colonizer's culture. Women were forced to work as
sexual slaves, and men were conscripted into the Japanese army.
</P>
<P>
	   But in Taiwan, many have fond memories of their Japanese colonizers, who
they say could be harsh but were efficient and fair, unlike the corrupt
Nationalist government that took over after the war.
</P>
<P>
	   Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui, who attended college in Japan and speaks
fluent Japanese, is an unabashed fan of Taiwan's neighbor to the north. He once
shocked people by saying he felt more Japanese than Chinese while growing up.
</P>
<P>
	   Chou Ching-chun, of the pro-China Patriotic Alliance in Taipei, said Lee has
encouraged a dangerous trend of young Taiwanese turning to Japan instead of
their motherland, China, for cultural inspiration. Chou worries that the youth
are losing touch with their Chinese roots.
</P>
<P>
	   In South Korea, the hatred for Japan has eased over the years, and the
government has even lifted a ban on Japanese comic books, magazines and movies,
said Ji Myong-kwan, a Japanese studies professor at Hanlim University.
</P>
<P>
	   People now identify themselves as consumers and don't let history influence
their shopping, he said. ``One might dislike Japan as a former colonizer but it
doesn't seem to make him dislike Japanese comic books,'' Ji said.
</P>
<P>
	   Computer engineer Kwon Hyong-han, 28, agreed: ``Japanese goods are of high
quality. I think it's counterproductive to drag historical issues into things
that you enjoy in daily life.''

Boeing Union Calls Strike
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co. engineers and technical workers will strike on
Wednesday after last-ditch talks with a federal mediator failed to bring
agreement on a labor contract, a union spokesman said. "They offered nothing"
during the latest negotiations, the spokesman, Bill Dugovich, said late Tuesday.
The strike was to begin at 9 a.m. "Obviously we are disappointed that we were
unable to reach an acceptable solution through the course of mediation in the
past two days," Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said. He said the aerospace giant
plans to maintain operations, but a strike could affect production.

said he was struck "for the first time in probably 24 years to see an election

by striking students. But while courts freed most of the 745 people arrested in
Sunday's raid, the turmoil at the National Autonomous University spilled into
national politics and onto other campuses in the Mexican capital. Students at
other city universities demonstrated in favor of strikers still imprisoned.
Mexico City's leftist mayor, Rosario Robles, appeared in television
advertisements to denounce the federal raid on the 270,000-student school known
by Spanish acronym, UNAM. She demanded freedom for all those arrested.

Bush Wins Delaware Primary

	   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush won Delaware's
presidential primary Tuesday and earned a badly needed boost into a Southern
showdown, even as antagonist John McCain burnished his insurgent candidacy by
finishing second in a state where he did not campaign. A weak third-place finish
by Steve Forbes doomed his candidacy. A senior adviser, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said aides were recommending that the candidate depart the race --
and he was likely to do so. "I think this is a piece of good news that will buoy
our supporters," Bush, the Texas governor, told The Associated Press after
securing the state's 12 delegates.

eBay, Amazon and CNN, all in assaults similar to one that overwhelmed Yahoo! a
day earlier. A fifth prominent Internet company, Buy.Com, also was crippled for
hours earlier Tuesday in a similar attack against its Web site. All the
companies said hackers did not gain access inside their computers or retrieve

Four Escape From Afghan Plane

	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Four men dropped from the cockpit window of a
hijacked plane and ran to safety Tuesday night, fleeing the Afghan aircraft that
has been parked for two days while negotiators seek the release of more than 150
passengers. They were being questioned after receiving medical attention, and
appeared to have suffered no serious injuries, said Joe Edwards, an Essex Police
assistant chief constable. The aims of the hijackers, believed to be Afghans,
remained unclear. Speculation ranged from an elaborate play for political asylum
to a bid to win the release of Ismail Khan, a former regional governor in
Afghanistan.

Kings' largest this season, surpassing a 29-point win over the Golden State

<HEADLINE> Mixed Reviews for Life Under Haider  </HEADLINE>
   By MELISSA EDDY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KLAGENFURT, Austria (AP) -- This could be any of Austria's quaint,
mountain-ringed, picture-post card towns. The sidewalks are swept clean, the
historic buildings freshly painted in pastel blues and greens, the churches
topped with onion-shaped domes.
</P>
<P>
	   This is Joerg Haider country, capital of Carinthia province, whose residents
overwhelmingly elected the controversial far right-wing leader as their governor
last year.
</P>
<P>
	   When Haider's Freedom Party joined the government last week, the rest of the
European Union's members froze bilateral diplomatic relations. Many folks here
cannot understand what the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Europe is overreacting. We're not a bunch of Nazis here and neither is
Haider,'' said Monika Bauer, 31, a shopkeeper in one of downtown Klagenfurt's
chic clothing boutiques. ``Look around. Does this look like a place where bad
things are happening?''
</P>
<P>
	   Admittedly, it doesn't. Klagenfurt isn't Baghdad or Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
	   Well-dressed women in fur coats pass by on bicycles equipped with baskets.
Groups of teenagers wait dutifully at the streetcorner for the light to turn
green. A young man helps an older woman pick up scattered groceries that have
fallen from her basket.
</P>
<P>
	   But Carinthia is traditionally one of Austria's most conservative provinces.
A plaque in downtown Klagenfurt honors ``those who fell defending their homeland
and freedom to protect tradition'' during both World Wars.
</P>
<P>
	   Eighty years after a British-supervised referendum established the border
with what is now Slovenia, Carinthian school children still learn a patriotic
song whose lyrics talk of the land ``where the border was written in blood.''
</P>
<P>
	   Over the weekend, Nazi symbols appeared on the walls of the middle school.
Police dismissed the graffiti as the work of kids with no political motives.
</P>
<P>
	   But Ranazan Tuerkan, 43, a Turkish immigrant who runs a kebab stand
downtown, isn't surprised. He thinks the worst is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Under Haider, things have gotten worse,'' for immigrants, Tuerkan said.
``People have become more intolerant.''
</P>
<P>
	   Two blocks down the cobblestone street, another member of Klagenfurt's small
Turkish minority disagrees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think the situation has changed at all'' since Haider came to
power, said Murat Ovacikli, 23.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps not yet. But with the eyes of the Europe and the world now focused
on Haider's every move, many in Klagenfurt are starting to worry.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, family members of the late Austrian author Ingeborg Bachman
banned the use of her name for one of the best known literary prizes in the
German-speaking world. The prize had been awarded annually in Klagenfurt to
promising German-language writers.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of Bachman's relatives said the ban would hold until ``we feel that the
political policy of this country is no longer shameful.'' Last year, the prize
was awarded although Haider was already governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider responded by telling reporters Tuesday the province had already
decided in early January it no longer wanted to participate in the prize.
</P>
<P>
	   Janko Messner, a poet from Carinthia's Slovene-speaking minority who has
been monitoring Haider for 20 years, fears the situation will get worse because
those who didn't vote for him are not willing to fight him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People here aren't willing to fight any more, because this isn't an
economic crisis,'' he said. ``This is a moral crisis. A little bit of resistance
won't be enough'' to change anything.
</P>
<P>
	   Melitta Trunk, who heads the local offices of the center-left Social
Democratic Party, believes people are too fascinated with Haider to see what she
calls his ``dangerous lust for power.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Because it serves his purpose of power, Haider is holding all of Carinthia
hostage, making us into a Haider Land -- even a Nazi Land,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Bill To Shed Befast Powers Backed  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- The House of Commons overwhelmingly backed an emergency bill
allowing the British government to remove the powers of Northern Ireland's
fledgling administration this week in an effort to save it from collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   The 352-11 House of Commons vote came Tuesday after Britain's Northern
Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson warned that members had no choice following
the Irish Republican Army's refusal to disarm in support of the province's 1998
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   In a last formal step before the bill passed to the upper House of Lords --
a ceremonial final ``reading'' passed with a vote of 326 to seven.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson, who transferred considerable responsibilities to the Belfast
administration two months ago, said in these circumstances it was clear that it
``will simply fall apart'' if powers were not immediately taken back.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ulster Unionists, the major Protestant party within the power-sharing
Cabinet, had agreed to form the four-party coalition -- which includes the
IRA-linked Sinn Fein -- only on condition that IRA disarmament would commence in
response.
</P>
<P>
	   A disarmament commission's report last week said the IRA had made no
concrete commitments, triggering the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   As Martin McGuinness, a former IRA commander who is now Sinn Fein's minister
for education in the Cabinet, looked on from the visitors' gallery, Mandelson
said those arguing for the power-sharing Cabinet to continue were offering ``a
false choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   The reality, he said, was ``between pause and bust.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``A pause in the operation of the institutions, far from seeing them lying
in collapse, will preserve the institutions and allow them to be revived at a
later date,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill is expected to become law Thursday, after passage through the House
of Lords. Mandelson said he intended to resume ``direct rule'' from London on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams directly appealed to Prime Minister Tony Blair
not to suspend the administration's powers, saying it would render any start to
IRA disarmament impossible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Good Friday agreement is under the greatest threat so far since it
came into existence,'' Adams said, accusing the British government of backing
``a unilateral deadline'' sought by the Ulster Unionists.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, in a radio interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. in Belfast,
Adams claimed to have done all he could to win an IRA commitment to disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   But others blamed Sinn Fein for not delivering on its end of a bargain
struck in November.
</P>
<P>
	   In exchange for the Ulster Unionists' accepting Sinn Fein as Cabinet
colleagues, Sinn Fein declared for the first time that disarmament was
``essential,'' and the IRA opened negotiations with the province's 3-year-old
disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
	   The Good Friday accord proposed that the IRA should completely disarm by
May, but specified no starting point. The IRA has never accepted that goal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ulster Unionists plan to ballot grassroots members Saturday on whether
to remain in the Cabinet. If they call for withdrawal, forming a new Cabinet
would prove extremely difficult because it would require a new election in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   Given the rising Protestant hostility to cooperating with Sinn Fein, the
Ulster Unionists would probably suffer losses.

<HEADLINE> Weiss Is Champion in Underdog Role  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Michael Weiss heard the rumors saying his injured left ankle
hasn't fully healed and that he wouldn't be able to defend his national title.
</P>
<P>
	Well, guess who arrived fashionably late at the U.S. Figure Skating
Championships? And not limping at all.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not,'' Weiss cracked Tuesday night when asked about reports he might not
be coming.
</P>
<P>
	Weiss might have been poking fun at the hoopla surrounding his appearance. But
truth be told, with much of the focus of this year's championships on hometown
favorite Timothy Goebel and his quadruple aerial show, Weiss has become somewhat
of an underdog.
</P>
<P>
	``I think unproven is probably a good word,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	Bothered by a stress fracture in his ankle since last summer, Weiss followed a
fourth-place finish at October's Skate America by finishing fifth in November at
the Trophee Lalique in Paris.
</P>
<P>
	He said the injury affected some of his simplest jumps, and only in the last
two months has the ankle responded to therapy and started to feel better.
</P>
<P>
	Because of the injury, Weiss said speculation about his ability to win here is
understandable.
</P>
<P>
	``I did have a rough start to the season because of my injury, and any time
somebody is injured it's hard to analyze whether they're in good shape or
they're going to be a contender or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	Weiss stayed completely off the ankle for a few weeks and has since been
undergoing extensive physical therapy. He's taking a medication aimed at
improving his bone density and is using a stimulator 10 hours per day.
</P>
<P>
	``It's healed beautifully,'' he said. ``I feel great right now. I'm back to
normal strength and I've prepared incredibly for this. It feels real good right
now. I'm psyched.''
</P>
<P>
	If he's so pumped, where has he been?
</P>
<P>
	``I always come in on Tuesday,'' he said. ``I like to train at home and get
that extra time in. I feel comfortable doing that. Anyway, if people were
talking about me before I got here, then that's good news, too.''
</P>
<P>
	Weiss, who placed third at the world championships last year, will begin
defense of his title on Thursday night when the men skate their short programs.
He is expected to be challenged by Goebel and Trifun Zivanovic, who placed
second last year.
</P>
<P>
	``But it's the national championships,'' Weiss said. ``Anything can happen. Any
time you come to a national championship, you're expected to be pushed to your
max in order to win. Even if you're the favorite.''
</P>
<P>
	This year, the favorite might not be the defending champion. Goebel has been
getting the bulk of the publicity, primarily because of his Cleveland connection
and his extraordinary jumping ability.
</P>
<P>
	The quad has become figure skating's equivalent to basketball's slam dunk. It's
trendy, the fans love it, but it doesn't guarantee victory.
</P>
<P>
	Weiss has mixed feelings about what the four-revolution jump is doing to the
sport.
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of people are stressing this as being extremely important and
necessary, and it is if you want to win that specific event,'' he said. ``But I
think in the long run, the judges haven't put the emphasis on it like the rest
of the world has -- yet.
</P>
<P>
	``They may do that. But right now, we just have to do the things that impress
those people. That's who puts us in our spot.''
</P>
<P>
	Weiss isn't worried about Goebel having any kind of home-ice advantage. He's
expecting more than 60 family members, including his two small children, to be
in Gund Arena when he skates.
</P>
<P>
	He wouldn't admit it, but Weiss seems to be relishing this underdog role.
</P>
<P>
	``I feel real confident in my ankle, and real confident in my skating right
now,'' he said. ``I can honestly say that I haven't felt better than I have in
the last couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
	Now, that sounds like a champion.

<HEADLINE> Griffey Talks May Have Broke Rules  </HEADLINE>
    By JOE KAY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners wanted to get a deal done for Ken
Griffey Jr. Instead, they might get an investigation from major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mariners gave Griffey's agent permission to talk to the Cincinnati Reds
on Tuesday, hoping to satisfy the small market club's financial concerns and
remove the major obstacle to a trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of breaking the impasse, the move might have broken baseball's rules
prohibiting teams from talking to players under contract with another club.
</P>
<P>
	   Such discussions can only take place if the teams agree on a trade, then ask
the commissioner's office for a 72-hour window for the acquiring team to
negotiate a new contract with the player. Baseball said Tuesday it has not given
permission for such talks involving Griffey.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If that, indeed, did happen, then we're going to have to investigate it,''
baseball spokesman Rich Levin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Baseball said it was stepping up enforcement of the rule, which was violated
in the Roger Clemens trade from Toronto to the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Griffey talks snagged and spring training approaching, Mariners
president Chuck Armstrong told agent Brian Golberg he could talk to the Reds
about their concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Chuck Armstrong was nice enough to give me permission to generally speak
to the Reds to try to bring some closure to Junior's situation prior to spring
training,'' Goldberg said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Commissioner Bud Selig, Armstrong and the two general managers involved --
Seattle's Pat Gillick and Cincinnati's Jim Bowden -- did not return telephone
calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Griffey will make $8.25 million this season, then would be eligible for free
agency. The Reds don't want to increase their payroll substantially for 2000 --
it's already up $7 million from last season to approximately $40 million.
</P>
<P>
	   They're also afraid they won't be able to afford him beyond this season
because they won't move into a revenue-producing new ballpark until at least
2003.
</P>
<P>
	   Griffey turned down a $148 million, eight-year offer from the Mariners and
told them he would like to play for a team closer to his home in Orlando, Fla.
In December, Griffey said he would accept a trade only to Cincinnati, the city
where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is where he really wants to play, and he would take considerably less
dollars than what he's already been offered by the Mariners,'' Goldberg told The
Cincinnati Post earlier Tuesday. ``He would also be very liberal in the
distribution of it and would consider signing a long-term deal immediately.''
</P>
<P>
	   Griffey has emphasized that he doesn't want to play in Seattle this season,
in part because he received a death threat in the mail last November.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariners pitchers and catchers report for spring training Feb. 17 in Peoria,
Ariz. If there's a trade, Griffey would like to have it done before then.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldberg said Griffey is willing to try to work out a financial arrangement
that's acceptable to the Reds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Kenny does not have a need to be the highest-paid player at the moment,''
Goldberg said. ``He wants to play here very badly and would go to great lengths
to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
	   The question is whether it can work financially.
</P>
<P>
	   The Reds will lose 14,000 seats at Cinergy Field after the season, when part
of left field will be torn down to make room for the new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
	   The Reds also will be under greater financial pressure the next two years as
the young nucleus of the team that won 96 games last season gains experience and
bigger salaries.
</P>
<P>
	   They've already seen the start of it. Second baseman Pokey Reese agreed to a
one-year contract for 2000 that included a sevenfold salary increase, from
$270,000 to $1.95 million.

<HEADLINE> Blackbird Poisoning Program Expands  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Federal wildlife officials are expanding a
controversial blackbird poisoning program this spring to try to kill up to 2
million of the birds that feast on farmers' sunflower crops.
</P>
<P>
	   The spring poisoning program has been used in South Dakota since 1994. It
will be used in both South Dakota and North Dakota this year, said George Linz,
project leader for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services office
in Bismarck.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're trying to target the female red wing blackbird, trying to slow down
their reproduction," he said. "We only have about four weeks to do it as the
birds are heading north to their breeding grounds."
</P>
<P>
	   The program involves poisoning rice kernels with the chemical DRC-1339 and
leaving the bait in plots for the birds to eat. The chemical kills blackbirds
within three days of ingestion by causing irreversible kidney and heart damage.
</P>
<P>
	   Questions remain about what effect the poison has on non-target species such
as mourning doves and sparrows.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Johnson, an environmental contaminant specialist with the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service in Bismarck, said research indicates non-target birds that
are around in the spring are attracted to the baiting areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Research also has shown that in the fall, the non-target birds are coming
into the baiting areas and eating the poisoned rice, Johnson said. The effect of
the laced bait on those birds is not known, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are not in a position to support the program because there are
definitely questions that we need to have answered," Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
	   The poisoning has had limited success in the fall in North Dakota, where it
was done on an experimental basis the past two years. Last year, only about
20,000 birds were killed, Linz said.
</P>
<P>
	   But about 750,000 blackbirds were killed in South Dakota during the spring
program.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's really the spring baiting program we think has long-term viability,"
Linz said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the fall, it is tough to get the birds off the sunflower heads and onto
the ground where the laced rice is, and the bait breaks down easily in wet
conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the spring, food is in shorter supply for the blackbirds so they are more
likely to be attracted to the bait, he said. There also are fewer non-target
species around, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Will Bleier, chairman of the zoology department at North Dakota State
University, said some birds that eat the poisoned rice have higher tolerances to
the chemical than do blackbirds.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't deny that there is a possibility that an occasional non-target may
die from (the poison), but we certainly haven't recorded it," said Bleier, who
has been involved with some of the research on the poison. "I don't see any red
flags, yet."
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Olson, a program manager with the North Dakota Department of
Agriculture, said the blackbird program has been limited to brown rice, which
"is not a first food choice for a lot of the non-targets."
</P>
<P>
	   Blackbirds cause an estimated $5 million to $10 million in damage to North
Dakota sunflower crops each year, according to the state agriculture department.

<HEADLINE> Rocker Suspension Reversal Sought  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- John Rocker is back in the city he hates, trying to
overturn his suspension for offensive comments against homosexuals, minorities
and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
	   Baseball commissioner Bud Selig has banned Rocker until May 1, saying the
Atlanta Braves' top reliever ``offended practically every element of society''
with his comments in a December issue of Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
	   The players association quickly appealed the decision, setting up today's
hearing in New York before Shyam Das, baseball's new arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Just be patient,'' is all Rocker would say Tuesday outside the union's
office in midtown Manhattan, far from Shea and Yankee stadiums, where taunting
fans aggravated him so much last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Das was to hear testimony from Selig and Braves president Stan Kasten. Gene
Orza, the union's chief lawyer, will argue on Rocker's behalf, and union head
Donald Fehr is expected to testify on past suspensions.
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker planned to attend the hearing, but it's unclear if he would be asked
to testify. He told Sports Illustrated in December that he would never play for
a New York team because he didn't want to ride a subway train ``next to some
queer with AIDS.'' He also mocked foreigners and called a black teammate a ``fat
monkey.''
</P>
<P>
	   Time and time again, the players association has convinced arbitrators to
reduce or overturn suspensions imposed by baseball.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1981, St. Louis shortstop Garry Templeton was suspended and fined $5,000
after making a series of obscene gestures toward heckling fans at Busch Stadium.
Two days later, an arbitrator ruled the suspension should be lifted when
Templeton checked into a hospital for treatment of depression.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1992, Yankees pitcher Steve Howe was suspended for life after pleading
guilty to attempting to buy a gram of cocaine. An arbitrator ended the
suspension later that year, saying Howe had attention deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
	   Minus Rocker, the Braves are holding a prespring training pitching camp at
Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerry Ligtenberg, who held the closer's job in 1998 and is trying to come
back from an elbow injury that kept him out all of last season, hopes the Rocker
situation will be settled quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a big distraction for the team,'' Ligtenberg said Tuesday. ``We need
to get this resolved sooner rather than later. If we push it to the side and
bring it up two months later, it's not going to be any better. We need to deal
with John as a team and go from there.''
</P>
<P>
	   For now, the Braves are facing the possibility of heading to Florida next
week without the pitcher who saved 38 games last season, one short of the
franchise record.
</P>
<P>
	   Selig's suspension covers all 45 days of spring training and the first 28
days of the season. He also fined Rocker $20,000 and ordered him to undergo
sensitivity training.
</P>
<P>
	   There's no indication how quickly the arbitrator might rule, but the union
will likely ask for a decision by the start of spring training. The Braves'
pitchers and catchers report to camp at Kissimmee, Fla., on Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Moss, the association's top lawyer for 11 years, predicted last week
that Rocker's punishment is likely to be reduced.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the commissioner's office to just do something without consulting the
players association, without consulting Rocker and without reaching agreement on
what was acceptable to everybody was kind of stupid,'' Moss said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to research by the players association and the commissioner's
office, this is the first time a player was disciplined for speech since 1938.
New York Yankees outfielder Jake Powell was suspended for 10 days by
commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis for disparaging blacks on a radio
interview.

<HEADLINE> NFL Star Derrick Thomas Dies  </HEADLINE>
    By MARK LONG AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Nearly 12 hours after Derrick Thomas died, his family and
friends remained at Jackson Memorial Hospital, consoling one another and sharing
their memories of the nine-time Pro Bowl linebacker.
</P>
<P>
	   They congregated on the third floor of the rehabilitation center, the place
where Thomas was recovering from a paralyzing car crash last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Coaches, teammates and childhood buddies sat alongside Thomas' relatives,
all of them still shocked by his sudden death Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas probably died from a massive blood clot, doctors said. He was 33.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're all in a situation at this juncture where I don't think any of us can
appreciate the personal loss," former Kansas City Chiefs coach Marty
Schottenheimer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas was being transferred from his hospital bed to a wheelchair on his
way to therapy Tuesday morning when he uttered something to his mother and his
eyes rolled back, said Dr. Frank Eismont, a neurosurgeon at Jackson Memorial
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chiefs linebacker, who held the NFL record of seven sacks in a game,
went into cardio-respiratory arrest, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors have not determined an exact cause of death, and an autopsy might be
performed today.
</P>
<P>
	   Blood clots are more common in people with paralysis, Eismont said, and
Thomas was on medication to prevent clotting.
</P>
<P>
	   "His family is devastated. We all are," said Spencer Hammond, who played
alongside Thomas at Alabama and spent much of Tuesday with Thomas' family. "It's
very upsetting."
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas' death surprised everyone, mainly because of the progress he had made
in just a short time since his injury.
</P>
<P>
	   "Derrick was an extraordinary person and was breaking all the records while
he was here," Dr. Barth Green said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas was driving a car during a snowstorm on Jan. 23 as he and two friends
headed to the Kansas City airport to fly to St. Louis for the NFC championship
game. He lost control of the car, and it overturned at least three times, police
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said Thomas was speeding and weaving in traffic, but no charges were
filed.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas and passenger Michael Tellis, 49, were not wearing seat belts and
were thrown from the car. Tellis was killed and Thomas' spine and neck were
broken. The third person in the car, who was wearing his seat belt, sustained
only minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas was brought to the hospital in Miami, his hometown, where he remained
paralyzed from the chest down after having surgery to repair his spinal column.
Doctors had hoped he would walk again.
</P>
<P>
	   Others were certain.
</P>
<P>
	   "He would have won the battle, there's no doubt in my mind," Schottenheimer
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson Memorial is the home of the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, the
world's largest spinal cord injury research center, and its surgeons have
operated on injured athletes before, including race car driver Emerson
Fittipaldi.
</P>
<P>
	   An All-American at Alabama, the 6-foot-3, 255-pound Thomas became an
immediate star as a pass-rushing specialist after being taken in the first round
of the 1989 draft. He was an All-Pro in his first nine seasons and ranked ninth
on the career list with 126.5 career sacks.
</P>
<P>
	   With one of the quickest first moves of any defender in the league, Thomas
became known for his "sack and strip" move, where he closed fast on a
quarterback's blind side and hacked at his arm to knock the ball out of his
hand.
</P>
<P>
	   He set the single-game sack record in 1990 in a game against Seattle. That
game was the same week as Veterans Day, and Thomas dedicated his performance to
his father, an Air Force pilot killed in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas is survived by his mother, Edith Morgan; his son, Derrick Thomas Jr.,
8; and a half-brother, Gregory Morgan, 19.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll always remember two things: the ever-present smile and the great sense
of pride that was a part of everything he was involved in," Schottenheimer said.

<HEADLINE> Poor Nations Re-Exam Trade Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID THURBER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- For decades, poor countries have felt excluded
from the closed-door meetings that set the direction for the world's trade
agreements.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, most accepted the pacts, believing that free trade would help
them develop and eventually join the ranks of the rich.
</P>
<P>
	   But with global poverty and income gaps worsening, a growing number of
developing countries and activist groups are re-examining the agreements and
saying they are no longer willing to be excluded from discussions during which
global economic policies are set.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those who are affected need to have a voice, and so far their voice isn't
being heard," said Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon.
</P>
<P>
	   Third World governments and activist groups hope their voices will be heard
at a meeting of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development starting Saturday
in Bangkok, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike last December's failed World Trade Organization talks in Seattle,
which tried to push a new binding free-trade agreement, UNCTAD is a talk shop
dominated largely by developing countries and focused on how trade can help poor
nations grow.
</P>
<P>
	   The 135-nation WTO is widely perceived to be controlled by rich countries.
Some African countries were so upset in December by being excluded from some
negotiating sessions in Seattle that they threatened to walk out.
</P>
<P>
	   "The process was undemocratic," says Martin Khor, director of the Third
World Network, a Malaysia-based advocacy group. "Most of the key meetings took
place in secret, with only 10 to 20 mostly rich countries attending. That left a
very bitter taste for the developing countries."
</P>
<P>
	   Delegates from poorer countries were angered by President Clinton's comment
before the WTO meetings that trade sanctions should be imposed against countries
that violate basic labor standards.
</P>
<P>
	   Poor nations saw that as an attack on one of their few economic advantages
-- lower wages -- and pandering by Clinton to an important domestic lobby, U.S.
trade unions.
</P>
<P>
	   Behind the growing Third World disenchantment over free-trade talks are
signs that many of the poorest countries are being left behind by the tide of
economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
	   A year ago, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned that globalization
might not benefit all countries, lifting the "yachts" while capsizing many
"canoes."
</P>
<P>
	   A draft report prepared for the UNCTAD meeting concludes that Annan was
right.
</P>
<P>
	   "The income gap between the developed and the developing countries has grown
wider," it says. Many developing countries "have been unable to benefit from the
globalization process."
</P>
<P>
	   Even worse, it says, income inequality has risen within developing countries
while job security has fallen.
</P>
<P>
	   Third World groups say that's because rich countries have pushed trade
agreements through the WTO that favor their own industries.
</P>
<P>
	   The UNCTAD report says many of the WTO tariff reductions favor
industrialized countries, while a "significant" number of goods produced by
developing countries remain blocked by high tariffs.
</P>
<P>
	   Thailand symbolizes other misgivings by developing countries about
globalization.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the flash point of Asia's recent financial crisis, which has been
blamed in part on overly hasty liberalization and massive, uncontrolled flows of
capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the crisis, Asian countries have been hesitant to put their ravaged
economies at the mercy of another binding world trade agreement. Many also fear
that opening up their markets too rapidly will hurt their already suffering
farmers and small businessmen.
</P>
<P>
	   In Bangkok last weekend, Thai farmers' groups said the concept of free trade
is a figment of the imagination and if anyone benefits, it is big agribusiness,
not poor and small farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   Khor said he hopes UNCTAD will become a forum in which Third World countries
can rally together to create a world trading system that gives developing
countries a greater chance.
</P>
<P>
	   But rich countries aren't eager to grant an enhanced status to UNCTAD, which
hopes it can smooth out some of the differences raised at Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite calls from Thailand for high-level representation at the meetings,
most Western nations will be sending junior-level officials. The U.S. delegation
will be led by Harriet C. Babbitt, deputy administrator of the Agency for
International Development.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have a hope that the rich countries will listen, but only a little one,"
Khor says. "Our suspicion and fear is that they want to continue to marginalize
UNCTAD in favor of the WTO, which they now dominate."

<HEADLINE> Khmer Rouge Tribunal Plans Laid Out  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan has laid out for
Cambodia's leader the issues that the United Nations wants addressed in
negotiations to create a tribunal to prosecute Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen's response to the letter Annan sent Tuesday
will determine whether the U.N. head sends a team to Cambodia for any further
discussion, Hans Corell told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Corell refused to detail the contents of Annan's letter except to say that
the main areas of contention concern the composition of the court and powers
granted to judges and prosecutors. He said the letter set out principle issues
to guide further talks.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations and Cambodia have been negotiating for months to create a
tribunal to prosecute the remaining leaders of the Khmer Rouge, blamed for the
deaths of 1.7 million Cambodians during their reign of terror in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cambodian government plan before parliament calls for U.N. involvement
-- critical to gaining international legitimacy for the court -- but ensures
that the trials would be controlled by Cambodia's politicized and underdeveloped
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations has so far balked at approving the plan, which is in the
form of a draft national law. U.N. legal experts have demanded an international
co-prosecutor be able to make indictments independently of a Cambodian
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
	   Corell said he was briefing reporters to put on record the developments that
have emerged to date -- and to counter accusations that the United Nations had
been slow to respond to Cambodia's request for U.N. help.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan's letter sets out the U.N. position to the latest version of the draft
law, which was received Jan. 18. Since then, the United Nations has heard
comment from several member states and human rights organizations, who all
stressed that ``international standards should be met when ultimately the draft
is approved,'' Corell said.
</P>
<P>
	   Corell said the United Nations was committed to finding a solution, but
added there were still ``quite a few questions that need to be answered before
the arrangement can take effect.''
</P>
<P>
	   In particular, Corell indicated the United Nations was seeking to focus now
on reaching a basic international agreement between Cambodia and the
organization while specific negotiations on the draft national law continue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The focus has been on -- until now -- a draft law,'' Corell said. ``And
surely such a law would have to be adopted at the national level in Cambodia.
However, when the United Nations enters into a commitment with a member state,
this would have to be through an international agreement.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said it wasn't yet known whether Annan and Hun Sen would discuss tribunal
plans on the sidelines of a U.N. Conference on Trade and Development meeting in
Thailand, which both are attending.

<HEADLINE> String of U.S. Security Lapses  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For security experts, it was a shocking revelation: As
CIA director, John Deutch had stored highly secret government documents on an
unsecured home computer that was connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet the Deutch story is just the latest in a string of serious U.S. security
lapses and breaches.
</P>
<P>
	   This is creating alarm -- and demands for inquiries -- among congressional
and presidential overseers of the intelligence community.
</P>
<P>
	   First there were the reports about lax controls over technology exports to
China, followed by the alleged mishandling of nuclear secrets at the Los Alamos
nuclear weapons lab -- and the resultant indictment of a former scientist for
improper computer behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   Then a listening device was found in December at the State Department in a
seventh-floor conference room. A Russian who had been parked in his car outside
the department monitoring the transmissions was expelled from the country.
</P>
<P>
	   An internal inspector's general report found that the State Department had
allowed visitors, contractors and maintenance workers to roam its building
unescorted. This was followed by reports that a Pentagon review board had
granted security clearances to employees of defense contractors with criminal
convictions, histories of financial problems and drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally, it was disclosed last week that Deutch, who was CIA director from
May 1995 to December 1996, still held Pentagon security clearances. He had been
stripped of his CIA clearances last summer after it was discovered he had
classified documents on his home computer, in violation of security protocols.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch on Tuesday asked for the Pentagon clearances to be withdrawn in the
face of likely having them revoked.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee,
cites a ``rising concern about these persistent breaks in security as far as our
national secrets are concerned.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., announced Tuesday that he was widening his
committee's investigation of the Deutch affair to focus on whether there was a
``cover-up'' by the current CIA director, George Tenet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're just beginning to get into this,'' Shelby said, suggesting the CIA's
own internal review of the matter showed that Deutch was ``treated with kid's
gloves'' in the investigation into his computer behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby, Allard and other committee members said Tenet and other high-ranking
CIA officials should have come forward much sooner to take action against
Deutch.
</P>
<P>
	   Not to be outmaneuvered, the CIA announced late Tuesday it had requested its
own new investigation into the matter, by a presidentially appointed panel that
oversees the intelligence community.
</P>
<P>
	   The chairman of the Agency Accountability Board, former Sen. Warren Rudman,
R-N.H., agreed to look into the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Porter J. Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee,
contends there's a thread running through all of these security lapses, and
others. It's what he calls ``a culture of disdain about security'' that he
claims has marked the Clinton administration from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know that does sound partisan, but it's a factual observation,'' said
Goss, who worked for 10 years in the CIA's clandestine services.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know whether Mr. Deutch's problems are part of that culture,''
Goss said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he has no intentions of looking into this ``disdain for security.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we did, that's all we'd do for the year.''
</P>
<P>
	   There is no shortage of investigations.
</P>
<P>
	   The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on international
operations, Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., plans to investigate security breaches at
the State Department. He will hold hearings after the department conducts its
own review.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
said he will hold hearings into the Pentagon's troubled security-clearance
program. And Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, has asked the Pentagon to conduct an
internal review, saying ``these security lapses are especially disturbing given
the nature of information handled by the Pentagon.''
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen told the Senate Armed Services Committee on
Tuesday that the security-clearance program ``remains a serious problem, but I
think we now have a handle on it.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Wins Delaware Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Campaigning toward a collision in South Carolina, Gov. George W. Bush said
his 2-to-1 victory in Delaware's GOP presidential primary will buoy his
supporters while Sen. John McCain claimed he'll get a boost for finishing second
in a state he bypassed. Steve Forbes was the third man out.
</P>
<P>
	   For Bush and McCain, the next crucial battleground in an escalating
Republican campaign is South Carolina, where they will campaign virtually
nonstop until the GOP primary there Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   Each man questioned whether the other can be trusted Tuesday and accused the
other of negative attacks. Bush took the offensive after McCain trounced him in
the leadoff New Hampshire primary, gaining headway that showed in narrowing
margins for the front-runner in the states ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   In voting Tuesday in Delaware, with 100 percent of the precincts reporting,
Bush won 15,102 votes or 51 percent; McCain 7,547 votes or 25 percent; and
Forbes 5,857 votes or 20 percent. Alan Keyes finished fourth, with 1,138 votes
or 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My message is a message the people heard,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain called his share of the vote remarkable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We never even went there,'' he said. ``We didn't spend a penny there.'' He
said it was ``bound to give us a boost,'' but noted that he still has a long way
to go. ``I'm still the underdog,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said the victory ``will buoy our supporters.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's important for me to show you that not only can I take a punch, but I
can come back and win,'' Bush said Tuesday night in Columbia, S.C. ``And that's
exactly what I intend to do here in the state of South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also said sardonically that he was confident he'd now be on the cover of
the three major news magazines, a dig at the play they gave McCain after he won
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Mike Castle, a former Delaware governor, said Bush's margin should
quiet doubts raised by his loss in New Hampshire. ``The potholes are all gone
now,'' Castle said at a victory rally in Wilmington. ``It's going to send us
into South Carolina with a little momentum that we really wanted,'' said Bush's
sister, Doro Koch, of Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
	   The clear signal from Delaware was that the race has become a two-man
contest, with Forbes hobbled by three defeats and embarrassed by trailing McCain
in Delaware after campaigning hard in the state. Forbes won Delaware four years
ago with 33 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Republicans who said they'd voted for Forbes in 1996, only half were
with him this time. Campaign manager Bill Dal Col said Forbes will go on ``and
assess the situation as things move forward.'' A senior Forbes adviser, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said aides were recommending that the candidate
depart the race -- and he was likely to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes had said in advance that the impact of losing on his campaign would
depend on what percentage of the vote he got, and the order of finish. Both went
against him.
</P>
<P>
	   A survey of Delaware voters leaving their polling places showed that Bush
was strong on the question of electability -- and also among Republicans who
rated moral values their top issue. McCain had scored in New Hampshire on the
latter point.
</P>
<P>
	   About half of McCain's voters said they'd made their decision in the last
week, since his victory in the first primary in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   The exit polling was conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of The
Associated Press and ABC, NBC, CBS and CNN.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Tuesday, Bush and McCain traded shots, in campaign ads, about who
could be trusted. The two rivals recently shook hands and agreed not to use
negative ads -- then used them.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the Texas governor, in his ad against McCain, says the senator
``promised a clean campaign, then attacked Governor Bush with misleading ads.''
The spot notes McCain's passion for campaign finance reform, then says he
``solicits money from lobbyists with interests before his committee and
pressures agencies on behalf of contributors.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's commercial alleges that the Bush camp ``twists the truth like
(President) Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said McCain's ad ``demeans the process.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said he'd quit it if Bush would. Bush said he would not.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the old game of switch and bait,'' he said of McCain's offer. ``It's
a game of say one thing, do another.''

<HEADLINE> Bush a Reformer? So He Says  </HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN WOODWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush has been known more for massaging the
powers that be to his own ends than for wrestling them to the ground. But the
governor says he's been a reformer all along and has the record to prove it.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's description of himself as the true ``reformer with results'' in the
Republican presidential contest is the latest tack he's taken against Sen. John
McCain, a man who thought he was alone on a mission to upend the status quo.
</P>
<P>
	   With his emphasis on ``results,'' Bush is obliquely calling attention to the
fact that McCain does not always achieve what he preaches, most notably campaign
finance reform. But Bush's record as a reformer is mixed too.
</P>
<P>
	   As evidence of his reformist bent, his campaign is pointing to welfare
limits enacted in Texas -- but actually required by federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign is also underscoring steps taken to limit awards in lawsuits,
establish local control of schools and crack down on juvenile crime, all
measures at the core of Republican orthodoxy if not bipartisan consensus.
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast, McCain has tried to change the system of political money in
ways that unnerve his party and even his national co-chairman, Nebraska Sen.
Chuck Hagel, who made speeches against the McCain-Feingold campaign finance
legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also has alienated Republicans and Democrats alike in Washington by
speaking against the pork attached to spending bills, and he's stood against the
tobacco interests that have given money to Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   A look at the record:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Bush opposes McCain's effort to eliminate soft money, the large,
unregulated political contributions that the senator says are poison to
politics. But the governor is reminding voters that McCain has taken money from
lobbyists with business pending before the Senate Commerce Committee that he
chairs.
</P>
<P>
	   Given Bush's reluctance to overhaul campaign financing, it's not easy for
him to convince people he's a reformer, says Wayne Fields, a professor at
Washington University in St. Louis who studies rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's another sort of sound bite that can only be tested a little ways
before its inadequacy becomes apparent,'' he said. ``Is this really reform? Are
these really results? I think he's sitting on a very, very, fine line on which
he could tumble off.''
</P>
<P>
	   When two think-tanks invited close associates of Bush to Washington last
month to chew over his record and style, much praise was offered. ``He's
comfortable bringing people together,'' said Michigan Gov. John Engler. ``He's
willing to assimilate these different ideas.''
</P>
<P>
	   But, reformer? No one characterized him that way.
</P>
<P>
	   A subtext of Bush's claim to be a reformer with results is that McCain has
not achieved what he has preached. The Bush campaign ticked off progress in
Texas on education, civil litigation, taxes, health care and more to make that
contrast.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush ``reformed welfare by taking on the status quo,'' his campaign says,
noting that Texas passed time limits and work requirements for welfare
recipients. The campaign also noted that Texas received a $16 million ``bonus
award from the federal government for being in the top 10 of states moving
people from welfare to work.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before President Clinton signed the bill in 1996 that established a time
limit on welfare and created work requirements, 43 states already had started to
enact welfare restrictions.
</P>
<P>
	   As for the award, Texas was one of 28 states that got federal bonuses in
December. Texas was ninth among states where welfare recipients got jobs. But it
did not make the top 10 in the three other categories judged by Washington,
including states that performed best in helping people keep those jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Bush ``reformed education by taking on the entrenched education
bureaucracy and teacher unions,'' his Web site also says.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor has achieved a statewide accountability system for schools and
seen progress on test scores. He's been unable to win support for
taxpayer-financed vouchers to help some parents send children to private
schools.

<HEADLINE> Defense Minister Death Stuns Public  </HEADLINE>
   By KATARINA KRATOVAC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Opponents of President Slobodan Milosevic
warned that the slaying of the defense minister in the country's latest
gangland-style shooting heralds an era of total anarchy.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Minister Pavle Bulatovic, a Milosevic ally from the smaller Yugoslav
republic of Montenegro, was gunned down Monday evening at a Belgrade restaurant.
Two of his companions were wounded when an unknown assailant opened machine-gun
fire from a back window.
</P>
<P>
	   The assassination of the highest-ranking official to date is proof of
forthcoming ``total anarchy and a roadsign to despair,'' warned the
Demo-Christian party, a member of the largest opposition alliance, on Tuesday.
Opposition parties called for senior officials to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   The killing struck at the highest echelon of power here and shocked a public
already reeling from last year's defeat in Kosovo and a decade of bloodshed and
suffering.
</P>
<P>
	   Milosevic's government was swift to pledge an all-out campaign to root out
``terrorism.'' His allies in the Communist Yugoslav Left party saw an alleged
``United States terrorist threat'' in connection with the slaying, while the
ruling Socialists echoed the official line that Bulatovic's assassination was a
``classical terrorist act.''
</P>
<P>
	   The ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party blamed American, French or
British intelligence agents for the murder.
</P>
<P>
	   In Madrid, U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering said Yugoslavia
appears headed for a ``sort of long-knives confrontation'' among the nation's
elite brought about by discontent, instability and lack of control in this
turbulent country.
</P>
<P>
	   Bulatovic joined more than a dozen prominent figures assassinated in the
past decade of Milosevic's rule, including politicians, journalists, police and
underworld figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Serbia's most notorious paramilitary leader and warlord Zeljko
Raznatovic, or Arkan, was shot in a Belgrade hotel, with media speculating for
weeks on the mafia-style execution. Police apprehended several suspects.
</P>
<P>
	   Bulatovic did not have a high political profile. Although the 52-year-old
official was a Cabinet member, he wielded little real power and had no
reputation as a player in the country's shadowy network of smuggling and
organized crime, believed to be tied closely to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   While the motive of the slaying remains unclear, it occurred during a tense
period between Milosevic and Montenegro, whose pro-Western leadership has been
struggling toward independence from what is left of the Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
	   Bulatovic was a top official in the pro-Milosevic Socialist Peoples Party in
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
	   In Montenegro, the pro-Western leadership on Tuesday canceled a scheduled
parliament session because of the assassination. Miodrag Vukovic, an adviser to
the Montenegrin government, called on Serbia's leaders to ``speak out and say
why this country has become restive and life-threatening.''
</P>
<P>
	   Late Tuesday, the airplane bearing Bulatovic's coffin landed at the military
airport in Montenegro's capital Podgorica, where his remains are to lie in state
today at the local cemetery. Bulatovic will be buried on Thursday in his native
village of Gornji Rovci in Montenegro.

<HEADLINE> Bill To Shed Belfast Powers Backed  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- The House of Commons overwhelmingly backed an emergency bill
allowing the British government to remove the powers of Northern Ireland's
fledgling administration this week in an effort to save it from collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   The 352-11 House of Commons vote came Tuesday after Britain's Northern
Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson warned that members had no choice following
the Irish Republican Army's refusal to disarm in support of the province's 1998
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   In a last formal step before the bill passed to the upper House of Lords --
a ceremonial final ``reading'' passed with a vote of 326 to seven.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson, who transferred considerable responsibilities to the Belfast
administration two months ago, said in these circumstances it was clear that it
``will simply fall apart'' if powers were not immediately taken back.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ulster Unionists, the major Protestant party within the power-sharing
Cabinet, had agreed to form the four-party coalition -- which includes the
IRA-linked Sinn Fein -- only on condition that IRA disarmament would commence in
response.
</P>
<P>
	   A disarmament commission's report last week said the IRA had made no
concrete commitments, triggering the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   As Martin McGuinness, a former IRA commander who is now Sinn Fein's minister
for education in the Cabinet, looked on from the visitors' gallery, Mandelson
said those arguing for the power-sharing Cabinet to continue were offering ``a
false choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   The reality, he said, was ``between pause and bust.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``A pause in the operation of the institutions, far from seeing them lying
in collapse, will preserve the institutions and allow them to be revived at a
later date,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill is expected to become law Thursday, after passage through the House
of Lords. Mandelson said he intended to resume ``direct rule'' from London on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams directly appealed to Prime Minister Tony Blair
not to suspend the administration's powers, saying it would render any start to
IRA disarmament impossible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Good Friday agreement is under the greatest threat so far since it
came into existence,'' Adams said, accusing the British government of backing
``a unilateral deadline'' sought by the Ulster Unionists.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, in a radio interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. in Belfast,
Adams claimed to have done all he could to win an IRA commitment to disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   But others blamed Sinn Fein for not delivering on its end of a bargain
struck in November.
</P>
<P>
	   In exchange for the Ulster Unionists' accepting Sinn Fein as Cabinet
colleagues, Sinn Fein declared for the first time that disarmament was
``essential,'' and the IRA opened negotiations with the province's 3-year-old
disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
	   The Good Friday accord proposed that the IRA should completely disarm by
May, but specified no starting point. The IRA has never accepted that goal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ulster Unionists plan to ballot grassroots members Saturday on whether
to remain in the Cabinet. If they call for withdrawal, forming a new Cabinet
would prove extremely difficult because it would require a new election in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   Given the rising Protestant hostility to cooperating with Sinn Fein, the
Ulster Unionists would probably suffer losses.

<HEADLINE> Navy To Search for Alaska Air Part  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTINE HANLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- The Navy will try to find a piece that may have
broken off the Alaska Airlines plane as Flight 261 began its fatal plunge into
the Pacific Ocean, the National Transportation Safety Board chief said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   A loud noise heard on the cockpit voice recorder corresponds to radar
signals picked up when the MD-83 begins its final dive into the sea with 88
people aboard, NTSB Chairman Jim Hall said at a news conference in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Radar showed what could have been parts of the aircraft carried by the wind
up to 2 1/2 minutes after the plane struck the water. The Navy will search an
area four miles from the main wreckage, where investigators believe any pieces
might have landed, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These primary radar hits might be indicative -- and I emphasize might be
indicative -- of something coming off Flight 261 near this point,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hall also said the pilots turned off the autopilot soon after leaving Puerto
Vallarta, Mexico, and flew without it for an hour and 53 minutes -- the majority
of the 2 hour, 43 minute flight.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilots later turned the autopilot on briefly, Hall said, and when they
disengaged it again the plane flew out of control.
</P>
<P>
	   In other developments Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Officials revealed that the MD-83 had two ``maintenance write-ups'' late
last year for problems with its horizontal stabilizer, the wing-like piece of
equipment on the jetliner's tail that is the focus of the crash investigation.
In October, the system was checked and the plane returned to service. A month
later, mechanics replaced a switch. It was unknown what prompted the concerns,
and Hall did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   -- The Navy on Monday night recovered two parts of the horizontal
stabilizer, including an eight-foot section.
</P>
<P>
	   -- The NTSB described the final minutes of the flight, when the plane
abruptly dropped 7,000 feet and leveled off before free-falling nearly 18,000
feet in one minute.
</P>
<P>
	   Analyzing the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, investigators
determined Flight 261 was cruising on autopilot at 31,000 feet 12 minutes before
the Jan. 31 crash.
</P>
<P>
	   The horizontal stabilizer, which controls the plane's up and down motion,
moved to an apparent full ``nose-down'' position as the pilots simultaneously
disengaged the autopilot, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane dropped nearly 7,000 feet in one minute, more than three times the
typical rate of descent, as the crew struggled to level it. They finally brought
it under control at 24,300 feet and over the next nine minutes descended in what
Hall described as a ``controlled flight'' to 18,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Things then began to happen very quickly,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane nose-dived at a roughly 60-degree angle within three seconds,
eventually reaching an acceleration of negative 3 Gs -- meaning objects in the
plane were pulled upward at three times the force of gravity. A person who feels
a sense of weightlessness on a roller coaster is experiencing only a small
fraction of the force that would have been felt on the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   An MD-80 series jet is designed to be maneuverable up to a force of negative
1 G, said John Thom, a spokesman for Boeing, which bought the plane's builder,
McDonnell Douglas, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You're above the structural limitations of the airplane,'' said William
Waldock, associate director for the Center for Aerospace Safety Education at
Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz. ``In a way, I'm almost
surprised the wings stayed on.''
</P>
<P>
	   As the plane nose-dived, it pitched to the left and inverted, corkscrewing
from 17,900 feet to the ocean in just over a minute.
</P>
<P>
	   All victims appeared to have died instantly, said Ventura County Medical
Examiner Ron O'Halloran.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The impact was forceful, and it is extremely unlikely that anyone
maintained consciousness or suffered beyond the impact,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Sketches $8.5B School Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Democratic rivals Bill Bradley and Al Gore turn their
focus to education today, with Bradley set to sketch out an $8.5 billion
proposal that would double funding for schools in distress.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's proposal would allow parents to choose between the public schools
their children attend, puts in place a grading system for schools and an extra
$500 million for charter schools, said Bradley aides.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would double the amount of money we spend in the largest federal
program,'' said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   He said his package would give schools incentives to improve, hold schools
and teachers more accountable and give parents better information about the
education their children are getting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We require those who receive that money assure that there's a quality
teacher in every classroom, that they are accountable for results,'' said
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Coupled with earlier Bradley proposals to double the number of slots in the
Head Start program and provide incentives to find 600,000 new teachers, aides
said Bradley is offering a far more aggressive package than Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore offered much earlier in the campaign a $115-billion, 10-year package of
school construction and modernization funds, pre-school grants and teacher
salary increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Hardly ceding the issue now, Gore was in Detroit to promote -- at a child
care center -- his plan to give tax incentives for middle-class families to save
for college tuition.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley camp contends his package leaves the former New Jersey senator
as the education candidate, arguing that he is proposing more money, more
innovation and more results than the vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gore spokesman Chris Lehane countered that Bradley was only scrambling
to the issue because he lost contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and Delaware.
``Coming on the heels of his health care plan, which blew out the budget
surplus, there's no money left for Senator Bradley to address education. He's a
few dollars short and three primaries late,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
	   Underscoring his focus on schools that are struggling the hardest, Bradley
was heading to an inner-city school to offer details of his package in St.
Louis. He previewed the proposal in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest single piece of Bradley's proposal would be to double funding
for the basic federal program helping to pay for disadvantaged and low-income
school districts expanding the current $8 billion effort to $16 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   A portion of the money would go for programs aiding youngsters when a gap
between high performing students and low performers grows.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also calls for ``public school choice,'' or allowing parents to
choose the public school their youngsters attend. To help them make that choice,
schools would be given grades and rated.
</P>
<P>
	   Significantly for schools, money flows on a per-pupil basis and that money
would move to the new school as the child made that shift.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's package also contains a requirement boosting testing requirements
for teachers. ``We will require that all teachers be qualified to teach their
subject,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has already proposed grant and loan programs for teachers in
training who agree to teach in distressed rural and urban high schools, and the
new focus on teacher quality meets the demands of parents.
</P>
<P>
	   The school choice issue is a touchy one for Bradley, because he routinely is
attacked by Gore for votes he cast in favor of experiments with school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
	   Vouchers allow parents to pick the school their child attends, public or
private. That's denounced by many in the education community, who argue it would
drain money from the public school system.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's aides were careful to note that the school choice plan they offer
allows parents to pick among public schools only.
</P>
<P>
	   Education is a big fighting point between Bradley and Gore. Gore seeks to
tag Bradley with his vote on vouchers, arguing that he's a stronger supporter of
the public school system.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley counters that Gore had accomplished little during his tenure in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He talks a lot about education, but he's had seven years to demonstrate
his accomplishments,'' said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue is hotly fought in Democratic politics, because polls have shown
Democratic primary voters rank education among the top issues they consider when
making a voting decision.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Squabble Over Trust  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT LINDLAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- John McCain and George Bush are pounding away at each
other's credibility as character accusations eclipse all other issues in this
battleground state.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said he hopes policy debates replace the exchanges on trustworthiness
when the two candidates hit the road today, but promised: ``We're going to
respond harder than we have hit and that's an old tactic in warfare.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush aired a commercial charging the senator ``solicits money from lobbyists
with interests before his committee and pressures agencies on behalf of
contributors.''
</P>
<P>
	   The accusations flew as Bush got a much-needed lift over McCain's insurgent
candidacy with a 51-25 percent win in Delaware. McCain did not campaign in
Delaware, bypassing it to campaign in South Carolina and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   The South Carolina primary is Feb. 19, and the candidates are crisscrossing
the state in search of votes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor said McCain was not the political maverick he claimed,
repeatedly referring to the senator as ``the chairman'' and saying that as head
of the Senate's Commerce Committee and as a campaigner he ``tends to say one
thing and do another.''
</P>
<P>
	   The latest example, Bush said, was McCain's statement a day earlier that he
had always opposed public funding of elections. The Bush campaign offered a list
of five McCain votes from 1990 to 1993 in favor of a bill that proposed partial
public funding of Senate campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain voted not once, not twice, but five times to support
publicly funded congressional campaigns,'' Bush told reporters after speaking to
a cheering student crowd at North Greenville College.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said he couldn't recall whether he had ever voted for public funding
of federal campaigns, but that he was philosophically opposed to the idea
``because of my view that my tax dollars should not be used to subsidize the
campaigns of another candidate.''
</P>
<P>
	   His spokesman, Howard Opinsky, said: ``This is the same old Washington
Clintonian politics that voters have become so cynical about, trying to twist
John McCain's 17-year record of reform and consistent opposition to public
financing to Governor Bush's advantage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Opinsky said all of the votes were against cloture motions -- that is,
voting to continue debate -- to keep opponents from stifling campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush later characterized the contest against McCain as a fight he looks
forward to.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's important for me to show you that not only I can take a punch, but I
can come back and win and that's exactly what I intend to do here in the state
of South Carolina,'' Bush said in a speech to the South Carolina Association of
Home Builders in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican hopeful Alan Keyes blamed an ``oppressive government'' for what
he said was the nation's moral crisis. Pacing the Sumter Opera House's stage
bordered by red, white and blue campaign posters, Keyes urged ``people willing,
through the goodness of their heart,to take on the responsibilities of freedom''
and self-government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in Columbia, McCain announced a plan to fight crime and drugs, but
the event was all but buried by questions from reporters about his disputes with
Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, a former Vietnam prisoner of war, said he was offended by a Bush
ally who questioned his commitment to veterans -- a comment McCain said was
``beyond the pale'' -- as well as by aggressive new Bush ads. He noted that he
and Bush had shaken hands just weeks ago and agreed not to air negative ads
against each other.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe it is not trustworthy when someone shakes your hand and says
they're not going to run a negative ad, and then runs a negative ad,'' he said
aboard his bus.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've already got somebody in the Oval Office who is not trustworthy,'' he
said. He went even further in a new TV ad that says one of Bush's ads ``twists
the truth like Clinton.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- As impressive as the victory was, the way No. 12
Florida handled it might have been even more telling.
</P>
<P>
	   Only moments after their wire-to-wire 90-73 dismantling of No. 11 Kentucky
on Tuesday night, the Gators were looking ahead instead of celebrating what once
would have been considered a monumental win.
</P>
<P>
	   Sophomore Mike Miller led the effort with 11 points and a career-high 18
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory put Florida (18-4, 7-2 Southeastern Conference) into a three-way
tie for first in the SEC East with Kentucky (17-6, 7-2) and No. 8 Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every win in the league is important," Florida coach Billy Donovan said. "I
just want the guys to keep this in perspective. This is one game in the league.
We played well tonight, but there's a long way to go."
</P>
<P>
	   The postgame atmosphere was much different than last season, when Florida
beat Kentucky at home to thrust itself into the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
	   After that victory, the Gators celebrated like national champions. Point
guard Teddy Dupay had to be yanked from going into the crowd by the school's
athletic director as he played to the frenzied student section.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, the crowd was just as pumped, but the players shook hands and
quietly shuffled off the court. It seemed as though they expected this -- and so
much more in this season of increasing expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sure, it's great to beat a team with their tradition and their
championships," said Donovan, a former assistant at Kentucky. "I hope these guys
understand that this is one game. We still have to go back and play them in
Lexington."
</P>
<P>
	   In other games involving ranked teams Tuesday, Purdue beat No. 6 Michigan
State 70-67 and No. 16 Oklahoma defeated Kansas State 85-64.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wildcats came into Gainesville having gone 13-1 since splitting their
first eight games and raising questions whether their dynasty was in decline.
</P>
<P>
	   Certainly it isn't, although the Gators made it look that way at times.
</P>
<P>
	   Full-court trapping the Wildcats into a state of frustration, the Gators
took a 34-17 lead with seven minutes left in the first half and spent the rest
of the game holding off Kentucky rallies.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida got the lead up to 19 points early in the second half. Kentucky got
the deficit down to 76-66 with three minutes remaining, but committed a turnover
when it had the ball with a chance to trim it to eight.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida scored the next seven points, and the Gators had their second
straight victory in the series after dropping 11 of the previous 13. It was
Florida's largest margin of victory in the series since 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought we just got beaten pretty soundly by a very good team," Wildcats
coach Tubby Smith said. "We didn't seem to be kicking on all cylinders. We
seemed to be more interested in talking instead of playing tonight, so these are
the results."
</P>
<P>
	   Kentucky center Jamaal Magloire was among the biggest talkers.
</P>
<P>
	   Drawn into trash talk with most of the Florida team and some of its crowd,
Magloire drew his second foul four minutes into the game and his third three
minutes into the second half. He played a total of 17 minutes and finished with
four points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're always disappointed when your leading scorer and leading rebounder
gets in foul trouble," Smith said. "Those are things you've got to be a little
more mature about."
</P>
<P>
	   Freshman Keith Bogans had 24 points for Kentucky, and Desmond Allison added
17.
</P>
<P>
	   Dupay led Florida's balanced scoring with 14 points. Major Parker had 13 and
six Gators finished in double figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Brian Cardinal scored 17 points and Mike Robinson added 16 as the
Boilermakers (16-7, 7-3 Big Ten) rallied from a 10-point deficit in the second
half. Purdue used a 10-0 run to erase a 57-47 deficit, and a layup by Robinson
with 2:54 left gave it the lead for good at 64-63. A.J. Granger matched his
career high with 17 points and also had a career-high 12 rebounds for the
visiting Spartans (17-6, 7-2), while Mateen Cleaves had 11 points and nine
assists.
</P>
<P>
	   J.R. Raymond scored 17 points and Eduardo Najera had 15 points and nine
rebounds for the Sooners (19-3, 7-2 Big 12). Kelvin Howell had 12 points and 11
rebounds for the visiting Wildcats (8-13, 1-9), who have lost nine straight and
10 of 11.

<HEADLINE> McCain Compares Bush to Clinton  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush went after John McCain on his signature
issue, campaign finance reform, as McCain charged that Bush ``twists the truth
like Clinton'' in a rapidly escalating and angry TV ad war.
</P>
<P>
	   With the South Carolina GOP presidential primary less than two weeks away on
Feb. 19, Bush is confronting McCain at every turn. McCain, working to hold his
momentum after his New Hampshire victory, is battling back.
</P>
<P>
	   Each man is using TV commercials to accuse the other of distorting positions
on Social Security and tax cuts, and of breaking their agreement to steer clear
of negative ads.
</P>
<P>
	   In his new ad released Tuesday, McCain complains about an earlier Bush spot
and suggests the Texas governor is ``getting desperate.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``His ad twists the truth like Clinton. We're all pretty tired of that,''
McCain says in the ad. ``As president, I'll ... always tell you the truth no
matter what.''
</P>
<P>
	   This ad upped the ante from a similar spot released a day earlier. The
earlier ad merely implied Bush was like Clinton, whereas Tuesday's outright
compares the two by name.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, Bush released two new television commercials for South
Carolina, Michigan and Virginia. One is a positive recitation of his
accomplishments as Texas governor, the other, a slam against McCain on campaign
finance.
</P>
<P>
	   The second ad argues that while McCain denounces the big-money political
system, his campaign has attracted swarms of lobbyists and he takes money from
groups with business before the Commerce Committee, which he chairs.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain camp offered a cease fire. Campaign manager Rick Davis sent a
letter Tuesday to Karl Rove, his counterpart in the Bush campaign, offering to
pull McCain's attack ads if Bush did the same.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have an opportunity to regain the high ground and do what is right for
the Republican party, but we will not act alone,'' Davis wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush camp wasn't biting, suggesting that McCain was looking for an
``excuse'' to take down an ad that will ultimately backfire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He never should have aired it in the first place, and, no, we won't take
down our ads,'' said a statement from Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman. ``Our ads
set the record straight while his ads go way too far.''
</P>
<P>
	   But outside analysts said the McCain ad was unlikely to hurt the Arizona
senator.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has the tone of someone defending themselves,'' said Hastings Wyman,
editor of the Southern Political Report.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack Bass, who studies politics at the College of Charleston, guessed that
Bush's backers are the only ones who will be offended -- and they're already
voting for Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If there's one quality South Carolina voters like above all in a
candidate, it's toughness, somebody who fights back,'' Bass said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Charlie Black, a Republican consultant allied with Bush, said the ad
isn't likely to hurt McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you compared him (Bush) to Adolf Hitler, that would get people mad,''
he said. ``This doesn't sound to me like that as much as firing a blank.''
</P>
<P>
	   The substance of the dispute between Bush and McCain involves their
proposals to cut taxes and shore up Social Security. Bush's tax cut is about
twice the size of McCain's. But McCain puts more money toward Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain charges that Bush would spend the entire surplus on tax cuts, leaving
nothing to shore up the retirement system.
</P>
<P>
	   But there are actually two ``surpluses'' in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush sets aside all of the extra money coming into the Social Security trust
fund -- known as the ``Social Security surplus'' -- for the program. But there
also is a multibillion dollar surplus in the general federal treasury. Bush
would use most of that for tax cuts, while McCain would use some to bolster the
retirement program, which will need billions more dollars once the baby boomers
retire and start collecting from the program rather than paying into it.

<HEADLINE> 4 Die in Aceh Anti-Rebel Campaign  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (AP) -- Government troops clashed with separatist
rebels, killing four people, in the Indonesian province of Aceh, where security
forces have intensified operations, police said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's killings brought the death toll in the gas and oil-rich province
to at least 14 since Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Col. Syafei Aksal, a local police chief, said the four were shot dead in
two skirmishes in North Aceh and nearby regency of Bireuem. He said the four
belonged to the Free Aceh Movement.
</P>
<P>
	   But Ismail Syahputra, a spokesman for the rebel group, claimed the victims
were villagers who were assassinated by soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, two schoolchildren were injured in a grenade attack against a
military post in Bireuem, the Media Indonesia daily reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels are fighting for an independent state in Aceh, about 1,087 miles
northwest of Jakarta. More than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict in
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
	   During the past month, government troops have conducted a series of sweeps
against rebel strongholds.

<HEADLINE> Wiranto Attends Cabinet Meeting  </HEADLINE>
   By DANIEL COONEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's security minister smiled and joked
when he showed up at a Cabinet meeting today, once again defying the president's
demands he quit and take responsibility for the devastation of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second time Gen. Wiranto has attended a Cabinet meeting since
President Abdurrahman Wahid, who is currently on an official visit to India,
first called for his resignation on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto, who uses only one name, made it clear he had no intention of
stepping down before Wahid returns to Indonesia on Sunday at the end of a 16-day
European and Asian tour.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let us wait until the president comes back then I will report everything
about my responsibilities for East Timor,'' he told reporters. ``Let the law run
its course.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid called on Wiranto to quit after an Indonesian government investigation
held him responsible for the mayhem that engulfed East Timor last year when the
territory voted to break away from Indonesia in a U.N.-supervised ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto, a four-star general, was Indonesia's military commander at that
time.
</P>
<P>
	   Before today's Cabinet meeting at the presidential palace in Jakarta, a
relaxed and confident-looking Wiranto chatted and laughed with Cabinet
colleagues and shook hands with several. Afterward, Cabinet Secretary Marsilam
Simanjuntak said Wiranto's future was not discussed.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid has repeatedly said he will press for Wiranto's resignation after his
return to Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
	   Apparently wanting to soften the blow for Wiranto, the president has
promised to grant a pardon if he is eventually convicted of human rights
violations. He has praised his character and even described him as a ``friend.''
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, Wiranto refuses to budge and maintains he has done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview published in Singapore's Straits Times newspaper Tuesday,
Wiranto said Indonesians would regard his resignation as an admission of guilt.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the paper said that he had left open the possibility of quitting
after Wahid's return.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, the impasse triggered coup rumors. But these have been dismissed
by Wiranto and Wahid along with the present military top brass.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indonesian investigation and a separate U.N. probe have accused
Wiranto's troops of aiding anti-independence militias in East Timor to loot,
burn and kill.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid, who was appointed president last October, has steadily eroded the
power of the military in his bid to deliver democratic reforms after decades of
authoritarian rule.

<HEADLINE> Four Escape From Afghan Airline  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROLINE BYRNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Four men dropped from the cockpit window of a
hijacked plane and ran to safety Tuesday night, fleeing the Afghan aircraft that
has been parked for two days while negotiators seek the release of more than 150
passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, a flight attendant left the plane during tense negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   In the darkness shortly before midnight, the men used a rope to help lower
themselves about 20 feet to the tarmac of Stansted airport.
</P>
<P>
	   They were being questioned after receiving medical attention, and appeared
to have suffered no serious injuries, said Joe Edwards, an Essex Police
assistant chief constable.
</P>
<P>
	   Police confirmed that the four men were Afghan crew members -- the captain,
second captain, first officer and flight engineer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Inevitably, the escape of these men did upset the calm atmosphere for a
time and we have been working to restore that calm. There's obviously tiredness
and some frustration among those on board,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations with the hijackers were ``up and down'' throughout the night
following the escape, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``During this unsettled period, a man was seen falling down some steps at
the rear of the plane. He appeared to have been pushed,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
	   The man, who turned out to be the flight attendant, was given medical
attention for a minor graze on his forehead and was debriefed by police at
Stansted Airport, north of London, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, negotiators warned that the talks, which gained the release of a
ninth hostage during the day Tuesday, could go on for days.
</P>
<P>
	   The aims of the hijackers, believed to be Afghans, remained unclear.
Speculation ranged from an elaborate play for political asylum to a bid to win
the release of Ismail Khan, a former regional governor in Afghanistan detained
since 1997 by the country's ruling Taliban movement.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about a potential asylum bid, John Broughton, an Essex Police
assistant chief constable, said: ``In talking around the issues, there are a lot
of things raised.'' He would not elaborate, saying only that the hijackers, who
controlled the plane at Stansted Airport 25 miles north of London, had made no
``formal demands.''
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the negotiations involved what Broughton called housekeeping issues,
such as the delivery of water and food to the Ariana airlines plane.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've done everything we can to keep the conditions on the aircraft
habitable,'' said Edwards. ``We're talking all the time about what's the
condition of people and how are the children.''
</P>
<P>
	   A London representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees arrived
at Stansted as an observer, police said Tuesday evening. She would not be a
negotiator, but would bring to the crisis the strength of the U.N.'s expertise
on the situation in Afghanistan, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boeing 727 had been headed to the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif
from the Afghan capital, Kabul, when it was seized early Sunday. It then began a
meandering journey across the former Soviet Union, stopping in Uzbekistan,
Kazakstan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   According to some of the 22 passengers released before the plane landed at
Stansted early Monday, the hijackers are eight young men armed with pistols,
grenades and daggers. Edwards said former hostages that authorities have talked
to have said there were between six and 10 hijackers.
</P>
<P>
	   They were believed to still be holding more than 150 hostages, including 21
children. All the passengers were believed to be Afghans.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight passengers were released at Stansted on Monday, including two infants
who were treated for dehydration. The man released earlier Tuesday, an
asthmatic, had complained of feeling ill, Broughton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The freed hostages have said they were treated well, authorities said. One
told reporters the hijacking started somewhat quietly 20 minutes into the
flight, with the armed men calmly telling passengers to put their hands on their
heads.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people we are talking to are remarkably calm and that's really
important,'' Edwards said. ``The atmosphere is one of control, people behaving
rationally. That's going to help an awful lot.''
</P>
<P>
	   All six Iraqi men at the center of Britain's last hijacking drama -- a 1996
case involving a Sudanese airliner -- remain in the country as asylum-seekers,
the British government confirmed Tuesday. Those men held 197 people hostage for
seven hours at Stansted.
</P>
<P>
	   They were convicted in 1997 and sentenced to between five and nine years in
prison. But they were cleared on appeal a year later after a court ruled the
trial judge was wrong to bar jurors from considering their defense -- that they
were acting under ``necessity'' as opponents of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's
regime.
</P>
<P>
	   The men had claimed they stormed the plane in a desperate bid to enter
Britain and seek asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghanistan is one of the top sources of asylum seekers in Britain. An
average of 360 applications a month has been lodged by Afghans since October.
Refugee status is granted in about a third of cases.

<HEADLINE> Deutch Gives Up Pentagon Clearances  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon intends to withdraw John Deutch's last
remaining access to classified Pentagon information, officials said after the
former deputy defense secretary offered to give it up.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch, who became CIA director after he left his Pentagon post in 1995,
lost his CIA security clearances last August because he violated security rules
by keeping classified information on unprotected personal computers at his home.
He is not accused of compromising CIA secrets.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, a day after Defense Secretary William Cohen said the Pentagon
was reviewing Deutch's handling of classified information during his years at
the Pentagon, Deutch sent a letter to Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre asking
that his three remaining industrial security clearances be dropped.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the clearances would be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch said in his letter to Hamre that he has no further need for access to
the Pentagon's secrets and therefore prefers that his three remaining Pentagon
clearances be discontinued. His industrial security clearances gave him access
to classified information about defense technologies, the type of clearances
commonly granted to people working under Defense Department contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch's letter was transmitted to Hamre by his attorney at the Washington
law office of Williams &AMP; Connolly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has been Mr. Deutch's practice since his CIA clearance was suspended by
Director Tenet last August to avoid access to any classified information,
including classified documents, meetings and conversations,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Therefore, there is no need to continue these industrial security
clearances at this time, and he asks that they be discontinued.''
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch spent 38 years in public service before leaving the CIA in December
1996.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time CIA Director George Tenet suspended Deutch's security clearance
at the agency, the Pentagon cut off Deutch's access to Defense Intelligence
Agency information. But the Pentagon allowed Deutch to keep his industrial
clearances.
</P>
<P>
	   When he acted against Deutch, Tenet said the CIA had found no evidence that
national security information was lost due to Deutch's security lapses, but
``potential for damage to U.S. security existed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee,
said Tuesday it was hard for him to conceive of any other outcome than for
Deutch to lose all security clearances.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby said Deutch's continued possession of Pentagon clearances six months
after his CIA clearances were revoked was ``mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby's committee met privately with CIA Inspector General L. Britt Snider
and was hoping Deutch would accept its invitation to also appear to discuss his
security violations. Shelby said committee lawyers were in contact with Deutch
and his lawyers to try to arrange an appearance.
</P>
<P>
	   A Deutch associate, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he expected
Deutch to comply with the committee's wish. The associate said Deutch was
traveling Tuesday and not available for direct comment.
</P>
<P>
	   If Deutch does not come voluntarily, the committee will consider issuing a
subpoena to compel his appearance, Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it is important that he come to the committee and let him explain
his version of events and his side of the story,'' Shelby said.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Funds for Poison Control  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House has given final congressional approval to a bill
that would help finance operations of the nation's 73 remaining local poison
control centers.
</P>
<P>
	   Proponents of the bill say a lack of a reliable source of finances over the
past two decades has forced many poison centers to cut services or shut down
altogether. Just 22 years ago, the country had 661 centers.
</P>
<P>
	   The House, by a 378-16 vote, passed a measure Tuesday to would authorize
$140 million over the next five years to pay for the centers' operations, carry
out a national media campaign and create a nationwide toll-free telephone number
to give enhanced access to the sick or injured.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The financial squeeze has forced many centers to curtail their services,''
said Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich. ``This bill is going to save lives, and at the end
of the day it can save money too.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to a report issued by a government advisory group, every dollar
spent on poison control services saves $7 in medical costs.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 2 million poisonings are reported to control centers throughout
the United States each year. Ninety percent of the incidents occur at home, and
more than half the victims are preschool children.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This kind of effort is critical if centers are to provide the maximum
level of service to our most vulnerable children,'' said Rep. Edolphus Towns,
D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate passed the measure in August. It now goes to the White House
President Clinton's signature.

Bush Wins Delaware Primary

Gov. George W. Bush said his 2-to-1 victory in Delaware's GOP presidential

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Said Broke Israeli Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is calling for
monitors to convene along the Lebanese-Israeli border, where she says the
Islamic militant group Hezbollah is violating a 1996 promise not to use villages
in Lebanon to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright said Tuesday the attacks from villages on Lebanon's southern border
with Israel are contrary to the agreement brokered four years ago by the United
States. That pact rules out attacks on civilians or subjecting them to
cross-fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel this week responded to Hezbollah with a devastating aerial attack,
its heaviest bombardment of Lebanon in eight months.
</P>
<P>
	   Six Israel soldiers have been killed in two weeks of clashes. Some 40
Lebanese civilians were wounded in the fighting, according to Farid Abboud, the
Lebanese ambassador to Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview, Abboud denied Hezbollah -- which he referred to as ``the
resistance'' -- was using civilians as shields.
</P>
<P>
	   He accused Israel of deliberately targeting civilians in southern Lebanon,
where Israeli troops and friendly Lebanese militia, have occupied a
self-declared border buffer zone since 1985 to protect Israel's northern towns
from guerrilla shelling. Abboud appealed to the Clinton administration to halt
Israel's attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   With tensions rising, and already faltering peace hopes fading, Albright
said in Israel's defense that Israel was trying to send ``a very clear signal''
that it did not want the fighting to escalate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They want to make sure the message is received,'' Albright said, while
noting Israel had rocketed power stations in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   She telephoned Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa to seek Syria's
assistance. Albright said the United States and Syria both wanted a monitoring
panel established under the 1996 accord to convene.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria has some 30,000 troops in Lebanon and has permitted the flow of arms
to the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group. Asked if Syria agreed to use its
influence to stop the fighting, Albright said ``they are basically saying they
are doing what they can.''
</P>
<P>
	   She also said she would send American mediator Dennis B. Ross back to the
region next week to try to spur peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The resistance's motivation is to attack Israel until they leave
Lebanon,'' Abboud said after calling on White House and State Department
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   But Mark Regev, spokesman for the Israeli embassy here, said ``no one should
expect Israeli civilians, alone, to pay the price for Hezbollah terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said Israel had made ``a deliberate and conscious attempt to avoid
hitting targets that will cause civilian casualties.''
</P>
<P>
	   At his request, Abboud called at the White House on Bruce Riedel and Rob
Malley, senior advisers to President Clinton on the Middle East, and at the
State Department on Assistant Secretary Edward Walker.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I expressed my government's concern -- grave concern -- for the Israeli
attacks on civilian targets and explained that these were deliberate attacks in
contradiction of law and the April 1996 agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think the Israelis have violated very gravely this agreement
unilaterally, while the Lebanese resistance has limited its attacks to Israeli
and militia targets'' he added, referring to pro-Israel Lebanese force.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The attacks of the resistance were conducted under the rules,'' which do
not exclude targeting soldiers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Mike Hammer said the United States was deeply
concerned about the escalation of violence, regretted loss of life and injury on
all sides as well as damage to civilian infrastructure and disruption of
civilian life.
</P>
<P>
	   Hammer blamed Hezbollah for the deteriorating situation, saying it was
trying to create tensions and prevent progress toward an agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Hammer said the way to defuse the crisis is to work with the Israel-Lebanon
monitoring group, which was established in the 1996 agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint,'' he said.

	   ``I personally believe the flag should come down,'' Watts told USA Today's
editorial board.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said he understands where GOP presidential front-runners George W.
Bush and John McCain ``are coming from.''
</P>
<P>
	   Watts said it's unfair to criticize Republicans when many South Carolina
Democrats favor keeping the flag flying. ``We've got to be careful,'' he said.
``We don't want this to become a Republican issue.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked whether Bush or McCain could improve their standing among black voters
by selecting a black running mate, Watts quipped: ``I don't think Colin Powell
would be interested.''
</P>
<P>
	   Watts is often mentioned as a potential vice presidential candidate.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Judge Dismisses Belgian Suit  </HEADLINE>
   By ESTES THOMPSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- A federal judge has ruled that relatives of five
Belgians killed when a Marine jet severed a ski gondola cable in the Italian
Alps cannot seek damages in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   While sympathizing with the families, U.S. District Judge Malcolm Howard
said Tuesday their only recourse is through a 1951 NATO agreement that governs
the civil and legal activities of NATO troops in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
	   To allow the families to sue in the United States ``could conceivably
undercut the treaty and create a cause of action for any overseas military
accident,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The relatives' attorney, Torrence Armstrong, argued that while the accident
occurred overseas, several problems had roots in the United States: a faulty
altitude gauge on the jet, outdated maps and inadequate flight crew training.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong said he would appeal to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the real tragedy is that the United States is not accepting
responsibility for this and is hiding behind the NATO agreement,'' Armstrong
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he would seek $6 million to $6.5 million for each of the five
victims if the case went to trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty people were killed in 1998 when a low-flying EA-6B Prowler on a NATO
assignment severed the cable and sent a ski gondola crashing to the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema approved the maximum $1.9
million in damages per victim in the crash, with the United States paying 75
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
	   The payments are governed by the 1951 accord covering the activities of NATO
troops in foreign countries. Under the agreement, the compensation claims for
the accident must be dealt with in Italy.
</P>
<P>
	   A military jury at Camp Lejeune acquitted the jet's pilot, Capt. Richard
Ashby, of manslaughter, but he served several months in prison and was dismissed
from the Marine Corps for helping destroy a videotape of the flight. The jet's
navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, also was dismissed over the videotape.
Charges were dropped against two back-seat crewmen.

<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra has named Brooklyn
Philharmonic music director Robert Spano to replace departing conductor Yoel
Levi.
</P>
<P>
	   The symphony board Tuesday also named Donald Runnicles, music director of
the San Francisco Opera, to become principal guest conductor.
</P>
<P>
	   The new structure means that Spano, a 38-year-old Ohio native, and the
Scottish-born Runnicles, 45, will help plan the entire sweep of ASO programs
together.
</P>
<P>
	   The appointments end a two-year search to replace Levi, who leaves this
summer after a 12-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
	   The Atlanta orchestra has had just three conductors in its 56 years. With
its $23 million budget, it is the largest cultural organization in the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
	   It was among several in the nation seeking to fill music director positions,
including New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Indianapolis and Minneapolis. Last
month, the Cincinnati Symphony announced Paavo Jarvi would replace the retiring
Jesus Lopez-Cobos as its music director.

<HEADLINE> Shalala Wants Better CDC Bookkeeping  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A high-ranking government accountant will make sure that
one of the nation's largest health agencies properly tallies all the taxpayer
money it spends fighting killer viruses, Health and Human Services Secretary
Donna Shalala announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Shalala moved to clean up bookkeeping by the Atlanta-based Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, which last week acknowledged it had misled
Congress, for a second time, about how it spends some of its disease-fighting
money.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am taking what I consider to be very aggressive and unprecedented
actions to rectify the problem,'' Shalala told a House Appropriations health
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   Last October, CDC Director Jeffrey Koplan acknowledged his agency misspent
about half of the $22.7 million it received from Congress to study chronic
fatigue syndrome. Koplan again apologized last week, this time for how his
agency dealt with $7.5 million in annual funding intended to fight hantavirus.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress never said CDC must spend all that money against hantavirus, an
often deadly infection spread by mice that struck 24 Americans last year. But
the CDC told Congress it had done so, even though it really spent some of the
money fighting outbreaks of other mysterious killer viruses.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers now question if they can trust CDC employees to be truthful about
any financial issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Shalala instructed her department's chief financial officer to certify that
all expenditures by the CDC's infectious diseases branch are performed and
documented properly. In addition, all senior scientists in that branch will
receive special budget training.
</P>
<P>
	   A congressman in charge of CDC's funding questioned whether if the agency
has ``a very cavalier approach'' in spending and accounting for taxpayer money.
Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., suggested appointing non-government financial
consultants might work better.
</P>
<P>
	   Koplan will further address those concerns when CDC employees testify before
lawmakers Thursday, Shalala said.

<HEADLINE> School Dumps 'Captain Underpants'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NAUGATUCK, Conn. (AP) -- "Captain Underpants" has proved no match for
elementary school officials here, who have banished the cape-and-underwear-clad
character from their library.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Adventures of Captain Underpants: An Epic Novel," one in a series of
four, features bathroom humor and two mischievous boys.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at Maple Hill School say the problem was that some fourth-graders
started acting like the boys in the book.
</P>
<P>
	   "The book was beginning to take on a life of its own," Superintendent Alice
Carolan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Some parents, including Jennifer Merrill, want it back in circulation
because it entertains kids who otherwise don't like to read. "It's not harmful
to children," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Parent Stephen Lotto said it all started two weeks after his son took his
copy of "Captain Underpants and The Perilous Plot of Professor Poopypants," the
fourth in the series, to school for show and tell.
</P>
<P>
	   Principal Rebecca Sciacca removed the school's book from the library.
Sciacca would not comment except to say she encourages good literature in the
school.
</P>
<P>
	   In all four books by Dav Pilkey, the two boys hypnotize a mean principal
into thinking he's Captain Underpants.
</P>
<P>
	   The other two books in the series are titled "Captain Underpants and the
Attack of the Talking Toilets: Another Epic Novel," and "Captain Underpants and
the Invasion of the Incredible Naughty Cafeteria Ladies from Outer Space."
</P>
<P>
	   Carolan said she won't take any further action unless parents formally ask
the school board to return the book to the library.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is just goofy to me," Carolan said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Down; Dow Off 78.80  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened mostly lower today as weakness returned to
cyclical stocks and technology shares were undermined by an attack by hackers on
several leading Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 78.80 at 10,878.80.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 8.16 at 1,433.56, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 6.33 at 4,433.83.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Amazon.com and eBay slipped a day after Internet vandals hacked
into their Web sites, disrupting access for consumers. Amazon.com was down 1
17/64 at 81 55/64 and eBay fell 4 3/4 to 165.
</P>
<P>
	   Buy.com, which also succumbed to the attack Tuesday as its shares traded
publicly for the first time, rose 2 1/2 to 27 5/8 today.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology shares have so thoroughly dominated the market in the past year
that some analysts fear that when they falter, the broader market falters as
well. Today, a wide range of blue-chip shares pulled the Dow lower. Honeywell
fell 2 1/8 to 43 1/8 and Merck lost 2 1/16 to 73 3/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Cisco Systems went against the trend, rising 6 15/16 to 131 3/4. The company
said late Tuesday that profits in its fiscal second quarter topped analysts'
expectations. Cisco also announced a 2-for-1 stock split, to take effect March
22. The company has been one of the Nasdaq's strongest performers in recent
months as demand has soared for its computer networking equipment.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Demands Universal Coverage  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, trying to bring pressure on Congress,
said today that a patients' rights bill should cover all Americans and allow
them to sue health providers for inadequate care.
</P>
<P>
	   The president spoke up as congressional negotiators prepared to meet
Thursday to begin reconciling differences between House and Senate versions of
legislation to expand the rights of patients in dealing with HMOs.
</P>
<P>
	   The House bill, passed last year with the support of Democrats, provides the
right to sue HMOs for denial of care. The GOP-crafted Senate plan does not. The
House measure would apply to all 161 million Americans with health insurance,
compared with 48 million for the Senate measure.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has said that the compromise
legislation probably would include some provision for lawsuits but that, ``What
we don't want to make it is just a lawyers' bill of rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said universal coverage and the right to sue are essential.
</P>
<P>
	   ``First we want to cover all Americans; that's a very important thing,'' the
president said. ``And there has to be some way of enforcing a right or it's not
a right. Otherwise, it's just a suggestion.''
</P>
<P>
	   He spoke with reporters on the South Lawn as he left for a political
fund-raising trip to Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My message is simple and straightforward: Congress should seize this
moment of opportunity to do what is right for the health of the American family
-- to seize this moment to stand with doctors, nurses and patients to restore
trust and accountability in our health care system.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said he favored the House version over the Senate measure because it
allows patients to go to the nearest emergency room, guarantees the right to see
a specialist and prevents HMOs from forcing patients to switch doctors in the
middle of treatment. It also provides the right to sue and includes all health
plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said it has the support of more than 300 health and consumer groups,
as well as 68 Republican members of the House.
</P>
<P>
	   But he complained that the negotiating committee had been stacked with
opponents of the provisions he favors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although I remain concerned that the conferees on the bill do not share
the majority's view, I believe nevertheless they have a clear responsibility to
ratify these fundamental rights, to put politics aside and pass a strong
enforceable patients' bill of rights,'' the president said.

<HEADLINE> Hypertension Patients in New Tests  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDA A. JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Could an experimental hypertension drug keep seniors
with a common, but rarely treated, type of borderline high blood pressure from
dying or having a heart attack, stroke or heart failure?
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists in 16 countries, led by a cardiologist at the University of
Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, have begun an extensive, five-year study
to find the answer. They are hoping the medication will prevent patients'
arteries from stiffening further and thus pushing their blood pressure
dangerously high.
</P>
<P>
	   The study begun last fall will include about 12,600 patients at about 900
sites around the world, according to the lead researcher, Dr. John B. Kostis, a
cardiology professor and chairman of the Department of Medicine at UMDNJ-Robert
Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is a history-making clinical trial," Kostis said last month.
</P>
<P>
	   The study will test a Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. drug, called omapatrilat, on
patients who have an early stage of what's called isolated systolic hypertension
because only their systolic blood pressure is above normal.
</P>
<P>
	   Systolic pressure, the top number in a blood pressure reading, occurs when
the heart contracts, forcing blood into the arteries; diastolic pressure, the
lower number in a blood pressure reading, occurs when the heart relaxes between
beats. Usually if one pressure is elevated, the other is high as well.
</P>
<P>
	   From the 1950s until the 1990s, cardiologists and researchers focused on
patients' diastolic pressure, partly because the heart is at rest two-thirds of
the time. Efforts to control hypertension concentrated on bringing down
patients' diastolic pressure until studies by Kostis and other researchers in
the late 1990s showed that using diuretics prevented cardiac "events" such as
heart attacks in many patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Kostis said those studies showed that the level of a patient's systolic
pressure was a better predictor than diastolic pressure of whether their heart
condition would worsen or kill them.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no proof that treating the mildest forms of this isolated systolic
hypertension benefits the patient," but this study could prove just that, said
Kostis, who spent a decade trying to organize and get funding for it.
</P>
<P>
	   Bristol-Myers Squibb, which has its research headquarters in Princeton, is
funding the study. It is hoping the federal Food and Drug Administration, which
last month said it would expedite its evaluation of the drug, will approve it
for sale by June.
</P>
<P>
	   Half the patients will take a 20 mg or 40 mg dose of omapatrilat each day
and half will take a sugar pill. Neither the patients nor their doctors will
know who got what until the study ends. Patients must be 65 or older and have a
systolic blood pressure of 141 to 159 and a diastolic pressure below 90.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think they're doing a great thing for whoever might need it," said Alfred
Feld, 72, one of the first patients recruited.
</P>
<P>
	   Feld, a retired salesman and manager in the textile industry, has had
borderline high blood pressure for years but is always on the go with errands
and civic activities. He doesn't want his heart condition to worsen and force
him to slow down.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm thrilled to be getting it," he said. While Feld doesn't know if he's
actually taking the drug, he said his blood pressure was fine at his recent
annual physical.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Jeffrey Cutler, head of clinical hypertension trials at the National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, said given that several million elderly
Americans have isolated systolic hypertension and there have been no large
studies of whether cutting their blood pressure is beneficial, "it's an
important thing to nail down."
</P>
<P>
	   Worldwide, 15 percent to 20 percent of people over age 60 have the
condition.
</P>
<P>
	   "A positive result from such a trial could have important influences on
practice patterns," Cutler said, adding that he would have preferred to see the
study also compare omapatrilat to the most commonly used heart drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Omapatrilat, which has the brand name Vanlev, belongs to a new class of
cardiovascular drugs known as vasopeptidase inhibitors and could become the
first in that class to go on sale.
</P>
<P>
	   Like other cardiac drugs called ACE inhibitors, vasopeptidase inhibitors
block the effects of certain enzymes that constrict arteries and thicken the
walls of arteries and the heart itself, pushing up blood pressure. Kostis said
the drug also blocks effects of another type of enzyme that also narrows blood
vessels, while at the same time increasing levels of a chemical that dilates
those vessels and flushing excess, pressure-raising fluids from the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's uniquely suited for this kind of blood pressure, because it appears to
lower systolic blood pressure more than other drugs," he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> On Stage: New Plays in New York  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL KUCHWARA AP Drama Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- After a sparse, almost barren fall and winter, a few new
plays are heading to Broadway. There might even be enough worthy candidates for
"best play" by the time the Tony Award nominations are announced in May.
</P>
<P>
	   And with debuts of two competing musicals called "The Wild Party" (one on,
the other off-Broadway), an Elton John musical by way of Disney and star
productions for Cherry Jones, Patrick Stewart and Derek Jacobi, things could be
looking up for New York theater.
</P>
<P>
	   There currently are no new plays running on Broadway, a situation that won't
be rectified until April. Three entries -- "Voices in the Dark," "Epic
Proportions" and "Wrong Mountain" -- arrived in the first half of the season,
and all of them quickly disappeared.
</P>
<P>
	   Raising the greatest expectations in the new-play department is
"Copenhagen," the London hit by Michael Frayn, author of the farcical "Noises
Off."
</P>
<P>
	   "Copenhagen," arriving April 11 at the Royale Theater, is anything but
farcical. A play about the morality of science, it concerns a fictional meeting
during World War II between two great physicists, the Dane Niels Bohr and Werner
Heisenberg, a German. Philip Bosco plays Bohr, Michael Cumpsty is Heisenberg and
Blair Brown portrays Bohr's wife, Margrethe.
</P>
<P>
	   Olympia Dukakis takes center stage in "Rose," a one-woman play by Martin
Sherman about a Jewish woman and her decades-long journey from the Ukraine to
the ghettos of Warsaw to Miami Beach. A production of Lincoln Center Theater,
"Rose," which received favorable reviews at London's Royal National Theater last
year, opens April 12 at the Lyceum.
</P>
<P>
	   A new Arthur Miller play on Broadway is an event, especially one that stars
Patrick Stewart. In "The Ride Down Mount Morgan," Stewart plays a successful
businessman whose near-fatal accident has some surprising consequences. Frances
Conroy portrays his embittered wife. The fireworks go off April 9 at the
Ambassador Theater.
</P>
<P>
	   Elaine May tests her considerable talent with a comedy, "Taller Than a
Dwarf," about a New York couple at the beginning of a new millennium. Matthew
Broderick and Parker Posey star. The opening is April 24 at the Longacre.
</P>
<P>
	   Director Julie Taymor, in her first Broadway venture since "The Lion King,"
brings theatergoers "The Green Bird," billed as a satirical Italian fairy tale,
on April 18 at the Cort. The ever-inventive Taymor will also create masks and
puppets for the show.
</P>
<P>
	   Comparisons will be inevitable between two productions called "The Wild
Party," both based on the same 1920s Jazz Age poem by Joseph Moncure March.
</P>
<P>
	   The first, at off-Broadway's Manhattan Theater Club, features Taye Diggs and
Idina Menzel and book, music and lyrics by Andrew Lippa. The premiere is Feb.
24. The second boasts the star power of Mandy Patinkin, Eartha Kitt and Toni
Collette. It has a score by Michael John LaChiusa and a book by LaChiusa and
George C. Wolfe, who also directs. Look for it April 13 at the Virginia Theater.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney does Broadway again, this time with "Aida," with a pop score by Elton
John and Tim Rice. The show features Heather Headley, Adam Pascal and Sherie
Rene Scott as the three points in an ancient Egyptian love triangle. The lavish
sets, which garnered great notices during the show's Chicago tryout, are by Bob
Crowley. The curtain rises March 23 at the Palace.
</P>
<P>
	   The folks at Lincoln Center Theater, knowing a good thing when they see it,
will move "Contact," done last fall at its smaller theater, into the larger
Vivian Beaumont. The critically cheered dance play, devised by choreographer
Susan Stroman and John Weidman, consists of three pieces about people trying to
connect. The new opening is March 30.
</P>
<P>
	   Two musical favorites return in April. "Jesus Christ Superstar," Andrew
Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's first success, has an April 16 opening at the Ford
Center for the Performing Arts. Newcomer Glenn Carter plays the title character.
</P>
<P>
	   Meredith Willson's "The Music Man" marches back to Broadway April 27 at the
Neil Simon Theater. Craig Bierko portrays the charming con man, Professor Harold
Hill, while Rebecca Luker is the properly suspicious Marian the librarian.
</P>
<P>
	   Revivals of plays boast some impressive casts.
</P>
<P>
	   Derek Jacobi, Laura Linney and Roger Rees will open the Roundabout Theater
Company's new theater on 42nd Street with a revival of Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya."
The opening is set for April 20.
</P>
<P>
	   Cherry Jones, who did "The Heiress" proud several seasons back, returns
March 19 in "A Moon for the Misbegotten" by Eugene O'Neill. Gabriel Byrne and
Roy Dotrice complete the cast at the Walter Kerr Theater.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising stars Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly were two of the best
things in the recent movie "Magnolia." Now they are joining forces to play
battling brothers in a remounting of Sam Shepard's "True West." Matthew Warchus,
who worked wonders with "Art," directs for an opening March 2 at Circle in the
Square.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time "The Real Thing" was on Broadway, its stars were Glenn Close
and the then little-known Jeremy Irons. Now the Tom Stoppard rumination about
love is back with a highly praised London production featuring Stephan Dillane
and Jennifer Ehle. Look for it April 17 at the Ethel Barrymore Theater.
</P>
<P>
	   And then there are some shows that don't quite fit any category.
Off-Broadway has had "Stomp" and "Thwak," so why shouldn't Broadway see
"Squonk," which is being billed as "a virtual live-theater music video." The
five-person production, which features music, dance and puppetry, opens Feb. 29
at the Helen Hayes Theater.
</P>
<P>
	   "Riverdance" has been breaking records all over the country and the world.
And its newest edition, "Riverdance -- on Broadway," is not just about the Irish
anymore.
</P>
<P>
	   South African sensation Tsidii Le Loka, who was in "The Lion King," has
joined the international cast, along with a South African choir to sing songs
from their country. And in the dance department, flamenco star Maria Pages will
also be featured. The extravaganza swirls into the Gershwin Theater for a March
16 opening.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   In March, Broadway begins to blossom again. The following list is likely to
change but includes all the openings between now and May -- plus one

<HEADLINE> Star Watch: Sigourney Weaver  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUGLAS J. ROWE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Sigourney Weaver can laugh about it now and break into a
silly song of survival: "I'm ... still ... HERRRRE!"
</P>
<P>
	   But for a long time it was no laughing -- or singing -- matter. The ditty's
directed at her Yale Drama School instructors who told her she had no talent,
and decimated her self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
	   So even though she's 50 and enjoyed a career that spans two decades-plus,
Weaver doesn't talk in retrospective terms of meeting or exceeding any goals she
may have had as an actress, as some people might at that stage in life.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had zero expectations," she says, recalling how her graduate school
experiences put her confidence left of zero.
</P>
<P>
	   Since she was shy anyway, their opinions were like a punch to the solar
plexus. And she suspects that her early roles might have been more varied if she
weren't so doubled over with doubt.
</P>
<P>
	   "It took me a long time to get over it. I think I'm finally over it this
year," she says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
	   So there you have it: A nominee for 2000's Gotten-Over-It Woman of the Year.
</P>
<P>
	   She's already been nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance as a
wife and mother whose life is nearly destroyed by the death of her best friend's
child and charges of child abuse in "A Map of the World." And she may receive a
matching Academy Award nomination on Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
	   She's also making movie audiences laugh as a buxom, blond bimbo in the
box-office hit "Galaxy Quest," a sendup of "Star Trek" and its fans.
</P>
<P>
	   "I said to my agent, 'If anyone's going to parody space movies, I'm a good
person to choose.' I've been there," says Weaver, who's been so memorable as
Ripley in the four "Alien" movies, including her screen debut in the 1979
original.
</P>
<P>
	   "And it was actually a relief to play someone who is afraid, and who's a
normal person in space and feels terribly out of place," she says, referring to
how intrepid Ripley was.
</P>
<P>
	   In earlier interviews, Weaver caused a small stir by saying that when she
put the blond wig on, she "didn't say an intelligent thing for months."
</P>
<P>
	   "The reason I said that was that I felt when I got the whole costume on --
and my character keeps talking about not being taken seriously -- I found it
hard to take myself seriously ... and I really do think other people found it
hard to take me seriously, too," she says, explaining that, while it was a joke,
it was also an expression of empathy.
</P>
<P>
	   She felt others were relating to her based on how she looked -- and she can
see how that has an impact on self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
	   Her character in "A Map of the World" has no self-esteem problems, and
Weaver was attracted to the role because she felt the woman was "so
uncompromisingly honest."
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a very liberating experience because I was brought up to be terribly
polite, and my mother's English, so of course you never talk about your real
feelings," says Weaver, the daughter of Sylvester "Pat" Weaver, the long-ago NBC
president credited with creating the "Today" and "Tonight" shows, and Elizabeth
Inglis, an actress who appeared in "The 39 Steps."
</P>
<P>
	   In between the two movies in theaters now, Weaver made a third movie last
year, "Company Men," playing a '50s housewife named Daisy who inadvertently
causes the Bay of Pigs.
</P>
<P>
	   Weaver, who has appeared on and off-Broadway, takes on a broad range of
roles because she's trying to recreate, as a movie actress, the experience of a
theater actress in a repertory company.
</P>
<P>
	   "In rep you always have three plays going at once, and you have a big part
in one -- you know, you get to play the leading lady, (for example) 'Hedda
Gabler' in one -- and then you play the maid in the next one," says Weaver, a
Tony nominee in 1985 for David Rabe's "Hurlyburly." "It's very good for the work
to go from drama to farce, or from Ibsen to Shakespeare to some Restoration
comedy ... or an old play to a new play."
</P>
<P>
	   Weaver has displayed that range throughout much of her career.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1989, she received Oscar nominations for very different roles in very
different movies: "Gorillas in the Mist" and "Working Girl." Likewise, in 1995
she appeared in "Copycat" and "Jeffrey" and in 1997 in "The Ice Storm" and
"Alien Insurrection." And she's built her varied career with the "Ghostbusters"
comedies, "The Year of Living Dangerously" and Roman Polanski's film adaptation
of "Death and the Maiden."
</P>
<P>
	   Weaver doesn't like to leave home for more than one movie a year because of
her family life, with husband Jim Simpson, who's a theater director, and
9-year-old daughter Charlotte. And she'd probably do more if more films were
made in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's much more about location than anything ... It's all about the school
year -- and what can shoot close to home."
</P>
<P>
	   Her husband has his own theater in downtown Manhattan, a small nonprofit
enterprise where he does mostly new plays.
</P>
<P>
	   "Also, having only one child I don't want to miss it because it goes so
quickly. There will be plenty of time to take work, I always feel," she says.
</P>
<P>
	   Come fall she may get back to her theater roots by appearing on Broadway,
although she can't offer details yet, and she doesn't discount the possibility
of a fifth "Alien" movie.
</P>
<P>
	   So in 20 years, you might see a white-haired Ripley hobbling around, she
jokes.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Movie Biz Fights at Home  </HEADLINE>
    By TINI TRAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Shot in southern Vietnam, the critically acclaimed
"Three Seasons" won top prizes at the Sundance Film Festival. Add to that the
string of awards that Vietnamese filmmakers have racked up at film festivals
worldwide, and the country's profile has rarely been higher.
</P>
<P>
	   So award-winning documentary director Le Manh Thich seems a little pained to
explain why these aren't the best of times for Vietnamese cinema.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can say that the quality and substance of the films are better than ever,
but it's difficult to be a filmmaker these days," Thich says. "I make movies
that few people see."
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the outside acclaim, Vietnam's movie industry is fighting on its
home turf against the pervasive presence of imported videos and television.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's ironic that many Vietnamese movies have won awards internationally,
but our industry in Vietnam is struggling," says director Nguyen Thi Hong Ngat,
head of the Vietnam Feature Film Company, the country's leading production
company.
</P>
<P>
	   Lines are rare outside the country's handful of antiquated cinemas (the
first to offer Dolby sound opened last year). Even the more popular films
usually play to half-empty theaters.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, video stores renting or selling pirated tapes or CDs have
mushroomed, despite a copyright-protection agreement with the United States.
Television, now accessible to most people in one of the world's poorest
countries, has become the standard source of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
	   Domestic film output has dropped by as much as 80 percent from the
industry's heyday in the early 1980s, when Vietnam was routinely producing 70-80
documentary films and 15-20 feature films a year.
</P>
<P>
	   During those peak days of central-government support, Ngat recalls,
Vietnam's leaders even built film studios on a 17,000-acre site at Co Loa, just
outside Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
	   "In those days, the country was poor, but we invested in films," she said.
"Vietnamese leaders were so romantic, they imagined building a Hollywood in Co
Loa. They built three-story blocks so that actors could have a place to live
during filming. There's still the remnants there."
</P>
<P>
	   During much of that period, Vietnam was in political isolation from the rest
of the world, so filmmakers had an almost captive audience. But in 1986, the
country embarked on market reforms and began opening its doors to the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign films flooded in from Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and the United
States, and cheap videocassette recorders made watching movies at home possible.
</P>
<P>
	   The homegrown film industries of other countries are suffering similar
problems. The added challenge in Vietnam, though, is that movie-making remains a
largely government-funded affair, with tight controls over artistic endeavors.
</P>
<P>
	   Thich's recent documentary of a 30th reunion of Vietnamese women guerillas
and their former American enemies won high praise at the Asian Pacific Film
Festival but has yet to be shown here.
</P>
<P>
	   "Though there have been more liberal policies on censorship, still there are
some problems. They would ban my film for not cutting out one sentence. It's not
right," Thich said.
</P>
<P>
	   Budget problems have reduced the annual allocation to under $500,000 for an
entire film studio, enough for maybe two or three movies a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Slower-paced and generally contemplative, Vietnam's movies tend to deal with
themes of peasant life, revolutionary fervor and the country's postwar
struggles.
</P>
<P>
	   Burdened with outdated production technology and fairly rigid creative
control, filmmakers cannot launch a truly competitive fight against Hong Kong's
kung fu epics and South Korea's soap operas.
</P>
<P>
	   "Local audiences themselves have also turned their back on Vietnamese films,
much less trying to sell (Vietnamese films) abroad," said Le Van Su, director of
the Vietnam Films Import-Export and Distribution Co. (Fafilm).
</P>
<P>
	   During one low period, Thich said, his documentary studio had to rent out
space to commercial businesses to stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
	   The hard times come as Vietnam's filmmakers are making a name for themselves
at festivals in Australia, China, Italy and the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Stirring particular interest has been "Three Seasons," by
Vietnamese-American director Tony Bui. Featuring mainly Vietnamese actors, as
well as executive producer Harvey Keitel, the story of four people's struggles
in chaotic postwar Vietnam swept three top prizes at Sundance late last month:
the Grand Jury Prize in dramatic competition, an award selected by audience
balloting and the cinematography award.
</P>
<P>
	   "Of course, it makes me very sad to see the current situation," said
director Ngat. "We have good actors but we don't have enough work. They have to
rotate. If they make a film one year, they don't make one the next year."
</P>
<P>
	   The exception has been Ly Huynh, Vietnam's equivalent of Hong Kong action
director John Woo. Huynh, who lives in Ho Chi Minh City, spent the better part
of 20 years acting before taking up directing a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Considered the most successful Vietnamese director and producer in recent
times, he was the first filmmaker in Vietnam to take advantage of a government
policy several years ago that allowed some private funding to finance films.
</P>
<P>
	   He is still the only filmmaker to make a profit investing his own money, and
is keenly aware of his colleagues' difficulties. But predictions of the demise
of Vietnamese movies are premature, Huynh says.
</P>
<P>
	   "People still like seeing films on the big screen. If you make a good movie,
people will come to see it," he said. "We need to be patient. Movies will be
popular again."

<HEADLINE> Hip-Hop Promoters Get MTV Show  </HEADLINE>
    By NEKESA MUMBI MOODY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- For almost 10 years, the Lyricist Lounge has been
synonymous with underground hip-hop, providing a showcase for unknown rap
artists struggling to become the next Eminem or Foxy Brown.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, both stars wowed Lyricist Lounge crowds with their skills before
they ever posted multimillion album sales or graced magazine covers.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we saw Foxy Brown ... she still was special because she was only 14 at
the time, and she was kicking tighter rhymes than the majority of the people in
the spot," says Danny Castro, 25, who helped start the Lounge. "We knew that she
was going to have a time to like, blow up."
</P>
<P>
	   Now the Lounge creators are hoping to provide even more exposure for
up-and-coming artists with "The Lyricist Lounge Show," which debuts on MTV
Tuesday (Feb. 8). Based in part on comedy sketches performed by Lounge rappers,
it features hip-hop artists from the Lounge performing with other actors in what
MTV calls a cross between "Saturday Night Live" and "In Living Color."
</P>
<P>
	   The rap skits are the most original and entertaining part of the show, which
can hit or miss with its irreverent and raunchy brand of humor. The show also
features guest appearances from Lounge alumni like Eminem and Mos Def. Ten
half-hour episodes were taped, and it may eventually become a regular MTV
series.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was just a natural progression for the Lyricist Lounge to go into
television, and I'm pleased because it was groundbreaking, in terms of having a
show that is comedy and also rhyme-sketch together," says Anthony Marshall, 26,
another Lounge creator. "Certain sketches are kind of like urban opera, because
its rhyming and a singsong type of thing in a story line. ... There's just a lot
of room for growth."
</P>
<P>
	   The Lounge has already grown exponentially since it was started in 1991 by
Marshall and Castro, then just teens immersed in the rap scene, breakdancing in
videos and rapping with friends.
</P>
<P>
	   "We really didn't know that many industry people at the time we first
started Lyricist Lounge -- it was mainly for our peers that were around us that
were getting into rhyming and just making tunes," says Castro. "We saw that
there was no outlet for them to go to rehearse their skills and also get
exposure from the public."
</P>
<P>
	   What started off as an open mike showcase in a Manhattan studio space owned
by a friend's father grew so popular that it branched out to clubs around the
country. The Lounge soon caught the eye of record industry bigwigs like Sean
"Puffy" Combs, who used one Lounge showcase to introduce an unknown Biggie
Smalls, aka the Notorious B.I.G.
</P>
<P>
	   "Eventually, word of mouth went around, more and more people started coming,
and we realized how powerful it was," Castro says.
</P>
<P>
	   As the Lounge grew in influence, Marshall and Castro joined Perry
Landesberg, a Lyricist Lounge fan who had a clothing company, to create Open MIC
Records. The fledgling label linked with Rawkus Entertainment to distribute the
first single from Lounge regular Mos Def, who has been critically acclaimed for
his rhyme artistry and lyrics. They also teamed with Rawkus to put out "Lyricist
Lounge: Volume One," a compilation of acts which toured several cities last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought there were a lot of people out there who would want compilations
of new artists," says Landesberg, 26. "Pretty much Anthony and Danny know where
the talent is, what's going to be like the new biggest thing before it comes
out."
</P>
<P>
	   Columbia Law School student Jacob Septimus, 27, also entered the mix when he
began filming Lounge showcases for the group and offering free legal advice.
Eventually, he became a partner in the venture, and Open MIC Records evolved
into MIC Media, broadening from records and showcases to merchandising,
television projects and Internet deals.
</P>
<P>
	   "The way we set up the company now is such that if there's an artist that
we're excited about, we can get them a record deal, we can put them on TV, we
can get them appearances in films, we can put them on the tour, we can get them
advertising contracts," says Septimus.
</P>
<P>
	   The budding moguls say their main goal is doing what's best for the artist.
After watching many artists get ripped off by record companies or get lost in
the avalanche of wannabes, they hope to make sure their artists don't succumb to
the pressures of the industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't just do deals with people -- we try to help them with their lives.
Because if you do a deal with someone who doesn't have their life together, that
deal is not really worth it," says Marshall.
</P>
<P>
	   And MIC Media appears to have the trust of its artists. Take Tony Matthews,
known as Master Fuol, who was on "The Lyricist Lounge Show" and has been signed
to a record deal with the company.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ain't nobody going to come here and try and change your style, and change
what you've already accomplished," he said. "It's like, up here, you can be you.
Anywhere else you go, they might want to candy coat it ... right here, the
artist knows best."
</P>
<P>
	   Matthews credits the Lounge showcase with giving him an outlet other than
the streets.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was one of them wild kids on the block with a whole bunch of energy, who
was either going to do good or do bad," he says. "I was on the wrong road, and
what happened was I ran into an older guy and he was like, 'You've got a lot of
energy, and you need to take that energy and direct it into something."'
</P>
<P>
	   Eventually, MIC Media hopes to provide more outlets for youth, on a grander
scale. "One of our main goals is to build Lyricist Lounge centers throughout the
nation, and then eventually worldwide," says Castro. "It will be like a
community center, because we feel like the youth need that right now."
</P>
<P>
	   And, says Marshall, they'd like to help budding entrepreneurs like they once
were.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just think a lot of times it's not just about what your stock is doing,
what your artist is doing," he says. "It's about the other people around you and
what everyone is doing together and trying to make ways for everyone to blow up
and stop being so selfish. ... It's hip-hop, and we're all growing together."

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Lower; Dow Down 129  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today as blue-chips slumped and
Internet shares faltered after an attack by hackers on several leading Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
	   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
129.68 at 10,827.92.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was down 15.92 at 1,425.80, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 23.39 at
4,404.11, reversing an early gain.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow's losses were broad based, with American Express down 3 7/8 at 159
1/8, Home Depot down 1 1/2 to 59 7/8 and Merck down 4 to 71 7/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares were pressured by a familiar worry, said Ned Riley, chief investment
strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. Investors fear old-line
industrial companies will be the first to see profits slide if the Federal
Reserve continues raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   "The economy is dictating that interest rates will go up," Riley said.
"That's limiting the leadership of the market to the companies that have very
rapid earnings growth."
</P>
<P>
	   One of those companies was Cisco Systems, which rose 6 3/64 to 130 55/64.
The company said late Tuesday that profits in its fiscal second quarter topped
analysts' expectations. Cisco also announced a 2-for-1 stock split, to take
effect March 22. The company has been one of the Nasdaq's strongest performers
in recent months as demand has soared for its computer networking equipment.

<P>
	   The broader technology sector was rattled by a spate of Web site attacks by
computer hackers.
</P>
<P>
	   In today's trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, shares of ETrade were down 
3/4 to 22 1/4 amid news the online broker had become the latest high-profile
victim to this week's spate of Web site attacks by computer hackers.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Amazon.com, eBay and Yahoo! slipped a day after Internet vandals
hacked into their Web sites, disrupting access for consumers. Amazon.com was
down 1 7/8 at 81 1/4 and eBay fell 6 1/2 to 163 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Buy.com, which also succumbed to the attack Tuesday as its shares traded
publicly for the first time, rose 3 3/16 to 28 5/16 today.
</P>
<P>
	   Yahoo!, the first target of this week's attacks, was down 12 1/4 at 364.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology shares have so thoroughly dominated the market in the past year
that some analysts fear that when they falter, the broader market falters as
well.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 497.83 million shares, ahead of Tuesday's
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.47 to 537.02.

<HEADLINE> Champion of Domesticity Made Easy  </HEADLINE>
    By BETH GARDINER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Katie Brown just LOVES Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
	   But she sometimes frets over the domestic diva's gourmet recipes and
fabulous home improvement schemes. They're so complicated -- and so costly.
</P>
<P>
	   So when Brown -- no slouch herself in the domesticity department -- got her
own homemaking show on the Lifetime cable network, she made simplicity her
touchstone.
</P>
<P>
	   One of a slew of imitators riding the wave of Stewart-stimulated interest in
hearth and home, Brown gears her craft and cooking tips toward career-minded 20-
and 30-somethings who hope to create cozy homes and tasty meals with a minimal
investment of time and money.
</P>
<P>
	   "You always have to ask yourself the question, 'Would anybody ever really do
this?"' said Brown, whose half-hour show "Next Door with Katie Brown" airs
weekdays at 9 a.m. EST and Saturdays at 1:30 p.m. "I want the answer to always
be yes."
</P>
<P>
	   The relentlessly upbeat Brown makes scented soaps and candles, mixes
martinis, experiments with flower arrangements and concocts fancy but
easy-to-replicate breakfast entrees. All with enough encouraging smiles to put
Martha to shame.
</P>
<P>
	   "Next Door" focuses on "how to do cool stuff if you don't have a ton of
money, you don't have a ton of time," explains Brown.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown isn't bothered by those who dub her show "Domesticity for Dummies" --
she thinks the tag is on target and says viewers appreciate her focus on the
basics. One recent show offered a primer on setting the dinner table, with an
oh-so-creative twist -- Brown draped swatches of fabric across her table and
tied napkins with long blades of grass. She decorates picture frames with birch
branches, cures her own olives, and makes book covers festooned with images of
flowers, leaves and post cards.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown, 36, thinks the Generation Xers who watch her show are longing for a
homeyness they may have lacked as children.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our generation was really the first generation of divorce," Brown said
during a recent interview, looking downtown hip in a wrinkled white-and-orange
shirt and green scarf, her short brown hair mussed and her hands splattered with
white paint from a morning's work. "We're all a little bit homesick, and we like
to daydream about having time to get fresh-baked cookies out of the oven."
</P>
<P>
	   The desire for domestic bliss only seems to grow with the harried pace of
modern life, Brown says. She hopes to show viewers that a busy work life doesn't
have to mean chaos at home -- pre-made pie crusts and pastry dough and
store-bought everything are staples of her recipes and decorating ideas.
</P>
<P>
	   "Women of my generation ... we get to pursue a life outside of the home, and
it's fantastic," she said. "But you still have this urge -- clearly I have it --
to nest, and make a home and learn how to cook.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't want to make stock from scratch," she continued. "But I still want
my family and people I love and my friends to know that I put some time in. So I
just try and take some of the steps out so that people can be domestic and proud
of it, and still have a life that doesn't just revolve around the hearth."
</P>
<P>
	   Brown's dumbed-down approach to homemaking may be catching on. Her show
draws an average of 371,000 viewers daily and 834,000 in its Saturday slot, very
respectable for a niche cable show. By contrast, the genre's Goliath, the
syndicated "Martha Stewart Living," gets about 1.9 million viewers per episode,
according to Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown learned her trade growing up in tiny Petoskey, Mich., surrounded by a
large extended family whose members gathered often for home-cooked meals.
</P>
<P>
	   "The biggest claim to fame for them was, 'How many did you feed last
night?"' Brown said, recalling her competitive aunts' answers: "'I fed 10!' 'I
fed 12!"'
</P>
<P>
	   She absorbed their nurturing inclinations and added a keen mind for business
and promotion. After struggling for several years as a would-be actress in New
York and starting a catering company in Los Angeles, Brown opened Goat, an L.A.
shop she crammed with antiques and eclectic what-nots. She soon began hosting
weekly dinner parties there, putting a long table in the middle of the store and
serving platters piled with food.
</P>
<P>
	   When she went home to Michigan three years ago planning to open a similar
shop near her parents' home on Mackinac Island, serendipity struck. Lifetime
executives, scouring the country for someone to host a down-to-earth homemaking
show, called a local official for help.
</P>
<P>
	   "Les, who runs the Chamber of Commerce, said, 'Yeah, Paul Brown's daughter
does that kind of thing,"' Brown said. "When he came down with this ripped-up
piece of paper in his hand and said 'Lifetime television called, they want to do
this show,' I thought it was my sisters playing a joke on me."
</P>
<P>
	   Many meetings and audition tapes later, "Next Door with Katie Brown"
premiered in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown is also working on a book about dinner parties, and spends much of her
time brainstorming new cooking and decorating ideas -- at a stylish SoHo
restaurant, she gushed over cut-glass salt-and-pepper shakers and admired
comfy-looking leather chairs.
</P>
<P>
	   But she tries not to get too wrapped up in the quest for domestic
perfection.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not that serious," she laughs. "I mean, if worse comes to worst, just
order pizza."
</P>

	   WOMEN WHO HATE: A "20/20" investigation has uncovered a growing trend in
hate groups: The rise of women leaders. Women are gaining power and being
recruited in many hate organizations, and the message seems to be that the best
way to keep a member is to raise one. In his first report for "20/20," anchor
Jack Ford speaks with some of these women about what they are fighting for, why
they are rising to power inside these groups run by men, and how they are
raising their children. It airs tonight at 10 p.m. EST on ABC.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Chris Elliott  </HEADLINE>
    By SAMANTHA CRITCHELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Chris Elliott doesn't consider himself an actor.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't really have any method for acting," Elliott said. He'll often
suggest another actor when his agent or manager approaches him with a part.
</P>
<P>
	   If not an actor, then what?
</P>
<P>
	   "I guess I'm a freak of nature, that's the best way to describe me," said
Elliott, who stars with Chevy Chase in the new movie "Snow Day."
</P>
<P>
	   He appeared with Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller in "There's Something About
Mary" and had his own TV series, "Get a Life," which ran on Fox from 1990-92.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott did sketch comedy on "Late Night With David Letterman" and later as
a cast member on "Saturday Night Live." He also wrote and starred in the 1994
film "Cabin Boy."
</P>
<P>
	   When pressed, Elliott defines himself as a comic actor, but qualifies the
characterization by saying that he has a career like no one else's.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm a guy who has kind of cut my own niche in this business," he said.
"It's never just 'let's get somebody funny for this part' or 'who is available?'
When people want me for a part, they are looking for me -- which is nice. It
might not happen that often, but I know when it does, they really want me."
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott, 39, is the son of Bob Elliott, half of the "Bob and Ray" comedy
duo. He joined "Late Night With David Letterman" as a writer in 1982. Over the
next four years, he won four consecutive Emmys for his writing on the show.
</P>
<P>
	   He calls Letterman his mentor, saying he still considers himself an
apprentice to the late-night talk-show host.
</P>
<P>
	   "I still -- to this day in everything that I do -- I think in my head, would
Dave think this is funny?" he explained.
</P>
<P>
	   In "Snow Day," Elliott plays Roger Stubblefield, an evil snowplow operator.
</P>
<P>
	   He describes the movie as a mix of comedy, physical humor and goofiness that
will keep both adults and children entertained.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a movie you can go to with your kids, and you won't feel like you are
wasting an hour and a half. I don't think there are enough movies like that,"
said Elliott, whose children are 9 and 12.
</P>
<P>
	   1. Were you the class clown in school?
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott: I was the class clown, but I was a reluctant class clown because I
was always and still am somewhat embarrassed by performing. I have terrible
stage fright and I don't like being in front of people.
</P>
<P>
	   2. Do you have a favorite character that you've created?
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott: I've only created one character and that's this persona of Chris
Elliott. I guess if somebody has never seen any of my work and they see 'Snow
Day' or 'Something About Mary,' they are seeing a character they've never seen
before. But really everything that I've done has this strain of nuttiness to it
-- sort of this psychopathic side that I really started developing at 'Late
Night.' The idea of a guy who is pretty much in his own world is pretty much who
I am.
</P>
<P>
	   3. So does that mean you're not interested in playing the romantic lead?
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott: What I just said is just the spin I'm putting on it. Of course I
want to be the romantic hero. I'm just covering myself if they don't come
asking.
</P>
<P>
	   4. Do your children think you are funny?
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott: If they did, they wouldn't tell me. I think they're just used to
me. They just think I'm weird. I never thought my dad was funny because I was
just used to it. I was just used to smiling or used to laughing.
</P>
<P>
	   5. What does your father think of your career?
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott: I think he is only proud. My humor may not always appeal to him but
he's told me how proud he is. We're very much alike. As we both get older, I
realize how similar I am to him in many ways. ... I've had basically the same
sort of career as he has, even though his work was more literary. He was more of
a humorist, and I'm a little more slapstick than my dad.

<HEADLINE> Kelis: The Lioness Roars  </HEADLINE>
    By DEEPTI HAJELA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Say what you want about astrology, but sometimes that stuff
is just on point. Do I hear the skeptics calling for an example? OK, here's one:
Kelis. The rising 20-year-old R&AMP;B star is a Leo. Boy, is she ever.
</P>
<P>
	   Everything about Kelis (pronounced Ka-LEASE) is leonine. She has a mane of
golden hair (with a dyed-green cast at the moment), tawny skin and a personality
that is a textbook of Leo's character traits.
</P>
<P>
	   Those born under the lion sign (July 23-Aug. 22) are creative (she's a
musician), extroverted (getting her to talk in an interview is NO problem) and
strong-willed (just ask her friends).
</P>
<P>
	   "I am the perfect description of a Leo," said Kelis in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Need more proof?
</P>
<P>
	   "Caught Out There," the first single from her debut "Kaleidoscope" album, is
a scorned woman's response to her cheating lover. The chorus has Kelis shouting,
"I hate you so much right now! AAAAHHHH!!!"
</P>
<P>
	   How's that for a roar? It's definitely an attention-getter, as is her Hype
Williams-directed video.
</P>
<P>
	   After she graduated from high school, Kelis was introduced to Chad Hugo and
Pharell Williams, a production duo known as the Neptunes, who have worked with
Mase, Ol' Dirty Bastard and SWV.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Neptunes, Kelis found people who share her understanding of music.
The result is an album that combines the sounds of the past and future: the jazz
and blues of her childhood with the percussive-heavy beats that are popular in
today's urban music.
</P>
<P>
	   "We just clicked," she said. "They're on another page, and I'm always trying
to get to another page."
</P>
<P>
	   Some members of the media have commented on the anger in her first song,
calling her the R&AMP;B Alanis Morissette. But Kelis has no fear of being
categorized as an "angry young woman."
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's natural for people to put you in a box," she said. "People are
weak and that's the only way they can comprehend something. If they are able to
understand me and say, 'Oh, she reminds me' of whatever, that to me is very
weak. But I understand why people feel the need to compare you."
</P>
<P>
	   Kelis' name is a combination of the first names of her parents, Kenneth and
Eveliss Rogers. Her mother is a Puerto Rican-Chinese designer. Her father, a
black musician and minister, died two days before she signed a deal with Virgin
Records last year.
</P>
<P>
	   She credits her father with instilling a love of music in her. "My
understanding of music comes from him. My taste in music comes from him."
</P>
<P>
	   Her mother gave her the drive to succeed.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mom -- she was the one who was hustling me to lessons," Kelis said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelis was born in the New York neighborhood of Harlem. She sang in the
choir, played the violin and attended Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music
&AMP; Art and Performing Arts in Manhattan, the school that was the basis for the
1980 movie "Fame."
</P>
<P>
	   Growing up wasn't easy. During her teen years, she had plenty of conflicts
with her parents and the people around her as she struggled to figure out who
she was and what she wanted.
</P>
<P>
	   "The teen-age years for me were really confusing and I don't like being
confused," she said. "Until I turned 18, I was mad at the world. I was mad I
didn't get it."
</P>
<P>
	   Now the singer, who is on the verge of stardom, can look back and marvel at
how far she's come.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would never go back to being a teen-ager," she said. "I am so thrilled to
be an adult, it's not even funny."

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Marc Anthony  </HEADLINE>
    By DEEPTI HAJELA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Singing sensation Marc Anthony understands fame. The
31-year-old has dealt with it for years, thanks to his global success with salsa
music.
</P>
<P>
	   He's had sellout crowds at Madison Square Garden, won a Grammy and is
nominated for another this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet there is something special about "Marc Anthony -- the Concert From
Madison Square Garden," which premieres Feb. 12 on HBO.
</P>
<P>
	   "The overwhelming feeling I get is that this is my debut after 20 years. ...
I'm really looking forward to it," he said prior to the show's taping.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony's sold-out performances at Madison Square Garden, where the program
was to be taped, are part of a two-month tour to promote his self-titled English
language album. After a one-month break, the tour will resume in other parts of
the globe.
</P>
<P>
	   Long before his single "I Need to Know" introduced him to the mainstream
American public, Anthony was a salsa star. He released three albums and became
the top-selling salsa singer in the world, according to Columbia Records.
</P>
<P>
	   Born and raised in New York to Puerto Rican parents, Anthony began singing
when he was a toddler. He started doing backup vocal work in his early teens. In
high school, he became involved in the freestyle scene, a genre of dance music
that was popular all along the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
	   His first salsa album was released in 1993. His third album won a 1999
Grammy for Best Tropical Latin Performance. This year he is nominated for Best
Male Pop Vocal Performance for "I Need to Know."
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony has appeared in four films. In 1998, he had a starring role in Paul
Simon's "The Capeman" on Broadway, which closed after just 68 regular
performances.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview in his 5,000-square-foot TriBeCa loft, the philosophical yet
fidgety Anthony talked about the craziness of fame, his acting and his feelings
about what has been called the "Latin explosion" in music.
</P>
<P>
	   1. What's the craziest thing you've had a fan do?
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony: This girl jumped up on stage and bit my face and she wouldn't let
go, and it got to the point where my face was getting swollen and she wouldn't
let go. ... She didn't break the skin, but it got to be really really painful
and I ran off to the side of the stage. ... I went back out and she was still
there and I couldn't even look at her. I stopped the show and said, 'You bit
me.' It's one thing to admire somebody and it's another to assault.
</P>
<P>
	   1 1/2. Do you know what happened to her?
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony: Every time I play Chicago, she's the one with the big sign, 'The
girl who bit your face.' She doesn't miss a show.
</P>
<P>
	   2. You started recording salsa because it was the only way to record a song
you loved. What made you decide to stick with it?
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony: What kept me there was the fact that once I got past that one song
... I understood it because I was subliminally cultured. I would tell my mom and
dad, 'Turn off that salsa,' but I understood it. That's when I realized that I
had so much to learn about my culture, about my people, about my island, about
my music about my food. ... I was like, 'Whoa.'
</P>
<P>
	   3. Is your music going to be recorded in English or Spanish in the future?
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony: It's going to be both. I'm both and I understand both and I'm
comfortable in both languages. ... Now I'm slated to record another salsa album,
which I'm dying to ... I feel the need. The thing is that it's spaced out in
such a way that I'm dying to record salsa now. So I'll record a salsa album and
I'll tour behind it and I'll promote it and then I'm like, 'Yeah, an English
album would be perfect,' and it will be that time.
</P>
<P>
	   4. You appeared on Broadway in "The Capeman," which didn't do too well.
Would you try anything like that again?
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony: You can say, 'Marc, you can have one year of unprecedented success,
a record-breaking year, or three experiences (where) you can walk away with what
you walked away with in 'The Capeman'; three experiences that weren't commercial
successes but were artistic successes.' I would take three 'Capeman'
(experiences) any day ... because what I learned made me what I am.
</P>
<P>
	   5. Obviously, everybody talks about you and Ricky Martin, Enrique Iglesias,
Jennifer Lopez, etc., being part of a "Latin-music explosion." It's not a label
you seem to be comfortable with. Why?
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony: It would be different if I were presenting the authentic Latin
music to the American public for the first time. ... But when my album's a pop
album and Ricky's album is a pop album and Jennifer's is a pop album and
Enrique's is a pop album and they call it Latin music and that's all they want
to talk about, there's nothing to talk about because it's not Latin music, so
let's stop it right there. ... It's all pop music. Why can't a Latino put out a
pop album, especially if they were born and raised in the U.S. and they
understand the culture?

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Crystal Gayle  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM PATTERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Crystal Gayle smiles politely, suppresses an eye
roll, then finally gives up and laughs out loud.
</P>
<P>
	   The singer, known for her flowing, long brown hair and streak of elegant
country music hits in the 1970s and '80s, had just been asked if Shania Twain's
pop-country hits had pushed country music too pop for its own good.
</P>
<P>
	   "What's country? What's pop?" she asks.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I lived in another time, I was definitely that cabaret singer
somewhere," she said. "Maybe it would be a cabaret in a honky-tonk, or a saloon
in the Old West."
</P>
<P>
	   Gayle's latest album typically discards musical labels. It's "Crystal Gayle
Sings the Heart &AMP; Soul of Hoagy Carmichael" (Platinum Records).
</P>
<P>
	   Gayle, 49, has wanted to do the album ever since working with the legendary
songwriter on a TV special shortly before his death in 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   Backed by an orchestra, Gayle delivers gorgeous vocals on the classics
"Stardust," "Georgia on My Mind" and "Heart and Soul."
</P>
<P>
	   "How many kids are playing that right now?" Gayle said of "Heart and Soul,"
the song that generations of children have repeatedly plunked out on the piano.
</P>
<P>
	   Gayle, the youngest sister of country music legend Loretta Lynn, was exposed
to an eclectic selection of music during her childhood, including the music of
Carmichael. Lynn grew up in the mountains of Kentucky. Gayle, who was born
Brenda Webb, was raised in Wabash, Ind. They're 16 years apart.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I first started, they'd say, 'You can't be Loretta Lynn's sister. You
don't sound like her,"' Gayle said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If my voice is a little bit different and it doesn't have the twang, it's
because when I grew up ... my dialect was a little of everything."
</P>
<P>
	   Lynn gave Gayle her start in the music business. Gayle joined the Lynn show
as a backup singer at 16. Lynn, who relished the hamburgers served by the
Krystal restaurant chain, suggested the stage name of Crystal.
</P>
<P>
	   Gayle's first hits were in the hard country style of Lynn, and sometimes
written by her, too. But Gayle didn't hit her stride until leaving Lynn's record
label Decca and signing with United Artists in 1972. She was paired with
producer Allen Reynolds, who became Garth Brooks' producer in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   Reynolds and Gayle crafted a middle-of-the-road sound to highlight the
singer's lush alto, and the hits started coming. "Don't It Make My Brown Eyes
Blue" and "Talking in Your Sleep," which crossed over to the pop charts, are
among the most memorable of her 18 No. 1 hits.
</P>
<P>
	   "Even then, that (pop) question was there," Gayle said. "When we did 'Don't
It Make My Brown Eyes Blue,' we weren't thinking it was going to be a big pop
hit. We didn't know. We just loved the song."
</P>
<P>
	   Gayle has recorded pop standards from the 1930s and '40s on her albums, and
she has tried to persuade record executives to let her do an album of them.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had just gotten a pass to do that, and that was right when (Linda)
Ronstadt brought hers out," Gayle said, speaking of Ronstadt's 1983 album
"What's New."
</P>
<P>
	   "It was not the perfect time for me to do it, 'cause they'd say, 'She's only
doing it now because of the Ronstadt record."'
</P>
<P>
	   Gayle feels free to do such projects now because she's been replaced by a
younger generation of singers on the country music charts. But her audience base
is still strong, and the Carmichael album lends itself to the performances with
local symphonies that she has favored in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   She performs between 50 to 80 times a year, and keeps busy raising her two
children and overseeing a fine gifts store she owns in Nashville. A long-planned
duet album with Lynn may happen this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every now and then, I think maybe I should do another commercial album. If
I felt like it could be viable, and people would really take it seriously, then
I would do it. It's a lot of effort.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd probably have more of chance to get (radio stations) to play it with a
pop album. I guess that's not out of the question either."
</P>

	   German stock market officials said Epcos, an electronic components business,
will be added to the DAX-30 index of leading companies if the planned merger of
Vodafone Airtouch PLC and Mannesmann AG goes through.
</P>
<P>
	   Standard &AMP; Poor's said its ratings on Vodafone remain on CreditWatch with

<P>
	   The networking company reported late Tuesday that operating income rose to
$906 million, or 25 cents a share, in its second quarter, up from $609 million,
or 17 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Cisco also announced plans
for a 2-for-1 stock split.

<HEADLINE> E. Coli Stricken Get Welcome News  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID KINNEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Researchers say they have moved a step closer to developing what could be
the first drug to save the lives of victims of an especially dangerous strain of
E. coli.
</P>
<P>
	   Infections from a strain called 0157:H7 kill 250 people in the United States
each year, many of them children 5 and under. The bacteria produce a poison that
works its way into the bloodstream and damages the kidneys.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers at the University of Alberta in Canada have created a new
"inhibitor": a five-limbed molecule armed with 10 grippers that are designed to
grab the toxins and escort them out of the body. Its designers call it
"Starfish."
</P>
<P>
	   In test-tube experiments, Starfish appears to be far more effective than the
other inhibitors undergoing testing.
</P>
<P>
	   If it works in humans, it would be a big step.
</P>
<P>
	   There are no vaccines or inhibitors for E. coli infections on the market,
and doctors say there is not much they can do to treat the related kidney
disorder besides giving patients dialysis and blood transfusions.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers say Starfish shows promise, but they are still testing its
effectiveness in humans.
</P>
<P>
	   "You'd have to make sure this molecule would end up in the right place in
the body, and also that it does not cause any toxicity problems itself. We don't
think it will," said David Bundle, a chemistry professor at Alberta.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
	   Starfish works because of its design. Each inhibitor molecule can latch onto
two toxin molecules, preventing them from binding to the body's cells. With its
multiple arms, Starfish binds to the toxins 1 million to 10 million times more
tightly than other inhibitors being tested, Bundle said.
</P>
<P>
	   E. coli became a major health concern in the 1980s and '90s after deadly
outbreaks, many of them blamed on undercooked hamburgers. About 70,000 Americans
are infected annually.
</P>
<P>
	   Adults get diarrhea and intestinal trouble, symptoms Starfish could not
stop. But Bundle's team thinks Starfish could prevent the kidney disorder,
called hemolytic uremic syndrome.
</P>
<P>
	   Each year, about 5,000 people infected with E. coli 0157:H7 contract HUS,
according to the Centers for Disease Control. Five percent of HUS sufferers die.
</P>
<P>
	   An inhibitor called Synsorb, which is in testing, might be able to mop up
the poisons in the intestine but cannot fight toxins that end up in the
bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
	   Dennis Lang, a researcher at the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, said Starfish's design appears to be a good advance, but
more testing is needed to determine whether it works.

<HEADLINE> IFC To Air Gay Film Festival  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Independent Film Channel coyly titles its Valentine's
Day marathon the "It Ain't Just Boy Meets Girl Festival."
</P>
<P>
	   The reality -- a four-film collection of gay and lesbian-theme movies -- is
still somewhat bold for television, where same-sex kisses are considered unusual
enough to make news.
</P>
<P>
	   IFC, a pay cable network that reaches 30 million, or roughly one-third, of
the nation's television homes, will kick off its festival with "Beautiful
Thing," a love story about two teen-age boys in London.
</P>
<P>
	   "What's great about what IFC is doing is they are tying it to a romantic
holiday, which is unusual," said Scott Seomin, entertainment media director for
the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. "In television, it seems like
there's an ongoing theme that it's OK to be a gay or a lesbian as long as it's a
punch line."
</P>
<P>
	   Gay TV characters tend to be the wisecracking next-door neighbor, with their
love lives left unexplored, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A televised gay film festival isn't unprecedented, though. Cable's Sundance
Channel has, for the last two years, run several homosexual-theme movies in
prime time in connection with Gay Pride Month, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   IFC said it was simply trying to come up with a gimmick. Last year its
Valentine's Day festival was "Love Stinks," and around the holidays it paid
tribute to director David Lynch with "The Lynch Who Stole Christmas."
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not making a political point," said Frances Berwick, the network's
senior vice president of programming. "We're just presenting great films."
</P>
<P>
	   The network hasn't heard any complaints from viewers and doesn't anticipate
any, Berwick said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other films, which run in order starting at 8 p.m. EST, include "Go Fish,"
about a relationship between two young women; "The Incredibly True Adventures of
Two Girls in Love," about a couple with different economic and ethnic
backgrounds; and "Love and Human Remains," about sexual and gender politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Seomin predicted large numbers of gays and lesbians would tune in.
</P>
<P>
	   "We just really never get to see the love lives, the heartaches and the
romantic joys between two men and two women," he said.

<HEADLINE> Automaker's Child Seat Safety Plan  </HEADLINE>
    By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With federal regulators pondering whether they should
start rating child safety seats, a major automaker began offering parents a free
seat checkup service, regardless of what kind of car they have.
</P>
<P>
	   Child safety seats prevent thousands of deaths and injuries annually, but
federal officials and safety experts say a large share of those in use are not
installed correctly, posing a possible hazard to children riding in them.
</P>
<P>
	   DaimlerChrysler Corp. began taking appointments Wednesday at 400 dealerships
in 80 cities for child seat checkups. Under the program, which will grow to
1,000 dealerships by year's end, even adults driving a competitor's vehicle can
ask DaimlerChrysler technicians if a child seat is properly installed and
children are buckled in properly.
</P>
<P>
	   Every year, parents struggle to install about 70 models of child car seats
in hundreds of types of cars with different back seats. Studies show more than
80 percent of child seats are improperly installed.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched its look at ways
to improve child seat safety, including a possible rating system, with a public
hearing on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Australia and Europe test safety seats and provide parents the results of
those tests, while Japan is considering a rating system, noted Stephen R.
Kratzke, NHTSA associate administrator for safety performance.
</P>
<P>
	   If a rating system is developed it needs to include real-world performance,
not just crash-test results, Stephanie M. Tombrello of SafetyBeltSafe U.S.A.
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "A rating system that is simply a star system can hinder safety because
parents stop asking questions," she said. Parents need instructions in correct
installation, Tombrello said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kathleen Weber of the University of Michigan Medical School suggested the
possibility of a weighted rating system that included explanations of tradeoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Not all test data are of equal importance," she said, noting that
measurements of head movement, chest acceleration and knee movement in a crash
are among pieces of information collected.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert B. Waller, Jr., who represents car seat manufacturers, said a single
rating system could be misleading. A single rating could lead manufacturers to
sacrifice in one area, such as compatibility with various vehicles, in favor of
some other factor that weighs more in the rating, said Waller, of the Juvenile
Products Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   That could result in angry consumers, frustrated that what they thought was
the "best" seat won't fit in their car, he said. He suggested improved
instructions and warning labels for the seats, adding that some current
mandatory labeling requires a 12th grade education to understand.
</P>
<P>
	   Another safety agency, the National Transportation Safety Board, called
attention to the problem of wrongly installed seats, urging creation of a
network of permanent "fitting stations" for child seats that the government,
automakers and private safety agencies would operate jointly.
</P>
<P>
	   NTSB Chairman Jim Hall urged automakers to also to offer checkups as a
permanent feature in every dealership.
</P>
<P>
	   Traffic accidents are the leading cause of death for children 14 and
younger. Properly used child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in half,
government officials say, but inspections indicate many parents do not know they
are using the seats incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
	   Susan Cischke, DaimlerChrysler's vice president of regulatory affairs, said
their research found that 96 percent of drivers with child seats believed the
seats were installed properly -- even though less than 20 percent were.
</P>
<P>
	   Cischke said some of the more common mistakes were getting the wrong
sized-seat for the child and moving an infant into a forward-facing seat too
quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the NTSB recommendation, General Motors Corp. financed periodic
checkups at their dealerships with help from a private safety group, the
National Safe Kids Campaign. Under the program, more than 45,000 child seats
have been inspected since 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   And starting this month, GM will have a minivan in each state that will be
used to conduct car seat clinics at different sites.
</P>
<P>
	   But until DaimlerChrysler's announcement, no automaker offered parents the
chance to make an appointment at dealerships on such a wide scale.
</P>
<P>
	   DaimlerChrysler said parents who want an appointment for a checkup should
call 1-877-FIT-4-A-KID or visit the Internet site www.fitforakid.org.

<HEADLINE> Automaker Offers Seat Safety Tips  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Federal regulators and automakers launched efforts Wednesday to improve the
safety of children riding in cars. As part of its effort, DaimlerChrysler
included the following safety tips:
</P>
<P>
	   -- For babies under one year of age and less than 20 pounds, be sure they
ride in rear-facing restraints in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
	   -- If less than a year and over 20 pounds, be sure they ride in a seat
approved for heavier babies and continue to ride rear facing until a year old.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Those children over age 1 and at least 20 pounds should ride forward
facing until they reach 40 pounds.
</P>
<P>
	   -- For children over 40 pounds be sure they ride in booster seats until they
are big enough to fit in an adult seat belt, usually 60-80 pounds.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Old or used child safety seats should not be used unless you are certain
they have never been in a crash, have all the parts, including instructions and
have been checked for recalls.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Remember: Never place a child safety seat in front of a passenger air
bag.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Always read both the vehicle owner's manual and the instructions that
come with the child safety seat.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Kids of all ages are safest when properly restrained in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
	   -- It's important to remember that the best child safety seat is the one
that correctly fits the child, the vehicle and is used correctly every time.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Do the right thing -- always buckle up, and make sure your passengers do
too!

<HEADLINE> Goodyear Earnings Drop in 4th Q  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- The Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. said Wednesday its
earnings fell sharply in the fourth quarter, but they still beat Wall Street
estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income was $40.8 million, or 26 cents a share, in the October-December
period, compared with $121.5 million, or 78 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding special items, such as restructuring charges, earnings were $47.6
million, or 30 cents a share, in the fourth quarter compared with $115 million,
or 74 cents a share, a year earlier. That beat the 28 cents expected by analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the period totaled $3.55 billion, up 11 percent from $3.2 billion
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Goodyear's shares were changing hands at $23.68 3/4, up $1.62 1/2 or about 7
percent, Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Goodyear reduced its work force by 5,800 last year, but still employs more
than 105,000 people in its 90 facilities worldwide. It also agreed last year to
an alliance with Japan's Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd., which gave Goodyear
control of Dunlop tire operations in North America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Samir Gibara, the company's chairman, chief executive and president, call
the 1999 earnings report disappointing but added: "Goodyear has laid the
groundwork for significant improvement in 2000 and into the future."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the company aimed to sell 20 percent more tires this year.

<HEADLINE> Deutch Case Prompts Wider Security  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prompted by former CIA Director John Deutch's mishandling
of classified material, Congress is pursuing investigations of recent security
lapses, including the State Department bugging and Pentagon clearances issued to
felons.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans used the reports to press a broad attack against what House
Intelligence Committee Chairman Porter Goss, R-Fla., called a Clinton
administration ``culture of disdain about security.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate Intelligence Committee, meanwhile, turned its attention to
determining why it took current CIA Director George Tenet more than two years to
act against Deutch.
</P>
<P>
	   Last August, Tenet stripped Deutch of his clearances. An inquiry had begun
in December 1996 when CIA officials learned Deutch violated security rules by
working on highly classified home computers that were also connected to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee chairman, Sen. Richard Shelby, was trying to negotiate with
Deutch's lawyers for Deutch to appear voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby, R-Ala., also said he will ask the committee to widen the scope of
its inquiry and to call top CIA officials and representatives of the Justice
Department and FBI to appear, along with further testimony from Tenet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're digging into this. We're not satisfied at this moment on the
explanations,'' Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch, a former deputy defense secretary, volunteered Tuesday to give up
his Defense Department clearance, which he had retained even after being
stripped of CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency clearances.
</P>
<P>
	   The Deutch case has drawn congressional attention to other recent security
lapses, including the discovery in December of a listening device at the State
Department in a seventh-floor conference room. A Russian found monitoring the
transmissions from his car parked outside the department was expelled from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   That episode was followed by an internal inspector's general report that
found the State Department had allowed visitors, contractors and maintenance
workers to roam its building unescorted.
</P>
<P>
	   The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on international
operations, Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., plans to investigate security breaches at
the State Department. He will hold hearings after the department conducts its
own review.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va., has
announce he will hold hearings to investigate the Pentagon's security clearance
program.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon faces a backlog of about 700,000 applications for
building-access passes. Also, a Pentagon review panel recently has come under
criticism for giving security clearances to employes of defense contractors who
had criminal records, financial problems and histories of drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, has asked for a review of such practices. ``These
security lapses are especially disturbing given the nature of information
handled by the Pentagon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Adding to the number of investigations, the CIA has asked a presidentially
appointed commission that oversees the intelligence community to conduct its own
investigation of the Deutch case and the way it was handled by Tenet and other
top CIA officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., chairman of the President's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board, agreed to take on the review.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., appointed Goss and Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., as heads
of a new bipartisan panel that will review the performance of the National
Reconnaissance Office, the agency that operates intelligence satellites.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of that system was knocked out for several hours at the beginning of
the year by a Y2K glitch.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today as blue-chips slumped and
Internet shares faltered after an attack by hackers on several leading Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 167.22 at 10,790.38.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was down 19.92 at 1,421.80, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 40.07 at
4,387.43, reversing an early gain.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow's losses were broad based, with American Express down 5 at 158, Home
Depot down 1 15/16 to 59 7/16 and Merck down 4 3/16 to 71 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft fell 4 3/16 to 105 3/4 on the news that European Union regulators
have opened an examination into the launch of Microsoft's new Windows 2000
operating system. Mirroring antitrust concerns in the United States, several
competitors have complained that Windows 2000 would give Microsoft a dominant
position in the software market, EU officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares were also pressured by familiar worries about rising interest rates,
said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in
Boston. Investors fear old-line industrial companies will be the first to see
profits slide if the Federal Reserve continues boosting rates.
</P>
<P>
	   "The economy is dictating that interest rates will go up," Riley said.
"That's limiting the leadership of the market to the companies that have very
rapid earnings growth."
</P>
<P>
	   One of those companies was Cisco Systems, which rose 5 1/4 to 130 1/16. The
company said late Tuesday that profits in its fiscal second quarter topped
analysts' expectations. Cisco also announced a 2-for-1 stock split, to take
effect March 22. The company has been one of the Nasdaq's strongest performers
in recent months as demand has soared for its computer networking equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader technology sector was rattled by a spate of Web site attacks by
computer hackers.
</P>
<P>
	   In today's trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, shares of ETrade were down 1
7/32 to 21 5/32 amid news the online broker had become the latest high-profile
victim of Internet vandalism.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Amazon.com, eBay and Yahoo! slipped a day after Internet vandals
hacked into their Web sites, disrupting access for consumers. Amazon.com was
down 5/8 at 82 1/2 and eBay fell 6 1/2 to 163 1/4. Yahoo!, the first target of
this week's attacks, was down 14 11/16 at 361 9/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Buy.com, which also succumbed to the attack Tuesday as its shares traded
publicly for the first time, rose 2 1/2 to 27 5/8 today.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology shares have so thoroughly dominated the market in the past year
that some analysts fear that when they falter, the broader market suffers as
well.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 12-to-7 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 723.01 million shares, ahead of Tuesday's
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.65 to 536.84.

<HEADLINE> AFL-CIO To Aid Teamsters Strike  </HEADLINE>
    By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Contract talks in the 3-month-old Teamsters strike
against Overnite Transportation Inc. resumed Wednesday, just after the AFL-CIO
gave picketing truckers a boost by pledging $500,000 to help escalate the labor
conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   Teamsters spokesman David Cameron said the AFL-CIO money would help finance
an advertising campaign to let Overnite customers and the public know about the
union's struggle with the company, and to pay to lobby members of Congress and
shareholders of Overnite's parent company, Omaha, Neb.-based Union Pacific Corp.
to get involved.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've joined with the Teamsters in asking Overnite customers to tell the
company to respect the decision of its employees to join a union," AFL-CIO
President John Sweeney said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Company spokesman Ira Rosenfeld said "Overnite is hopeful that the Teamsters
will in fact agree to the benefits package" offered.
</P>
<P>
	   The contract talks in Chicago, which resumed after a six-month lull, cover
about 1,800 workers at 22 Overnite terminals where the company recognizes the
union. The Teamsters say they have won votes to represent 3,600 workers at 37 of
Overnite's 166 terminals, however.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Labor Relations Board ruled in November that Overnite engaged
in actions that unfairly hindered the Teamsters' five-year effort to organize
workers at the Richmond-Va.-based company. The NLRB said the efforts included
offering raises and new benefits to workers at Overnite terminals who voted not
to unionize.
</P>
<P>
	   The NLRB has ordered the company to recognize Teamsters' representation of
workers at some Overnite terminals where the company disputed the union's
authority. However, Overnite has appealed that decision and accused the
Teamsters of causing a breakdown in contract negotiations last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   On Oct. 24, the Teamsters started using strike tactics against the company.
While many Overnite drivers are continuing to make deliveries, some, joined by
Teamsters from other companies, are following Overnite trucks to their
destinations and picketing at delivery sites.
</P>
<P>
	   Overnite has filed a lawsuit seeking $5.2 million from the Teamsters,
accusing them of a string of illegal activities aimed at extorting a contract
from the company or putting it out of business.
</P>
<P>
	   Police have said several acts of violence appear to be strike-related. The
most serious came Dec. 1, when William Wonder, of Evansville, Ind., was shot in
the stomach as he drove from Overnite's Memphis hub.
</P>
<P>
	   Overnite competes in the less-than-truckload market, consolidating small
shipments. The company has terminals in the United States, Canada, Mexico,
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- European stocks were mixed Wednesday, though media stocks
surged higher, led by Reuters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks companies in countries that
joined the single currency, closed up 0.64 points at 438.94. The Dow Jones Euro
Stoxx 50 Index rose 15.6 points to 5191.8.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Dow Jones Stoxx Index, which tracks shares in over 600 European
companies, was little changed, down 0.03 point at 382.35, while the Dow Jones
Stoxx 50 Index fell 5.6 points to 4844.4.
</P>
<P>
	   A surge in media shares led European gains throughout the session.
</P>
<P>
	   Portfolio reshuffling by fund managers following the Vodafone-Mannesmann
tie-up boosted Deutsche Telekom and Canal Plus.
</P>
<P>
	   Merger and acquisition news and speculation has fueled gains in media shares
since Reuters Group said Tuesday it's planning to spend some $800 million over
the next four years migrating to the Internet and linking businesses in new
joint venture companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Reuters were up 16.6 percent, after closing up 23 percent Tuesday.
The Dow Jones media sector index rose 6.5 percent, and the technology sector up
1.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Workers Go On Strike  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Engineers and technicians walked off the job today at Boeing
Co. after last-ditch talks with a federal mediator failed to produce an
agreement on a labor contract.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately known how many members of the Society of Professional
Engineering Employees in Aerospace joined the strike.
</P>
<P>
	   The union, Boeing's second-largest, represents about 22,000 engineers,
scientists, manual writers, computer software designers and technicians in
Washington, Kansas, Florida, California, Oregon, Texas and Utah. About 13,000
are actual union members.
</P>
<P>
	   Union spokesman Bill Dugovich predicted a significant number of non-members
would honor picket lines.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between Boeing and the union had been overseen by C. Richard Barnes,
director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. But negotiations
broke off Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is mediation. It's not magic," Barnes said. "So we will attempt to
continue to work with them and hopefully at some point we will be able to help
them reach a satisfactory agreement."
</P>
<P>
	   No further talks were scheduled.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing's stock fell $2.06 1/4 a share, or 5 percent, to $38.75 in midday
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 10,000 SPEEA members rallied this morning at Renton Memorial Stadium,
near Boeing's plant south of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   "They walked in, they thought they could bully us, and they were wrong,"
union Executive Director Charles Bofferding told the crowd to loud cheers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've had it," Stan Sorscher, a Boeing physicist and member of the
engineers' negotiating team said before the rally. "Our job security and our
company and our product are at stake here."
</P>
<P>
	   Strikers set up outside the gates of the Boeing Renton plant, and motorists
honked their horns in support as rallygoers chanted in the background.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter B. Conte, a Boeing spokesman, said late this morning the company was
still measuring the effects of the walkout.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't have a history of strikes with this union, so we don't have that
level of detail to fall back on," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The union has no strike fund and never before has attempted a full-scale
walkout. Its only previous strike was a one-day walkout in 1992, but union
leaders promised to disrupt Boeing's operations.
</P>
<P>
	   The union has sought more guaranteed pay raises and bonuses similar to those
received by production workers represented by the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Boeing has insisted on mostly selective pay
hikes, reductions in life insurance benefits and some changes in health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing made its first contract offers to union members Nov. 11. Union
members rejected the company's latest three-year contract offers last week.

<HEADLINE> EU Delays Decision on U.S. Beef Ban  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union on Wednesday postponed for a
month a decision on banning hormone-free beef imports from the United States, to
give U.S. authorities time to implement tighter controls to ensure the meat
really is free of growth hormones.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU already has a ban on hormone-treated beef, claiming it poses a health
risk.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the United States rejects the claim that beef hormones are a human
health hazard, Washington voluntarily suspended exports of hormone-free beef
last July after EU tests found some 12 percent of such meat in fact contained
hormone residues.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, the European Commission said its veterinary experts accepted
the U.S. was improving its monitoring program to ensure unauthorized substances
are detected.
</P>
<P>
	   "The U.S. has given strong assurances that they will immediately take
actions to rectify the current weakness of their system," a statement from the
EU executive body added. The EU will look at the issue again March 15, the
Commission said.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States last year successfully challenged the ban on
hormone-treated beef at the World Trade Organization which authorized Washington
to apply sanctions on EU goods to compensate for some $116.8 billion in lost
trade.

<HEADLINE> Connie Stevens Loses Case on Appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A state appeals court reinstated a jury's $4.3 million
damage award against actress Connie Stevens on Tuesday. The lawsuit was brought
by a former manager who said Stevens had promised him 10 percent of the profits
on a new cosmetics line.
</P>
<P>
	   Norton Styne said he helped Stevens develop the "Forever Spring I" line of
beauty products and arranged for her to sell it on the Home Shopping Network.
</P>
<P>
	   He won the $4.3 million verdict two years ago from a Superior Court jury.
But Judge Reginald Dunn threw out the verdict and ordered a new trial, saying he
should have let the jury decide whether the alleged agreement was void due to
the fact that Styne wasn't licensed by the state as a talent agent.
</P>
<P>
	   The 2nd District Court of Appeal overruled Dunn and said Stevens wasn't
allowed to wait until after an unfavorable jury verdict before raising the issue
of Styne's lack of a license.
</P>
<P>
	   Stevens appeared as Cricket on the television series "Hawaiian Eye" from
1959 to 1963 and recorded the hit song '16 Reasons."
</P>

campaign of electronic assaults against the biggest names in
cyberspace, disrupting access for consumers. ETrade said its web
site was attacked but customer accounts were never compromised.
Spokesman Patrick DiChiro said that fewer than one-fifth ETrade
customers were affected by the clogged traffic for about 90 minutes
before the company blunted the attack, he said. ZDNet.Com, a

	   EU Regulator Examining Windows 2000
</P>
<P>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union's top antitrust
official said today that EU regulators had opened an examination
into the launch of Microsoft Corp.'s new Windows 2000 operating
system. Mario Monti, the EU competition commissioner, told
journalists that several competitors had complained that Windows
2000 would give Microsoft a dominant position in the software
market. Monti said the European Commission has asked Microsoft for
more information. Microsoft has four weeks to respond to the
request. Microsoft officials said today that the company will
comply fully with the EU's request for information, and that the
investigation would not interfere with making Windows 2000
commercially available. Microsoft stock was down 4 3/16 at 105 3/4 in
afternoon trading.

	   Goodyear Earnings Drop in 4th Q
</P>
<P>
	   AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- The Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. said Wednesday
its earnings fell sharply in the fourth quarter, but they still
beat Wall Street estimates. Net income was $40.8 million, or 26
cents a share, in the October-December period, compared with $121.5
million, or 78 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding special
items, such as restructuring charges, earnings were $47.6 million,
or 30 cents a share, in the fourth quarter compared with $115
million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier. That beat the 28
cents expected by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson
Financial. Sales for the period totaled $3.55 billion, up 11

current and four former employees contend that Coca-Cola has
discriminated against blacks in pay, promotion and performance
evaluations. The lawsuit seeks to expand the case to represent more

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Defend Military Retirees  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Contending it is time for the nation to start keeping its
promises to military retirees, lawmakers pressed Wednesday for legislation to
restore full health care access for all retired career servicemen.
</P>
<P>
	   Military retirees have been ``lost in the shuffle'' in the health care
debate, said Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., co-sponsor of legislation in the Senate
with Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga. ``We're addressing a problem that frankly is
shameful,'' Johnson told a Capitol Hill news conference filled with veterans.
</P>
<P>
	   The Johnson bill and an identical House bill would allow military retirees
who entered military service before June 7, 1956, to enroll in the health care
program for federal civilian retirees -- the Federal Employee Health Benefits
Program -- with the government paying 100 percent of costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Those entering after 1956, when the military health care plan CHAMPUS was
enacted into law, could enter FEHBP under the same conditions as civilian
retirees. At age 65, they could either stay in FEHBP or participate in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Charles Norwood, R-Ga., chief sponsor in the House with Rep. Ronnie
Shows, D-Miss., said there's no official calculation yet of the cost of the
legislation but it could be between $8 billion and $10 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So what? That absolutely means nothing to me. We gave our word,'' Norwood
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Those who entered the service before 1956 were promised free health care for
life if they retired after 20 years. After 1956, all retirees were entitled
either to free care at a military facility on a space-available basis or could
sign up with an insurance plan, for many the HMO-like Tricare program. At age
65, all retirees are switched to Medicare coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   One problem, said Norwood, is that ``Tricare is one of the worst HMOs in
America.'' Reimbursement rates are only about 75 percent of what Medicare pays,
he said, making it difficult to find providers and forcing many veterans to pay
thousands of dollars out of pocket before applying to the program for
reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
	   In testimony to Congress Wednesday, Defense Secretary William Cohen said,
``We have made a pledge, whether it's legal or not, it's a moral obligation that
we will take care of all of those who served, retired veterans and their
families, and we have not done so. There are big bills involved in this. This is
no small matter.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, added that career
servicemen were promised a lifetime of support and ``in their minds, we have
broken that commitment. And I think we have.''
</P>
<P>
	   Shows said they have 260 co-sponsors in the House, well above a majority,
and are ready to force the Republican leadership and the administration to act
on the issue this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're nervous about it because they know it's an issue, a big issue out
there,'' Shows said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 133.72; Nasdaq Downd 19.38  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today as blue-chips slumped and
Internet shares faltered after an attack by hackers on several leading Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
	   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 133.72 at 10,823.88.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was down 15.69 at 1,426.03, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 19.38 at
4,408.12, reversing an early gain.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow's losses were broad-based, with American Express down 5 1/8 at 157
5/8, Home Depot down 1 13/16 to 59 9/16 and Merck down 4 1/4 to 71 3/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft fell 3 3/16 to 106 3/4 on the news that European Union regulators
have opened an examination into the launch of Microsoft's new Windows 2000
operating system. Mirroring antitrust concerns in the United States, several
competitors have complained that Windows 2000 would give Microsoft a dominant
position in the software market, EU officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing fell 1 15/16 to 38 7/8 after last-ditch talks with a federal mediator
failed to produce an agreement on a labor contract and engineers and technicians
walked off the job.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares were also pressured by familiar worries about rising interest rates,
said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in
Boston. Investors fear old-line industrial companies will be the first to see
profits slide if the Federal Reserve continues boosting rates.
</P>
<P>
	   "The economy is dictating that interest rates will go up," Riley said.
"That's limiting the leadership of the market to the companies that have very
rapid earnings growth."
</P>
<P>
	   One of those companies was Cisco Systems, which rose 4 1/16 to 128 7/8. The
company said late Tuesday that profits in its fiscal second quarter topped
analysts' expectations. Cisco also announced a 2-for-1 stock split, to take
effect March 22. The company has been one of the Nasdaq's strongest performers
in recent months as demand has soared for its computer networking equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader technology sector was rattled by a spate of Web site attacks by
computer hackers.
</P>
<P>
	   In today's trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, shares of ETrade were down
3/4 to 22 1/4 amid news the online broker had become the latest high-profile
victim of Internet vandalism.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Amazon.com, eBay and Yahoo! slipped a day after Internet vandals
hacked into their Web sites, disrupting access for consumers. Amazon.com was
down 5/8 at 82 1/2 and eBay fell 4 7/8 to 164 7/8. Yahoo!, the first target of
this week's attacks, was down 9 15/16 at 366 5/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Buy.com, which also succumbed to the attack Tuesday as its shares traded
publicly for the first time, rose 2 1/4 to 27 3/8 today.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology shares have so thoroughly dominated the market in the past year
that some analysts fear that when they falter, the broader market suffers as
well.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 12-to-7 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 837.68 million shares, ahead of Tuesday's
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.85 to 538.34.

<HEADLINE> Allstate Profits Fall 18 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Allstate Corp.'s fourth-quarter operating profits fell 18
percent, even excluding large charges for restructuring and acquisitions, as
higher auto claims and stiffer competition continued to hammer the troubled
insurer.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's earnings report still exceeded analysts' lowered expectations,
but Allstate's stock quickly fell to a new 52-week low. In midafternoon trading,
the company's shares were down $1.93 3/4, or nearly 9 percent, to $20.06 1/4 on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The Northbrook, Ill.-based company said October-December operating earnings,
excluding one-time charges, were $524 million, or 66 cents a share, down from
$641 million, or 78 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had forecast earnings of
64 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income for the quarter, including the special charges, was $425 million,
or 54 cents a share, compared with $760 million, or 93 cents a share, a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues were $7.01 billion in the quarter, up 8.6 percent from $6.45
billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Allstate is the second-biggest U.S. company in personal-lines insurance --
automobile, home and life insurance -- behind privately-held State Farm.
</P>
<P>
	   "Things are tough at Allstate right now," said Steve Musser, an analyst for
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. "There's a lot of uncertainty."
</P>
<P>
	   Musser said the unexpected departure of top executive Bruce Marlow was a big
blow to Allstate. Marlow on Tuesday was named president and chief executive at
21st Century Insurance Group in Woodland Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   At Allstate, Marlow was president of Allstate's Independent Agency Markets,
a division that handles the insurer's independent agents. He led efforts at the
company to use the Internet in transactions with independent brokers and "was
seen as a tremendous leader" in building that business, Musser said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reacting to Marlow's departure, Salomon Smith Barney cut its investment
rating for Allstate to "neutral" from "buy," Dow Jones News reported.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, operating earnings excluding items were $2.19 billion, or
$2.73 a share, compared with $2.57 billion, or $3.08 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income was $2.72 billion in 1999, compared with $3.29 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues were $26.96 billion, up 4 percent from $25.88 billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> German Films Showcased At Festival  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL GEITNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- In its 50th year showcasing German films, the Berlin
International Film Festival opened Wednesday with a premiere of German director
Wim Wenders' latest work, "The Million Dollar Hotel."
</P>
<P>
	   The romantic thriller showed just how cross-cultural filmmaking has become
since the festival's early days, when directors like Ingmar Bergman and Francois
Truffaut made their highly stylized marks in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Million Dollar Hotel" was financed in Germany, but Wenders shot it in
English in Los Angeles. It is based on a story co-written by Irish rock star
Bono, and stars the Hollywood powerhouse Mel Gibson.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference after the film's first screening, Wenders expressed his
delight at returning to Berlin and the newly rebuilt Potsdamer Platz, where he
shot one of his first successful films, "Wings of Desire," 15 years ago when the
square was still a no man's land in the shadow of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
	   "It'd be an honor for any director on the planet to be here, but for me it's
highly emotional," he said. "I never would have dreamed it."
</P>
<P>
	   His is one of three German movies among 21 in competition at the festival.
But it's the six Hollywood juggernauts, including "The Beach" and "The Talented
Mr. Ripley," that attract the most attention, with their posters plastered all
around the theaters where the festival is being held.
</P>
<P>
	   German President Johannes Rau spoke out for "cultural variety" and warned
that allowing big studios with deep pockets -- namely Hollywood -- to gain too
much market power could lead to a "leveling of cultural traditions."
</P>
<P>
	   "I wish that German films in the coming year contribute strongly to this
variety -- perhaps a little more strongly," Rau said in remarks prepared for his
opening night address.
</P>
<P>
	   Culture Minister Michael Naumann told German radio earlier that the problem
with German and European films lies not with quality, but with marketing and
distribution. If European distributors spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
advertising their films, he said, those films also would be big hits.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted the recent listing in Frankfurt of German production companies, and
said film distributors should make more money available to German filmmakers "to
be able to compete with their high-financed American competitors."
</P>
<P>
	   By Hollywood standards, Wenders' film was made for next-to-nothing: less
than $20 million. To save money, it was done entirely on digital video, which
Wenders noted also made it easier and cheaper to add special effects, such as
lighting up the neon sign on the roof of the decrepit hotel. The finished
product was then transferred to film.
</P>
<P>
	   Having the lead singer of a popular band like U2 as co-author also goes a
long way toward generating free publicity. Wenders may have been sitting center
stage at his post-screening news conference, but most of the questions from the
world media were directed at Bono, who also provided the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
	   Wenders also talked Bono into doing a brief cameo in the film.
</P>
<P>
	   "I still flinch when I see it," Bono said, squinting from behind his
trademark bug-eye sunglasses. "It's one of those awful 'There's the rock star in
his movie' moments for me."

<HEADLINE> Clinton, 'Inner Nerd' Touch Base  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   McALLEN, Texas (AP) -- With his final budget gone to Congress and his wife
seeking entree into the Senate, President Clinton did Wednesday what any
suddenly un-busy politician would do: hit the road.
</P>
<P>
	   The president came to Texas to raise $1.1 million for Democrats -- and he
vowed to the handful of reporters in tow that he doesn't miss the campaign trail
at all.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You guys are going to have a great time,'' Clinton bellowed as he bounded
through the press cabin aboard Air Force One. He noted that the temperature in
south Texas was above 80 degrees.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was appearing at two fund-raising events here and one later in
Dallas that were bringing in $850,000 for the Democratic National Committee and
$250,000 for the re-election bid of Rep. Ruben Hinojosa, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the first time in two decades, I'm not on the ballot anywhere,'' he
announced to the Hinojosa luncheon. He said that qualifies him to discuss this
year's presidential election, and explain why the winner ought to pick up where
he left off on the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   He then lingered for a roundtable discussion of local concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton vacillated between serious and goofy subjects, railing about the
pace of Senate hearings for his judicial nominees, then marveling about the warm
weather. He pointed out that, while en route to the luncheon, he saw a golf
course without snow on it for the first time in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've been here now, I guess, three times,'' Clinton said of his latest
stop in south Texas. ``If it were up to me, I'd come once a month.''
</P>
<P>
	   He accused Senate Republicans of ``deliberate slow-walking'' his judicial
nominees, and urged the crowd to press senators for action. Particularly, he
cited Enrique Moreno of El Paso, a Harvard Law graduate Clinton nominated for
the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The American Bar Association said he was highly qualified to be a judge,''
Clinton said. ``I cannot even get a hearing because your senators won't support
it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Otherwise, Clinton waxed on about the goals he set for his 1992 campaign --
putting Americans ahead of politics.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last few days, Clinton has engaged in such memory lane rhetoric more
often than he did in the past, as if he's constantly bracing for the day he's no
longer in office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are always coming to me saying, 'Oh, this must be a real downer for
you, you know, that the vice president and Hillary, they're out there
(campaigning),''' Clinton said Tuesday. ``I said, 'Well, I'm using this
opportunity to get in touch with my inner nerd.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday night, he described the sense of watching this year's election from
the outside as ``rather interesting. I feel like the cat that ate the canary
some days.''
</P>
<P>
	   But there are fewer and fewer reporters on hand to hear Clinton's thoughts.
Most of them have turned their attention to Vice President Al Gore or Texas Gov.
George Bush, the Democratic and Republican presidential front-runners.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, there were so few reporters aboard the chartered press plane
to Texas that White House aides pointed out there was ample room in the back for
those who wanted to stretch out for a nap during the three-hour flight.
</P>
<P>
	   Roughly a dozen news organizations accompanied Clinton on Wednesday, about
half the number of a year ago when his Senate impeachment trial was nearing a
close.

<HEADLINE> Politics Around Marriage Penalty Tax  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ignoring President Clinton's call for restraint, House
Republicans set a vote for Thursday on a 10-year, $182 billion income tax cut
for millions of married couples that will force Democrats to make a difficult
political choice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These Americans do not just reside in Republican districts,'' said Rep.
John Shadegg, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the GOP's election-year strategy is to stage individual votes on the
more popular parts of the $792 billion tax cut vetoed by Clinton last year,
giving Republican candidates in competitive districts a potent issue to exploit
if Democrats vote against them.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans ``really believe that they can con the American people to
believe that we are rejecting things, instead of being positive in working with
them, in getting something done,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation set for a House vote Thursday, written entirely by
Republicans, would cut taxes for all married couples who file joint income tax
returns, not just the estimated 25 million two-earner couples who pay a
``marriage penalty'' compared with what they would owe if single. Roughly half
the bill's total cost would go to increase the ``marriage bonus'' enjoyed by
millions of other couples, mainly those in which one spouse earns much more than
the other.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost 50 million married couples filed joint tax returns in 1997, according
to the most recent complete Internal Revenue Service statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we are going to provide tax relief for married couples, why pick and
choose which couples will benefit?'' said Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga. ``All
married couples should benefit, not just those with dual incomes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is already threatening a veto, arguing that the GOP bill is too
costly -- it is four times as expensive as the president's version -- and is
skewed toward people with higher incomes. Clinton also says the bill would
consume a chunk of the projected budget surplus before plans are laid to ensure
the future solvency of Social Security and Medicare, payment of national debt
and to pay for key spending increases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not going to walk down the blind alley of individual tax cuts until
we know what the overall plan is,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Democrats, hoping to limit their House defections to two dozen or so,
will offer an alternative that would take about $89 billion of the projected
surplus over 10 years, or twice the size of Clinton's proposal. The Democratic
proposal, aimed more at lower- and middle-income people, would not help married
couples who itemize their deductions and contains a trigger requiring a
``framework'' to be in place for fixing Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everbody's for a tax cut,'' said House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt,
D-Mo. ``It's a question of who gets them, how they're targeted and how much they
take of the total budget.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans, however, labeled the Democratic alternative ``phantom tax
relief'' because it depends on enactment of future legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Democrat plan is a sham, a fig leaf, and nothing more than an attempt
to confuse married couples and to try to pull the wool over the eyes of voters
who deserve tax relief,'' said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill
Archer, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   While House passage of the GOP bill seems assured, its future is less clear
in the Senate. Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the House measure is
``a good bill'' but it may have to be combined with other tax legislation to
avoid Democratic delaying tactics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will certainly try to find a way to consider it,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Democrats also support marriage penalty tax relief but not at such a
high cost, said Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. He said the House bill's
price tag would pay for a new Medicare prescription drug benefit for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you spend that kind of money, we want to spend it on more than just
addressing the marriage penalty,'' Daschle said. ----------

<HEADLINE> Wheat leads Grains, Sybeans Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat prices led other grains and soybeans higher Wednesday
on the Chicago Board of Trade on bullish U.S. export news and dryness in the
southern Plains states.
</P>
<P>
	   After lagging early in the session, wheat surged in response to Egypt's
announcement of a large purchase of wheat -- two-thirds of it from the United
States and the rest from Australia.
</P>
<P>
	   The purchase is the biggest involving U.S. wheat in weeks after a series of
rejections and other evidence that worldwide demand for it is on the wane.
</P>
<P>
	   Continuing dry conditions in the U.S. winter wheat belt also underpinned the
wheat rally, as did news that Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman will announce a
new food donation program in the next few days. Wheat is expected to make up the
bulk of the package.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn also moved higher on a generally bullish day for grains.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans recovered from early losses to close back above $5 a bushel, rising
on news of the food donation program.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery rose 6 1/4 cents to $2.65 1/2 a bushel; March corn
rose 1 1/4 cent to $2.22 1/2 a bushel; March oats fell  3/4 cent to $1.08 1/2 a
bushel; March soybeans rose 3 1/2 cents to $5.03 3/4 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Beef futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while pork
futures were mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   April live cattle fell .40 cent to 71.67 cents a pound; March feeder cattle
fell .80 cent to 83.45 cents a pound; April lean hogs fell .90 cent to 58.95
cents a pound; March pork bellies rose .90 cent to 88.80 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> At The Movies: 'The Beach'  </HEADLINE>
    By MATT WOLF Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- "The Beach" is a mediocre movie, to be sure, but it would be
a shame if blame were laid exclusively at the sandy feet of its titanic star,
Leonardo DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
	   Skeptics scoffed when the quintessentially American "Leo" -- as DiCaprio,
post-"Titanic," is now known around the world -- was cast as Richard.
</P>
<P>
	   The sought-after role is that of an English drifter at the unnerving heart
of the 1996 best-seller published when author Alex Garland was a scant 26. But
DiCaprio isn't British, which seems to have necessitated a shift in tone from
the unsparing nihilism of the novel. Americans, or so the thinking goes, don't
do bleak.
</P>
<P>
	   Then there was the McGregor factor. Whereas Ewan McGregor was key to the
earlier films of the creative team behind "The Beach" -- "Shallow Grave,"
"Trainspotting" and "A Life Less Ordinary" -- even the Scottish actor's newfound
status as a "Stars Wars" icon wasn't enough to displace DiCaprio when it came to
casting.
</P>
<P>
	   So how is Leo? Not bad actually, which is more than can be said for a script
from John Hodge that ditches most of the novel's tension.
</P>
<P>
	   While the book may not quite be the modern-day "Lord of the Flies" that
admirers have claimed, Garland nonetheless proved on his debut outing that he
can write a page-turner with the best of 'em. It's a clipped, often violent,
ultimately very chilling novel about a time-honored topic -- paradise postponed
-- here reinvented anew. A 20-something drifter in search of utopia, Richard
finds himself a near-casualty of an impossible ideal in a community that could
not be more dystopian.
</P>
<P>
	   "I carry a lot of scars," Richard reports twice in the last page of the
book. And so he does, even if readers are likely to be most disturbed by the
matter-of-fact blankness that is the narrator's principal means of reportage.
</P>
<P>
	   From its opening moments -- "my name is Richard," we are told, "so what else
do you need to know?" -- the film sounds as if it wants to catch that moral
aphasia.
</P>
<P>
	   The surprise, then, is how quickly the script lapses into cliche.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were headed for the great unknown," says Richard, as he and two newly
acquired French friends, Francoise (Virgine Ledoyen) and Etienne (Guillaume
Canet), abandon their Bangkok dive for a mysterious island locale mapped out for
Richard by the haunting Daffy (Robert Carlyle, reprising the psycho turn he
perfected last year in "The World Is Not Enough").
</P>
<P>
	   They encounter sharks, waterfalls and gun-toting Thais before arriving at an
island retreat overseen by Sal (Tilda Swinton), the beach's resident despot,
whose officiousness co-exists with a strong sexual appetite.
</P>
<P>
	   Does the beach offer any kind of balm? Not much, although Danny Boyle's
direction is at its strongest juxtaposing the supposed idyll with a return visit
to mainland Thailand -- here seen as urban life at its most disorienting and
jagged.
</P>
<P>
	   For that sequence, all credit goes to cinematographer Darius Khondji, whose
images are every bit as jarring -- and, when need be, alluring -- as they were
in "Evita" and "Seven."
</P>
<P>
	   In the novel, readers felt each incremental step in the breakdown of
"society" into its component savage parts, many of them embodied by Bugs, Sal's
supposed main squeeze.
</P>
<P>
	   But as the movie progresses, it seems to have other interests, from a
soft-core underwater tryst involving our leading man to evoking the odd twinge
of "Jaws" that comes with fending off fins.
</P>
<P>
	   And although DiCaprio is certainly a good enough actor to suggest goodness
gone AWOL, no one should have to deliver musings like "I tried to remember the
person I used to be, but I just couldn't do it."
</P>
<P>
	   DiCaprio is far more effective in off-the-cuff moments -- hissing,
shockingly, at a newly arrived American tourist whose tenancy on the beach will
be brief, indeed. Or in his sweaty realization, at the eleventh hour, that even
paradise exacts its own horrific price.
</P>
<P>
	   That glimpse into the abyss echoes "the horror! the horror!" of Joseph
Conrad's "Heart of Darkness," one of "The Beach's" numerous literary
antecedents.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a shame, then, that the movie opts instead for the kind of spurious
messages that are delivered far more meaningfully in, among others, "American
Beauty."
</P>
<P>
	   "I still believe in paradise -- it's not where you go," concludes Richard,
who decides instead that such states of grace consist of "a moment" that, once
found, lasts forever.
</P>
<P>
	   "American Beauty" suggested as much with the mere sight of a plastic bag
dancing in the wind. In "The Beach," by contrast, such considerations merely
sound waterlogged.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   "The Beach" is a 20th Century Fox release of a Figment Film, produced by
Andrew Macdonald. In a move sure to frustrate DiCaprio's teeny-bopper brigade of
fans, the film has been rated R. Running time: 120 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Railroads Raising Freight Prices  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID KOENIG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- Encouraged by the strong economy and facing higher fuel and
labor costs, the nation's freight railroads are raising certain rates more
aggressively than in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   Fort Worth, Texas-based Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. is notifying
shippers it will raise rates for some customers as much as 4 percent in the
railroad's first broad price hike since 1995. Norfolk Southern Corp., based in
Norfolk, Va., recently announced an identical increase for customers shipping
scrap metal, paper, lumber and container freight.
</P>
<P>
	   Top officials of Omaha, Neb.-based Union Pacific Corp. and Richmond,
Va.-based CSX Corp. have also signaled they intend to raise rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The railroads blame higher labor costs and the rising price of diesel, which
has doubled from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts, who have been looking for signs of higher prices to boost
profits, are underwhelmed by the announcements, however.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's selective and I'd say it affects less than a quarter of the business,"
said James Valentine, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
	   Valentine's skepticism is due to the fact that the increase won't apply to
the roughly 60 percent of rail customers who have long-term contracts with the
railroads. Other customers, such as farmers and automakers, can't afford to pay
more or will shift to truck shipments, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Adam Hollingsworth, a CSX spokesman, said his company's increases -- he
declined to say how much CSX will raise rates -- are also due to stronger market
conditions, including a shortage of rail capacity, price increases averaging
about 5 percent imposed by trucking companies, and the shortage of truck
drivers, which limits trucking capacity.
</P>
<P>
	   Burlington Northern spokesman Jim Sabourin said the increases, scheduled to
be completed during the first three months of the year, are the first since
Burlington Northern merged with Santa Fe Pacific in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Jill Evans, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, said rather than improving service,
railroads in recent years resorted almost entirely to cost-cutting to bolster
their bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
	   "Rail service has improved, they have a very good on-time record in
intermodal," she said, referring to containers that can be loaded from trains on
to trucks. "They've also improved in shipping commodities, such as forestry
products, because of more-direct routes as a result of mergers."
</P>
<P>
	   Railroads' on-time record, however, still lags far behind truckers. Analysts
say Burlington Northern's on-time record is around 90 percent, but the industry
as a whole rates about 75 percent, while the trucking industry is well above 90
percent. Valentine called timeliness "the Achilles heel" for raising railroads'
profitability.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said they doubted the rail freight price increases would affect
consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's relatively small in the scheme of the economy," Evans said.

<HEADLINE> Air Force One Incident Sparks Heat  </HEADLINE>
   By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal safety officials are recommending changes in the
staffing of the air traffic control tower at Ronald Reagan Washington National
Airport in the wake of a 1998 incident when Air Force One flew too close to
other aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   The incident took place Jan. 28, 1998 as Air Force One was leaving from
Andrews Air Force Base, across the Potomac River from the airport.
</P>
<P>
	   A National Transportation Safety Board report released Wednesday noted that
at about six miles west of Washington, radar data indicated Air Force One was
separated by about 2.7 miles from a USAirways flight and, moments later, by 2.56
miles from a Delta Air Lines flight.
</P>
<P>
	   In the area, planes are required to stay about 3 nautical miles, or 3.45
miles, apart.
</P>
<P>
	   The NTSB report noted that controllers at the National tower suspended
inbound flights as the president's helicopter approached Andrews and then began
working to clear the backlog.
</P>
<P>
	   When Air Force One departed, its crew, as usual, contacted the National
tower for instructions and routing.
</P>
<P>
	   The controller working the departure position was a developmental
controller, meaning he was certified for that position but not for all control
positions, the NTSB said. The report added there was one supervisor on duty, who
was called away to take a phone call during the presidential departure.
</P>
<P>
	   Under FAA rules a supervisor is required to monitor all presidential
flights, the NTSB said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the supervisor on duty had continued to monitor the situation rather
than take a phone call, she would probably have prevented the incident,'' the
board concluded.
</P>
<P>
	   The NTSB recommended that staffing at the National tower be increased to
include more supervisors to be sure there are enough staffers available to
monitor Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Frasier Jones said the agency had
received the recommendations and was giving them serious attention. The FAA is
ultimately responsible for air traffic control at airport towers.
</P>
<P>
	   The board noted an FAA recommendation that a developmental controller
following an Air Force One Flight work under the guidance of a training
instructor who can override the controller's instructions if necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also said that supervisors monitoring Air Force One visually were
not also listening in to radio calls involving the plane. The FAA has now
instructed the supervisors to monitor the flights both visually and by listening
to radio traffic, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Down; Dow Off 258.44  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks tumbled today amid worries about rising
interest rates, while a rash of attacks on leading Web sites deflated the
high-flying technology sector.
</P>
<P>
	   the Dow Jones industrial average fell 258.44 to close at 10,699.16.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also lower.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 29.86 to 1,411.89, and the Nasdaq composite
index fell 64.70 to 4,362.80.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 2,006 down, 1,029 up and 485 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.041 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.044 billion in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.49 to 536.00. The Dow's
losses were broad-based, with American Express, Citigroup and Home Depot all
dropping on concerns that the Federal Reserve will continue raising interest
rates this year, potentially threatening corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors in these stocks are anticipating that the Fed will eventually be
successful in forcing a slowdown in the economy," said Ned Riley, chief
investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed has raised short-term interest rates four times since June 1999 in
an effort to slow the economy enough to keep inflation under control. Since the
last increase, announced a week ago, investors have been shying away from
blue-chip companies, fearful that their profits will be the first to suffer if
interest rates continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're waiting to find out just how far the Fed will go," said Eugene G.
Mintz, financial markets analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
"They've already committed a lot of money to this market and they're a little
nervous."
</P>
<P>
	   Riley said technology shares held up a bit better because investors believe
they are growing quickly enough to withstand the crunch of higher rates.
</P>
<P>
	   "The economy is dictating that interest rates will go up," Riley said.
"That's limiting the leadership of the market to the companies that have very
rapid earnings growth."
</P>
<P>
	   One of those companies was Cisco Systems. The company said late Tuesday that
profits in its fiscal second quarter topped analysts' expectations. Cisco also
announced a 2-for-1 stock split, to take effect March 22. The company has been
one of the Nasdaq's strongest performers in recent months as demand has soared
for its computer networking equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   But Cisco alone couldn't lift the technology-dominated Nasdaq, which saw
many Internet stocks rattled by a spate of Web site attacks by computer hackers.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of ETrade were down amid news the online broker had become the latest
high-profile victim of Internet vandalism. Amazon.com, eBay and Yahoo! slipped a
day after Internet vandals hacked into their Web sites, disrupting access for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   Buy.com, which also succumbed to the attack Tuesday as its shares traded
publicly for the first time, rose today.
</P>
<P>
	   Also today, Microsoft dropped on the news that European Union regulators
have opened an examination into the launch of Microsoft's new Windows 2000
operating system. Mirroring antitrust concerns in the United States, several
competitors have complained that Windows 2000 would give Microsoft a dominant
position in the software market, EU officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dow component Merck fell after the Wall Street Journal reported that five of
the company's drugs will lose U.S. patent protection within two years,
threatening profits and revenue.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing fell after last-ditch talks with a federal mediator failed to produce
an agreement on a labor contract and engineers and technicians walked off the
job.

<HEADLINE> Analyst Cohen Wary on Campaign Vows  </HEADLINE>
    By DUNSTAN PRIAL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Superstar Wall Street analyst Abby Joseph Cohen said
Wednesday that the presidential candidates figure to be the only wild card in
determining the success of the U.S. stock markets in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates, eager to exploit the current budget surplus to further their
presidential aspirations, could potentially upset what has been a sound domestic
economic policy for the past decade, said Cohen, an analyst with Goldman Sachs &AMP;
Co.
</P>
<P>
	   They should avoid falling over themselves to offer larger tax cuts until
actual surplus figures are available, she added. "This shouldn't become a
spitting contest in that regard."
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen, arguably the most high-profile "bull" -- or optimist -- on Wall
Street, spoke at Goldman Sachs' Annual Foreign Exchange Conference in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the candidates were mentioned by name. But both leading Republican
candidates, U.S. Sen. John McCain and Texas Governor George Bush, have proposed
large tax cuts based on budget surplus projections.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen suggested the budget surplus be used to fulfill the nation's social
obligations and to pay down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Unforeseen political upheaval overseas could also roil U.S. markets, Cohen
speculated. But barring either of those circumstances, Cohen said the longest
running bull market in history should extend through 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen, who has achieved near-celebrity status for her accurate and
optimistic predictions, said investors will do well in 2000, but probably not as
well as in 1999, when the both the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index and
the benchmark Dow Jones industrial average ended the year at record highs.
</P>
<P>
	   So far this year, the Dow is down about 800 points, or about 7 percent, on
the year, while the Nasdaq, after dropping as much as 10 percent from its high,
is up about 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   But Cohen remains optimistic. "This isn't the year it gets ugly," Cohen
said. "Stock investors will be happy, but probably not as giddy as they have in
recent years."
</P>
<P>
	   Inflation won't be the culprit, however.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Cohen said stocks won't mirror the record breaking gains of recent
years because they have finally achieved their proper valuations. In other
words, stocks are now worth what they're supposed to be worth.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen offered a simple explanation for the decade-long bull market. In the
early 1990s stocks were significantly undervalued due to lousy economic
conditions in the U.S. and the poor reputation of corporate America.
</P>
<P>
	   But as the U.S. economy turned around and technology companies began to
emerge as significant players within that economy, the stock market took off.
</P>
<P>
	   And the emergence of the Internet late in the decade only seemed justify the
high valuations investors had given many high-tech companies in the computer
hardware and software sectors, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The technology stocks and companies were getting the respect they deserved.
These stocks are now appropriately priced," Cohen said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, 'Inner Nerd' Touch Base  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   McALLEN, Texas (AP) -- With his final budget gone to Congress and his wife
seeking entree into the Senate, President Clinton did Wednesday what any
suddenly un-busy politician would do: hit the road.
</P>
<P>
	   The president came to Texas to raise $1.1 million for Democrats -- and he
vowed to the handful of reporters in tow that he doesn't miss the campaign trail
at all.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You guys are going to have a great time,'' Clinton bellowed as he bounded
through the press cabin aboard Air Force One. He noted that the temperature in
south Texas was above 80 degrees.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was appearing at two fund-raising events here and one later in
Dallas that were bringing in $850,000 for the Democratic National Committee and
$250,000 for the re-election bid of Rep. Ruben Hinojosa, D-Texas. That brought
to 14 the number of fundraisers Clinton has done this year, five of them in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the first time in two decades, I'm not on the ballot anywhere,'' he
announced to the Hinojosa luncheon. He said that qualifies him to discuss this
year's presidential election, and explain why the winner ought to pick up where
he left off on the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   He then lingered for a roundtable discussion of local concerns before going
to a second fund-raising event, where he told the crowd he wanted to speak not
as president but ``as a citizen of this country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton thanked the audience for the support the Rio Grande Valley has given
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton for her Senate bid. He said he spoke with her
Wednesday, and believes her campaign is going well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you can measure how well you're doing by how hard they attack you --
which I always thought was a pretty good measure -- she's a cinch,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton vacillated between serious and goofy subjects, railing about the
pace of Senate hearings for his judicial nominees, then marveling about the warm
weather. He pointed out that, while en route to the luncheon, he saw a golf
course without snow on it for the first time in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've been here now, I guess, three times,'' Clinton said of his latest
stop in south Texas. ``If it were up to me, I'd come once a month.''
</P>
<P>
	   He accused Senate Republicans of ``deliberate slow-walking'' his judicial
nominees, and urged the crowd to press senators for action. Particularly, he
cited Enrique Moreno of El Paso, a Harvard Law graduate Clinton nominated for
the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The American Bar Association said he was highly qualified to be a judge,''
Clinton said. ``I cannot even get a hearing because your senators won't support
it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Otherwise, Clinton waxed on about the goals he set for his 1992 campaign --
putting Americans ahead of politics.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last few days, Clinton has engaged in such memory lane rhetoric more
often than he did in the past, as if he's constantly bracing for the day he's no
longer in office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are always coming to me saying, 'Oh, this must be a real downer for
you, you know, that the vice president and Hillary, they're out there
(campaigning),''' Clinton said Tuesday. ``I said, 'Well, I'm using this
opportunity to get in touch with my inner nerd.'''
</P>
<P>
	   At one point Wednesday, he spotted former Texas Attorney General Dan Morales
in the crowd and jokingly asked the Democrat, who did not seek a third term in
1998: ``Is there life after politics, Dan?''
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday night, he described the sense of watching this year's election from
the outside as ``rather interesting. I feel like the cat that ate the canary
some days.''
</P>
<P>
	   But there are fewer and fewer reporters on hand to hear Clinton's thoughts.
Most of them have turned their attention to Vice President Al Gore or Texas Gov.
George Bush, the Democratic and Republican presidential front-runners.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, there were so few reporters aboard the chartered press plane
to Texas that White House aides pointed out there was ample room in the back for
those who wanted to stretch out for a nap during the three-hour flight.
</P>
<P>
	   Roughly a dozen news organizations accompanied Clinton on Wednesday, about
half the number of a year ago when his Senate impeachment trial was nearing a
close.

<HEADLINE> Review Into Clinton-Judge Complaints  </HEADLINE>
   By PETE YOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prompted by new information from a congressman, a
judicial body that oversees judges' conduct reopened a review Wednesday into why
the chief federal judge in Washington directed criminal cases of presidential
friends to appointees of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The Judicial Council ordered appeals court judge Stephen Williams to look
into the circumstances surrounding the assignment of five campaign fund-raising
prosecutions and the tax evasion case against long-time Clinton confidant
Webster Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
	   In each of the six cases, Chief District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson
bypassed the computer system that randomly assigns cases. Instead, Johnson sent
the prosecutions to Clinton appointees. The Associated Press first brought the
special assignments to light in a story last summer regarding the Hubbell case
and the fund-raising prosecution of presidential friend Charlie Trie.
</P>
<P>
	   In a two-paragraph order, the Judicial Council noted that a Jan. 10 letter
by House judiciary subcommittee chairman Howard Coble, R-N.C., focuses on
additional fund-raising cases.
</P>
<P>
	   In one of them, Johnson assigned a Clinton judge the guilty plea of
prominent Miami businessman Howard Glicken, a former fund-raiser for Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The chief judge has never said why she bypassed the random assignment system
in Glicken's case.
</P>
<P>
	   Court records show presidential friend Vernon Jordan intervened in the case,
asking the sentencing judge to be lenient. Glicken was given community service
work and probation.
</P>
<P>
	   The district court last week killed a rule that enabled Johnson to designate
which judges got the cases. The rule allows the chief judge to bypass the random
assignment system for ``protracted'' cases.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to a newspaper last summer, Johnson said she made the special
assignments to ``move the docket as expeditiously as possible'' and that
politics was ``never a factor.''
</P>
<P>
	   The now-revived complaint was brought by Judicial Watch, a conservative
group. Williams labeled the complaint ``frivolous'' in a November opinion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All we requested was an investigation and this is an important step in
that direction,'' Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams, a Reagan appointee, had said the court rule that enabled Johnson
to bypass the random assignment system ``makes possible both actual and
perceived abuses.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman, who received some of the campaign
fund-raising cases from Johnson, spearheaded an internal courthouse review of
the long-standing rule -- a review that began last April, before the issue
became public. He recommended the rule be abolished.
</P>
<P>
	   The Judicial Conference, the national policymaking body of the federal
judiciary, also rescinded its long-standing position supporting special
assignments.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Form New Privacy Groups  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate lawmakers, grappling with complex privacy
issues, are forming groups to discuss possible new legislation and policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., announced Wednesday the
formation of a Senate Democratic Privacy Task Force, while Sen. Richard Shelby,
R-Ala., disclosed the creation of a bipartisan Congressional Privacy Caucus of
senators and House members.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The issue of privacy touches virtually every American, often in extremely
personal ways,'' Daschle said in a statement. ``Whether it is bank records or
medical files or Internet activities, Americans have a right to expect that
personal matters will be kept private.''
</P>
<P>
	   Because laws have not kept pace with sweeping technological changes, Daschle
added, Americans' right to privacy is at risk. ``Some of our most sensitive,
private (data) end up on databases that are then sold to the highest bidder,''
he said. ``That is wrong, it's dangerous and it has to stop.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pollsters have found that privacy now is one of the highest priorities for
Americans, who have expressed concern about threats to their privacy involving
financial data, health records and employment records, Daschle noted.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress enacted in November sweeping legislation removing Depression-era
barriers and allowing banks, securities firms and insurance companies to get
into each other's businesses. It included, for the first time, provisions giving
consumers the right to block financial companies from providing their personal
data to outside firms, such as telemarketers. However, the companies will be
able to share customers' data with affiliated financial companies under the same
corporate roof.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, lawmakers may consider legislation regarding medical privacy and
other areas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate Democratic task force will be headed by Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., the Senate Judiciary Committee's senior Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Democratic senators have expressed interest in joining the group, Leahy
spokesman David Carle said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby, a conservative, and Rep. Edward Markey of Massachusetts, a liberal
Democrat, bitterly opposed the financial overhaul legislation last year on
grounds its privacy protections were inadequate.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby and Markey will be co-chairmen of the new privacy caucus, along with
Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., and Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas.

<HEADLINE> Congress: Map Needed on Patient Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By ALICE ANN LOVE Associate Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some lawmakers want clearer direction from President
Clinton and GOP leaders as negotiators prepare to begin reconciling differences
between House and Senate versions of patient protection legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, trying to bring pressure on Congress, said Wednesday the bill
should cover all Americans and allow them to sue health providers for inadequate
care.
</P>
<P>
	   But more specific guidance is needed if congressional negotiators are to
reach a compromise, said Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., a former dentist who has
lead a GOP push for patient protections.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Republican lawmakers were expected to join Norwood at a news
conference on Thursday to ask Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., to meet with Clinton before negotiators
sit down for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They ought to be able to come up with something that's a clear-cut goal
that these guys can work for,'' said Norwood spokesman John Stone.
</P>
<P>
	   An initial meeting of the House-Senate negotiating committee, scheduled for
Thursday, was postponed at the request of Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who has
been hospitalized with a form of pneumonia. It was expected to be rescheduled
during the week of Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
	   The House bill, passed last year with the support of Democrats, provides the
right to sue HMOs for denial of care. The GOP-crafted Senate plan does not. The
House measure would apply to all 161 million Americans with health insurance,
compared with 48 million for the Senate measure.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott has said the compromise legislation probably would include some
provision for lawsuits. But, he says, ``What we don't want to make it is just a
lawyers' bill of rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said universal coverage and the right to sue are essential.
</P>
<P>
	   ``First we want to cover all Americans; that's a very important thing,'' the
president said. ``And there has to be some way of enforcing a right or it's not
a right. Otherwise, it's just a suggestion.''
</P>
<P>
	   He spoke with reporters on the South Lawn as he left for a political
fund-raising trip to Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he favored the House version over the Senate measure because it
allows patients to go to the nearest emergency room, guarantees the right to see
a specialist and prevents HMOs from forcing patients to switch doctors in the
middle of treatment. It also provides the right to sue and includes all health
plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said it has the support of more than 300 health and consumer groups,
as well as 68 Republican members of the House.
</P>
<P>
	   But he complained that the negotiating committee has been stacked with
opponents of the provisions he favors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although I remain concerned that the conferees on the bill do not share
the majority's view, I believe nevertheless they have a clear responsibility to
ratify these fundamental rights, to put politics aside and pass a strong
enforceable patients' bill of rights,'' the president said.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Ease Ban on Yugoslav Flights  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States on Wednesday endorsed a move by the
European Union to lift a ban on commercial air travel to Yugoslavia while vowing
to keep up political and economic pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced the decision after meeting
with the British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who said the suspension would be
for six months.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, the close allies endorsed a tougher line against Milosevic
and his supporters. It will take the form of adding an unspecified number of
industrialists and others whose names will be added to a list of 60 Yugoslav
officials ineligible for visas.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union is expected to lift the ban on flights on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain and the United States tend to take a tough line against Milosevic,
who has been branded a war crimes suspect for mistreatment of ethnic Albanian
civilians in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright said Cook and she had ``agreed on a need to isolate the Milosevic
regime.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's important to keep the pressure up,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
	   But some other countries in the 15-nation European Union prefer a more
conciliatory approach.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Serbia's opposition leaders and Western officials struck a deal
to expand the European Union's humanitarian aid package to the
sanctions-stricken country.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan includes help for Serbia's increasingly impoverished pensioners and
health facilities as well as providing more funding to supply heating oil to
cities run by opponents of Milosevic.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Complains of Senate Delays  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   McALLEN, Texas (AP) -- President Clinton renewed his criticism Wednesday of
senators who have delayed decisions on his judicial nominees, implying that
their inaction was linked to the minority backgrounds of several appointees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the things that continues to bother me in my efforts to build one
America is the problem that I continue to have in the United States Senate in
getting judges confirmed,'' Clinton said, ``particularly judges who come from
diverse backgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president spoke at a $5,000-a-plate Democratic National Committee
fund-raising event in McAllen, the first of three fund-raising stops in Texas on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Senate Republicans have raised objections to the views of some
candidates for the bench, while others have placed holds on nominations in
response to disputes with the administration on unrelated matters.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans have promised Clinton a vote on two of his judicial nominees --
Richard Paez, a Mexican-American federal judge in Los Angeles, and San Francisco
labor lawyer Marsha Berson -- before the Senate takes a recess March 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, this week
reiterated that promise by Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., while
acknowledging a threat by Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., to attempt to block action
on any of Clinton's nominees.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to Inhofe conceded that Lott's promise will probably prevail regarding
Paez and Berson. Inhofe vowed last month to try to block all of Clinton's
nominees until the president leaves office, claiming the White House violated an
agreement limiting recess appointments while Congress was not in session.
</P>
<P>
	   According to a recent count by Senate Democrats, there are 73 openings in
the federal judiciary. Clinton has 35 nominations pending in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief Justice William Rehnquist has complained of severe backlogs in the
federal court system. Last year, 33 new judges were confirmed, down from 65 in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton specifically referred to two Hispanic men he has nominated to the
federal bench, Enrique Moreno of El Paso for the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals, and Julio Fuentes for the Third Circuit in California.
</P>
<P>
	   While he conceded that politics often intrudes in the appointment process
when the Senate is controlled by one party and the president belongs to another,
Clinton argued that his appointees have been subjected to unreasonable delays.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There has never been an example like what we've seen of the deliberate
slow walk and refusal to have hearings, refusal to vote up or down on judges,''
Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> For one man, court challenge by white-owned businesses rings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Al Cave never thought too highly of Atlantic
City to begin with.
<P>
	   A successful building services contractor in East Orange, Cave and his New
Life Group won dozens of federal contracts in the New York area after going into
business 21 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   But he was in no rush to work here.
</P>
<P>
	   "Atlantic City is Mississippi on the Atlantic, as far as I'm concerned, in
terms of racism. It's always been that way," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, he attended a seminar at Showboat Casino Hotel to learn how
minority vendors like him could get casino contracts, which are worth nearly a
billion dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
	   What he heard was promising: Under state Casino Control Commission
regulations, casinos are supposed to spend at least 15 percent of their annual
purchasing dollar on businesses owned by women or minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   So he opened up an office in nearby Pleasantville in the hope of obtaining a
piece of the casino industry pie. Now, after three years of trying, he's giving
up.
</P>
<P>
	   He has contracts to repaint and refinish elevator doors, bell carts and room
service carts at a handful of casinos. But it's not enough. Soon, he plans to
close the Pleasantville office.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't make enough money to sustain my workforce," said Cave, 69. "There's
no interest in doing work with minorities. To a lot of the (casino) buyers,
minority means small results, poor results. I know that's not the case with me.
</P>
<P>
	   "But somebody's getting that work. I don't think there's some conspiracy,
saying, 'We won't do work with minorities.' They're comfortable with who they've
done work with in the past. You're just not considered," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He scoffs at the court challenge mounted by other casino industry
contractors who say they are losing business to companies like his because of
the minority set-aside requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   The Association for Fairness in Business, which includes Fabi Construction
of Absecon among its members, filed a federal suit seeking to strike down the
program as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   A judge agreed Tuesday, granting a preliminary injunction banning the
commission from continuing to enforce the set-aside program.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's totally unfounded," Cave said. "I'd like to know who are these
minority companies that they're losing business to. A construction company is
complaining? I'd like to know who the minority construction company is that
they're losing business to."
</P>
<P>
	   All 12 of the casinos exceed the 15 percent standard, according to Casino
Control Commission figures. About one-fourth of the $976 million spent by the
casinos in 1998 was done with minority-owned or women-owned companies,
commission spokesman Daniel Heneghan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the problem may lie in the regulations, which call for a combined 15
percent for women- and minority-owned businesses. Theoretically, a casino could
reach the goal by using women-owned businesses for 13 percent and minority-owned
business for only 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of the program also say some contractors have found a way around the
set-aside by installing wives or other women as the official "owner" of the
business, thereby qualifying as woman-owned.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result of the ruling, Cave says minority contractors that have had
success with casinos will suffer. He won't, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't miss what you never had," he said.

<HEADLINE> Legislator: give more benefits to families of dead Attica guards  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - It is time to redress a 29-year-old wrong and give
additional benefits to relatives of guards killed during the 1971 Attica prison
riot, a state assemblyman said Wednesday.
<P>
	   Daniel Burling, a Republican from Wyoming County, said the state took
advantage of the wives, parents and children of the 11 guards killed during the
Attica riot by offering them death benefits - but not making it clear that by
accepting the money, the relatives could not bring wrongful death suits against
the state.
</P>
<P>
	   "They trusted their employer, the state of New York, which for many years
had been their providers," Burling said. "But it appears to me that the state
was acting out of concern for its own self and its legal exposure."
</P>
<P>
	   By accepting the benefits, families of the dead officers were essentially
signing a legal waiver that released the state from any further liability,
according to the legislator.
</P>
<P>
	   Burling said he will introduce a bill offering the 11 families $90,000 each
in additional accidental death benefits. He said he arrived at that number by
taking the average salary state prison guards made in 1971 - about $9,000 - and
multiplying it by 10.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was just to use as the rule of thumb to come to some feasible amount,"
Burling said. "We had to come up with something."
</P>
<P>
	   Burling said the recent announcement of a proposed settlement in a suit by
former Attica inmates against the state makes the climate right to pay
additional death benefits to guards' families. Under that proposed deal, inmates
who contended they were beaten, tortured or denied medical care after the riot
was quelled will get $8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Burling said the agreement with inmates was unpopular in his district. But
he added he is "not taking issue with that."

<P>
	   "The whole situation was very difficult and tragic for everyone involved,
whether it be inmates, corrections officers, families and the people who were
involved in the retaking of the prison, because they were victims too,
somewhat," Burling said.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, 32 inmates and 11 guards were killed in the Attica riot, most in a
hail of bullets when authorities retook the prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The benefits would be paid to the surviving children of the dead officers
under Burling's legislation. If there are no children, the spouses of the dead
officers would get the money. If there are both surviving spouses and children,
they would split the money.
</P>
<P>
	   If guards died without children or spouses, their parents would get the
payments.
</P>
<P>
	   The death benefits would be payable from funds in the state treasury and the
Local Employees' Retirement System, according to Burling.
</P>
<P>
	   Burling said state Sen. Dale Volker, an Erie County Republican who chairs
the Codes Committee in the Senate, will sponsor the measure in that chamber.
</P>
<P>
	   Burling said he did not know how much guards' families got in the initial
round of death benefits, but was told that one family received about $90,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Carrier, a spokesman for state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, said
Assembly Democrats would review the Burling legislation when it is filed.

<HEADLINE> DiCaprio Thrills At 'Beach' Premiere  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- Thousands of waiting fans shrieked in adoration Wednesday
night as Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio stepped from a limousine for the
star-studded European premiere of his latest movie, "The Beach."
</P>
<P>
	   Admirers gathered 10 deep in places chanting "Leo!" "Leo!" and jostling to
get a better view from behind the police barriers at the Empire Cinema in
Leicester Square. Young fans waved banners saying "Leo, kiss me quick" as
celebrity guests filed in.
</P>
<P>
	   DiCaprio, wearing a gray suit and matching tie, looked slightly bemused by
his rapturous reception, but smiled for photographers before heading inside.
</P>
<P>
	   Long after he disappeared from view, the crowd chanted on in hope he might
return.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's weird these crowds," DiCaprio said once inside. "You have to go
through the motions. I try my best, I pose for the cameras, but it's almost like
it's not me out there.
</P>
<P>
	   "But I'm a very lucky person," he added. "I don't complain."
</P>
<P>
	   The 25-year-old actor's co-star, Virgine Ledoyen, arrived in a pair of faded
jeans. Robert Carlyle, another co-star, brought his wife, Anastasia, to the
premiere.
</P>
<P>
	   Baby Spice Emma Bunton and All Saints, who provided the movie's theme tune,
appeared, as did Mick Hucknall, the star of the band Simply Red.
</P>
<P>
	   Steps stars Faye Tozer and Claire Richards were among the pop contingent,
along with Duran Duran's Simon Le Bon and Nick Rhodes and their partners Yasmin
Le Bon and Tara Palmer-Tomkinson.
</P>
<P>
	   The film is based on a best-selling novel by Alex Garland about a group of
travelers who head to an idyllic secret beach on a Thai island and find that
their piece of paradise isn't what they expected.
</P>
<P>
	   The film opens across Britain on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Senate hears of neglect, paternalism for farm workers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - State senators considering higher wages and better
conditions for farm workers heard testimony Wednesday as disparate as scenes
from "The Grapes of Wrath" and TV's "Cheers."
<P>
	   A union leader told of migrant and seasonal farm workers eking out a
back-breaking living through 12-hour days, seven days a week without overtime
pay or health care, limited access to toilets and no opportunity to attend
religious services.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't dare ask for a raise or a day off because you'll be fired,"
stated Adrian Ramirez, in written testimony read to senators. He wrote of
dilapidated trailers at an unidentified corporate operation where six slept to a
room, with faulty windows that let mosquitoes in during summer and a cold draft
in winter.
</P>
<P>
	   He also contended that some women were pressured by supervisors for sex to
keep a job.
</P>
<P>
	   But farmers say union leaders and other farm worker advocates are using old
statistics and increasingly rare negative anecdotes. Farmers said many of the
state's 20,000 migrant workers are treated as family and friends, where they
work alongside their bosses and their children play video games together.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are always going to be exceptions," said Denis Hughes, president of
the AFL-CIO labor organization. However, "there is a moral and ethical
obligation we have as a society to provide these workers with respect," the
respect granted "even our most hated enemies."
</P>
<P>
	   Members of two state Senate committees began gathering facts Wednesday
following recent New York Daily News articles that senators said helped focus
attention on the issue. The hearings could lead to the overhaul of state laws
enacted in the 1930s. Among them is a law that allows no overtime pay and places
these farm workers in a category separate of most other workers.
</P>
<P>
	   The statewide average farm wage is $8.12 an hour - about 20 cents to 30
cents an hour better than most other laborers, according to state statistics.
They get no overtime pay and can't be represented by unions for collective
bargaining of wages and benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   But they also often get free housing provided by the farmer, sometimes
through a state loan program. State and federal programs offer day care and
schooling for students as well as free nursing and dental services, hot meals
for the workforce's 1,900 children, clothing and other services.
</P>
<P>
	   A new law will increase minimum farm wages by about $19 a week to a typical
wage of $314 a week. Increases will be tied to advances in the federal minimum
wage.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. George Pataki also proposed building eight or nine more daycare centers
around the state for migrant workers' children, said Agriculture and Markets
Commissioner Nathan Rudgers.
</P>
<P>
	   The workers hired every year from Jamaica, Mexico and other countries do
work on a short, seasonal basis that local residents can't do - especially in a
competitive job market, farmers said. Some workers make enough in a few weeks to
live for the year on wages from their annual trip to the United States paid by
farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   All this comes at a time when dairy farmers are getting the lowest price for
milk in 20 years and a series of storms caused millions of dollars in damage
statewide in recent years, said Rudgers.
</P>
<P>
	   Advocates acknowledge recent improvements, but say much more is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   But higher wages and unions would hurt the farm workers, farmers said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't go and pay overtime because I'd have to cut down their hours," said
dairy farmer Jon Greenwood, who runs an 800-cow dairy farm with his wife, Linda,
and 14 employees in St. Lawrence County. "I would have to go out and hire
additional employees and our employees would lose."
</P>
<P>
	   His workers are paid from $6.50 to $10 an hour with bonuses.
</P>
<P>
	   The nature of farm work simply works against overtime and union controls
because the crop depends not on work schedules, but weather.
</P>
<P>
	   Patrick Hooker of the state Farm Bureau lobby for farmers, said members
considered the union issue.
</P>
<P>
	   "Farmers felt it was unnecessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Applegrower Rod Dressel Jr. from Ulster County said more regulations or
higher labor costs will result in "questionable food supply, loss of open space
and no place for workers to work."
</P>
<P>
	   Farmers said only a few farm workers, at most, aren't treated well while
union officials said the number is far higher.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't matter," said Damaris McGuire, a staffer for the Episcopal
Church and for Justice for Farm Workers in Albany. "The point is you have a
class of workers that are systematically excluded from basic rights."

<HEADLINE> Defibrillators Prevent Sudden Death  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Implanted defibrillators that jolt the heart back into a normal rhythm can
be lifesavers for people with a certain inherited heart condition, a study
found.
</P>
<P>
	   The condition, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, involves heart muscle
enlargement and an overly vigorous heartbeat. It affects an estimated 500,000
Americans, and about 10 percent of them are considered at high risk of sudden
death.
</P>
<P>
	   The drug amiodarone can reduce the number of potentially fatal episodes of
heart irregularities, but it is not recommended in younger patients because it
can have serious long-term side effects that include vision deterioration.
</P>
<P>
	   The study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine looked at 128
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients and followed them for an average of three
years after they received defibrillators, small devices that are typically
implanted under the skin of the chest or the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
	   The study group included 43 patients who had suffered cardiac arrest or at
least one serious episode of a wildly speeded-up heartbeat before getting the
implants. The defibrillators corrected potentially deadly heart irregularities
in 11 percent of these patients per year.
</P>
<P>
	   The study also looked at 85 mostly younger patients who had never suffered
cardiac arrest or a serious heart irregularity, but who were considered at high
risk of sudden death because of their family histories or the results of heart
tests.
</P>
<P>
	   Five percent of these patients suffered potentially fatal heart episodes
each year, and they were corrected by the implants.
</P>
<P>
	   Only two patients in the study died. Both were at an advanced stage of
disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was led by Dr. Barry Maron of the Minneapolis Heart Institute
Foundation and funded in part by a grant from Medtronic, which makes implantable
defibrillators.
</P>
<P>
	   More than one-third of the patients who had a serious heart episode during
the study were also taking amiodarone, suggesting the drug was not nearly as
effective at preventing sudden death as the implants, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Hugh Watkins of Oxford University said in an accompanying editorial that
the research appears to be "very good news."
</P>
<P>
	   "If longer-term studies bear this out, there is little doubt that the costs
and risks of defibrillators will be outweighed by the lives saved," Watkins
wrote.

<HEADLINE> FDA Backs Off Pregnancy Supplements  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under fire from birth defects experts, the government is
backing off a new regulation that would have let dietary supplements treat
morning sickness without proof the products are safe for unborn babies.
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration told dietary supplement manufacturers
Wednesday not to claim that their products can treat morning sickness or
pregnancy-related leg swelling until the issue is settled.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, the FDA eased restrictions on the claims dietary supplement
companies can make about how their products affect people's health. Birth
defects experts were stunned to see those two pregnancy-related conditions on
the list of claims that otherwise unregulated dietary supplements could now
sport.
</P>
<P>
	   That rule reversed current medical policy and ``has the potential to put
pregnant women and their offspring at serious risk,'' one prominent pregnancy
expert told the FDA, as doctors and consumer advocates began a string of
protests to the agency last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Thanks to a 1994 law, dietary supplements do not undergo government scrutiny
-- and in most cases undergo little if any scientific study -- to ensure they're
safe and effective before they are sold to millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   That 1994 law does prohibit dietary supplements from claiming to treat or
cure diseases, but it says they can advertise help for non-disease health
conditions. The FDA's new rule attempted to draw the line between what was an
acceptable and illegal claim for these products.
</P>
<P>
	   FDA officials have maintained that morning sickness and leg swelling are not
a disease but are normal pregnancy conditions and thus dietary supplements,
under the 1994 law, could claim to treat them.
</P>
<P>
	   But because so many chemicals -- natural or synthetic -- can hurt a fetus,
the government until now had always required safety studies before letting any
medical substance target pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
	   If a product claims to treat sickness, consumers would assume it's been
proven safe for the unborn baby -- when in fact that's not the case, critics
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There certainly are some plants that if people take, they could result in
birth defects,'' FDA drug chief Dr. Janet Woodcock acknowledged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   So the FDA has put the pregnancy part of the new rule on hold, and will
convene a public meeting within a few months to debate what to do.
</P>
<P>
	   ``FDA realizes it made a serious mistake,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the
consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, who spearheaded the protests. ``The
well-known dangers of many herbal products for pregnant women ... should have
been sufficient for FDA not to have issued the reckless Jan. 6 regulation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, all pregnant women should consult a doctor before taking any
dietary supplement -- or any medication, Woodcock cautioned.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Registers Concerns With Russia  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department demanded Wednesday that Russian
officials ``come clean'' about the fate of a journalist missing in Chechnya.
Twenty-one members of Congress demanded his release in a tough letter to Acting
President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian military officials claim to have turned over Radio Liberty reporter
Andrei Babitsky to Chechen rebels last week, but he has not been heard from
since.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said Tuesday that Babitsky was
alive and well. But State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Wednesday the
reporter's disappearance, and incomplete and contradictory explanations by
Russian officials ``have raised the greatest fears as to his fate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials have said Babitsky was turned over to Chechen rebels in
exchange for Russian prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Capitol Hill, 21 members of Congress, led by Rep. Sam Gejdenson,
D-Conn., said such a swap was incomprehensible, one that suggested the reporter
was affiliated with the rebels when, in fact, his reporting had been objective
and fair.
</P>
<P>
	   The House members called on Putin to review the situation promptly and
assist in securing release of the reporter and his return to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the United
States has made its concern over Babitsky known in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   In another action, Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., wrote Putin, expressing
deep concern about the loss of civilian life in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   While Russia has a right to stop secession and counter terrorism, Wellstone
said, ``this responsibility does not and cannot justify the use of
indiscriminate force against civilians and the displacement of hundreds of
thousands of persons.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright suggested to Putin last week that he permit journalists to report
from Chechnya and allow a humanitarian commission to go to the republic to
assess the needs of civilians there.
</P>
<P>
	   In Moscow, Albright said Putin seemed interested in both proposals. But on
Wednesday she said she had not heard from Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who
normally would be in touch with her about them.
</P>
<P>
	   Once again, Albright insisted on a ``political dialogue'' between Russia and
the secessionists. And she again said the Russians were ``in denial'' in
expecting a military offensive to solve the separatist problem.

Vodafone Airtouch PLC and Mannesmann AG goes through.
</P>
<P>
	   Standard &AMP; Poor's said its ratings on Vodafone remain on CreditWatch with
negative implications. The credit rating agency said Vodafone's plans to acquire
Mannesmann AG will hurt its current financial profile but boost its competitive

	   US Freightways Corp. called off its plan to buy the company for $132.7
million. Also, Transport Corp. restated its results for its latest third quarter

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Painful Bowel Drug  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Millions of women who suffer irritable bowel syndrome won
a new treatment Wednesday that promises some relief for their diarrhea and pain.
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration approved Lotronex, the first new therapy in
years for the mysterious intestinal disorder. The FDA cautions that the drug
offers modest help and is not a cure.
</P>
<P>
	   Irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS, involves chronic or recurrent abdominal
pain, the sudden and urgent need to go to the bathroom, and frequent diarrhea or
constipation. It affects up to 15 percent of the U.S. population, and is three
times more common in women than men.
</P>
<P>
	   Lotronex, known chemically as alosetron, is only for women who have
diarrhea-prone IBS. Studies so far show no effect in men, or in women whose IBS
is more prone to constipation than diarrhea, the FDA said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lotronex seems to work by blocking certain neurologic receptors that line
the intestine, explained Dr. Victor Raczowski, FDA's deputy chief of
gastrointestinal drugs. Those receptors affect pain sensations, fluid secretions
and how rapidly waste moves through the intestines. By blocking those receptors,
Lotronex theoretically offers a three-pronged attack against the pain and
diarrhea of IBS.
</P>
<P>
	   In clinical trials involving 1,200 women, Lotronex had "a modest but real
effect," Raczowski said. Of every 100 patients using it, about 10 to 15 got
relief from abdominal pain and diarrhea, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But even that modest effect is important because there are few other drugs
that treat IBS and the illness can severely disrupt people's lives, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The main side effect was constipation, affecting about 28 percent of
Lotronex users. Some had constipation so severe they had to quit taking
Lotronex, while others took fiber or laxatives, or temporarily stopped the drug
until their constipation was relieved, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lotronex does pose one serious concern, Raczowski said: Four patients have
developed ischemic colitis, a potentially lifethreatening inflammation of the
large intestine. All four recovered when they quit taking the drug, and the FDA
cannot prove Lotronex caused the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   But the FDA is warning patients that if they suffer sudden worsening of
abdominal pain or see any blood in their bowel movements, they immediately
should stop taking Lotronex and call a doctor.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors must be alert to possible colitis cases and report any to the
government at 1-888-INFO-FDA, Raczowski said. Manufacturer Glaxo Wellcome Inc.
has promised to clear up just how big this risk by studying several thousand
more patients once Lotronex hits the market.
</P>
<P>
	   Patients take one tablet twice a day. The prescription-only drug will be on
pharmacy shelves by mid-March and will cost $1.98 a tablet, Glaxo said.

<HEADLINE> Gold Resumes Rally; Crude Oil Up  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Gold futures resumed an interrupted rally Wednesday, surging on fears a
leading producer is teetering at the edge of failure and will leave banks short
10 million ounces of gold.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, wheat increased sharply and crude oil prices jumped nearly
3 percent on supply concerns and in spite of renewed speculation about OPEC
production increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Gold began its latest zoom upward last Friday when top producer Placer Dome
announced it was suspending its program for hedging, or betting on lower prices
-- clear evidence of optimism in the mining industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices performed the market equivalent of a triple lutz for two trading
days, leaping dramatically to a four-month high of $326.90 Monday before
slumping when Canada's Barrick Gold Corp. stopped short of following Placer
Dome's lead.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the market reversed course again and prices jumped as high as
$314 per troy ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange before the April
delivery contract settled up $6.90 at $308.60 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
	   Sparking the rally were rumors that AngloGoldfields Ltd. of South Africa,
the world's No. 1 gold producer, would buy back some of its gold hedges as
Placer Dome had done -- effectively giving up on its earlier bets on lower
prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Then a court in Ghana ordered a shareholders meeting to decide whether to
disband the board of Ashanti Goldfields Co., Africa's No. 3 gold producer.
Ashanti experienced liquidity problems after gold prices began soaring in late
September, losing money after betting on gold prices going in the other
direction.
</P>
<P>
	   If Ashanti goes under, analysts said, its bank creditors will be forced to
buy back some 10 million ounces of gold bullion that Ashanti borrowed and
subsequently sold.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar fears helped spur gold's rapid rise last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ashanti strikes fear into the hearts of any gold bears in that it was the
key catalyst for the October rally," said Bill O'Neill, senior futures
strategist for Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neill cautioned against any assumptions gold will continue to rise,
however.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market could have some further short-term upside, but one should be
careful about drawing the conclusions that this is the start of any super bull
market," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think this rally in gold is a monetary or economic event, or a
proxy for inflation, or is being driven by concerns about some financial houses.
This is a structural gold issue."
</P>
<P>
	   Gold's gains contributed to across-the-board advances in metals. April
platinum jumped 6 percent to $529.60 an ounce after hitting a new 9 1/2-year
high of $544.50, while March palladium reached its latest all-time high of $598
an ounce. March silver climbed 9 cents to $5.43 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
	   Crude prices increased after a Venezuelan official said no decision has been
made on whether the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will increase
supply after its agreement on lowered production expires next month.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, new data showed that gasoline inventories last week were down
12 percent from a year ago.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Form New Privacy Groups  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate lawmakers, grappling with complex privacy
issues, are forming groups to discuss possible new legislation and policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., announced Wednesday the
formation of a Senate Democratic Privacy Task Force, while Sen. Richard Shelby,
R-Ala., disclosed the creation of a bipartisan Congressional Privacy Caucus of
senators and House members.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The issue of privacy touches virtually every American, often in extremely
personal ways,'' Daschle said in a statement. ``Whether it is bank records or
medical files or Internet activities, Americans have a right to expect that
personal matters will be kept private.''
</P>
<P>
	   Because laws have not kept pace with sweeping technological changes, Daschle
added, Americans' right to privacy is at risk. ``Some of our most sensitive,
private (data) end up on databases that are then sold to the highest bidder,''
he said. ``That is wrong, it's dangerous and it has to stop.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pollsters have found that privacy now is one of the highest priorities for
Americans, who have expressed concern about threats to their privacy involving
financial data, health records and employment records, Daschle noted.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress enacted in November sweeping legislation removing Depression-era
barriers and allowing banks, securities firms and insurance companies to get
into each other's businesses. It included, for the first time, provisions giving
consumers the right to block financial companies from providing their personal
data to outside firms, such as telemarketers. However, the companies will be
able to share customers' data with affiliated financial companies under the same
corporate roof.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, lawmakers may consider legislation regarding medical privacy and
other areas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate Democratic task force will be headed by Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., the Senate Judiciary Committee's senior Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Democratic senators have expressed interest in joining the group, Leahy
spokesman David Carle said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby, a conservative, and Rep. Edward Markey of Massachusetts, a liberal
Democrat, bitterly opposed the financial overhaul legislation last year on
grounds its privacy protections were inadequate.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby and Markey will be co-chairmen of the new privacy caucus, along with
Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., and Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Some two dozen single-issue caucuses now exist on Capitol Hill, including
the Congressional Black Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus, and caucuses on women's
issues, human rights, Social Security, seniors, rural health, AIDS and the
Internet.

	   Feds Wage War Against Cyber-Vandals
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno promised today
that federal law enforcement authorities will do all in their power
to combat a wave of Internet vandalism. Reno said the motives of
the vandals are not known ``but they appear to be intended to
interfere with and disrupt legitimate electronic commerce.'' Ronald
Dick, a cyber-security expert at the FBI, said the hackers could
face a maximum penalty of 5 to 10 years in jail and up to a
$250,000 fine, or in some cases ``twice the gross loss to the
victim.'' Internet vandals testerday waged an unprecedented
campaign of electronic assaults against Web sites belonging to some
of the biggest names in cyberspace, disrupting access for consumers
to the some of the Web's most popular sites. Today, the online
brokerage, ETrade said it was attacked, but none of its accounts

journalists that several competitors had complained that Windows
2000 would give Microsoft a dominant position in the software
market. Monti said the European Commission has asked Microsoft for
more information. Microsoft has four weeks to respond to the
request. Microsoft officials said today that the company will
comply fully with the EU's request for information, and that the
investigation would not interfere with making Windows 2000
commercially available.

certain rates more aggressively than in recent years. Fort Worth,
Texas-based Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. is notifying
shippers it will raise rates for some customers as much as 4
percent in the railroad's first broad price hike since 1995.
Norfolk Southern Corp., based in Norfolk, Va., recently announced
an identical increase for customers shipping scrap metal, paper,
lumber and container freight. Top officials of Omaha, Neb.-based
Union Pacific Corp. and Richmond, Va.-based CSX Corp. have also
signaled they intend to raise rates.

	   Analyst Cohen Wary on Campaign Vows

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Superstar Wall Street analyst Abby Joseph Cohen
said today that the presidential candidates figure to be the only
wild card in determining the success of the U.S. stock markets in
2000. The candidates, eager to exploit the current budget surplus
to further their presidential aspirations, could potentially upset
what has been a sound domestic economic policy for the past decade,
said Cohen, an analyst with Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. None of the
candidates were mentioned by name. But both leading Republican
candidates, Sen. John McCain and Texas Governor George Bush, have
proposed large tax cuts based on budget surplus projections. Cohen
suggested the budget surplus be used to fulfill the nation's social
obligations and to pay down the national debt.

	   Goodyear Earnings Drop in 4th Q
</P>
<P>
	   AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- The Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. said its
earnings fell sharply in the fourth quarter, but they still beat
Wall Street estimates. Net income was $40.8 million, or 26 cents a
share, in the October-December period, compared with $121.5
million, or 78 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding special
items, such as restructuring charges, earnings were $47.6 million,
or 30 cents a share, in the fourth quarter compared with $115
million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales for the period
totaled $3.55 billion, up 11 percent from $3.2 billion a year
earlier.

	   Allstate Profits Fall 18 Percent
</P>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Allstate Corp.'s fourth-quarter operating profits
fell 18 percent, even excluding large charges for restructuring and
acquisitions. Higher auto claims and stiffer competition were major
factors. Today's report still exceeded analysts' lowered
expectations. Allstate said December operating earnings, excluding
one-time charges, were $524 million, or 66 cents a share, down from
$641 million, or 78 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Humana Earnings Exceed Forecasts
</P>
<P>
	   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Humana Inc.'s fourth quarter operating
profit nose dived 56 percent, but it was enough to beat Wall
Street's diminished expectations for the managed care firm. The
Louisville-based company said net operating income was $25 million,
or 15 cents per share in the final three months of 1999 compared
with $57 million, or 34 cents a share, a year ago. The results beat
Wall Street estimates by two cents, according to First Call/Thomson
Financial. Revenue in the fourth quarter rose 4.2 percent to $2.6
billion from $2.5 billion.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Boy Stabs Girl  </HEADLINE>
   By STAN LEHMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Police said Wednesdy that a 9-year-old boy's knife
attack against a neighbor girl was inspired by the slasher doll Chucky of the
``Child's Play'' horror films.
</P>
<P>
	   The girl, 7, received 25 superficial knife wounds in the back, chest and
neck and was out of danger, said doctors at Hospital da Base in Brasilia, 20
miles from her home in the poor district of Santa Maria.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack Monday came three days after the boy -- who cannot be named
because he is a minor -- watched the film ``Child's Play 2'' on television. It
revived a debate on whether violence in the media can influence people's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy used three serrated knives. The girl's wounds were not worse because
the ``boy is small and did not have enough physical strength,'' inspector Suzana
Machado said in a telephone interview from Brasilia, the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've never seen a child attack another with such violence,'' said Machado,
who is on the police department's Special Office for Children and Adolescents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He came over to our house and asked her if she wanted to die,'' the girl's
mother, Raimunda Nonata do Nascimento, said in a television interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearing the girl's screams, neighbors rushed to the house where they found
her in the bathroom. The boy climbed to the roof. Police found him hiding behind
a water tank.
</P>
<P>
	   Machado said the boy told her that he had a ``strong urge to imitate
Chucky.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the movie, the spirit of a psychotic murderer possesses the doll, which
comes to life and stabs several people to death.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence follows a shooting in November in which a medical student
killed three people in a Sao Paulo movie theater. Police later pointed to eerie
similarities between his behavior and the video game ``Duke Nukem 3D,'' which
the killer played on a home computer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Horror films or violent films definitely stimulate the imagination and
fantasies of children and adults,'' said Marcos Roberto Vieira Garcia,
psychologist at the University of Sao Paulo. ``For a disturbed individual,
already prone to violence or aggressive behavior, these films could easily
detonate similar behavior. He sees the action in the film as reality and thinks
he has the green light to repeat it.''
</P>
<P>
	   It's not the first time ``Child's Play'' has been linked to violence. It was
a favorite of gunman Martin Bryant, who killed 35 people in Tasmania in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   SBT, the Brazilian network that aired the film, was unavailable for
immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Because he is a minor, the boy will not go to jail. A judge will decide
whether he will be sent to a special juvenile detention center, a psychiatric
hospital or home.

<HEADLINE> High Prices Spur Iraq Oil Smuggling  </HEADLINE>
   By ANWAR FARUQI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Smugglers evading U.S. destroyers in the
Persian Gulf are shipping more and more Iraqi oil in violation of U.N.
sanctions, reaping handsome profits and lining the pockets of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein, the U.S. Navy says.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week's seizure of a Russian tanker carrying illicit Iraqi fuel
highlighted the issue of Iraqi oil smuggling, which the U.S. Navy estimates has
nearly doubled in six months. U.N. naval forces seized the tanker off the
Emirates' coast.
</P>
<P>
	   The 4,000 tons of oil -- equivalent to 29,320 barrels -- seized from the
Volga-Neft-147 is only a fraction of what is getting through, said Cmdr. Jeff
Gradeck, spokesman for the Bahrain-based U.S. Navy 5th Fleet.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, when oil prices hit nine-year highs of about $28 a barrel,
367,000 tons -- 2.7 million barrels -- of Iraqi oil were smuggled out, according
to Navy estimates. Last September, when prices were about $19 a barrel, 191,000
tons -- 1.4 million barrels -- were smuggled out, Gradeck said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The amount of oil smuggled out of Iraq has doubled since August last year,
when oil prices began to increase,'' Gradeck said in a telephone interview
Wednesday from Bahrain. ``That means increased profits for the smugglers and
increased profits for the Iraqi regime.''
</P>
<P>
	   Crude prices today are about $26.75 a barrel, and although smugglers sell
for less than the legitimate market rate, their prices go up with world market
prices. Western diplomats suspect merchants in Iran and the Emirates buy
smuggled Iraqi oil at huge discounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq is banned from most international commerce because of its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, which led to the Persian Gulf War. Although a December U.N.
resolution includes lifting a cap of $5.2 billion on Iraqi oil sales every six
months, Iraq has not accepted the resolution and pumps within the old ceiling.
</P>
<P>
	   The oil-for-food program has allowed the limited oil sales so Iraq can buy
food and medicine for its people and spare parts to rebuild its oil industry,
shattered during the 1991 war.
</P>
<P>
	   Smuggled oil revenues, however, go straight to Saddam, observers say.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even if you reckon that the smugglers are selling the oil at a bit over
half the market price, at today's prices that means Saddam is making $50 million
a month. That's going directly into his coffers,'' said Leo Drollas, analyst at
London's Center for Global Energy Studies.
</P>
<P>
	   Because proceeds from legitimate oil sales are strictly monitored, they
cannot be diverted to rebuild Iraq's military. Revenues from smuggled Iraqi oil
cause concern because Saddam can do whatever he wants with them.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq has long denied that smuggling of crude oil or byproducts exists in the
Gulf. It maintains that the United States scrutinizes Gulf ships traveling to
and from Iraq but does nothing to stop brisk oil smuggling overland from
northern Iraq -- a Kurdish area outside Baghdad's control -- into Turkey, a U.S.
ally.
</P>
<P>
	   Allegations that Iraqi leaders benefit from Gulf smuggling aren't new. A
former aide to Saddam's son Odai said in 1998 that his ex-employer profited from
it. The aide, Abbas al-Janabi, who had defected to Britain, said Odai owned 50
vessels that smuggled oil through Iranian waters.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Forbes magazine estimated Saddam Hussein's wealth at $6 billion
and attributed it to oil and an alleged smuggling operation controlled by Odai.
</P>
<P>
	   Small tankers and other vessels allegedly flood their ballast tanks and
compartments with the cargo picked up at ports on Iraq's Shatt al-Arab waterway,
then skirt the Iran coast as they steam southward. Iran denies complicity.
</P>
<P>
	   Smugglers carrying a 4,000-ton cargo, like that aboard the Volga-Neft-147,
can make $300,000 to $500,000, Western diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States said it has stepped up efforts to stop illegal oil exports
from Iraq, but international law and coastal shoals keep deep-hulled U.S.,
British and other warships on sanctions patrol out of Iran's 12-mile-wide
territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Emirates vowed to crack down on smuggling after a 1998 oil spill from a
rickety barge. But the Emirates has said it cannot monitor its entire 435-mile
coastline, and has consistently called for sanctions against Iraq to be lifted.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia also supports steps that would lead to the eventual lifting of the
U.N. economic embargo. Amid tensions over the stoppage of its ship, the Russian
navy said Wednesday it plans to send a reconnaissance ship to the Mediterranean
to monitor NATO vessels in the Gulf, the news agency Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The ship is to leave from the Black Sea port of Sevastopol on Feb. 16, the
report said. It said the ship's aim will be to collect information about NATO
ships in the Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Democrats support some ideas, see problems with others  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Gov. John G. Rowland's budget proposals met with
polite applause Wednesday, but Democratic legislative leaders are already
expressing opposition to some of his ideas.
<P>
	   "The numbers just don't work," said Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin
Sullivan. "They simply don't add up."
</P>
<P>
	   In June, the Legislature passed a balanced $23.7 billion biennial budget,
including $11.6 billion in spending during the first year and $12.1 billion in
the 2000-2001 fiscal year. But Rowland said Wednesday he wants to spend an
additional $252 million this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan said Rowland's budget proposal adds new spending while cutting $111
million in promises made last year. He said it also exceeds the constitutional
spending cap in the first year and would likely fall just $40 million under the
cap in second year.
</P>
<P>
	   The current budget is $69 million below the cap in its second year, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our first look at it suggests that you simply cannot move those kinds of
numbers around and end up with a budget that is where the governor has said it
is today," said Sullivan. "Particularly on the cap calculations, we believe
there are phantom calculations."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Sullivan and other Democrats support many of Rowland's ideas,
including using the state's $241 million revenue surplus to pay off and avoid
debt, and a one-time, $20 million bailout for the University of Connecticut
Health Center, which faces a $21 million deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic lawmakers were pleased that Rowland suggested no major education
cuts, but were disappointed that the proposal did not include a tuition freeze
in the second year.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican leaders said they were confident that the governor's plan would
get bipartisan approval.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a responsible governor proposing a responsible budget," said state
Sen. William Nickerson, R-Greenwich. "He's proposed reform which I think all
sides of the aisle will agree on."
</P>
<P>
	   House Minority Leader Robert Ward, R-Northford, called Rowland's proposal
"an excellent plan."
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland's plan includes a maximum $500 tax credit for middle- and low-income
families who send their children to private schools.
</P>
<P>
	   "My concern is that we're not increasing funding for the targeted education
grants we know are working," said Rep. Cameron Staples, D-New Haven, co-chairman
of the Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   House Majority Leader Dave Pudlin, D-New Britain, said the state should be
looking to improve education for the majority, not a select few. He said a goal
should be to increase enrollment at community colleges.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Moira Lyons, D-Stamford, said there are still major
differences in the budgets of the state's public school systems.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe until we finish that job, we shouldn't take on another," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. William A. Dyson, D-New Haven, said he was concerned that the private
school tax credit "potentially undermines public education."
</P>
<P>
	   "While it may not be taken from line item budget, it's money that would have
come in to the state that could have been used for the agenda," added Daria
Plummer, head of the Connecticut Education Association, the state's largest
teachers union.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats oppose Rowland's plan to trim 7 cents off the state's gas tax,
saying it would not lead to a price cut.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think ... it should be predicated upon on some sort of guarantee that, in
fact, the price of gas will go down," said Sen. Martin Looney, D-New Haven.

<HEADLINE> Sens.: Aid Can't Keep Up With Costs  </HEADLINE>
   By ANJETTA McQUEEN AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators complained to university officials Wednesday
that more federal student loans and aid seem to be enticing colleges to raise
their tuitions, and students and government cannot keep up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is incumbent on us to take a serious look at the effect of this
government spending on tuition rates,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn.,
chairman of the Government Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuitions at public and private schools overall have doubled in the past 20
years, after inflation, making college unaffordable for many families despite
the $41 billion in annual federal grants and guaranteed loans, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Senators said they fear more federal aid could simply drive up college costs
even more, speculating that states could raise public tuition caps -- figuring
more students could afford it because of a larger loan, a higher grant or a
potential tax break on their bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Senators also said private schools might reduce their campus-based programs
in favor of students who can afford to pay their own way with the help of
federal loans and tax deductions.
</P>
<P>
	   College officials denied Wednesday that they were driving up tuition costs
to take advantage of increases in federal aid and said there's little government
can do to control costs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tuition price controls will not work and will be destructive of academic
quality in higher education,'' said William Troutt, president of Rhodes College
in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's hard to believe that parents would welcome a decision by the federal
government to curtail severely their access to loan capital,'' said David
Breneman, an education school dean at the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   Soaring price tags can be blamed on a handful of the most-expensive private
schools catering to students who don't need aid, said Harvard economist Caroline
Hoxby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no evidence that students are being forced to enroll in
inexpensive colleges that are inappropriate for their level of preparedness,''
said Hoxby, pointing out that Education Department data also shows that since
1970, tuition at the least-expensive schools has actually dropped 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Private schools cost an average $15,000 per year; public colleges charge
about $3,300 annually. Nearly half of 14 million U.S. college students receive
some sort of aid. About 60 percent of the help a student gets to pay these bills
comes from loans that average $3,000 a year, while grants make up less than 40
percent of available aid.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If college becomes a luxury that an increasing percentage of our
population cannot afford, it will expand the economic divide between the higher
education haves and have-nots and stunt our economic growth,'' said Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., the committee's top Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   During the two-day hearing that began Wednesday, the committee also plans to
discuss merit-aid programs that offer discounts for high-performing students who
may not be among the neediest, and scholarship scams that ask parents for money
to search for financial aid.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising student loan debt is another concern, said college graduate Jamie
Pueschel, who told lawmakers that government budget surpluses should be used to
boost grant programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have little ability to save money and have no idea when I will be able
to afford a car let alone buy a house,'' said Pueschel, a lobbyist with the
United States Student Association. She has a $19,000 debt and a $25,000 annual
income.

<HEADLINE> Insurers Urged on Holocaust Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More European insurance companies should face up to their
moral responsibility and join an international effort to compensate
Holocaust-era victims, legislators were told Wednesday, amid particularly harsh
criticism for the Dutch.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We strongly encourage all insurers that issued policies during the
Holocaust -- that is, all of those in Germany, all of those in Austria and in
the Netherlands, including Aegon, to join the international commission and
participate fully in its claims, outreach and humanitarian programs,'' Deputy
Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat told the House banking committee.
</P>
<P>
	   He referred to a commission negotiating the plan for compensating heirs
denied payment on policies of family members killed in Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   Netherlands insurer Aegon, which controls Trans-America in the United
States, has declined to join the group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those insurance companies, particularly Dutch insurers who have refused to
join are displaying rank insensitivity to the memory of those who were
victimized,'' said World Jewish Congress Chairman Israel Singer.
</P>
<P>
	   The government of the Netherlands, in its testimony, noted the country began
restitution programs for Holocaust victims as early as 1945, adding that a
government-appointed committee found last year that wrongs in the insurance
industry had already been redressed.
</P>
<P>
	   The testimony came at the opening of a two-day hearing into progress being
made in a range of programs of Holocaust-related programs, including efforts to
compensate slave and forced laborers, return stolen gold, and return bank
deposits to heirs of account holders killed by the Nazis.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani: I support Ten Commandments in schools  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Wednesday that he supports
the right of public schools to post the Ten Commandments in classrooms, even
though the practice violates the First Amendment of the Constitution.
<P>
	   "If teachers want to put up the Ten Commandments, they should be allowed to
do that," Giuliani said during a City Hall press conference. "They shouldn't be
harassed if they want to do that. The Ten Commandments is part of our tradition.
It's part of our history, it's part of Western civilization. If teachers would
like to emphasize what's in it and talk about it, there shouldn't be some kind
of inquisition that says that they can't do that."
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor - who was educated in Catholic parochial schools and who was once
a First Amendment lawyer - added however, that posting the commandments should
not be required.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani, a moderate Republican who has been courting elements of his
party's conservative wing recently, is running for the U.S. Senate against first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The commandment issue was raised after The Village Voice obtained an
eight-page Giuliani fund-raising letter mailed to out-of-state religious
conservatives. In the letter, Giuliani complains that, "liberal judges have
banned the posting of even the Ten Commandments in our public schools."
</P>
<P>
	   In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that placing the commandments in
schools violates First Amendment protections against a government's promoting
religion.
</P>
<P>
	   But there has been a recent push in communities across the United States to
allow the display of the commandments in public spaces, including schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, the Indiana House of Representatives overwhelmingly
approved a bill that would allow the commandments to be posted in schools,
courthouses or other government property if displayed with other documents of
historical significance that have formed and influenced the U.S. legal system.
</P>
<P>
	   Indiana's state senate has already approved a similar bill and Gov. Frank
O'Bannon has said he will sign the legislation if it is found to be
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of such legislation say the United States based its system of
laws on the 10 rules the biblical Book of Exodus says God gave to Moses.
</P>
<P>
	   But Randall Balmer, a Barnard College professor of religion, said that
publicly posting the commandments constitutes "an excessive attack on religion."
</P>
<P>
	   "Religion has thrived in this country precisely because it has been
uncoerced," said Balmer. "The minute you post the Ten Commandments, you
undermine the very basis of what America stands for and you threaten the
vitality of religion in America."
</P>
<P>
	   Balmer added that anyone who is neither Christian nor Jewish, "should be
offended. They should be up in arms about this."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to advocating the posting of the commandments, Giuliani said
Wednesday that sometimes, teachers who pray with students are fired faster than
teachers found to have serious criminal records, including for sex crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   As an example, Giuliani cited a New York City school teacher dismissed last
year for leading students in prayer after one of their classmates had died.
</P>
<P>
	   "They had a prayer and the teacher was fired in record time," said Giuliani.
"And I made the point then that it was odd to me that a teacher would be fired
for something like that in a few weeks when pedophiles, who are accused and
convicted of pedophilia, teachers who do that, remain there for three or four
years."

<HEADLINE> O'Donnell Gets Wish, Is Phone Friend  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- After waging a public campaign to be a "phone friend" on
ABC's "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," talk show host Rosie O'Donnell got her
wish.
</P>
<P>
	   She's called upon for help on Sunday's edition of the quiz show, by a
contestant using a "lifeline" to get advice answering a question.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Donnell and ABC were tight-lipped Wednesday about who O'Donnell helped,
what the question was or even if she got it right.
</P>
<P>
	   But she'd be less likely to brag about it -- as she did to talk show guest
Matt Lauer on Wednesday -- if she gave a contestant a bum steer. She told Lauer
that she was called the night before when the show was taped, then promptly
refused to answer his questions about it.
</P>
<P>
	   "Let me just say I was nervous, and it's a lot more tension than people
realize," O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
	   As game show viewers know, contestants get three "lifelines" if they are
stumped by a multiple choice question. They can poll the audience, have two
wrong answers taken out of contention, or call a friend. The friend has 30
seconds to offer advice.
</P>
<P>
	   On her own show, the "Millionaire"-fixated O'Donnell has frequently asked
for the opportunity to help out. Contestants had arranged for O'Donnell to be a
phone friend four times before she got on the air during Tuesday's taping, said
her spokeswoman, Jennifer Glasek.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Donnell's campaign hasn't always gone smoothly, though. The New York Post
reported this week that several "Millionaire" contestants had asked for her help
and hadn't gotten a reply.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post called her a "phone-friend phony."
</P>
<P>
	   Glasek said O'Donnell had gotten so many requests that she'd been unable to
respond to them all. She was also rejected once because she wanted to be reached
by cell phone and the show's rules don't allow this, ABC said.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Donnell's new friend gets a bonus for calling her: the contestant will be
a guest on her talk show Monday.

<HEADLINE> 'Hurricane' Carter lawyers fight back against families' charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Point by point, lawyers for Rubin "Hurricane" Carter on
Wednesday rebutted charges by victims' relatives that Carter is a killer who got
away with murder, saying his case was corrupted by racism and prosecutorial
misconduct.
<P>
	   And while one lawyer said the film "The Hurricane" could have explained
Carter's legal battle better, he said it accurately portrays the former
middleweight boxer's innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   "They conducted a horrendously poor investigation," said Lewis Steel, the
lawyer for Carter's codefendant, John Artis. "It's a sad day when after all
these years, officials in the state of New Jersey can't say we made a horrendous
mistake."
</P>
<P>
	   The nationwide release last month of "The Hurricane," which won a Golden
Globe award for Denzel Washington's portrayal of Carter, has renewed interest in
Carter's case and has forced the film's producers to defend themselves against
charges that they changed details of the story to make Carter look like a better
man than he was.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter's lawyers released reams of court documents Wednesday they said show
that Carter didn't kill a bartender and two patrons of a Paterson, N.J., bar in
1966, including testimony by a chief investigator who said early witness
descriptions of the men who left the bar were "not even close" to Carter and
Artis.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Vincent DeSimone of the Passaic County (N.J.) Prosecutor's Office told a
grand jury two weeks after the June 17, 1966, killings that two of the shooting
victims had said light-skinned, tall black men wearing dark clothing had left
the bar, according to the testimony. Carter was wearing a white jacket at the
time, is 5 feet 7, and wore a beard, DeSimone told grand jurors.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter and Artis were convicted twice of the murders but Carter was freed in
1985 by a federal judge who said prosecutors unfairly presented an argument that
Carter was looking for racial revenge. Artis was freed on parole a few years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to other charges made a day earlier by relatives of DeSimone and
the murder victims, the lawyers:
</P>
<P>
	   -said that victim Hazel Tanis identified two men with criminal records who
were not Carter and Artis from police photographs before she died, refuting a
statement by Tanis' daughter that Tanis named Carter.
</P>
<P>
	   -said that a bullet and a shotgun shell found in Carter's car did not
exactly match the murder weapon and were planted by police.
</P>
<P>
	   -accused police and prosecutors of influencing witness testimony to target
Carter. Witness Patty Valentine's initial description of Carter's car was vague,
attorney Myron Beldock said, but she was positive it was Carter's car at trial.
</P>
<P>
	   -said that a 1966 police report of a polygraph test administered to Carter,
in which the sergeant says Carter could have been involved with the crime, was
"a forgery."
</P>
<P>
	   "This case is corrupt. It is a deceitful, fraudulent prosecution," Beldock
said. He said of the family members who have believed a different story for
decades, "people get wedded to their misconceptions."
</P>
<P>
	   The lawyers blamed prosecutors for suppressing favorable defense evidence,
coaching witnesses and injecting racism into the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Passaic County Prosecutor Ronald Fava noted Wednesday that no court has
ruled that Carter is innocent and said prosecutors only decided not to try him a
third time because witnesses had died and memories had faded.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he knew the people who worked on the case, and "they are people of
impeccable integrity and would never even consider doing anything unethical,
much less participate in the knowing framing of an innocent man."
</P>
<P>
	   Beldock said the release of the movie, largely based on Carter's
autobiography, has renewed a long-running debate but hasn't changed anyone's
mind.
</P>
<P>
	   Steel, however, said the film could have debunked the evidence against
Carter more effectively.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we all would have been better off if the movie had more carefully
analyzed the evidence," he said.

<HEADLINE> Official: N. Korea Working on Nukes  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- North Korea appears to be continuing its ballistic
missile program and selling technology to other nations despite a
well-publicized testing moratorium, a top U.S. intelligence official told
Congress on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   While North Korea so far has fulfilled its promise not to test missiles in
the atmosphere, ground testing of various components is believed to be taking
place, said Robert Walpole, the CIA official in charge of strategic and nuclear
issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our judgment is that they are continuing the program,'' Walpole told a
Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee. ``The program is still alive.''
</P>
<P>
	   Walpole summarized the unclassified portions of an intelligence estimate of
the ballistic missile threat completed in September.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, North Korea agreed to shelve its nuclear weapons program in
exchange for energy supplies from the United States, Japan and South Korea. But
it unnerved Asia and Washington in August 1998 by testing a three-stage Taepo
Dong-1 rocket that flew over Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   Last September, North Korea agreed to forgo a test of the newly developed
longer-range Taepo Dong-2 missile for the duration of talks with the United
States. In return, Washington lifted some of its half-century-old economic
sanctions on North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   Those talks are to resume next month when a senior North Korean official,
yet to be designated by Pyongyang, meets in Washington with administration
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. concerns about North Korean missiles are high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   Walpole told the Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee on international
security, proliferation and federal services that if North Korea ends the
freeze, it could test its long-range Taepo Dong-2 ballistic missile later this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   A three-stage Taepo Dong-2 would be capable delivering a several-hundred-ton
nuclear payload anywhere in the United States, Walpole said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We project that during the next 15 years the United States most likely
will face Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) threats from Russia, China
and North Korea, probably from Iran and possibly from Iraq,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the threat from Russia, with some 4,500 nuclear warheads, ``will
continue to be the most robust and lethal,'' but that an unauthorized or
accidental launch of a Russian missile ``is highly unlikely so long as current
technical and procedural safeguards are in place.''
</P>
<P>
	   Walpole said the proliferation of shorter-range ballistic missiles, ``driven
primarily by North Korean No Dong sales, has created an immediate, serious and
growing threat to U.S. forces, interests and allies in the Middle East and
Asia.''
</P>
<P>
	   Missiles Iran now has -- with help from North Korea, the Russian and China
-- can reach deep into Turkey, for instance, he said. ``That's NATO. We're
trying to get this message out.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``North Korea continues to demonstrate a willingness to sell its missiles,''
Walpole said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., the subcommittee chairman, said he was troubled
that ``North Korea appears ready to test its more capable Taepo Dong-2 at any
time; Iran has already tested a medium-range ballistic missile and has begun
developing longer-range weapons.''
</P>
<P>
	   He added: ``These worrisome developments reflect not just a determination by
rogue states to acquire ballistic missiles, but the increasing availability of
the technology required to develop these weapons.''
</P>
<P>
	   Walpole stressed that the new intelligence estimates do not predict that
countries such as North Korea, Iran or Iraq will seek to use such weapons, but
only that they have the capability.

<HEADLINE> FBI: Biggest Cyberattack Was Simple  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- This week's computer attacks on Internet sites are the
largest in memory but are not particularly sophisticated and easily could have
been launched by one 15-year-old boy, a senior FBI official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Ron Dick, chief of the FBI's computer investigation section, said the bureau
could not solve the crime or prevent future Internet vandalism without
considerable help from the private sector. ``We're going to need the help of
everyone in the community to resolve this,'' Dick told a news conference at FBI
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Janet Reno said the motive and identity of the attacker or
attackers are not known but, ``We're committed to taking steps to ensure that
e-commerce remains a secure place to do business.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a wakeup call,'' said Commerce Secretary William Daley. ``I don't
think these incidents should cause people not to go online to do whatever
business theyre doing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dick said the week's vandalism was accomplished using ``distributed denial
of service'' tools.
</P>
<P>
	   In such attacks, a hacker hides these tools, known as daemons, on hundreds
or even thousands of innocent third-party computers. The daemons can be
triggered later from a remote location to launch simultaneous attacks on a
single target, such as Yahoo! or eBay. The attacking daemons give false
addresses so they are harder to trace.
</P>
<P>
	   The volume of attacks overwhelms the target and causes it to cease
operations, much the same way that a very heavy volume of telephone calls can
tie up a phone system and leave most users with no dial tone or a busy signal,
Dick said.
</P>
<P>
	   Many tools for such an attack exist on Internet Web sites, and anyone can
download them, he said. ``They do not take much technical expertise to use,''
Dick said. ``A 15-year-old kid could launch these attacks. This is not something
that it takes a great deal of sophistication to do.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Dick noted that since the FBI does not know who conducted the attacks,
it's ``always a possibility'' that a foreign government is responsible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Until you get to the keyboard being utilized, you don't know what you're
dealing with,'' Dick said. He noted that most similar, past attacks used some
overseas computers as well as ones in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   Dick could not remember any attacks that affected as many millions of people
as those this week.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to not knowing who is responsible, the FBI also does not know
how many innocent third-party computers were used to launch them and does not
know if the attacks have ended, Dick said.
</P>
<P>
	   Agents are starting from victim computers and tracking the attacks back
through the Internet service providers that delivered the attacking daemons.
Dick likened it to tracking a trail left by bank robbers from the bank to their
lair. Tom Burke, of the General Services Administration, said no attacks had
been traced thus far to government computers.
</P>
<P>
	   Dick urged the private sector to report any attacks promptly so tracing can
begin quickly. And he urged private Internet sites to keep logs of traffic,
install any tools developed to thwart such attacks and keep them updated.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the New Year's weekend, the FBI posted tools that could detect whether
two types of daemons were hidden on a computer system. Some 2,600 businesses
downloaded the FBI tools at no cost and three found such daemons, prompting the
FBI to open criminal investigations of who put them there.

<HEADLINE> Report: Fatal police shooting justified  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - A North Branford police officer was justified in
killing a motorist because he reasonably believed he needed to defend himself, a
report into the shooting found Wednesday.
<P>
	   New Haven State's Attorney Michael Dearington said no charges would be filed
against Officer Michael Breen in the July 13 shooting death of Victoria Cooper
of West Haven.
</P>
<P>
	   "Officer Breen, through no fault of his own, was confronted with a motor
vehicle weighing over 3,000 pounds bearing down on him, and the operator did not
heed his efforts to stop or slow down," the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cooper's family and their lawyer could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
Messages were left at the lawyer's office and the family's home.
</P>
<P>
	   The family maintains the shooting was not justified. They have filed a civil
rights lawsuit against Breen in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   The report states Cooper's intent cannot be determined, but that cocaine in
her system may have affected her behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   North Branford Police Chief Matthew Canelli said he had expected the
investigation to find the shooting was justified. Breen was put been back on
regular patrol months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "Officer Breen had no intentions when he went out that evening that he was
going to take a life, but what happened happened. Ms. Cooper had to be
responsible for her actions also that evening," Canelli said.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation found that Cooper, 41, and her friend, Steven Guerette,
42, had smoked crack cocaine about an hour before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   They had driven in Guerette's brother's Camaro to a convenience store on
Route 80 at about 1 a.m. and Guerette was using the pay telephone when Breen
spotted them.
</P>
<P>
	   Breen stated he passed by the car three times and noticed its occupants were
watching him. He called in the license plate and found it was registered to
Guerette's brother, whose license had been suspended.
</P>
<P>
	   The car then drove down Route 80 and Breen followed. The car crossed the
center line three times, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Breen pulled Guerette over and asked him to step out of the car. A search
found Guerette was carrying two bags containing a substance that resembled
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   Guerette then fled into the woods. Breen chased him, but lost him and
returned to his cruiser.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that as he returned he saw the Camaro move toward him with its
headlights on. Breen said he yelled and waved his arms several times, but the
car did not stop, so he fired two shots.
</P>
<P>
	   A state police reconstruction of the shooting found Breen was in front of
and slightly to the right of the car, near the middle of the road, when he fired
the first shot. The bullet hit the car's hood and ricocheted.
</P>
<P>
	   Breen said he moved to avoid being hit as he fired a second shot. The bullet
went through the driver's side window at a 65-degree angle and hit Cooper in the
left side, exiting through her right chest.
</P>
<P>
	   Residue from the cartridge was found on the driver's side door, indicating
the car was very close to Breen.
</P>
<P>
	   Inside the car, police found more cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   The report stated Guerette had a history of fleeing police to prevent the
seizure of narcotics. He had fled from Madison police in 1986, injuring a police
officer, and in 1990 told a female driver to flee after police asked him to step
out of the car.
</P>
<P>
	   A week before the shooting, Guerette was involved in a police chase in which
Cooper was a passenger. He crashed the car and fled into the woods, where he was
captured.
</P>
<P>
	   Guerette is serving a one-year prison sentence for interfering with an
officer and drug possession.

<HEADLINE> Humana Earnings Exceed Forecasts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Humana Inc.'s fourth quarter operating profit nose
dived 56 percent, but it was enough to beat Wall Street's diminished
expectations for the managed care firm.
</P>
<P>
	   The Louisville-based company said net operating income was $25 million, or
15 cents per share in the final three months of 1999 compared with $57 million,
or 34 cents a share, a year ago. The results beat Wall Street estimates by two
cents, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue in the fourth quarter rose 4.2 percent to $2.6 billion from $2.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The drop in profits was expected following a previously announced charge of
$495 million in the quarter related the company lowering the value for two
insurance companies it bought in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Including the charge, Humana reported a net loss of $382 million, or $2.28
cents per share, for the year compared with net income of $129 million, or 77
cents per share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our results for 1999 are clearly not acceptable," newly appointed President
and Chief Executive Officer Michael McCallister said. "During the second half of
1999, we have put in place corrective actions that have begin to produce
favorable results, but more importantly set the stage for 2000."
</P>
<P>
	   Humana has undergone considerable upheaval since a planned
multibillion-dollar merger with United HealthCare Corp. collapsed in August
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, a Florida jury ruled that a Humana subsidiary must pay a young
girl with cerebral palsy almost $80 million because it improperly terminated her
treatment and lied to her parents.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, excluding charges, Humana reported net income of $109
million or 65 cents per share, compared to $213 million or $1.27 per share in
1998. Including the charges, Humana reported a net loss of $382 million or $2.28
per share, compared to net income of $129 million or 77 cents per share in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, revenues rose 3.4 percent to $10.1 billion from $9.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Humana fell 62 1/2 cents to $7.56 1/4 in trading Wednesday at 4:30
p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Russia Tests Rocket With Accelerator  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia on Wednesday successfully tested a rocket equipped to
put payloads higher into orbit, but lost the re-entry vehicle on its return to
Earth.
</P>
<P>
	   A Soyuz rocket equipped with a so-called Fregat accelerator unit blasted off
at 2:20 a.m. Moscow time from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakstan, said
Konstantin Kreidenko, a spokesman at Russian Aerospace Agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fregat unit also put a dummy payload into orbit.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fregat returned into the Earth's atmosphere after five orbits, but the
unit had not been located on the ground, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported late
Wednesday. The search was suspended due to darkness and was to resume Thursday,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   The launch also was intended to test a new system for cushioning cargoes on
their way back to Earth. The inflatable device is called an aerobrake.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's once-powerful space program has been crippled by funding cuts since
the collapse of the Soviet Union. But it has earned some money from commercial
satellite launches, and the government recently decided to keep the aging Mir
space station in orbit at least through August.

<HEADLINE> Twenty-one Sterling Foster brokers charged in small-stock scam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Prosecutors brought criminal charges Wednesday against
21 former managers and brokers at Sterling Foster &AMP; Co., a defunct Long Island
company that specialized in small-company stocks.
<P>
	   The charges against the employees of the firm headquartered in Melville from
1994 to 1997 alleged that they tricked investors into buying certain stocks so
they could artificially inflate their prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said they used high pressure, false and misleading sales pitches
to convince customers that the stocks would rise rapidly in value, producing
more than $200 million in illegal profits for employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The charges stemmed from six public offerings, five of which were
underwritten by Sterling Foster. The defendants were each charged with
conspiracy to commit securities fraud, mail and wire fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   An indictment filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan alleged that the
brokers promoted the stocks without disclosing to customers that they were
receiving excessive undisclosed compensation as high as 15 percent of the price
of the stock to pitch the securities.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said the defendants were part of so-called
boiler rooms where "corrupt brokers prey on the unsuspecting public."
</P>
<P>
	   In a release, she said the boiler rooms where brokers try to heat up the
value of a stock through deceit "are particularly dangerous because they serve
as a boot camp to train the next generation of boiler-room operators."
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutor noted that many of the 21 defendants held management or
supervisory positions at the Sterling Foster company.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI Assistant Director Lewis D. Schiliro said the case sends "a clear
message to others who would prey on unsuspecting good-faith investors."
</P>
<P>
	   "While the current period of unparalleled prosperity provides a window of
opportunity for investors big and small, it should not be looked at as a window
of opportunity for unscrupulous boiler-room operators using high-pressure sales
tactics to pump-and-dump worthless securities," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors earlier had brought charges against the company and several
others, including Randolph Pace, who allegedly secretly controlled the company,
and Alan Novich, an attorney and former dentist alleged to be an accomplice.
Both are awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Six other defendants had pleaded guilty to charges arising out of 11
allegedly fraudulent public offerings involving Sterling Foster. Those
defendants have forfeited or agreed to give up about $32 million in illegal
gains, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides the criminal charges Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange
Commission also brought civil securities fraud charges against 18 defendants.
</P>
<P>
	   Schiliro said the indictment Wednesday resulted from a focus on managers and
supervisors at Sterling Foster.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will set our sights on not just the headliners, but also the supporting
casts of these productions," Schiliro said.

<HEADLINE> Cisco Stock Jumps to New High  </HEADLINE>
    By CLIFF EDWARDS AP Technology Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Internet equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc. briefly
pushed past General Electric Co. on Wednesday to become the world's second most
valuable company, further highlighting the Web's growing influence on the
economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Cisco's stock jumped to an all-time high of $135 a share in morning trading
on the Nasdaq Stock Market following late Tuesday's release of yet another
quarterly report that topped Wall Street's expectations for sales and profits.
</P>
<P>
	   The stock pulled back to $128.62 1/2 by the end of the Nasdaq session, still
$3.06 1/4 higher on the day, giving it a market value of $439.9 billion based on
its 3.42 million shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
	   General Electric's stock, meanwhile, fell $2.43 3/4 a share to $134.75 on
the New York Stock Exchange, finishing with a total market value of $441.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Depending on the whims of investors, the two companies may trade spots
repeatedly on the valuation list, just as Microsoft Corp. has in taking the No.
1 ranking away from GE. For now, both Cisco and GE are far behind Microsoft,
which was worth $563.1 billion at the end of Nasdaq trading despite falling $5 a
share to $104.93 3/4.
</P>
<P>
	   It was only late last year that Cisco, the top supplier of gear to move
voice, data and video traffic across the Web and other networks, surpassed Intel
Corp. as the most valuable company in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
	   And while GE remains a major force in a dozen industries and Intel is still
the world's top producer of computer chips, investors are betting that Cisco
will be one of the biggest winners in the race to make the Internet an integral
part of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
	   Notably, the milestone for Cisco came on the same day that its two main
competitors switched places on the valuation chart for the first time. Nortel
Networks, a leader in fiber-optic technology that speeds the Web, rose 75 cents
to $121.75 on the NYSE for a market value of about $167 billion, while arch
rival Lucent Technologies sagged $1.43 3/4 to $52.75, slipping below $166
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The meteoric rise of companies like Cisco and Nortel underscores the
explosive growth of the new Web economy, which has created unparalleled wealth
and fueled a record U.S. economic expansion by improving worker productivity.
</P>
<P>
	   Cisco had $69 million in revenues when it went public in 1990, compared to
sales in fiscal 1999 of $12.2 billion. The company expects to see revenue growth
this year of 30 percent to 50 percent, chief executive John Chambers said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
	   "It comes down to execution and prioritization because there are so many
opportunities out there, you still only address about half of the ones you want
to," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company reported Tuesday that operating income rose to $906 million, or
25 cents a share, in the quarter ended Jan. 29. Those numbers compare with $609
million, or 17 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales were $4.35 billion, up 53 percent from the year-ago quarter.

<HEADLINE> Goodyear Earnings Drop in 4th Q  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- The Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. said Wednesday its
earnings fell sharply in the fourth quarter, but they still beat Wall Street
estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income was $40.8 million, or 26 cents a share, in the October-December
period, compared with $121.5 million, or 78 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding special items, such as restructuring charges, earnings were $47.6
million, or 30 cents a share, in the fourth quarter compared with $115 million,
or 74 cents a share, a year earlier. That beat the 28 cents expected by analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the period totaled $3.55 billion, up 11 percent from $3.2 billion
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Goodyear's shares rose 68 3/4 cents to $22.75, or about 3 percent, in
trading Wednesday at 4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Goodyear reduced its work force by 5,800 last year, but still employs more
than 105,000 people in its 90 facilities worldwide. It also agreed last year to
an alliance with Japan's Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd., which gave Goodyear
control of Dunlop tire operations in North America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Samir Gibara, the company's chairman, chief executive and president, call
the 1999 earnings report disappointing but added: "Goodyear has laid the
groundwork for significant improvement in 2000 and into the future."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the company aimed to sell 20 percent more tires this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income for all of 1999 was $241.1 million, or $1.52 a share, compared
with $682.3 million, or $4.31 a share, in 1998.

<P>
	   Revenues totaled $12.88 billion, up 2 percent from $12.63 billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Allstate Profits Fall 18 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Allstate Corp.'s fourth-quarter operating profits fell 18
percent, even excluding large charges for restructuring and acquisitions, as
higher auto claims and stiffer competition continued to hammer the troubled
insurer.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's earnings report still exceeded analysts' lowered expectations,
but Allstate's stock quickly fell to a new 52-week low. The company's shares
fell $2.06 1/4, or more than 9 percent, to $19.93 3/4 in trading at 4:30 p.m. on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The Northbrook, Ill.-based company said October-December operating earnings,
excluding one-time charges, were $524 million, or 66 cents a share, down from
$641 million, or 78 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had forecast earnings of
64 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income for the quarter, including the special charges, was $425 million,
or 54 cents a share, compared with $760 million, or 93 cents a share, a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues were $7.01 billion in the quarter, up 8.6 percent from $6.45
billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Allstate is the second-biggest U.S. company in personal-lines insurance --
automobile, home and life insurance -- behind privately-held State Farm.
</P>
<P>
	   "Things are tough at Allstate right now," said Steve Musser, an analyst for
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. "There's a lot of uncertainty."
</P>
<P>
	   Musser said the unexpected departure of top executive Bruce Marlow was a big
blow to Allstate. Marlow on Tuesday was named president and chief executive at
21st Century Insurance Group in Woodland Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   At Allstate, Marlow was president of Allstate's Independent Agency Markets,
a division that handles the insurer's independent agents. He led efforts at the
company to use the Internet in transactions with independent brokers and "was
seen as a tremendous leader" in building that business, Musser said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reacting to Marlow's departure, Salomon Smith Barney cut its investment
rating for Allstate to "neutral" from "buy," Dow Jones News reported.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, operating earnings excluding items were $2.19 billion, or
$2.73 a share, compared with $2.57 billion, or $3.08 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income was $2.72 billion in 1999, compared with $3.29 billion in 1998.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Form New Privacy Groups  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate lawmakers, grappling with complex
privacy issues, are forming groups to discuss possible new legislation and
policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., announced Wednesday the
formation of a Senate Democratic Privacy Task Force, while Sen. Richard Shelby,
R-Ala., disclosed the creation of a bipartisan Congressional Privacy Caucus of
senators and House members.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The issue of privacy touches virtually every American, often in extremely
personal ways,'' Daschle said in a statement. ``Whether it is bank records or
medical files or Internet activities, Americans have a right to expect that
personal matters will be kept private.''
</P>
<P>
	   Because laws have not kept pace with sweeping technological changes, Daschle
added, Americans' right to privacy is at risk. ``Some of our most sensitive,
private (data) end up on databases that are then sold to the highest bidder,''
he said. ``That is wrong, it's dangerous and it has to stop.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pollsters have found that privacy now is one of the highest priorities for
Americans, who have expressed concern about threats to their privacy involving
financial data, health records and employment records, Daschle noted.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress enacted in November sweeping legislation removing Depression-era
barriers and allowing banks, securities firms and insurance companies to get
into each other's businesses. It included, for the first time, provisions giving
consumers the right to block financial companies from providing their personal
data to outside firms, such as telemarketers. However, the companies will be
able to share customers' data with affiliated financial companies under the same
corporate roof.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, lawmakers may consider legislation regarding medical privacy and
other areas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate Democratic task force will be headed by Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., the Senate Judiciary Committee's senior Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Democratic senators have expressed interest in joining the group, Leahy
spokesman David Carle said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby, a conservative, and Rep. Edward Markey of Massachusetts, a liberal
Democrat, bitterly opposed the financial overhaul legislation last year on
grounds its privacy protections were inadequate.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby and Markey will be co-chairmen of the new privacy caucus, along with
Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., and Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I remain convinced that the American people do not want financial
(companies) to collect, profile, buy and sell consumers' ... personal financial
information at will,'' Shelby said. ``Families ... do not want complete
strangers buying and selling their personal profile like currency.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some two dozen single-issue caucuses now exist on Capitol Hill, including
the Congressional Black Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus, and caucuses on women's
issues, human rights, Social Security, seniors, rural health, AIDS and the
Internet.

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Rebels End War vs. Turkey  </HEADLINE>
   By HARMONIE TOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Abdullah Ocalan's rebel group announced Wednesday
it will end its 15-year guerrilla insurrection against Turkey and instead pursue
a political struggle for Kurdish rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey has rejected previous overtures from the rebels of the Kurdistan
Workers Party or PKK as insincere and is unlikely to welcome the move. Turkish
Interior Minister Sadettin Tantan refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There will be no reaction from authorities,'' predicted Ali Nihat Ozcan of
the Eurasia Strategic Research Institute. ``Turkish authorities are determined
not to do anything until the PKK lays down its arms.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Wednesday, the PKK said it would continue its battle for
Kurdish rights within the ``framework of peace and democratization.''
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement is part of the group's attempt to transform itself from a
guerrilla force into a political organization after major defeats on the
battlefield and Ocalan's death sentence last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels said the PKK's armed wing would be reorganized, but phasing it
out would depend on the ``democratic transformation of Turkey and the resolution
of the Kurdish question.'' Peace is also ``inseparably'' linked to Ocalan's
fate.
</P>
<P>
	   Osman Ocalan, a top PKK commander and brother of the detained leader, said
the rebels would not lay down arms or surrender because Turkey had not responded
to the PKK's previous peace overtures.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They will stay up in the mountains, not to attack, but to defend
themselves,'' he said in an interview with Brussels-based Kurdish Medya-TV.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear, however, if all of the guerrillas would listen to the
central leadership. There have been some reports of dissent among rebel
commanders to the PKK's unilateral overtures toward Turkey.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdullah Ocalan was sentenced to death for treason and separatism in June.
Turkey has decided to wait for the European Court of Human Rights to rule on his
appeal before it decides whether to hang him.
</P>
<P>
	   Previous peace overtures by the rebels have been welcomed in Europe and
several analysts note that the latest moves by the PKK may be intended to
increase European pressure on Turkey, now that Ankara has been accepted as a
candidate to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey says that Ocalan's estimated 4,500 guerrillas must surrender without
preconditions. Ocalan, who announced a cease-fire and withdrawal from Turkey in
August, wants Turkey to grant amnesty to all PKK rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   The PKK had originally been expected to make its announcement at Parliament
in Rome on Wednesday morning, but canceled its press conference at the last
minute without an explanation.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 37,000 people -- mostly Kurds -- have been killed as a result of
fighting in the southeast.

<HEADLINE> Marriage Penalty Legislation Glance  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A comparison of House Republican and Democratic legislation intended to ease
the ``marriage penalty'' in which many married couples pay more income taxes
than if they were single.
Republican
Total cost: $182.3 billion over 10 years
</P>
<P>
	   --Adjusts upward for married couples the bottom 15 percent income tax
bracket to make it double that of single filers by 2008. If it had been in place
this year, couples would have paid a 15 percent rate on their first $52,500 of
taxable income, compared to $43,850 in current law.
</P>
<P>
	   --Raises the standard income tax deduction for married couples who do not
itemize to twice that of single filers beginning in 2001. Using this year's
numbers, the deduction would rise from $7,351 to $8,800.
</P>
<P>
	   --Raises the income cutoff for lower-income couples who claim the earned
income tax credit by $2,000 beginning in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	    Democratic
Total cost: $89 billion over 10 years
</P>
<P>
	   --All items subject to congressional passage of separate legislation setting
``framework'' for ensuring future solvency of Social Security and Medicare and
payment of publicly held debt.
</P>
<P>
	   --Standard income tax deduction for married couples who do not itemize
raised to double that of single filers. Adjusts alternative minimum tax so that
it will not erode the full impact of raising the standard deduction for some
couples.

	   --Raises the income cutoff for lower-income couples who claim the earned
income tax credit by $2,000 in 2001 and $2,500 in 2002.

<HEADLINE> NASA: Launch Looks Good for Friday  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCIA DUNN AP Aerospace Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- For the first time in days, NASA had good news
on the space shuttle front: Endeavour is free of problems heading into Friday's
launch attempt and the weather looks good.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm encouraged -- the sun is shining,'' shuttle program manager Ron
Dittemore said Wednesday. ``It looks like it's clear skies and, hopefully, if
the weather is good to us, we'll have a good launch.''
</P>
<P>
	   With high wind the only concern and a small one at that, Endeavour is
scheduled to blast off at 12:30 p.m. Friday on an Earth-mapping mission that has
been delayed five months by damaged wiring and other shuttle trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   On the 11-day flight -- originally planned for September -- astronauts will
use radar to scan the Earth's terrain and create the finest 3-D map ever of the
world.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week's launch attempt, for instance, was thwarted by a last-minute
problem with a computerized unit that's needed to ignite the two solid rocket
boosters at liftoff and to separate them from the shuttle two minutes into the
flight. The faulty master events controller has since been replaced with a spare
that works just fine.
</P>
<P>
	   NASA has had to replace a few other components aboard Endeavour, namely a
cable and a navigation-satellite receiver. Although scuff marks were found on a
cable in the left booster, the damage turned out to be superficial and no
repairs were needed.
</P>
<P>
	   During the past week, shuttle managers also made progress in their
investigation into engine pump seals.
</P>
<P>
	   A seal that should have been thrown away as a factory reject somehow ended
up flying aboard Discovery in December. NASA was able to verify the quality of
all but two of the 18 metal seals in Endeavour's engine fuel pumps, but decided
to proceed with a Jan. 31 launch attempt anyway given the unlikelihood of
another defective seal turning up.
</P>
<P>
	   Engineers have since found the paperwork exonerating one of those two
remaining seals, and no more defective parts have popped up although the search
continues, Dittemore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of all the repairs and the extra attention to shuttle wiring in
recent months, Endeavour is in ``tiptop shape,'' Dittemore said.
</P>
<P>
	   NASA grounded the shuttle fleet after an exposed wire caused a short circuit
during Columbia's launch in July. Damaged wiring was found in all four shuttles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've had a reawakening of everybody's sensitivity to safety,'' Dittemore
said. ``There's a heightened awareness of what we're doing, and our vehicles are
much safer to fly.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Set To Nominate FEC Vacancy  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE RIZZO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Wednesday he will nominate law
professor Bradley A. Smith to fill a vacancy on the Federal Election Commission,
ending a stalemate with Republican leaders but possibly setting up a contentious
Senate confirmation.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith has been a harsh critic of campaign funding laws, saying they have
failed to rid the system of corrupting influences while infringing on
constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression. He favors no limits on how
much candidates can raise and spend.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, who teaches at Capital University Law School in Columbus, Ohio, was
recruited for the FEC post by Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a vigorous foe of the
campaign finance reform bills under consideration in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   McConnell said Smith's legal background and credentials may make him ``the
most qualified person we've ever put on the FEC.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Scott Harshbarger, president of the government watchdog organization
Common Cause, called Smith's nomination ``a slap in the face to any effort at
responsible reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people of this country are making it clear they want more, not less
efforts to limit the impact of money in politics,'' he said. ``Any senator who
supports this nomination cannot claim to support campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   The FEC enforces federal campaign finance law, making sure candidates comply
with disclosure requirements and contribution limits. The six-member commission
is evenly split among Republicans and Democrats, each of whom serve six-year
terms.
</P>
<P>
	   By tradition, the Senate's Democratic leadership recommends the three
Democrats and the GOP leadership recommends the three Republicans. In almost
every instance, whoever has occupied the White House has deferred to those
wishes.
</P>
<P>
	   But Smith's writings on election law gave his critics considerable fodder
with which to oppose him. Common Cause and other groups organized a campaign
last summer against Smith, and Clinton held off on the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Frustrated by the failure to get quick action on what normally is a routine
nomination, McConnell and Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., delayed
confirmation of Richard Holbrooke as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House made no mention of that background in its announcement.
Clinton also will re-nominate Commissioner Danny Lee McDonald, who has served on
the FEC since 1982.

<HEADLINE> Electric choice a dim bulb in N.J.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey's electric choice law is a year old, but
only a handful of residents have taken advantage of it.
<P>
	   Although electric rates will decrease by 5 percent a year over three years,
electric competition has yet to energize consumers. The cutthroat competition
typical of long-distance telephone companies has yet to materialize in the New
Jersey power market.
</P>
<P>
	   "So far, electric competition has been a power failure," said John Paul
Guinan, energy advocate for the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
	   Guinan said that of 3.4 million residential electricity customers in New
Jersey, only 14,061, or less than 1 percent, have switched to a new provider
since they were able to do so in October. By comparison, more than 90,000
Pennsylvania residents switched power companies in the first three months of
that state's hotly contested energy choice program.
</P>
<P>
	   But a Whitman spokesman said the program can't be measured solely on the
basis of how many customers switch suppliers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Their analysis is laughable," said spokesman Pete McDonough. "Fundamental
to their analysis is the number of people who switched. This isn't necessarily
about switching; it's about customer satisfaction. If I'm with PSE&AMP;G and they
give me a better rate and I stick with them, to PIRG, that's a failure."
</P>
<P>
	   The advocacy group released an analysis Wednesday of the first year of
energy choice in New Jersey, saying the program has failed in each of its stated
goals: improving quality and choice; protecting consumers; increasing instate
competition among providers, and protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
	   Guinan attributed the low rate to the difficulty of switching, consumer
confusion over the issue, and a lack of choices.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the unintended result of throwing utility markets open to all comers
has been a move toward cheaper out-of-state providers who rely on
pollution-causing coal-fired generating plants in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
	   "Governor Whitman's version of competition welcomes dirty power, shuns clean
power and leaves New Jersey residents out in the cold," Guinan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Guinan said the state's marketing of electricity choice "constantly has
focused on price, price, price," he said. "You're going to drive people out of
state to dirty power suppliers." But he could not estimate what percentage of
New Jersey's electricity is generated by such Midwestern plants.
</P>
<P>
	   McDonough said signing the energy choice bill into law last February was
only the first step. The state then spent six months educating the public about
the program, including television commercials in which Whitman plays a hockey
goalie.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will continue to take time for people to be educated about it and
understand they can switch if they choose," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In an example of how complicated the deregulation process has become,
customers of Public Service Electric and Gas Co., the state's largest power
company, were supposed to see a state-mandated 2 percent rate reduction this
month, resulting from a breakup of its electric monopoly.
</P>
<P>
	   But that cut has been placed on hold by a lawsuit filed by a group
representing large businesses, and joined by New Jersey's Ratepayer Advocate,
seeking bigger discounts. The 2 percent would have been in addition to a 5
percent reduction the company gave its customers last August, and would have
lowered the average residential bill by about $5.40 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit is not scheduled to be heard by an appeals court until early
March.

<HEADLINE> 21 Sterling Foster Brokers Charged  </HEADLINE>
    By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Prosecutors brought criminal charges Wednesday against 21
former managers and brokers at Sterling Foster &AMP; Co., a defunct Long Island
company that specialized in small-company stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   The charges against the employees of the firm, headquartered in Melville
from 1994 to 1997, alleged that they tricked investors into buying certain
stocks so they could artificially inflate their prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said they used heavy pressure as well as false and misleading
sales pitches to convince customers that the stocks would rise rapidly in value,
producing more than $200 million in illegal profits for employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The charges stemmed from six public offerings, five of which were
underwritten by Sterling Foster. The defendants were each charged with
conspiracy to commit securities fraud, mail and wire fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   An indictment filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan alleged that the
brokers promoted the stocks without disclosing to customers that they were
receiving excessive undisclosed compensation as high as 15 percent of the price
of the stock to pitch the securities.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said the defendants were part of so-called
boiler rooms where "corrupt brokers prey on the unsuspecting public."
</P>
<P>
	   In a release, she said the boiler rooms where brokers try to heat up the
value of a stock through deceit "are particularly dangerous because they serve
as a boot camp to train the next generation of boiler-room operators."
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutor noted that many of the 21 defendants held management or
supervisory positions at the Sterling Foster company.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI Assistant Director Lewis D. Schiliro said the case sends "a clear
message to others who would prey on unsuspecting good-faith investors."
</P>
<P>
	   "While the current period of unparalleled prosperity provides a window of
opportunity for investors big and small, it should not be looked at as a window
of opportunity for unscrupulous boiler-room operators using high-pressure sales
tactics to pump-and-dump worthless securities," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors earlier had brought charges against the company and several
others, including Randolph Pace, who allegedly secretly controlled the company,
and Alan Novich, an attorney and former dentist alleged to be an accomplice.
Both are awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Six other defendants had pleaded guilty to charges arising out of 11
allegedly fraudulent public offerings involving Sterling Foster. Those
defendants have forfeited or agreed to give up about $32 million in illegal
gains, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides the criminal charges Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange
Commission also brought civil securities fraud charges against 18 defendants.
</P>
<P>
	   Schiliro said the indictment Wednesday resulted from a focus on managers and
supervisors at Sterling Foster.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will set our sights on not just the headliners, but also the supporting
casts of these productions," Schiliro said.
</P>
<P>
	   About half of those charged were arrested Wednesday and were freed after an
initial court appearance. Prosecutors expect the remainder to be arrested and
appear in court later this week.

<HEADLINE> Senate To Consider Russian Treaty  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House will ask senators to quickly ratify a
treaty with Russia that defines law enforcement cooperation between the two
countries, Clinton administration officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The treaty would make it easier for U.S. law enforcement officials to track
suspected Russian terrorists, drug criminals, financial scam artists and others
preying on Americans or U.S. business interests, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, signed in June, will be sent to the
Senate on Thursday. The same treaty will be sent to the Russian Duma for
ratification within a few months, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The treaty would replace an interim agreement that does much the same thing,
and is not expected to be controversial.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This will give us a lot of flexibility to obtain testimony, and statements
from people ... and for both sides to get records or serve documents,'' an
administration official said. It also sets out rules for finding and seizing
suspected criminal assets.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising drug offenses, gangs, money-laundering, extortion and other
crime-related activity in Russia is affecting foreigners doing business there
and has become an irritant in U.S.-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
	   In September, Clinton warned that corruption and money-laundering could
``eat the heart out'' of Russian society unless the government there gets
serious about cracking down.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has signed 48 such treaties with other governments, and 31
have been ratified. Ukraine is the only other former Soviet government to sign a
similar agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The legal agreements are often signed alongside extradition treaties. The
United States has no extradition treaty with Russia, and none is contemplated
now, said an administration official speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEADLINE> Railroads Raising Freight Prices  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID KOENIG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- Encouraged by the strong economy and facing higher fuel and
labor costs, the nation's freight railroads are raising certain rates more
aggressively than in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   Fort Worth, Texas-based Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. is notifying
shippers it will raise rates for some customers as much as 4 percent in the
railroad's first broad price hike since 1995. Norfolk Southern Corp., based in
Norfolk, Va., recently announced an identical increase for customers shipping
scrap metal, paper, lumber and container freight.
</P>
<P>
	   Top officials of Omaha, Neb.-based Union Pacific Corp. and Richmond,
Va.-based CSX Corp. have also signaled they intend to raise rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The railroads blame higher labor costs and the rising price of diesel, which
has doubled from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts, who have been looking for signs of higher prices to boost
profits, are underwhelmed by the announcements, however.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's selective and I'd say it affects less than a quarter of the business,"
said James Valentine, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
	   Valentine's skepticism is due to the fact that the increase won't apply to
the roughly 60 percent of rail customers who have long-term contracts with the
railroads. Other customers, such as farmers and automakers, can't afford to pay
more or will shift to truck shipments, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Adam Hollingsworth, a CSX spokesman, said his company's increases -- he
declined to say how much CSX will raise rates -- are also due to stronger market
conditions, including a shortage of rail capacity, price increases averaging
about 5 percent imposed by trucking companies, and the shortage of truck
drivers, which limits trucking capacity.
</P>
<P>
	   Burlington Northern spokesman Jim Sabourin said the increases, scheduled to
be completed during the first three months of the year, are the first since
Burlington Northern merged with Santa Fe Pacific in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   The price hikes are receiving predictably bad marks from shippers. Mike
Heimowitz, a spokesman for the Chemical Manufacturers Association, said rail
service in the East is still recovering from the breakup of Conrail Inc., which
was carved up last year by CSX and Norfolk Southern.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're having a lot of service problems, and here they are giving us a rate
hike. It's not really the most pleasant thing," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jill Evans, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, said rather than improving service,
railroads in recent years resorted almost entirely to cost-cutting to bolster
their bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
	   "Rail service has improved, they have a very good on-time record in
intermodal," she said, referring to containers that can be loaded from trains on
to trucks. "They've also improved in shipping commodities, such as forestry
products, because of more-direct routes as a result of mergers."
</P>
<P>
	   Railroads' on-time record, however, still lags far behind truckers. Analysts
say Burlington Northern's on-time record is around 90 percent, but the industry
as a whole rates about 75 percent, while the trucking industry is well above 90
percent. Valentine called timeliness "the Achilles heel" for raising railroads'
profitability.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said they doubted the rail freight price increases would affect
consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's relatively small in the scheme of the economy," Evans said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Down; Dow Off 258.44  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks tumbled Wednesday amid worries about
rising interest rates, while a rash of attacks on leading Web sites deflated the
high-flying technology sector.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 258.44 to close at 10,699.16.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell
30.01 to 1,411.71, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 64.26 to 4,363.24.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow's losses were broad-based, with American Express, Citigroup and Home
Depot all dropping on concerns that the Federal Reserve will continue raising
interest rates this year, potentially threatening corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
	   American Express fell 6 7/16 to 156 9/16, Citigroup fell 1 13/16 to 54 3/16
and Home Depot fell 1 15/16 to 59 1/16.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors in these stocks are anticipating that the Fed will eventually be
successful in forcing a slowdown in the economy," said Ned Riley, chief
investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed has raised short-term interest rates four times since June 1999 in
an effort to slow the economy enough to keep inflation under control. Since the
last increase, announced a week ago, investors have been shying away from
blue-chip companies, fearful that their profits will be the first to suffer if
interest rates continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're waiting to find out just how far the Fed will go," said Eugene G.
Mintz, financial markets analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
"They've already committed a lot of money to this market and they're a little
nervous."
</P>
<P>
	   Riley said technology shares held up a bit better because investors believe
they are growing quickly enough to withstand the crunch of higher rates.
</P>
<P>
	   "The economy is dictating that interest rates will go up," Riley said.
"That's limiting the leadership of the market to the companies that have very
rapid earnings growth."
</P>
<P>
	   One of those companies was Cisco Systems, which rose 3 to 128 13/16. The
company said late Tuesday that profits in its fiscal second quarter topped
analysts' expectations. Cisco also announced a 2-for-1 stock split, to take
effect March 22. The company has been one of the Nasdaq's strongest performers
in recent months as demand has soared for its computer networking equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   But Cisco alone couldn't lift the technology-dominated Nasdaq, which saw
many Internet stocks rattled by a spate of Web site attacks by computer hackers.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of ETrade were down 1 1/8 at 21 7/8 amid news the online broker had
become the latest high-profile victim of Internet vandalism. Amazon.com and eBay
slipped a day after Internet vandals hacked into their Web sites, disrupting
access for consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   Amazon.com fell 2 7/8 to 80 1/4 and eBay lost 5 3/4 to 164.
</P>
<P>
	   Buy.com, which succumbed to the attack Tuesday as its shares traded publicly
for the first time, rose 2 3/8 to 27 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, Microsoft dropped 5 15/16 to 104 on the news that European
Union regulators have opened an examination into Microsoft's new Windows 2000
operating system, which will be officially launched Feb. 17. Mirroring antitrust
concerns in the United States, several competitors have complained that Windows
2000 would give Microsoft a dominant position in the software market, EU
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dow component Merck fell 4 1/16 to 71 3/8 after the Wall Street Journal
reported that five of the company's drugs will lose U.S. patent protection
within two years, threatening profits and revenue.

<HEADLINE> Tax cuts, spending increases in Rowland's revised budget proposal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Gov. John G. Rowland trumpeted the state's
resurgent economy in his annual budget address Wednesday, proposing $237 million
in tax cuts and credits along with plans for major governmental reform.
<P>
	   In his budget address to the General Assembly, Rowland said he wants to cut
7 cents off the gasoline tax. He also proposed giving a maximum $500 tax credit
for middle- and low-income families who send their children to private primary
and secondary schools, and offered new tax breaks for college students and
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
	   "In this booming economy, wages are higher and taxes are lower," Rowland
said during his 36-minute address. "Still, with all the great success we've had
over the last five years, there is always the challenge to improve."
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland also pushed for a package of reforms that would abolish the office
of high sheriff, restructure campaign financing and retool the office state
treasurer's office.
</P>
<P>
	   "My goal, and I believe your goal, is to continue to provide Connecticut
with a responsive, yet responsible, government," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the Legislature passed a balanced $23.7 billion biennial budget in
June that included a $11.6 billion spending plan for the 1999-2000 fiscal year,
Rowland said he wants to increase spending to about $12 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   State budget director Marc Ryan said the adjustments must be made because of
$162 million in cost overruns in the Department of Correction, Medicaid and the
state's ConnPACE prescription drug program.
</P>
<P>
	   The increased spending plan would burst a constitutional spending cap. But
the governor proposes using money from an estimated $241 million surplus in tax
revenues. About $60 million needed would come from money already in the state's
special transportation fund.
</P>
<P>
	   While Rowland insisted during his budget address he is abiding by the
spending cap, he signed a declaration Wednesday asking the Legislature to
override it.
</P>
<P>
	   "If there are large surpluses and they are going to be spent to avoid debt
or for one-time expenditures, those are wise investments," said House Minority
leader Robert Ward, R-North Branford.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor also wants to cut $111 million from next year's budget in order
to keep the state about $84 million under the cap during the 2000-2001 fiscal
year, Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Those cuts include dropping adults from the state's HUSKY health care plan -
a program that Ryan said is too costly and could save the state about $32
million. The program was originally designed to provide health care for
uninsured children in the state, but was expanded to include their parents.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Edith Prague called the HUSKY cut unfair.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a commitment we made," said Prague, D-Columbia. "To take it out of
the budget is a disaster. We can't leave people out there without any health
coverage."
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland said the state could save another $27 million by changing the way it
administers its prescription drugs assistance program. The changes would include
mandating that recipients use generic drugs when they are available.
</P>
<P>
	   Key Democrats immediately pounced on Rowland's plan to break the spending
cap this year, and promised to stall his gas tax proposal. They also predicted
his private school tax break would fail.
</P>
<P>
	   "We already have a balanced budget," said Senate Majority Leader George
Jepsen, D-Stamford. "There's no need to do anything with the budget."
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland's gas tax cut, which he wants on the books by April 1, would cost
the state an estimated $99 million in revenue. Ryan said that money could be
covered by with funds from the special transportation fund and the Department of
Motor Vehicles sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we are going to support that, it should be predicated on the fact that
the price of gas will come down if we pass the tax," said Sen. Martin Looney,
D-New Haven, co-chariman of the tax-writing Finance Committee. "There is no real
guarantee."
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland also revived the school choice debate. His plan for a private
education credit would be based on a sliding scale and limited to families that
meet certain income limits. He also wants to give college students state tax
cuts based on their eligibility for federal programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The college tax cut plan drew praise from many Democrats. But they
criticized the private education credit, arguing it would take money away from
public schools.
</P>
<P>
	   While Jepsen and Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin Sullivan, D-West
Hartford, said they do not want to reopen the budget, many key Democrats have
said they agree with Rowland's plan to spend the state's $241 million surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland said he wants the surplus to pay for school construction, bail out
the financially struggling University of Connecticut Health Center and upgrade
the government's computer system.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland also said $33.4 million should be funneled into the state's
emergency Rainy Day Fund, and $17.5 million should be used for a hospital tax
cut.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland proposed sinking $90 million into school construction, $30 million
into improved Internet access in schools, and $7.5 million into updating the
state's computer systems. He also wants to use $3.5 million to move the
Department of Information and Technology into new offices.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats support many of the ideas, but criticized the governor for not
including funding for open space purchases, housing programs and transportation
improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   His reform proposals received a mix reaction. Democrats have also called for
transferring the duties of the sheriffs system to state agencies, and that is
expected to pass. But reforming the treasurer's office is expected to be a
controversial issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Since ex-Treasurer Paul Silvester pleaded guilty to racketeering and money
laundering charges in connection with his handling of state pension investments,
Rowland and leading Republicans have called for a Board of Trustees to oversee
state investments.
</P>
<P>
	   Leading Democrats have said they want that job to remain in the hands of the
treasurer.

<HEADLINE> Report: Fatal police shooting justified  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - A North Branford police officer was justified in
killing a motorist because he reasonably believed he needed to defend himself, a
report into the shooting found Wednesday.
<P>
	   New Haven State's Attorney Michael Dearington said no charges would be filed
against Officer Michael Breen in the July 13 shooting death of Victoria Cooper
of West Haven.
</P>
<P>
	   "Officer Breen, through no fault of his own, was confronted with a motor
vehicle weighing over 3,000 pounds bearing down on him, and the operator did not
heed his efforts to stop or slow down," the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cooper's family maintains the shooting was not justified. They have filed a
civil rights lawsuit against Breen in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no reason that this shooting by this police officer was justified
or necessary," said David Rosen, an attorney for the family. "There is no reason
for this young woman to be dead."
</P>
<P>
	   The report states Cooper's intent cannot be determined, but that cocaine in
her system may have affected her behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   North Branford Police Chief Matthew Canelli said he had expected the
investigation to find the shooting was justified. Breen was put been back on
regular patrol months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "Officer Breen had no intentions when he went out that evening that he was
going to take a life, but what happened happened. Ms. Cooper had to be
responsible for her actions also that evening," Canelli said.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation found that Cooper, 41, and her friend, Steven Guerette,
42, had smoked crack cocaine about an hour before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   They had driven in Guerette's brother's Camaro to a convenience store on
Route 80 at about 1 a.m. and Guerette was using the pay telephone when Breen
spotted them.
</P>
<P>
	   Breen stated he passed by the car three times and noticed its occupants were
watching him. He called in the license plate and found it was registered to
Guerette's brother, whose license had been suspended.
</P>
<P>
	   The car then drove down Route 80 and Breen followed. The car crossed the
center line three times, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Breen pulled Guerette over and asked him to step out of the car. A search
found Guerette was carrying two bags containing a substance that resembled
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   Guerette then fled into the woods. Breen chased him, but lost him and
returned to his cruiser.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that as he returned he saw the Camaro move toward him with its
headlights on. Breen said he yelled and waved his arms several times, but the
car did not stop, so he fired two shots.
</P>
<P>
	   A state police reconstruction of the shooting found Breen was in front of
and slightly to the right of the car, near the middle of the road, when he fired
the first shot. The bullet hit the car's hood and ricocheted.
</P>
<P>
	   Breen said he moved to avoid being hit as he fired a second shot. The bullet
went through the driver's side window at a 65-degree angle and hit Cooper in the
left side, exiting through her right chest.
</P>
<P>
	   Residue from the cartridge was found on the driver's side door, indicating
the car was very close to Breen.
</P>
<P>
	   Inside the car, police found more cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   The report stated Guerette had a history of fleeing police to prevent the
seizure of narcotics. He had fled from Madison police in 1986, injuring a police
officer, and in 1990 told a female driver to flee after police asked him to step
out of the car.
</P>
<P>
	   A week before the shooting, Guerette was involved in a police chase in which
Cooper was a passenger. He crashed the car and fled into the woods, where he was
captured.
</P>
<P>
	   Guerette is serving a one-year prison sentence for interfering with an
officer and drug possession.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall Sharply  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Long-term government bond prices fell sharply Wednesday
after Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers suggested the government would reduce
the sale of all bonds, not just longer maturities, to help cut the national
debt.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year bond fell 1 3/16 points, or $11.87 1/2 per $1,000
in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of price, rose
to 6.32 percent from 6.23 percent late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond prices have been extremely volatile since the federal government
recently announced plans to pay down the national debt by reducing the amount of
bonds in circulation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I expect Treasury to continue to use the entirety of the yield curve as a
way of holding down our borrowing costs," Summers said after a congressional
hearing. The yield curve is a graphic representation of yields on Treasury
bills, notes and bonds and traders took the comments to mean Treasury buybacks
of government securities won't be limited to just long-term bonds.
</P>
<P>
	   Longer-term bond prices had soared earlier on the prospect of a reduced
supply. On Wednesday, however, gains centered on shorter maturities.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices of short-term Treasury securities rose 1/32 Tuesday, while
intermediate maturities rose  1/8 point or dropped 5/32 point, according to the
Bridge Telerate news service.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading Tuesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.68
percent, with the discount falling 0.02 percentage point from Tuesday to 5.52
percent. Six-month yields were 5.97 percent as the discount fell 0.03 percentage
point from Tuesday to 5.71 percent. One-year yields finished at 6.16 percent,
with the discount falling 0.02 percentage point to 5.81 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, rose
to 5.75 percent from Tuesday's 5.63 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds fell 1/32 point to 92. The yield was
6.25 percent, unchanged from late Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> NRC allows more discussion of spent-fuel pool expansion at  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Anti-nuclear groups on Wednesday won the right
to challenge a plan for the storage of nuclear waste at the Millstone Three
nuclear power plant.
<P>
	   The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board ordered a full hearing into the
groups' criticisms of plans to expand the capacity of the spent fuel pool at the
Waterford plant.
</P>
<P>
	   Specifically, the hearing will explore whether the fuel storage plan poses
an unnecessary risk to workers and the public and if it increases the chance of
a nuclear accident.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing is not likely until May at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
	   Northeast Utilities, the plant's chief owner and operator, said the fuel
storage plan is safe and proven to work.
</P>
<P>
	   "The same system is already in use at many other utilities. It has a proven
track record. We've proven it's safe," said Millstone spokeswoman Sandra
Bazinet.
</P>
<P>
	   But Nancy Burton, the lawyer for the Connecticut and Long Island Coalition
Against Millstone groups, says the hearing will expose problems with the storage
plan that will end up shutting down the plant.
</P>
<P>
	   The plant will have to shut down if it runs out of space to store its fuel,
and the storage problem will make the plant unattractive to potential buyers,
Burton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bazinet denied the plan will impact the sale of the plant, and said it will
be able to run for years before a new fuel plan is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   NU needs to increase storage space because the federal government has not
yet approved a permanent site to store spent fuel from Millstone and other
nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
	   The company maintains the spent fuel pool is designed to hold much more fuel
than its license allows, so it is asking to increase the number of fuel rods
placed in the pool.
</P>
<P>
	   The system looks like a 40-foot-deep, L-shaped swimming pool. The fuel rods
are stored in bundles called assemblies, which are held on racks submerged at
the bottom of the pool.
</P>
<P>
	   Water laced with boron is circulated around the pool to keep the fuel cool
and prevent a nuclear reaction.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, the Millstone 3 pool has about 450 assemblies. The plant is
licensed to store up to 756 assemblies, and NU wants to store up to 1,800.
</P>
<P>
	   Anti-nuclear groups say it would be safer to store the fuel in secure
concrete vaults, since the water storage system could fail if pumps broke or
water leaks out.

<HEADLINE> Officer recounts his role as witness in Louima case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Lawyers replayed the sequence of events on Wednesday
that led police officer Eric Turetzky to break the so-called "blue wall of
silence" by telling superiors what he saw the night Abner Louima was tortured in
a Brooklyn station house lavatory.
<P>
	   Turetzky, a patrolman at the time, helped arrest the Haitian immigant during
a street riot and later saw Officer Charles Schwarz lead the handcuffed prisoner
toward the bathroom where he was subsequently sodomized with a broom handle by
Justin Volpe, an officer who mistakenly thought Louima had hit him during the
melee.
</P>
<P>
	   Testifying as a prosecution witness in Brooklyn federal court, Turetzky said
he didn't see Schwarz enter the bathroom, but did see Volpe a short time later,
prodding Louima, pants down and still handcuffed, into a holding cell.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Volpe had a broken wooden stick in his other hand, "holding it like
you'd hold a sword."
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe is serving 30 years for violating Louima's civil rights. Schwarz, 34,
who is appealing his conviction in that case; Officer Thomas Wiese, 37, his
former partner; and Volpe's ex-partner, Officer Thomas Bruder, 37, are now on
trial for conspiring to obstruct justice by concealing Schwarz's role in the
Aug. 9, 1997, assault.
</P>
<P>
	   Louima testified earlier that the driver of the patrol car who took him to
the station - that being Schwarz - held him down in the bathroom while Volpe
rammed the broomstick into his rectum and then his mouth. Schwarz denies ever
being in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz's defense lawyer, Ronald Fischetti played a tape of Turetzky's
interview with police Internal Affairs Bureau investigators six days after the
incident, in which he said he saw Schwarz take a defendant into the bathroom,
but did not see which officer brought him out.
</P>
<P>
	   That differed sharply from his verbal account on Wednesday, that he did not
see Schwarz actually approach the bathroom with the prisoner. In reply to a
question, he called the IAB interview reference to Schwarz "a poor choice of
words on my part."
</P>
<P>
	   Turetzky, whose decision to go to the authorities provided a key break in
the case, said he acted despite pressure from fellow officers and delegates of
the police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, to keep silent.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, he told the IAB probers he had trouble sleeping and
"butterflies in my stomach" over what to do with the information.
</P>
<P>
	   As rumors of a "sexual assault" at the station house spread, Turetzky
testified, he visited the office of the precinct's new commander, and was later
confronted by Officer Timothy Lee, a PBA delegate.
</P>
<P>
	   "He said to me, 'What are you doing in there?' I said, 'you know what I'm
doing.' He said, 'why?"'
</P>
<P>
	   In the IAB interview, he said Volpe's police officer brother Damian, also a
PBA delegate, urged him to "stick together" with other cops over the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   Turetzky was transferred from the 70th precinct to the IAB after the Louima
incident and was later promoted to detective.
</P>
<P>
	   Turetzky said on Wednesday he saw no improper behavior by Schwarz and Wiese
at the riot scene or at the station house, where the two officers searched and
booked Louima and another Haitian man arrested at the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   After putting Louima in the cell, he said, Volpe whacked the stick against
walls and garbage cans in the station house. "He looked pissed off, angry,"
Turetzky said. "Officer Volpe was usually the center of attention, usually
joining in. Not that night."

<HEADLINE> Lazio says he's weighing Conservative Party invitation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Comparing himself to come-from-behind GOP presidential
hopeful John McCain, Rep. Rick Lazio said Wednesday he is seriously considering
the New York Conservative Party's invitation to enter the U.S. Senate race.
<P>
	   But the Long Island Republican said he would only do so if he ran on the
Republican line as well - and he added he has still not ruled out challenging
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would only be a candidate for the Conservative nomination if I was also
the candidate for the Republican nomination at the same time," Lazio said in an
interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have to decide whether I want to be Don Quixote or John McCain," he said,
referring to the knight errant made famous in Miguel Cervantes' novel of the
same name.
</P>
<P>
	   But Brooklyn GOP Chairman Arthur Bramwell said late Wednesday that Lazio had
told him about three weeks ago that he would endorse Giuliani at the group's
March 9 dinner.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazio had $3 million in the bank and was prepared to seek the Republican
nomination for the U.S. Senate late last year when Gov. George Pataki, who had
been providing him with advice, urged him to step aside in favor of the better
known Giuliani. Pataki and Giuliani had frosty relations since Giuliani endorsed
Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo over Pataki in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki yielded to calls from prominent Republicans, like Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, to unite behind Giuliani in order to beat the Democratic candidate for
Senate, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazio said Wednesday he had spoken with Pataki that morning, but declined to
say what they had discussed.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon would say only, "Rudy Giuliani is the
governor's candidate." One Pataki administration source said Lazio and Pataki
discussed Bush's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani irked Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long when in a series of
appearances on Sunday morning television talk shows he said he was prepared to
run without Conservative Party support. The mayor also reiterated his pro-choice
stance on abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Long has said that the only way Giuliani could win Conservative Party
backing would be to come out in favor of a ban on what critics call
partial-birth abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York state, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by an almost 5-3
margin, no Republican has won statewide office in the past 25 years without the
Conservative Party's endorsement. Pataki beat Cuomo on the strength of the
Conservative Party vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazio favors abortion rights but is opposed to certain late-term abortions.
</P>

	   Lazio said he has been studying the election results in New Hampshire, where
McCain, the Republican underdog, defeated the better-financed Bush. And he said
he has also been looking at polls that show nearly 60 percent of New Yorkers
wish someone besides Giuliani was running in the New York race.
</P>
<P>
	   "If he (Lazio) did run, I think he wins," Long said referring to Giuliani
and Clinton's high negative ratings in polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazio also said he was not entirely convinced Giuliani was in the race.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has hinted he will not formally announce he is entering the race,
but has strongly indicated that he is. The mayor has most of the state
Republican Party supporting him, including state GOP Party Chairman William
Powers, and has raised $11.5 million for the race.
</P>
<P>
	   "It looks like he's going to run but until he says 'I am a candidate for the
U.S. Senate' it's still a question," Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a very mercurial man," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The Giuliani camp had no comment Wednesday on Lazio's remarks.

<HEADLINE> Reporter's Fate in Chechnya Unclear  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNA DOLGOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- A missing reporter for U.S.-financed Radio Liberty has been
seen in the custody of a pro-Moscow militia in Chechnya, despite Russian claims
that he was handed over to Chechen rebels, a co-worker at the radio station said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mario Corti, the head of Radio Liberty's Russian service, said residents of
Chechnya's Russian-controlled city of Gudermes reported seeing Andrei Babitsky
with a pro-Moscow militia on Tuesday. According to witness reports, Babitsky's
face was badly bruised and his clothes were bloody, Corti told the Echo of
Moscow radio station.
</P>
<P>
	   But other reports also emerged. Russian television broadcast a videotape
purportedly showing Babitsky talking, and a Chechen official said Babitsky had
indeed been turned over to Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky was detained by Russian troops in Chechnya in January. He had been
reporting on the Chechen conflict from the rebels' side and had been sharply
criticized by Russian officials before his arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Babitsky allegedly was turned over to Chechen rebels in exchange
for three Russian prisoners of war. But his family and colleagues in Moscow have
not heard from him. They have alleged that Babitsky is being held by Russian
security services.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials have refused to provide any details of the supposed swap
and said they were unaware of Babitsky's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian authorities ``have contradicted themselves from day one,'' Corti
said. ``They have lied so much that I wouldn't be surprised if one of them says
that no Babitsky has ever existed -- so absurd it has all become.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, the U.S. State Department demanded Wednesday that Russian
officials ``come clean'' about Babitsky's fate. Department spokesman James P.
Rubin said the reporter's disappearance and incomplete and contradictory
explanations by Russian officials ``have raised the greatest fears as to his
fate.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Capitol Hill, 21 members of Congress called on acting Russian President
Vladimir Putin to review the situation promptly and assist in securing the
reporter's release. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said at a news
conference that the United States had made its concern over Babitsky known in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   A videotape broadcast on Russian television Wednesday purportedly showed
Babitsky alive for the first time in nearly a week. He spoke in vague phrases,
and revealed no hints of where or by whom he was being held. Babitsky's
colleagues at the radio station questioned the tape's authenticity.
</P>
<P>
	   In the videotape, Babitsky said he was in relatively good condition. He said
the video had been shot Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Time is the only problem, but, regrettably, the circumstances are such
that I can't immediately get home,'' said Babitsky, who was sitting against a
white wall and looking exhausted.
</P>
<P>
	   Corti said a man who offered him the tape Tuesday night claimed Babitsky was
with the rebels and proposed to sell the tape for $500. Corti said he gave him
$300 and got the impression the man wasn't interested in money.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think this was an operation of the secret services,'' he told NTV
television.
</P>
<P>
	   But Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov's envoy to Moscow, Sharip Yusupov,
told Echo of Moscow on Wednesday that Babitsky has indeed been turned over to
rebels and was with a small group of fighters.

<HEADLINE> Auto insurers made big profits in '98, claim they lost money in  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Auto insurers had a banner year in 1998, piling up
double-digit profits that were the highest in a decade, a new study shows.
<P>
	   But the insurance industry says when all the figures are added up for 1999,
profits will resemble a flat tire because a new auto insurance reform law
enacted last year forced insurers to reduce rates by at least 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Association of Insurance Commissioners' report says profits for
1998 were at 10 percent to 14 percent, depending on the formulas the group uses.
At either rate, it's a big profit.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no question right now that a strong economy is helping the
companies," said John Tiene, director of the Insurance Council of New Jersey.
"Companies are making money from their investments. But rate cuts of 1999 will
obliterate those profits."
</P>
<P>
	   The new insurance reform law last year cut rates for motorists by at least
13 percent. Tiene said his group estimates the average rate cut to be in the 16
percent range. He said the bulk of the 1998 profits were from investments. He
said there won't be big profits from 1999 because the rate cuts removed about
$830 million in premiums from insurers.
</P>
<P>
	   "When the report from 1999 comes out, we'll probably be in a loss
situation," Tiene said.
</P>
<P>
	   The national insurance group also reports average insurance rates that have
annually shown New Jersey as the most expensive auto insurance state in the
nation. The most recent report, covering 1997, placed the average rate at
$1,126. The 1998 figures are due by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
	   John Kerry Dyke, chairman of the New Jersey Auto Agents Alliance, said the
figures also show that auto insurance loss ratios, which look at claims, have
dipped below the national average. He said such figures should prompt insurers
to reduce premiums.
</P>
<P>
	   "If that does not happen, then auto insurance will once again become a top
political and consumer issue," Dyke said. "Our industry cannot continue to
charge high rates while simultaneously enjoying nice profits."
</P>
<P>
	   Tiene, however, said motorists should not expect a rash of rate reductions.
He said while the auto insurance industry was forced by the reform law to reduce
rates last year, cost-saving measures that are expected to pay for the rate
reduction are not fully in force yet. Until that happens, he said, insurers will
be playing catch-up.
</P>
<P>
	   "We still have not seen any significant cost savings to justify the rate
cut," Tiene said. "Many of the cost containment measures were put in place just
last month. We have a long way to go before we can say the problem is solved."

<HEADLINE> Breakdown in Contact With Hijackers  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROLINE BYRNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Contact with the hijackers of an Afghan airliner
broke down Wednesday after the flight crew escaped, but police regained
communication and expressed confidence they were on track to win release of the
150-plus hostages aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The negotiations became strained after four crew members staged a daring,
midnight escape through a cockpit window. Police were left to wonder if anyone
aboard could fly the Ariana airlines Boeing 727 if the hijackers chose to take
off again. The plane had leapfrogged across Asia and Europe before arriving
Stansted airport near London early Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can imagine their (the captors) reactions when they discovered that
the flight crew had gone,'' said Joe Edwards, an assistant chief constable of
Essex County police. ``Perhaps understandably, things went quiet.''
</P>
<P>
	   But contact resumed later Wednesday and negotiators grew more hopeful about
the release of the 150-plus hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're more optimistic now,'' said Edwards. ``Negotiations are where they
should be.''
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiators insisted that the armed men had made no formal demands,
political or otherwise. The men, believed to be Afghan dissidents armed with
grenades, pistols and daggers, had requested only that food, water and other
comfort items be brought to the plane, parked on a runway.
</P>
<P>
	   Speculation mounted in the British media, however, that the plane was seized
as part of an elaborate bid for political asylum -- and that some of the roughly
hostages were in on it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``HI-HOAX? Hijackers and hostages may be asylum seekers,'' the tabloid
Mirror blared on its front page. The downmarket Daily Star lamented ``Oh no!
They ALL want to stay (and we'll have to pay).''
</P>
<P>
	   Fueling the asylum speculation was the arrival Tuesday of an observer from
the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. The observer would be
providing expertise but would not be joining the negotiating team, said Edwards.
The commission's London office identified the observer as Hope Hanlan.
</P>
<P>
	   It was believed that 151 people, including 21 children, remained aboard the
aircraft, which was hijacked early Sunday 20 minutes into a domestic flight
leaving Kabul, Afghanistan's capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Among them were 39 members of one family who were traveling to a wedding in
Mazar-e-Sharif -- including the would-be bride, said Mohammed Daoud Sharisi, who
sells tickets at the Ariana office in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
	   Early in the day, the hijackers ejected a flight attendant, who was seen
being sent forcibly down a set of stairs at the rear of the plane. His departure
came four hours after four crew members -- the captain, second captain, first
officer and flight engineer -- escaped by using a rope to lower themselves from
the cockpit and jumping onto the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we are not able to determine is whether any of the remaining crew on
board or any of the passengers are able to fly this aircraft,'' said John
Broughton, an assistant chief constable of Essex County police.
</P>
<P>
	   Four men, presumed to be hijackers, appeared briefly on the ground at the
rear of the plane Wednesday morning to collect fresh supplies. That evening, two
men descended the jet's rear steps and collected an evening meal -- a result of
the continuing negotiations. They appeared to carry out an inspection of the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the crew members, the hijackers have released 31 passengers
so far.
</P>
<P>
	   In Kabul, an Ariana employee said Wednesday that several airline officials
responsible for security checks on the hijacked flight had been arrested. An
Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said several
employees were questioned but allowed to go back to work.

<HEADLINE> Guyanese Police Kill Fugitive  </HEADLINE>
   By BERT WILKINSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ECCLES, Guyana (AP) -- Police killed Guyana's most wanted fugitive and a
companion Wednesday in an 11-hour battle of gunfire and grenades in an upscale
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of police backed by special forces cornered Linden London, a former
army commando accused in a series of spectacular robberies, in an apartment in
Eccles, said Deputy Police Chief Floyd McDonald.
</P>
<P>
	   London was killed as he tried to escape a blaze ignited by police grenades.
An unidentified female companion was also found dead, and police said they
believed London killed her.
</P>
<P>
	   Others in the building also fled. A soldier and an officer were hurt, but
not seriously, the police said.
</P>
<P>
	   London was wanted in several robberies in the South American country,
including holding up currency exchange bureaus in the capital, Georgetown, in
September.
</P>
<P>
	   During that robbery, an armed gang sprayed automatic gunfire down a crowded
street, injuring several people. The gang fled into a sugarcane field, which
police burned in an attempt to flush them out. One robber was killed during a
shootout in the fields.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, police tracked London to the Toucan Rental Apartments, part of a
new housing development in Eccles, about six miles south of Georgetown. They
surrounded the building about 8 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Neighbors fled their homes as London and police dueled in an all-night
gunfight. At about 7 a.m. Wednesday, police fired rocket-propelled grenades at
the building, setting it on fire.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Set To Nominate FEC Vacancy  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE RIZZO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Wednesday he will nominate law
professor Bradley A. Smith to fill a vacancy on the Federal Election Commission,
ending a stalemate with Republican leaders but possibly setting up a contentious
Senate confirmation.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith has been a harsh critic of campaign funding laws, saying they have
failed to rid the system of corrupting influences while infringing on
constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression. He favors no limits on how
much candidates can raise and spend.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, who teaches at Capital University Law School in Columbus, Ohio, was
recruited for the FEC post by Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a vigorous foe of the
campaign finance bills under consideration in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   McConnell said Smith's legal background and credentials may make him ``the
most qualified person we've ever put on the FEC.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Scott Harshbarger, president of the government watchdog organization
Common Cause, called Smith's nomination ``a slap in the face to any effort at
responsible reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people of this country are making it clear they want more, not less
efforts to limit the impact of money in politics,'' he said. ``Any senator who
supports this nomination cannot claim to support campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   The FEC enforces federal campaign finance law, making sure candidates comply
with disclosure requirements and contribution limits. The six-member commission
is evenly split among Republicans and Democrats, all of whom serve six-year
terms.
</P>
<P>
	   By tradition, the Senate's Democratic leadership recommends the three
Democrats and the GOP leadership recommends the three Republicans. In almost
every instance, whoever has occupied the White House has deferred to those
wishes.
</P>
<P>
	   But Smith's writings on election law gave his critics considerable fodder
with which to oppose him. In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, he
wrote that when ``a law is in need of continual revision to close a series of
ever-changing `loopholes,' it is probably the law, and not the people, that is
in error. The most sensible reform is a simple one: repeal of the Federal
Election Campaign Act.''
</P>
<P>
	   Common Cause and other groups organized a campaign against Smith last
summer, and Clinton held off on the nomination. Frustrated by the failure to get
quick action on what normally is a routine nomination, McConnell and Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., delayed confirmation of Richard Holbrooke as U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House made no mention of that background in its announcement.
Clinton also will renominate Commissioner Danny Lee McDonald, who has served on
the FEC since 1982.

<HEADLINE> Immigrants Boycott in Spanish Town  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Most of the 10,000 Moroccan immigrants in the
strife-torn Spanish town of El Ejido boycotted work Wednesday, fearing further
violence after an immigrant was arrested in connection with the murder of a
young Spanish woman.
</P>
<P>
	   The greenhouses that blanket much of the countryside remained idle as the
laborers ignored pleas from their employers to continue harvesting the vegetable
crop. As many as 600 riot police patrolled the town of 52,000.
</P>
<P>
	   One greenhouse owner told Spanish television that he and his colleagues
feared the loss of tomatoes, cucumbers and other greenhouse crops after three
days of racial violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the weekend, residents chased Moroccans and other African immigrants
through the streets, trashing their cars, shops and other property. The rioting
was sparked by the arrest of a mentally disturbed Moroccan immigrant in
connection with killing of a 26-year-old woman in an El Ejido market last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested 46 Spanish citizens after the violence against the
immigrants, news agency Europa Press said. At least 15 humanitarian
organizations, immigrant groups and agricultural collectives organized a rally
for Friday in the nearby city of Almeria under the heading ``Live together in
peace.''
</P>
<P>
	   A statement from the Association of Moroccan Immigrant Workers in Spain said
immigrant workers should not be expected to return to work ``when they haven't
even received repayment for the moral and material damages.''

<HEADLINE> Vt. Committee Backs Gay Marriage  </HEADLINE>
   By ROSS SNEYD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- A key committee of the Vermont House voted Wednesday
in favor of developing a broad domestic partnership system for gay and lesbian
couples instead of broadening marriage statutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The House Judiciary Committee's vote -- eight for the domestic partnership
system; three for legalizing gay marriage -- decided the focus of the bill.
Committee members began writing it Wednesday and will vote on it later.
</P>
<P>
	   If approved by the legislature and enacted, the proposal would require
Vermont to provide more rights and benefits to gay and lesbian couples than any
other state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a momentous vote,'' Gov. Howard Dean said. ``It's a vote to move
forward and become the first state to really grant equal rights'' to lesbians
and gays.
</P>
<P>
	   Committee Chairman Thomas Little repeatedly said the committee would work on
a civil rights bill, something that would be ``different than, broader than''
domestic partnership plans that have been discussed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Legislature has been grappling with how to respond to a state Supreme
Court ruling that said gay and lesbian couples are being unconstitutionally
denied the rights and benefits that accompany legal marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   The court said the Legislature could rectify that by expanding marriage or
creating a parallel domestic partnership system.
</P>
<P>
	   The first draft of the domestic partnership bill discussed Wednesday would
give gay and lesbian couples all the legal rights and responsibilities
heterosexual married couples receive, including inheritance rights, tax
privileges and the authority to make medical decisions for a partner.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Rep. Michael Kainen of Hartford said many committee members voted
for the domestic partnership system rather than legalizing gay marriage because
they believe it has a better chance of passing.
</P>
<P>
	   The Judiciary Committee has held two public hearings attended by a total of
more than 5,000 people and has heard a month of testimony from religious and
legal experts.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic Rep. William Lippert, the only openly gay member of the committee
or the Legislature, said Wednesday he believed broadening marriage statutes to
include gays and lesbians would be a major move toward ending discrimination. He
voted for legalizing gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I trust whatever next step we take collectively, we take in a continual
step to dismantle institutional discrimination,'' Lippert said.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Air Inspecting Fleet  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM VERDIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Alaska Airlines said it was inspecting its fleet of
MD-80 jetliners Wednesday for damage to a key part in the tail system that may
have played a crucial role in the crash of Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
	   The component, called a jackscrew, drives the horizontal stabilizer, which
has become the focus of the investigation into the Jan. 31 crash that killed 88
people off the coast of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
	   A two-foot section of the screw was recovered with the main wreckage of the
MD-83 about 10 miles off the coast, and the airline said it had been stripped.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It appeared to investigators who looked at the mechanism ... that there
was some damage to it,'' National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall
said. ``It was unclear whether the damage was pre-impact or from hitting the
water.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska said it would inspect all 34 of its MD-80 series planes as a
precaution. The inspections were expected to be completed by the end of
Wednesday and were not expected to cause significant service delays.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 1,100 MD-80 aircraft are flown by nearly 70 airlines worldwide,
making it one of the most popular commercial jetliners ever built.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Aviation Administration has not told airline companies to make
additional checks of the tail section of MD-80 series aircraft, but that could
change as the investigation evolves, agency spokesman Paul Turk said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the continuing education of the accident reveals any threat to the
safety of flight, we won't hesitate to do whatever is necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators in the Alaska Airlines crash are focusing on the stabilizer, a
wing-like device on the jet's tail, because pilots reported problems with it
after taking off from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, for San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   The jackscrew is powered by two motors and resembles the corkscrew-like
device that opens many automatic garage doors. If the jackscrew was damaged
during flight, the horizontal stabilizer could move beyond its normal range,
causing the tail wing to stall, or lose its lift, said William Waldock,
associate director for the Center for Aerospace Safety Education at Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
	   It would be nearly impossible to recover from such a stall, Waldock said.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilots would not be able to control the up-or-down motion of the
aircraft -- which would be consistent with flight data that shows the plane went
into a 3.4-mile nosedive and radar tracking that shows something may have fallen
off the plane as the dive began.
</P>
<P>
	   The stabilizer moves up and down as a nut rides the jackscrew back and
forth, explained aviation analyst John Nance of Tacoma, Wash. It was unknown
whether the NTSB recovered the nut.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The system somehow came apart, separated or whatever and the stabilizer
was free to flip up into the wind at a very severe angle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You put something like that directly into the wind at such an angle and
it's going to fail. In the process of failing, instead of just coming off the
airplane, it pulled the tail up and pulled the nose down,'' Nance said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane's autopilot was disengaged when the jetliner reached 29,000 feet.
The jet was flown manually for one hour and 53 minutes. Pilots say it is unusual
to fly manually for that long and could suggest a problem with the autopilot or
any number of other systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said the MD-83 involved in the crash had two maintenance write-ups
last fall for problems with the horizontal stabilizer. In October, the system
was checked and the plane returned to service. A month later, mechanics replaced
a switch.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Denies Asylum To Cubans  </HEADLINE>
   By FABIOLA SANCHEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela on Wednesday rejected a request from
two Cuban doctors for political asylum but said it will allow them to remain in
the country temporarily.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctors' request had presented a dilemma for Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez, who is close friends with Cuban leader Fidel Castro and often praises
Castro's four-decade-old communist revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel said the request was
rejected because the doctors wanted to emigrate to Venezuela for economic
reasons and not because of political persecution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was no political reason that carried weight. They did not qualify
for asylum or refuge,'' Rangel told reporters. However, he said the doctors
would be allowed to stay in Venezuela for one year for unspecified
``humanitarian reasons.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two doctors, Heberto Navarro, 38, and Reinaldo Calebrook, 35, spoke at a
press conference Monday and said they wanted to emigrate to improve their
standard of living. They also praised the political freedoms Venezuelans enjoy.
</P>
<P>
	   The two arrived in Venezuela in December as part of a team of Cuban doctors
who treated victims of landslides that left thousands of people dead along
Venezuela's northern Caribbean coast and in Caracas. Most of the doctors have
remained -- with the Cuban government's OK -- in order to provide medical
assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Chavez administration granted the doctors political asylum, it would
in effect be confirming that there is political repression on the island. But if
it rejected the request and returned the doctors to Cuba, they might face
harassment or prison since they publicly criticized the Cuban government
overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's decision apparently was an attempt to seek a middle ground.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctors' request also was likely to prove embarrassing for the Cuban
government, which after decades of trying to export its brand of leftist
revolution throughout the Third World has taken to sending doctors and teachers
overseas to try to showcase what it says are the revolution's achievements in
health care and education.
</P>
<P>
	   While the two doctors will be allowed to live, work and travel in Venezuela,
officials said the agreement prohibits them from engaging in activities
involving Venezuelan politics.

<HEADLINE> Bronx woman describes Diallo shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The first eyewitness to take the stand in the Amadou
Diallo trial backfired on the defense Wednesday when she claimed police
continued to shoot the unarmed black man after he fell to the ground.
<P>
	   Called by the defense, Schrrie Elliott testified she saw four officers kill
Diallo as she walked home from the subway after midnight on Feb. 4, 1999. She
described the officers jumping out of a car with their guns drawn, forming a
semi-circle on the sidewalk outside Diallo's door and opening fire.
</P>
<P>
	   "And they continued shooting while (Diallo) was down?" prosecutor Donald
Levin asked on cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes," replied Elliott, breaking into tears.
</P>
<P>
	   The surprise testimony in the officer's murder trial prompted defense
attorneys to ask State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi to declare Elliott a
hostile witness. The judge agreed to let them cross-examine her about her
account on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi also was to rule Thursday morning on whether the defense could show
the jury a television news interview it says proves that Elliott has given
conflicting accounts of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not done with this witness," defense attorney Stephen Worth said
outside court. Elliott's attorney, Kevin Fee, refused comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott emerged as the trial's first eyewitness to the shooting after the
defense subpoenaed her to testify on behalf of Officers Kenneth Boss, 28, Sean
Carroll, 36, Edward McMellon, 27, and Richard Murphy, 27. The officers
themselves are expected to testify on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants, all white, have pleaded innocent to charges they murdered
the West African immigrant by firing 41 bullets into the vestibule of his
apartment building at close range, without warning and with abandon; 19 bullets
hit Diallo. If convicted, they face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The case sparked enough pretrial publicity and protest over police abuse of
minorities that an appeals court moved it to Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense claims the officers - in a search for dangerous criminals - saw
Diallo as a threat because he refused orders to halt, then pulled out a black
wallet that appeared to be a gun. It also argues the officers' high-powered
pistols fired fast enough for Diallo to stay on his feet, possibly up against a
wall, throughout the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors refused to comment on why they had not used Elliott as their own
witness.
</P>
<P>
	   After seeing videotape of her being interviewed by a reporter, defense
attorneys called her to testify that she heard someone yell "Gun!" before the
shooting began. The defense says Carroll shouted the warning, proving he thought
Diallo was armed.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott testified reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
	   The witness asked that her face not be broadcast or photographed. She
offered no information about her background, spoke softly and breathed heavily
during questioning by Worth.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, she told Worth, "I didn't want to speak to you all." She said
she knew the four men she spotted on Diallo's block were plainclothes officers,
because "I've had past dealings with the law." She did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Levin used his cross-examination to lead Elliott through a damaging version
of the shooting she apparently had given to a grand jury and the FBI last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman claimed she had a clear view from across the street of Diallo as
he stood in his vestibule with his back to the officers. She described watching
them corner him and fire after he turned around.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott also said none of the officers fell down. The defense has asserted
that McMellon fell as the shooting began, making the others think there was
return fire.
</P>
<P>
	   "Did you hear anyone yell 'Stop,' or 'Freeze,' or 'Show your hands'?" Levin
asked. "No," Elliott replied.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't know who said 'gun,' do you?" the prosecutor asked later. "No,"
she said. "It could have been (Diallo), right?," he continued. "Yes," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, Worth had questioned Elliott about whether she had told the
television reporter she "couldn't believe how long (Diallo) was standing" during
the shooting. She said she couldn't remember.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebroadcast Wednesday by WNBC in New York City, the interview shows Elliott
only in silhouette. She alleged the officers "just went crazy."
</P>
<P>
	   One officer "said 'gun' and that was it," she said. "They just did what they
did."
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott also suggested most of the gunfire occurred while Diallo was
upright, and - like previous prosecution witnesses - that it was interrupted by
a pause.
</P>
<P>
	   "When he was standing, it was longer," she said. "Then after they initially
started, like I said, like three or four seconds, then it was just a mess."
</P>
<P>
	   WNBC reported that it had arranged three polygraph tests for Elliott, and
that she passed them all.

<HEADLINE> Vt. Committee Backs Gay Benefits  </HEADLINE>
   By ROSS SNEYD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- A key committee of the Vermont House voted Wednesday
in favor of developing a broad domestic partnership system for gay and lesbian
couples instead of broadening marriage statutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The House Judiciary Committee's vote -- eight for the domestic partnership
system; three for legalizing gay marriage -- decided the focus of the bill.
Committee members began writing it Wednesday and will vote on it later.
</P>
<P>
	   If approved by the legislature and enacted, the proposal would require
Vermont to provide more rights and benefits to gay and lesbian couples than any
other state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a momentous vote,'' Gov. Howard Dean said. ``It's a vote to move
forward and become the first state to really grant equal rights'' to lesbians
and gays.
</P>
<P>
	   Committee Chairman Thomas Little repeatedly said the committee would work on
a civil rights bill, something that would be ``different than, broader than''
domestic partnership plans that have been discussed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Legislature has been grappling with how to respond to a state Supreme
Court ruling that said gay and lesbian couples are being unconstitutionally
denied the rights and benefits that accompany legal marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   The court said the Legislature could rectify that by expanding marriage or
creating a parallel domestic partnership system.
</P>
<P>
	   The first draft of the domestic partnership bill discussed Wednesday would
give gay and lesbian couples all the legal rights and responsibilities
heterosexual married couples receive, including inheritance rights, tax
privileges and the authority to make medical decisions for a partner.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Rep. Michael Kainen of Hartford said many committee members voted
for the domestic partnership system rather than legalizing gay marriage because
they believe it has a better chance of passing.
</P>
<P>
	   The Judiciary Committee has held two public hearings attended by a total of
more than 5,000 people and has heard a month of testimony from religious and
legal experts.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic Rep. William Lippert, the only openly gay member of the committee
or the Legislature, said Wednesday he believed broadening marriage statutes to
include gays and lesbians would be a major move toward ending discrimination. He
voted for legalizing gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I trust whatever next step we take collectively, we take in a continual
step to dismantle institutional discrimination,'' Lippert said.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Buses Grind To a Halt  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNION, S.C. (AP) -- John McCain calls his campaign bus the ``Straight Talk
Express.'' George W. Bush calls his ``The Victory Express.'' On Wednesday, there
was one phrase to describe them both: out of commission.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was chatting with reporters aboard his bus on its approach to a town
hall meeting with senior citizens when a jarring scrape brought the conversation
-- and the vehicle -- to a stop.
</P>
<P>
	   The bus's trailer hitch had caught on the pavement when the bus climbed
abruptly.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican presidential contender and his entourage got off and walked
the remaining distance to the event. The bus was towed out and put back in
commission a few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, meanwhile, didn't have a very successful first day in his new bus. The
customized vehicle is decked out with TVs, a satellite dish and a rack of stereo
components that would make an audiophile envious.
</P>
<P>
	   The rented vehicle, imported from Nashville, is driven by a man who
frequently ushers around country music star George Strait, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after the governor pulled out of Newberry en route to Union, the
Victory Express ground to a halt. Apparently it wouldn't move out of fifth gear;
fluid poured out of the transmission area.
</P>
<P>
	   That prompted Bush to move to the only reliable form of transportation
around: the press bus.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   During an appearance on a Columbia radio station Wednesday morning, Bush was
asked to name his favorite movie star.
</P>
<P>
	   When he didn't come up with an immediate answer, WCOS-FM host Jeff Roper and
his sidekicks asked which movie star he'd like to meet.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush didn't answer directly, but said he liked campaigning for governor with
actor and martial arts star Chuck Norris.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a Texan. He's a buddy,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush did admit to one downside when he's on the road with Norris.
</P>
<P>
	   He said 95 percent of the people show up to see Norris. Four percent want to
check out the campaign bus. The remaining 1 percent?
</P>
<P>
	   Those are the people there to see Bush.
</P>

</P>
<P>
	   YBOR CITY, Fla. (AP) -- For Al Gore, the techno-candidate, it was like
asking about his underwear.
</P>
<P>
	   At a town-hall forum with the campaigning vice president, computer whiz
Michael Phillips asked Gore: Which do you prefer, the PC platform (or operating
system) or MacIntosh?
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's kind of a high-tech, boxers-or-briefs question, there,'' chuckled
Gore, repeating the line as if to buy time to consider his answer.
</P>
<P>
	   In his bid to be president, Vice President Gore has courted both the
Apple-computer types in Silicon Valley and the mighty Microsoft set in
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he used Apple until ``finally the delay in the availability of the
new high-tech applications software got to be so long that I finally switched
over.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore held out some encouragement to the disappointed Phillips, who sported a
rainbow-colored Apple lapel pin: ``You know, Apple seems to be coming back with
the iMac, don't you think?''
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips, a 19-year-old college freshman studying digital arts, suffers
spinal muscular atrophy and, confined to a portable bed, can move just his
fingers and his eyes.
</P>
<P>
	   He told a reporter he hoped to convert Gore to MacIntosh because, ``it's the
most user-friendly and powerful computer and it's excellent for assistive
technology'' for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ABOARD AIR FORCE TWO (AP) -- On the vice president's plane, even the
cocktails are salted with campaign politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Flying out of Olympia, Wash., late last week, Al Gore proudly poured for his
entourage some Washington state wine, which, he noted, ``is ranked at the top
along with the California wines.''
</P>
<P>
	   (It should be noted here that Gore is waging a no-holds-barred fight with
fellow Democrat Bill Bradley to win California's March 7 primary.)
</P>
<P>
	   Are you 'dissing New York wines, a reporter teased Gore, knowing that New
York also votes on March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Nah, he replied.
</P>
<P>
	   But just to be safe, by Tuesday night, he had stocked the plane with New
York's Great Western champagne.
</P>
<P>
	   And since Florida's primary is March 14, Gore, padding through the cabin in
flip-flops, ordered that the bubbly be served mimosa-style with Florida orange
juice.

<HEADLINE> Crime still dropping, down 10 percent in preliminary report for  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Crime in New Jersey decreased 10 percent in the
first half of last year, according to preliminary figures released Wednesday,
capping a decade of a steady downward trend.
<P>
	   The preliminary reports are unofficial and are not regarded as final
statistics, which should be included in the annual Uniform Crime Report due out
this summer. However, the preliminary report does give a forecast of what sort
of statistics can be expected when the final figures for 1999 are presented.
</P>
<P>
	   The preliminary report shows that in the first six months of the year,
murder was down 10 percent, at 140 reported, down from 155 in the same period in
1998. The six-month report shows a 9 percent drop in overall violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   As for property crimes, burglary was down 19 percent in the first six months
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The burglary results show 14,875 reported break-ins at private residences,
down more than 3,500 from the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "Once again, crime is on the run in New Jersey," Gov. Christie Whitman
proclaimed as she released the crime report at a State Police barracks in
Totowa. "The crime rate has not been this low since 1974, a quarter century
ago."
</P>
<P>
	   The same preliminary report released at the same time last year showed the
same 10-percent drop for the first six months of 1998 compared with 1997. The
final Uniform Crime Report for 1998 ended up showing an annual drop in crime of
9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the statewide statistics released Wednesday were compiled by the
State Police based on reports filed by hundreds of local police agencies, a
town-by-town breakdown was not made available.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor credited tougher police efforts, stronger laws and longer
prison terms with the decline in crime.
</P>
<P>
	   "Has our strong economy helped as well? No question," Whitman added.
"Creating more jobs is one of the best ways to reduce the incidence of crime,
and we've done plenty of that."
</P>
<P>
	   Crime was down in every one of the 21 counties except Passaic, where it held
flat. Last year, crime had dropped in only 17 of the 21 counties.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest drops were in Union and Hunterdon counties, where it was down 20
percent, and in Cape May, Monmouth, Somerset and Warren counties, where it
decreased 16 percent.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Police Regain Contact With Hijackers  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROLINE BYRNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Contact with the hijackers of an Afghan airliner
broke down Wednesday after the flight crew escaped, but police regained
communication and expressed confidence they were on track to win release of the
150-plus hostages aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The negotiations became strained after four crew members staged a daring,
midnight escape through a cockpit window. Police were left to wonder if anyone
aboard could fly the Ariana airlines Boeing 727 if the hijackers chose to take
off again. The plane had leapfrogged across Asia and Europe before arriving
Stansted airport near London early Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can imagine their (the captors) reactions when they discovered that
the flight crew had gone,'' said Joe Edwards, an assistant chief constable of
Essex County police. ``Perhaps understandably, things went quiet.''
</P>
<P>
	   But contact resumed later Wednesday and negotiators grew more hopeful about
the release of the 150-plus hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're more optimistic now,'' said Edwards. ``Negotiations are where they
should be.''
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiators insisted that the armed men had made no formal demands,
political or otherwise. The men, believed to be Afghan dissidents armed with
grenades, pistols and daggers, had requested only that food, water and other
comfort items be brought to the plane, parked on a runway.
</P>
<P>
	   Speculation mounted in the British media, however, that the plane was seized
as part of an elaborate bid for political asylum -- and that some of the roughly
hostages were in on it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``HI-HOAX? Hijackers and hostages may be asylum seekers,'' the tabloid
Mirror blared on its front page. The downmarket Daily Star lamented ``Oh no!
They ALL want to stay (and we'll have to pay).''
</P>
<P>
	   Fueling the asylum speculation was the arrival Tuesday of an observer from
the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. The observer would be
providing expertise but would not be joining the negotiating team, said Edwards.
The commission's London office identified the observer as Hope Hanlan.
</P>
<P>
	   It was believed that 151 people, including 21 children, remained aboard the
aircraft, which was hijacked early Sunday 20 minutes into a domestic flight
leaving Kabul, Afghanistan's capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Among them were 39 members of one family who were traveling to a wedding in
Mazar-e-Sharif -- including the would-be bride, said Mohammed Daoud Sharisi, who
sells tickets at the Ariana office in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
	   Early in the day, the hijackers ejected a flight attendant, who was seen
being sent forcibly down a set of stairs at the rear of the plane. His departure
came four hours after four crew members -- the captain, second captain, first
officer and flight engineer -- escaped by using a rope to lower themselves from
the cockpit and jumping onto the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we are not able to determine is whether any of the remaining crew on
board or any of the passengers are able to fly this aircraft,'' said John
Broughton, an assistant chief constable of Essex County police.
</P>
<P>
	   Four men, presumed to be hijackers, appeared briefly on the ground at the
rear of the plane Wednesday morning to collect fresh supplies. That evening, two
men descended the jet's rear steps and collected an evening meal -- a result of
the continuing negotiations. They appeared to carry out an inspection of the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the crew members, the hijackers have released 31 passengers
so far.
</P>
<P>
	   In Kabul, an Ariana employee said Wednesday that several airline officials
responsible for security checks on the hijacked flight had been arrested. An
Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said several
employees were questioned but allowed to go back to work.

	   In 1763, France ceded Canada to England under the Treaty of Paris, which
ended the French and Indian War.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1840, Britain's Queen Victoria married Prince Albert of
Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1846, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, the
Mormons, began an exodus to the west from Illinois.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1933, the first singing telegram was introduced by the Postal Telegram
Company in New York.

<P>
	   In 1949, Arthur Miller's play ``Death of a Salesman'' opened at Broadway's
Morosco Theater.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1962, the Soviet Union exchanged captured American U-2 pilot Francis Gary
Powers for Rudolph Ivanovich Abel, a Soviet spy held by the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1981, eight people were killed and 198 injured when fire broke out at the
Las Vegas Hilton hotel-casino.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1989, Ron Brown was elected chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, becoming the first black to head a major U-S political party.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Dr. David Satcher was confirmed by the Senate to be surgeon

prisons but requiring states to get tougher on violent criminals before they
could receive any money.
</P>
<P>
	   One year ago: Resigned to losing their case, House prosecutors said public
opinion polls had made a stronger impression on senators than any evidence that
President Clinton committed high crimes and misdemeanors. A federal judge
ordered American Airlines pilots to end a sickout that had grounded 2,500
flights, stranded 200,000 travelers and left businesses scrambling for cargo
carriers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Looks To Fill FEC Vacancy  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE RIZZO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Wednesday he will nominate law
professor Bradley A. Smith to fill a vacancy on the Federal Election Commission,
ending a stalemate with Republican leaders but possibly setting up a contentious
Senate confirmation.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith has been a harsh critic of campaign funding laws, saying they have
failed to rid the system of corrupting influences while infringing on
constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression. He favors no limits on how
much candidates can raise and spend.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, who teaches at Capital University Law School in Columbus, Ohio, was
recruited for the FEC post by Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a vigorous foe of the
campaign finance bills under consideration in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   McConnell said Smith's legal background and credentials may make him ``the
most qualified person we've ever put on the FEC.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Scott Harshbarger, president of the government watchdog organization
Common Cause, called Smith's nomination ``a slap in the face to any effort at
responsible reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people of this country are making it clear they want more, not less
efforts to limit the impact of money in politics,'' he said. ``Any senator who
supports this nomination cannot claim to support campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   The FEC enforces federal campaign finance law, making sure candidates comply
with disclosure requirements and contribution limits. The six-member commission
is evenly split among Republicans and Democrats, all of whom serve six-year
terms.
</P>
<P>
	   By tradition, the Senate's Democratic leadership recommends the three
Democrats and the GOP leadership recommends the three Republicans. In almost
every instance, whoever has occupied the White House has deferred to those
wishes.
</P>
<P>
	   But Smith's writings on election law gave his critics considerable fodder
with which to oppose him. In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, he
wrote that when ``a law is in need of continual revision to close a series of
ever-changing `loopholes,' it is probably the law, and not the people, that is
in error. The most sensible reform is a simple one: repeal of the Federal
Election Campaign Act.''
</P>
<P>
	   Common Cause and other groups organized a campaign against Smith last
summer, and Clinton held off on the nomination. Frustrated by the failure to get
quick action on what normally is a routine nomination, McConnell and Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., delayed confirmation of Richard Holbrooke as U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House made no mention of that background in its announcement.
Clinton also will renominate Commissioner Danny Lee McDonald, who has served on
the FEC since 1982.

<HEADLINE> Bronx woman describes Diallo shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The first eyewitness to take the stand in the Amadou
Diallo trial backfired on the defense Wednesday when she claimed police
continued to shoot the unarmed black man after he fell to the ground.
<P>
	   Called by the defense, Schrrie Elliott testified she saw four officers kill
Diallo as she walked home from the subway after midnight on Feb. 4, 1999 in the
Bronx. She described the officers jumping out of a car with their guns drawn,
forming a semi-circle on the sidewalk outside Diallo's door and opening fire.
</P>
<P>
	   "And they continued shooting while (Diallo) was down?" prosecutor Donald
Levin asked on cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes," replied Elliott, breaking into tears.
</P>
<P>
	   The surprise testimony in the officer's murder trial prompted defense
attorneys to ask State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi to declare Elliott a
hostile witness. The judge agreed to let them cross-examine her about her
account on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi also was to rule Thursday morning on whether the defense could show
the jury a television news interview it says proves that Elliott has given
conflicting accounts of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not done with this witness," defense attorney Stephen Worth said
outside court. Elliott's attorney, Kevin Fee, refused comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott emerged as the trial's first eyewitness to the shooting after the
defense subpoenaed her to testify on behalf of Officers Kenneth Boss, 28, Sean
Carroll, 36, Edward McMellon, 27, and Richard Murphy, 27. The officers
themselves are expected to testify on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants, all white, have pleaded innocent to charges they murdered
the West African immigrant by firing 41 bullets into the vestibule of his
apartment building at close range, without warning and with abandon; 19 bullets
hit Diallo. If convicted, they face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The case sparked enough pretrial publicity and protest over police abuse of
minorities that an appeals court moved it to Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense claims the officers - in a search for dangerous criminals - saw
Diallo as a threat because he refused orders to halt, then pulled out a black
wallet that appeared to be a gun. It also argues the officers' high-powered
pistols fired fast enough for Diallo to stay on his feet, possibly up against a
wall, throughout the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors refused to comment on why they had not used Elliott as their own
witness.
</P>
<P>
	   After seeing videotape of her being interviewed by a reporter, defense
attorneys called her to testify that she heard someone yell "Gun!" before the
shooting began. The defense says Carroll shouted the warning, proving he thought
Diallo was armed.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott testified reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
	   The witness asked that her face not be broadcast or photographed. She
offered no information about her background, spoke softly and breathed heavily
during questioning by Worth.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, she told Worth, "I didn't want to speak to you all." She said
she knew the four men she spotted on Diallo's block were plainclothes officers,
because "I've had past dealings with the law." She did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Levin used his cross-examination to lead Elliott through a damaging version
of the shooting she apparently had given to a grand jury and the FBI last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman claimed she had a clear view from across the street of Diallo as
he stood in his vestibule with his back to the officers. She described watching
them corner him and fire after he turned around.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott also said none of the officers fell down. The defense has asserted
that McMellon fell as the shooting began, making the others think there was
return fire.
</P>
<P>
	   "Did you hear anyone yell 'Stop,' or 'Freeze,' or 'Show your hands'?" Levin
asked. "No," Elliott replied.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't know who said 'gun,' do you?" the prosecutor asked later. "No,"
she said. "It could have been (Diallo), right?," he continued. "Yes," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, Worth had questioned Elliott about whether she had told the
television reporter she "couldn't believe how long (Diallo) was standing" during
the shooting. She said she couldn't remember.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebroadcast Wednesday by WNBC in New York City, the interview shows Elliott
only in silhouette. She alleged the officers "just went crazy."
</P>
<P>
	   One officer "said 'gun' and that was it," she said. "They just did what they
did."
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott also suggested most of the gunfire occurred while Diallo was
upright, and - like previous prosecution witnesses - that it was interrupted by
a pause.
</P>
<P>
	   "When he was standing, it was longer," she said. "Then after they initially
started, like I said, like three or four seconds, then it was just a mess."
</P>
<P>
	   WNBC reported that it had arranged three polygraph tests for Elliott, and
that she passed them all.

<HEADLINE> Disney Earnings Rise  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Walt Disney Co., showing signs of mending after a
lackluster 1999, reported higher earnings Wednesday as the entertainment giant
benefited from its ABC hit "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."
</P>
<P>
	   Disney's expanding Internet operations, though, remained unprofitable and
are expected to continue to drag down overall results in the near future.
</P>
<P>
	   The company earned $515 million, or 25 cents a share, for the quarter ended
Dec. 31, up from $482 million, or 23 cents a share, for the same period a year
earlier. The first quarter results were in line with figures the company gave
last month, when it previewed its earnings report as it announced a management
reorganization.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's Go.com Internet division, spun off with its own stock after
Disney completed its acquisition of the Infoseek Web portal last fall, lost
$265.4 million, or $1.73 a share, for the quarter. Most of the loss resulted
from Infoseek acquisition costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney retained 72 percent of Go.com stock. Adding in Go.com's losses,
Disney's earnings were $324 million, or 16 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Go.com's operating losses are expected to continue while the company reforms
its operations from an Internet portal to a content-driven entertainment site,
Disney executives said.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney intends to make money off its Internet operations, so "we will push
to reach profitability as quickly as is possible and prudent," said Thomas
Staggs, chief financial officer, in a conference call with investment analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   With Disney's assets, including its movie division, ABC-TV, ESPN and other
top cable channels, Go.com is positioned to become a leading entertainment site
for Internet users, said Michael Eisner, Disney chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
	   "No other company than Go.com has a comparable collection of assets to serve
them," Eisner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney also can become a leader in creating entertainment specifically for
broadcast over the World Wide Web as high-speed Internet access becomes more
available, Eisner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall Disney revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 5 percent from
the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Broadcasting revenues were up 19 percent to $2.7 billion, driven by strong
ad sales for the smash game show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." Advertising
revenues also rose at Disney's radio stations and ESPN and some of its other
cable channels.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the success of "Toy Story 2," which has grossed $237 million,
Disney's studio revenues dropped 10 percent to $1.6 billion. Other films such as
"The Insider" and "Bicentennial Man" performed weakly, while home-video sales
also fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney's retail division, a sore spot as the company's stock and earnings
slumped the past year, continued to falter. Consumer products revenues were $903
million, down 6 percent as merchandise licensing declined in the United States,
Europe and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's tourism operations, which include theme parks, resorts and
cruise ships, maintained strong results, posting revenues of $1.58 billion, a 9
percent increase.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney stock was up 12 1/2 cents on the New York Stock Exchange at $37.68
3/4.

<HEADLINE> Lazio says he's weighing Conservative Party invitation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Comparing himself to come-from-behind GOP presidential
hopeful John McCain, Rep. Rick Lazio said Wednesday he is seriously considering
the New York Conservative Party's invitation to enter the U.S. Senate race.
<P>
	   But the Long Island Republican said he would only do so if he ran on the
Republican line as well - and he added he has still not ruled out challenging
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would only be a candidate for the Conservative nomination if I was also
the candidate for the Republican nomination at the same time," Lazio said in an
interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have to decide whether I want to be Don Quixote or John McCain," he said,
referring to the knight errant made famous in Miguel Cervantes' novel of the
same name.
</P>
<P>
	   But Brooklyn GOP Chairman Arthur Bramwell said late Wednesday that Lazio had
told him about three weeks ago that he would endorse Giuliani at the group's
March 9 dinner. The Lazio camp responded that the congressman had not even
committed to attend the dinner, let alone endorsing Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazio had $3 million in the bank and was prepared to seek the Republican
nomination for the U.S. Senate late last year when Gov. George Pataki, who had
been providing him with advice, urged him to step aside in favor of the better
known Giuliani. Pataki and Giuliani had frosty relations since Giuliani endorsed
Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo over Pataki in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki yielded to calls from prominent Republicans, like Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, to unite behind Giuliani in order to beat the Democratic candidate for
Senate, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazio said Wednesday he had spoken with Pataki that morning, but declined to
say what they had discussed.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon would say only, "Rudy Giuliani is the
governor's candidate." One Pataki administration source said Lazio and Pataki
discussed Bush's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani irked Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long when in a series of
appearances on Sunday morning television talk shows he said he was prepared to
run without Conservative Party support. The mayor also reiterated his pro-choice
stance on abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Long has said that the only way Giuliani could win Conservative Party
backing would be to come out in favor of a ban on what critics call
partial-birth abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York state, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by an almost 5-3
margin, no Republican has won statewide office in the past 25 years without the
Conservative Party's endorsement. Pataki beat Cuomo on the strength of the
Conservative Party vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazio favors abortion rights but is opposed to certain late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazio said he has been studying the election results in New Hampshire, where
McCain, the Republican underdog, defeated the better-financed Bush. And he said
he has also been looking at polls that show nearly 60 percent of New Yorkers
wish someone besides Giuliani was running in the New York race.
</P>
<P>
	   "If he (Lazio) did run, I think he wins," Long said referring to Giuliani
and Clinton's high negative ratings in polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazio also said he was not entirely convinced Giuliani was in the race.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has hinted he will not formally announce he is entering the race,
but has strongly indicated that he is. The mayor has most of the state
Republican Party supporting him, including state GOP Party Chairman William
Powers, and has raised $11.5 million for the race.
</P>
<P>
	   "It looks like he's going to run but until he says 'I am a candidate for the
U.S. Senate' it's still a question," Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a very mercurial man," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The Giuliani camp had no comment Wednesday on Lazio's remarks.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Drops Out, Millions Lighter  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- After spending more than $66 million of his own money
in a relentless six-year bid for political viability, Republican publisher Steve
Forbes abandoned his second presidential campaign Wednesday with little to show
for his investment.
</P>
<P>
	   The shy, bookish conservative called it quits after third-place finishes in
the New Hampshire and Delaware primaries, according to advisers who said Forbes
would announce the decision Thursday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have no regrets except not winning,'' Forbes told NBC News. ``But I
think we did help change the agenda in America.''
</P>
<P>
	   His departure triggered a scramble among the remaining contenders for his
anti-abortion, anti-tax supporters on the conservative right. It also set the
stage for a two-way race between national front-runner George W. Bush and Sen.
John McCain of Arizona, the surging underdog.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm going to be working hard to appeal to his voters,'' Bush said, as he
prepared for a clash with McCain in this state's Feb. 19 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Fresh off a landslide victory in New Hampshire, McCain made his own bid for
Forbes' supporters. ``Most Republicans think my tax cut ... is far more
conservative than Governor Bush's tax plan. I think they'll be headed in my
direction,'' he said between campaign stops.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals underscored that Forbes, more than the previous six GOP
candidates who dropped out of the race, left his mark on the political scene he
failed to conquer. His flat income tax plan became a national issue in his
failed 1996 presidential race, and this year he helped popularize GOP economic
themes such as health care savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   He also is one of the GOP's top fund-raising attractions.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls in the first three contests showed that Forbes fared best among
voters whose top priority was taxes. He also did well with people looking for a
candidate who stands up for what he believes.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, Forbes failed to convince Republicans that he could win in
November.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His candidacy failed to connect with Republicans outside of social
conservatives in Iowa. All the money in the world isn't going to change that,''
said GOP strategist Scott Reed, who managed Bob Dole's 1996 campaign which was
damaged by an onslaught of critical Forbes ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican analysts said Bush stood to gain most because Forbes had siphoned
conservative voters from him. McCain may pick up Forbes backers who are tired of
the party establishment, but the impact is probably marginal, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Presumably the advantage goes to Bush, but the truth is (Forbes) doesn't
have enough support in the upcoming primaries to really make a difference,''
said Republican consultant Tony Fabrizio.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, in Michigan for a series of campaign events, canceled Wednesday's
schedule and flew to New Jersey after finalizing his decision and informing
staff, according to two senior advisers who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   He had no immediate plans to endorse Bush or McCain, and supporters said he
still resented efforts by the Texas governor's campaign to undermine his
presidential bid. Bush's campaign hoped to mend fences through intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes, a former ambassador considered to have virtually no chance of
winning the nomination, will be the only other Republican onstage with McCain
and Bush for their South Carolina debate Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes is the seventh Republican to quit the race, all victims to some
extent of Bush's fund-raising prowess.
</P>
<P>
	   One adviser said Forbes made a tentative decision to quit the race over the
weekend, but hoped for a better showing in Delaware to keep him alive in case a
McCain win in South Carolina scrambled the political mix. McCain did not
campaign in Delaware, but finished comfortably ahead of Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes burst on the political scene with a radical flat tax proposal in
1996, but the lack of a grass-roots operation caused his momentum to fizzle
after victories in Delaware and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   He began mounting a 2000 bid almost as soon as the 1996 campaign ended,
shifting to the right on abortion and other social issues in an attempt to rally
social conservatives. He built a political organization, spending hundreds of
thousands of dollars on some of the party's best political talent.
</P>
<P>
	   The conservative base was split by a crowded field of like-minded candidates
such as Keyes, Gary Bauer and Sen. Orrin Hatch. Many conservatives stuck with
Bush, despite Forbes' attempts to dislodge them.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Iowa caucuses last month, Forbes finished a solid second to Bush but
it was his high-water mark. He was a distant third in New Hampshire and has not
been a factor in the upcoming South Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the two campaigns, Forbes spent at least $66 million of his estimated
$440 million personal fortune, which stems from the publishing empire started by
his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, a graduate of Princeton University, lives with his wife Sabina and
their five daughters in New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Foster Parent Sentenced in Molesting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDERSON, Ind. (AP) -- A foster parent who prevented a girl in his care from
being adopted by a gay man was sentenced Wednesday to 40 years in prison for
molesting the girl.
</P>
<P>
	   Earl ``Butch'' Kimmerling pleaded guilty last month to four counts of
molesting his foster daughter, now 9. He and his wife, Saundra, fought in 1998
to keep the girl from being adopted by Craig Peterson -- a gay man who had
adopted the little girl's three brothers.
</P>
<P>
	   At his sentencing, Kimmerling tearfully apologized for molesting the girl
and pleaded for leniency. He could have received up to 50 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors had argued for a harsh sentence. ``It's hypocrisy at its highest
level. He holds himself out to be a person of God, as a representative of the
Christian community, and at the same time engaging in outrageous behavior,''
prosecutor Rodney Cummings said.
</P>
<P>
	   During their adoption fight, the Kimmerlings gained support from various
Indiana political figures, including Anderson Mayor Mark Lawler and a Republican
state representative who unsuccessfully tried to ban gay adoptions.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kimmerlings eventually succeeded in adopting the girl, but Kimmerling
was arrested and charged with molesting her after Saundra Kimmerling notified
police.
</P>
<P>
	   The girl remained in Saundra Kimmerling's care.

<HEADLINE> Vt. Committee Backs Gay Benefits  </HEADLINE>
   By ROSS SNEYD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- A key committee of the Vermont House voted Wednesday
in favor of developing a broad domestic partnership system for gay and lesbian
couples instead of broadening marriage statutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The House Judiciary Committee's vote -- eight for the domestic partnership
system; three for legalizing gay marriage -- decided the focus of the bill.
Committee members began writing it Wednesday and will vote on it later.
</P>
<P>
	   If approved by the legislature and enacted, the proposal would require
Vermont to provide more rights and benefits to gay and lesbian couples than any
other state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a momentous vote,'' Gov. Howard Dean said. ``It's a vote to move
forward and become the first state to really grant equal rights'' to lesbians
and gays.
</P>
<P>
	   Committee Chairman Thomas Little repeatedly said the committee would work on
a civil rights bill, something that would be ``different than, broader than''
domestic partnership plans that have been discussed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Legislature has been grappling with how to respond to a state Supreme
Court ruling that said gay and lesbian couples are being unconstitutionally
denied the rights and benefits that accompany legal marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   The court said the Legislature could rectify that by expanding marriage or
creating a parallel domestic partnership system.
</P>
<P>
	   The first draft of the domestic partnership bill discussed Wednesday would
give gay and lesbian couples all the legal rights and responsibilities
heterosexual married couples receive, including inheritance rights, tax
privileges and the authority to make medical decisions for a partner.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Rep. Michael Kainen of Hartford said many committee members voted
for the domestic partnership system rather than legalizing gay marriage because
they believe it has a better chance of passing.
</P>
<P>
	   The Judiciary Committee has held two public hearings attended by a total of
more than 5,000 people and has heard a month of testimony from religious and
legal experts.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic Rep. William Lippert, the only openly gay member of the committee
or the Legislature, said Wednesday he believed broadening marriage statutes to
include gays and lesbians would be a major move toward ending discrimination. He
voted for legalizing gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I trust whatever next step we take collectively, we take in a continual
step to dismantle institutional discrimination,'' Lippert said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile in California, a ballot measure to deny legal recognition to
same-sex marriages performed in other states is supported by most segments of
the state's population a month before the election, the Field Poll reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   A representative sample of likely voters contacted in the six-day period
that ended Sunday favored Proposition 22 by 52 to 39 percent, with the rest
undecided, the independent polling organization reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll was based on responses from 775 likely voters, and had a margin of
error of 3.6 percentage points.

night as Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio stepped from a limousine for the
star-studded European premiere of his latest movie, "The Beach."
</P>
<P>
	   Admirers gathered 10 deep in places chanting "Leo!" "Leo!" and jostling to

<HEADLINE> House Questions Influence on Shows  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House lawmakers questioned White House and network
officials Wednesday on whether the government violated broadcasters'
independence by offering financial incentives to TV networks that included
anti-drug messages in their shows.
</P>
<P>
	   If the White House's drug policy office was trying to influence program
content, ``I think we have stepped incredibly far and hard on the First
Amendment,'' Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the Commerce subcommittee on
telecommunications, trade and consumer protection, said during a hearing on the
topic.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy denied it was
exerting any influence on the networks, saying it was only trying to spread an
anti-drug message to more young people by letting broadcasters get financial
credits for eligible programming.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've never intruded in the creative process,'' said Dr. Donald Vereen
Jr., deputy director of the drug office. He offered samples of several shows --
including ``Cosby'' -- which qualified for credits because of an anti-drug
message.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrangement stemmed from Congress' 1997 approval of a program to buy
anti-drug ads on TV. Networks were required to match each dollar spent by the
federal government, either with free ads or in other ways, such as demonstrating
that some of their programs convey anti-drug messages.
</P>
<P>
	   At the hearing, ABC presented snippets from programs such as ``The
Practice,'' ``Sports Night'' and ``The Drew Carey Show'' which carried such
anti-drug messages. But network officials asserted they submitted plot summaries
and cassettes only after the shows had aired.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These were stories that producers ... wanted to tell in their shows,''
said Alex Wallau, ABC's president of network administration and operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., questioned if the government was wasting its money
by giving financial credits to networks that had already planned to address
drug-related issues in their programming.
</P>
<P>
	   In May, Wallau said the drug office asked that ABC scripts be submitted in
advance to qualify for credits. The network refused and then negotiated a deal
to match government ads only with its own public service announcements.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin D. Franks, a senior vice president at CBS Corp., said his network
initially did submit some scripts before they were aired, but only to get a
``yes'' or ``no'' answer on whether they were eligible for the credits and ``not
for the purpose of inviting ONDCP edits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At not time have we felt that our creative integrity was being
compromised,'' Franks said.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House drug office recently established new rules to clarify that
the government will not review program episodes for such credits until they have
been aired.
</P>
<P>
	   To ward off perceptions of impropriety, JefLoeb, chairman of Katsin/Loeb
Advertising Inc., suggested that the arrangement with the government be included
in the program credits.

<HEADLINE> Study: Ovarian Cancer Surgery OK  </HEADLINE>
    By DARA AKIKO WILLIAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Women in the first stage of ovarian cancer who undergo a
surgery that allows them to continue having children apparently do not increase
their risk of dying from the disease, according to a study presented Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The study, conducted by researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in New York, examined 127 patients who had surgery after epithelial
ovarian cancer was detected at stage one, meaning it was present in only one
ovary but not in the second ovary or the uterus.
</P>
<P>
	   Ninety-two patients underwent a standard surgery to remove the uterus and
all functioning ovarian tissue, while 16 others had a more limited surgery that
preserved the uterus and at least one ovary.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those who had the more limited surgery, 88 percent lived with no signs
of cancer for a median of seven years after being diagnosed, compared with 77
percent of patients who had the standard surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   Ninety-three percent of those who had the limited surgery had a successful
pregnancy after treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   "By using conservative surgery that preserves functioning ovarian tissue and
the uterus, we found survival rates comparable to the standard surgery," said
Carol Brown, lead author of the study. "That is very reassuring."
</P>
<P>
	   Only 25 percent of women with ovarian cancer have it diagnosed in the
earliest stage, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
	   The study, which has not been published, was presented at the annual meeting
of the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists.
</P>
<P>
	   Maurie Markman, director of the Taussig Cancer Center at the Cleveland
Clinic, cautioned that the women studied had been were treated by specialists
while most women are treated by general surgeons or gynecologists.
</P>
<P>
	   "This in no way should be considered to be standard," he said. "You still
have to tell patients the standard treatment, based upon lots of experience over
several decades, is to remove all of the organs potentially at risk."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Registers Concerns With Russia  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department demanded Wednesday that Russian
officials ``come clean'' about the fate of a journalist missing in Chechnya.
Twenty-one members of Congress demanded his release in a tough letter to Acting
President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian military officials claim to have turned over Radio Liberty reporter
Andrei Babitsky to Chechen rebels last week, but he has not been heard from
since.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said Tuesday that Babitsky was
alive and well. But State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Wednesday the
reporter's disappearance, and incomplete and contradictory explanations by
Russian officials ``have raised the greatest fears as to his fate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials have said Babitsky was turned over to Chechen rebels in
exchange for Russian prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Capitol Hill, 21 members of Congress, led by Rep. Sam Gejdenson,
D-Conn., said such a swap was incomprehensible, one that suggested the reporter
was affiliated with the rebels when, in fact, his reporting had been objective
and fair.
</P>
<P>
	   The House members called on Putin to review the situation promptly and
assist in securing release of the reporter and his return to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the United
States has made its concern over Babitsky known in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty is a U.S. government-funded radio station
started about 50 years ago to spread uncensored news to Soviet-controlled
countries. It now broadcasts in 26 languages.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., wrote Putin, expressing deep concern
about the loss of civilian life in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   While Russia has a right to stop secession and counter terrorism, Wellstone
said, ``this responsibility does not and cannot justify the use of
indiscriminate force against civilians and the displacement of hundreds of
thousands of persons.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright suggested to Putin last week that he permit journalists to report
from Chechnya and allow a humanitarian commission to go to the republic to
assess the needs of civilians there.
</P>
<P>
	   In Moscow, Albright said Putin seemed interested in both proposals. But on
Wednesday she said she had not heard from Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who
normally would be in touch with her about them.
</P>
<P>
	   Once again, Albright insisted on a ``political dialogue'' between Russia and
the secessionists. And she again said the Russians were ``in denial'' in
expecting a military offensive to solve the separatist problem.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Army Breaks Blockade  </HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BAJAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Soldiers backed by helicopter gunships retook a
vital stretch of highway connecting Colombia's two main cities on Wednesday,
breaking an embarrassing four-day rebel blockade and freeing hundreds of
hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   The army reported that one soldier was wounded by a land mine. No other
casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   In a bold gesture of defiance, about 150 rebels of the National Liberation
Army blocked the highway that connects Bogota with Medellin on Saturday. They
shot out the tires of scores of vehicles and detained about 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   Air Force helicopters began buzzing through the area 40 miles east of
Medellin on Tuesday night after guerrillas allowed some older women and children
to leave. Troops were airlifted in after dawn Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In a firefight broadcast live by Colombian television networks, soldiers
fired at withdrawing rebels from behind some of the estimated 500 trucks
blocking a long, winding stretch of road.
</P>
<P>
	   The incident highlighted the increasing danger of road travel in Colombia.
Leftist rebels, who control about half the countryside, frequently mount
roadblocks and kidnap affluent residents.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Liberation Army -- the country's second-largest rebel band with
an estimated 5,000 fighters -- has waged a devastating sabotage campaign in
recent weeks, dynamiting oil pipelines and power pylons and forcing electricity
rationing for hundreds of thousands of Colombians.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebel band is demanding that President Andres Pastrana's government
withdraw troops from a 2,300-square-mile area in the northern state of Bolivar
as a condition for opening peace talks. The area is a traditional National
Liberation Army bastion.

<HEADLINE> Archbishop Speaks on Elian Case  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GUTKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba's Roman Catholic leader said Wednesday that some Cubans
are using the campaign to bring 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez back from the United
States as a pretense to attack the church.
</P>
<P>
	   The nun who offered her home for a meeting between the little boy and his
grandmothers in Florida has been maligned, Cardinal Jaime Ortega insisted,
though he said she is wrong to think Elian should stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Ortega, the archbishop of Havana and the only cardinal on the communist
island, said passions surrounding the case have spun out of control. He said
they may be unleashing ``prejudices and dark feelings'' against the church.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was rescued off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25, clinging to an inner
tube, after a boat wreck that killed his mother and 10 other people.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's relatives and other Cuban exiles in Miami want to keep him in the
United States, saying his mother died to give him freedom. But Cuba's government
is staging a massive campaign to have the boy returned to his father in Cuba,
plastering the walls of major cities with ``Save Elian'' posters and holding
daily rallies with rousing speeches, choir performances and poetry readings.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Elian's Cuban grandmothers went to the United States in an
effort to bring Elian back. While they were there, Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, the
president of Barry University, hosted a meeting between Elian and his
grandmothers in Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
	   After the meeting, O'Laughlin said she was giving up her previously
announced neutrality and felt the boy should remain in the United States. Since
then, she has been criticized by Cuba's media.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement released Wednesday, Ortega expressed concern about the
derogatory references to O'Laughlin that appear daily in the local media and
about criticism of the pope for not pressing for Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Laughlin may be misguided but is not the ``devil'' portrayed in Cuban
media, Ortega said.
</P>
<P>
	   He denounced ``repeated references in the media to the sexual conduct of
priests in the United States and statistics about clergyman sick with AIDS.'' He
said he hoped the anti-Catholic references in the Elian case were from
``sharpshooters pointing at any place'' instead of an orchestrated government
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Relations between the church and the Cuban state have warmed in recent
years. Fidel Castro's government abandoned officially mandated atheism in the
early 1990s and received Pope John Paul II in a historic visit in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Cuban rallies continued Wednesday. Castro and Elian's
grandparents joined hundreds of people -- most of them children -- at the
imposing Fortress of San Carlos de Cabana to demonstrate in favor of the boy's
repatriation. With the towering stone walls as a backdrop, costumed members of a
children's drama group sang songs, read poems and performed skits dedicated to
Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian is currently staying with his Miami relatives. The U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service has ruled in favor of his return to Cuba, but Elian's
U.S. relatives are challenging that decision in a Miami court.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Air Inspecting Fleet  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM VERDIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Alaska Airlines said it was inspecting its fleet of
MD-80 jetliners Wednesday for damage to a key part in the tail system that may
have played a crucial role in the crash of Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
	   The component, called a jackscrew, drives the horizontal stabilizer, which
has become the focus of the investigation into the Jan. 31 crash that killed 88
people off the coast of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
	   A two-foot section of the screw was recovered with the main wreckage of the
MD-83 about 10 miles off the coast, and the airline said it had been stripped.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It appeared to investigators who looked at the mechanism ... that there
was some damage to it,'' National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall
said. ``It was unclear whether the damage was pre-impact or from hitting the
water.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska said it would inspect all 34 of its MD-80 series planes as a
precaution. The inspections were expected to be completed by the end of
Wednesday and were not expected to cause significant service delays.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 1,100 MD-80 aircraft are flown by nearly 70 airlines worldwide,
making it one of the most popular commercial jetliners ever built.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Aviation Administration has not told airline companies to make
additional checks of the tail section of MD-80 series aircraft, but that could
change as the investigation evolves, agency spokesman Paul Turk said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the continuing education of the accident reveals any threat to the
safety of flight, we won't hesitate to do whatever is necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators in the Alaska Airlines crash are focusing on the stabilizer, a
wing-like device on the jet's tail, because pilots reported problems with it
after taking off from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, for San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   The jackscrew is powered by two motors and resembles the corkscrew-like
device that opens many automatic garage doors. If the jackscrew was damaged
during flight, the horizontal stabilizer could move beyond its normal range,
causing the tail wing to stall, or lose its lift, said William Waldock,
associate director for the Center for Aerospace Safety Education at Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
	   It would be nearly impossible to recover from such a stall, Waldock said.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilots would not be able to control the up-or-down motion of the
aircraft -- which would be consistent with flight data that shows the plane went
into a 3.4-mile nosedive and radar tracking that shows something may have fallen
off the plane as the dive began.
</P>
<P>
	   The stabilizer moves up and down as a nut rides the jackscrew back and
forth, explained aviation analyst John Nance of Tacoma, Wash. It was unknown
whether the NTSB recovered the nut.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The system somehow came apart, separated or whatever and the stabilizer
was free to flip up into the wind at a very severe angle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You put something like that directly into the wind at such an angle and
it's going to fail. In the process of failing, instead of just coming off the
airplane, it pulled the tail up and pulled the nose down,'' Nance said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane's autopilot was disengaged when the jetliner reached 29,000 feet.
The jet was flown manually for one hour and 53 minutes. Pilots say it is unusual
to fly manually for that long and could suggest a problem with the autopilot or
any number of other systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said the MD-83 involved in the crash had two maintenance write-ups
last fall for problems with the horizontal stabilizer. In October, the system
was checked and the plane returned to service. A month later, mechanics replaced
a switch.

<HEADLINE> Investors Agree To Bail Out Iridium  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SEATTLE (AP) -- A group of investors led by billionaire Craig McCaw agreed
to help bail out Iridium LLC, the financially ailing satellite
telecommunications provider.
</P>
<P>
	   McCaw's group, Eagle River Investments, will provide $74.6 million in
debtor-in-possession financing. That gives Iridium more than enough money to
operate beyond Feb. 15, when its primary investor, Motorola Inc., has said it
would stop carrying the company.
</P>
<P>
	   If the McCaw plan is approved in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Iridium should be
able to operate through mid-year while it prepares a restructuring plan.
</P>
<P>
	   McCaw's group now has the option of an outright purchase of Iridium's
assets. Iridium operates a constellation of 66 satellites and provides worldwide
satellite telephone service.
</P>
<P>
	   The company filed for bankruptcy protection in August after failing to
develop a market for its hand-held satellite phones. Analysts at the time said
the price of the service -- $3,500 phones and $9-per-minute rates -- was too
steep to allow the kind of broad use needed to make Iridium profitable.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time it filed for Chapter 11 reorganization, the company had 15,000
customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Iridium has $4.4 billion in debt, mostly from expensive satellite
development and rocket launches. It was de-listed from the Nasdaq Stock Exchange
in November, its share price falling to below $3 from a high of $70. The company
said Wednesday that it did not expect its shares to retain any worth after
bankruptcy reorganization is completed.
</P>
<P>
	   McCaw, who made his fortune in cellular communications and cable television
systems, has also promised to round up $1.2 billion to help London-based ICO
Global Communications, another financially troubled satellite communications
company. With new investors, led by McCaw's group, the company could have its
debts cleared and its service up and running by this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   McCaw is chairman of Teledesic LLC, which is building its own network of
satellites to provide wireless high-speed Internet access from anywhere on the
globe. The Teledesic system is expected to be operational in 2004. Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates is a Teledesic investor.
</P>
<P>
	   McCaw's group would not comment on whether Iridium's assets might make their
way to ICO or Teledesic.

<HEADLINE> Father Bush Campaigns for Son  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM SUHR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LIVONIA, Mich. (AP) -- On behalf of the son seeking to follow in his
footsteps, former President Bush accepted endorsements Wednesday from Michigan
law enforcement groups.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a powerful endorsement,'' he said at Livonia City Hall, where he
accepted for his son -- George W. Bush -- the backing of the Police Officers
Association of Michigan, the state's Deputy Sheriff's Association and the
Michigan Fraternal Order of Police.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope it rings out through this state. I hope the folks in South Carolina
hear it; as you know, we're engaged in hand-to-hand combat down there,'' the
elder Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina's GOP primary is Feb. 19, three days before Michigan's.
</P>
<P>
	   A Detroit Free Press/WXYZ-TV poll released Wednesday showed Bush and Sen.
John McCain of Arizona -- Bush's chief rival -- in a virtual dead heat in the
Michigan race.
</P>
<P>
	   While Dad was in Michigan, mom -- former first lady Barbara Bush -- made
appearances in Virginia. In Charlottesville, she spoke only sparingly about her
son in an address to about 1,000 high school and college students participating
in the Youth Leadership Initiative.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I didn't come here to campaign for George W. Bush,'' she said. ``I figure
you already knew who I was for. I hope that by the time you get through studying
all the candidates and their positions on the issues that you will agree with
me.''
</P>
<P>
	   During the gathering in this Detroit suburb, which was heavily attended by
police officials, the former president said the endorsement ``says a lot'' about
George W.'s commitment to police issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can say this with parental pride: He won't let you down,'' said the
elder Bush, who also was appearing Wednesday in Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids
before returning to Texas in the evening.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Deacon Denies Assaulting Teen  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
	   LIVINGSTON, Ala. (AP) -- A man accused of assaulting a teen-ager at a west
Alabama commune pleaded innocent Wednesday as the victim's family raised new
questions about a 1998 fire that killed four children at the compound.
</P>
<P>
	   Albert Lee Roberts, in a written plea, denied a misdemeanor charge. The
boy's mother, Geraldine Wilson, made complaints that prompted a state review of
conditions at the religious compound, known as the Holyland.
</P>
<P>
	   A judge set a March 13 trial date for Roberts, 48, described by authorities
as a deacon at the Pentecostal commune, home to dozens of children and adults.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Holyland resident Derrick Wilson, 13, said in an interview that
Roberts knocked him to the ground, choked him and struck him 20 times with a
paddle for pushing a boy who was picking on a female cousin.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts' attorney, Walter Griess, was not in court and did not immediately

	   Critics allege widespread abuse of children and the exploitation of poor
blacks at the Holyland. Holyland founder Luke Edwards, himself black, contends
his foes are jealous of his success.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside court, Ms. Wilson and her 15-year-old son, Jeffery, claimed in an
interview that Edwards predicted at least two blazes that occurred at the
compound. Four children died when flames swept through a wood-frame dormitory in
November 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   State investigators ruled the deadly blaze an accident started by an
electric lamp placed too near a bed, which caught fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeffery Wilson, who said he was living at the Holyland at the time of the
fatal blaze, said Edwards repeatedly predicted the girl's dorm would be
destroyed and that children would die.
</P>
<P>
	   After questioning the Wilsons about the fires Wednesday, the Sumter County
sheriff's office contacted the fire marshal's office, which sent an investigator
to talk with the family.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerry Brown, a Holyland spokesman, defended it in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any time a person stumps his toe at the Holyland, it's automatically going
to be local, state, national and international news,'' said Brown.
</P>
<P>
	   As for Edwards predicting the fires, he said, ``I haven't heard him make
those predictions. I did hear him say one time that he had dreamed of a fire.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Demands Aid Worker Protections  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations is demanding better protection for
its aid workers and justice from the countries where 184 civilian staffers have
been killed since 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   World Food Program director Catherine Bertini called for penalties against
governments that fail to investigate or prosecute crimes against humanitarian
workers. She made her plea at an open session of the Security Council on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bertini demanded more money from U.N. member states to protect and train
U.N. civilian staff, who -- unlike peacekeepers -- receive little or no security
training and carry no arms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to confront the simple fact that the United Nations sends unarmed
aid workers into environments where member governments will not send their own
armed troops,'' Bertini said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the killings, there have been 59 incidents of kidnapping or
hostage-taking of U.N. civilian personnel in the last six years. That includes
four people currently detained on a WFP-leased airplane in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   In a prepared statement unanimously adopted at the end of its meeting, the
council condemned such attacks. It welcomed the fact that violence against aid
workers was defined as a war crime in the treaty establishing the International
Criminal Court, which has yet to go into force.
</P>
<P>
	   Only two people have ever been convicted of killing a U.N. worker.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Such impunity must not be allowed to persist, as it only further
undermines field staff security,'' Canadian Ambassador Robert Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, aid workers have more and more often become targets of
wars, and not just the innocent victims of stray gunfire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Warring factions sometimes see the delivery of food aid itself as a
political act and those who deliver it are seen as targets,'' Bertini said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the council has little ability to force governments to prosecute the
crimes -- often because the suspects are the very rebels who are fighting the
governments.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy U.N. Secretary-General Louise Frechette said members could make a
difference by giving more money to U.N. security training programs and
increasing the size of the U.N. security coordinator's office, which has no
full-time chief and a budget of just $537,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Security is not a luxury,'' Frechette told the council. ``Security is
something we owe the troops and civilians who volunteer to serve in faraway
places under the most challenging of circumstances.''

<HEADLINE> Officials Regain Mexican University  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The head of Latin America's largest university finally
reached his office on Wednesday -- nearly three months after he took the job
during a bitter student strike.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to soothe all the wounds,'' Juan Ramon de la Fuente said as he
made his first visit to the massive campus since federal police cleared it of
strikers with a police raid on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said classes, suspended since April, could begin within days at
the National Autonomous University, a 270,000-student Goliath of a school that
is the center of Mexican academic life.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Fuente promised reconciliation and a ``great reform,'' but he faces a
university still bitterly divided by the strike and by the police raid used to
end it. His predecessor resigned in November due to inability to end the strike.
</P>
<P>
	   Even many academics who opposed the strike saw Sunday's police raid as a
violation of the school's jealously guarded autonomy and as a betrayal of
administration promises to negotiate an end to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the arrest of many leaders, the strike committee was continuing to
meet this week at other universities in Mexico City and was calling for students
to boycott classes until all of the detained strikers are freed.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 15,000 people marched Wednesday afternoon through the heart of
Mexico City, demanding the release of the strikers who are still in custody.
</P>
<P>
	   Courts and prosecutors have freed most of the nearly 800 people rounded up
on the campus on Sunday, but at least 89 adults and a few juveniles arrested
were still being held on various charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Another 175 strike supporters also face charges stemming from a Jan. 26
clash with police at one of the university-affiliated high schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Barricades of broken concrete, chairs and debris which had blocked the
campus for months were cleared away as dawn broke Wednesday and administrators
and students toured buildings long denied to them.
</P>
<P>
	   At the philosophy building, they found files scattered on the floors of
offices and revolutionary murals painted on the walls. The law and economy
buildings seemed almost untouched.
</P>
<P>
	   Students struck in April over university efforts to increase a minimal
tuition to about $140 a year and to demand greater student control.
</P>
<P>
	   While the administration backed down on tuition, radical leaders of the
strike insisted on full compliance with a list of other demands, portraying
their strike as a struggle against global free-market economic policies they
claimed would exclude the poor from education.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Jets Hit S. Lebanon Again  </HEADLINE>
   By HUSSEIN DAKROUB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israel staged airstrikes on suspected hideouts of
Lebanese guerrillas Wednesday and warned it would set Lebanon on fire if the
militants retaliated with rockets.
</P>
<P>
	   Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss shrugged off the warning by Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy, who said that if guerrilla rockets hit Israeli
towns, ``the soil of Lebanon will burn.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hoss said Levy's threats were part of Israel's ``terrorism'' against
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In making these threats, he reminds us of the genocide mentality that
characterized Nazism in Hitler's time,'' Hoss said. He added that since the
guerrillas were responding to Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon, ``we say
that the solution, simply, would be to terminate the Israeli occupation.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 11th straight day of Israeli strikes, following raids on Lebanese power
stations and guerrilla bases, drew further condemnation from Arab states and
pushed back the chance of resuming the peace talks between Israel and Syria that
were suspended indefinitely last month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This aggression exposes the true intentions of the Israelis towards the
peace process,'' Jordanian legislators said in a statement Wednesday. Saudi
Arabia's government said the attacks constituted ``the biggest damage to the
Middle East peace process.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli jets fired 12 missiles at three suspected guerrilla positions in
Jabal al Daher, outside the town of Nabatiyeh and on nearby Wadi al-Hojair,
Lebanese security officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli jets fired 18 missiles in three daytime and three nighttime raids
Wednesday at guerrilla hideouts or launch sites for rockets along a 12-mile
stretch of south Lebanon, the security officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman confirmed the airstrikes, which came
after a guerrilla rocket attack on a military post in the Israeli-occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah said in a statement that on Wednesday afternoon its fighters
attacked Israeli and allied militia positions at Sheer Azour, near Jezzine, and
Arnoun in the occupied zone, ``scoring direct hits.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lebanese security officials said they had not heard of these attacks. They
said that pro-Israeli militiamen discovered and detonated some guerrilla bombs
along a road in the zone.
</P>
<P>
	   Levy made it quite clear what would happen if Hezbollah retaliated in its
usual way for Israeli attacks on civilian targets in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If ... Katyushas (rockets) fall on our settlements, the soil of Lebanon
will burn,'' Levy said. ``Let everyone hear: vital interests of Lebanon will go
up in flames and it will take many years to restore them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah appeared to be refraining from attacks on Israeli villages and
continuing to attack Israeli soldiers and their militia allies. On Tuesday, its
guerrillas fired a missile that killed an Israeli soldier there, the sixth
Israeli casualty in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel struck Lebanese power stations Monday to retaliate for what it called
Hezbollah's ``severe escalation'' of hostilities. On Tuesday, its warplanes
attacked a Hezbollah office in the southern port of Tyre and a village in a
southern guerrilla stronghold. The raids wounded 15 civilians and plunged many
parts of Lebanon into darkness.
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah is fighting to evict Israel from Lebanon where it occupies about
10 percent of the country, policing the zone with 1,500 soldiers and 2,500
allied militiamen.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel accuses Hezbollah of attacking from Lebanese villages, a violation of
an 1996 understanding that civilian areas should not be used in the fighting.
Lebanon accuses Israel of violating the accord.
</P>
<P>
	   A committee of U.S., French, Lebanese, Israeli and Syrian monitors have
found both Israel and Lebanon in violation of the understanding.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, soon after launching the first wave of strikes, Israel said it
will no longer honor the understanding.

<HEADLINE> News Corp. Earnings Slide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- News Corp., the media conglomerate controlled by Rupert
Murdoch, reported an overall decline in quarterly earnings Wednesday despite
upturns in its television and newspaper businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   News Corp. earned $252 million in the three months ended in December, down
from $339 million in the same period last year. Earnings per U.S.-listed share
fell to 25 cents from 34 cents, meeting the forecasts of analysts surveyed by
First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues fell to $3.86 billion from $4.06 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Profits from the company's movie business were down sharply from the year
before, when earnings got a big boost from the video release of "Titanic" and
the theatrical release of "There's Something About Mary." The company also
booked losses in the most recent period from "Light it Up" and "Anna and the
King."
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings during News Corp.'s second fiscal quarter were also impacted by the
loss of revenues from TV Guide magazine, which the company sold a year ago to
United Video.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite lower ratings at the Fox TV network and higher programming costs,
broadcasting earnings also rose on the back of strong advertising sales.
Earnings at television stations owned outright by the company also improved.
</P>
<P>
	   News Corp. also reported strong results in its major newspaper markets
thanks to an upturn in ad revenues. The company owns several major newspapers in
Australia, its home base, as well as in England. It also owns the New York Post
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Profits were also higher in the company's book publishing division, which
last year acquired the William Morrow and Avon Books imprints from Hearst Corp.
Without the new acquisitions, revenues from book publishing, which includes
HarperCollins Publishers, grew 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Diallo Witness Backfires on Defense  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The first eyewitness to take the stand in the Amadou
Diallo murder case backfired on the defense Wednesday when she testified that
police officers continued to shoot the unarmed black man after he had fallen to
the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys had called Schrrie Elliott to the stand, hoping her
testimony would support the officers' contention they believed Diallo had pulled
a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   But on cross-examination, Elliott said that she watched from across the
street as four plainclothes New York City police officers cornered Diallo and
opened fire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They continued shooting while (Diallo) was down?'' asked prosecutor Donald
Levin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes,'' Elliott replied, breaking into tears.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott said she saw the shooting as she walked home from the subway after
midnight in the Bronx last February. She described the officers jumping out of a
car with their guns drawn, forming a semi-circle on the sidewalk outside
Diallo's door and opening fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The testimony prompted defense attorneys to ask Justice Joseph Teresi to
declare Elliott a hostile witness. The judge agreed to let them cross-examine
her about her account on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi also was to rule Thursday morning on whether the defense could show
the jury a television news interview it says proves that Elliott has given
conflicting accounts of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not done with this witness,'' defense attorney Stephen Worth said
outside court. Elliott's attorney, Kevin Fee, refused comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott emerged as the trial's first eyewitness to the shooting after the
defense subpoenaed her to testify on behalf of Officers Kenneth Boss, 28, Sean
Carroll, 36, Edward McMellon, 27, and Richard Murphy, 27.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers, all white, are charged with murder and could get 25 years to
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The slaying of the black West African immigrant in a barrage of 41 bullets
touched off protests against police brutality. An appeals court ordered the case
moved to Albany, 150 miles from New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense claims that Diallo refused orders to halt, then pulled out a
black wallet that appeared to be a gun. It also argues the officers'
high-powered pistols fired fast enough for Diallo to stay on his feet, possibly
up against a wall, throughout the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear why prosecutors had not used Elliott as their own witness.
The defense -- after seeing videotape of her being interviewed by a TV reporter
-- called her to testify she heard one of the officers yell, ``Gun!'' before the
shooting began.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott spoke softly and repeatedly sighed under questioning by defense
attorney Stephen Worth. She said she knew the four men she spotted on Diallo's
block were plainclothes officers because ``I've had past dealings with the
law.'' She did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Levin used his cross-examination to ask Elliott a rapid progression of
questions detailing a damaging version of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman claimed she had a clear view from across the street of Diallo as
he stood with his back to the officers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Did you hear anyone yell, `Stop' or `Freeze' or `Show your hands'?'' Levin
asked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No,'' Elliott replied.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You don't know who said, `Gun,' do you?'' the prosecutor asked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Worth later went on the attack, sarcastically asking Elliott, ``The police
shot Mr. Diallo for no good reason?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes,'' Elliott replied.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Complains of Senate Delays  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   McALLEN, Texas (AP) -- President Clinton renewed his criticism Wednesday of
senators who have delayed decisions on his judicial nominees, implying that
their inaction was linked to the minority backgrounds of several appointees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the things that continues to bother me in my efforts to build one
America is the problem that I continue to have in the United States Senate in
getting judges confirmed,'' Clinton said, ``particularly judges who come from
diverse backgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president spoke at a $5,000-a-plate Democratic National Committee
fund-raising event in McAllen, the first of three fund-raising stops in Texas on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Senate Republicans have raised objections to the views of some
candidates for the bench, while others have placed holds on nominations in
response to disputes with the administration on unrelated matters.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans have promised Clinton a vote on two of his judicial nominees --
Richard Paez, a Mexican-American federal judge in Los Angeles, and San Francisco
labor lawyer Marsha Berson -- before the Senate takes a recess March 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, this week
reiterated that promise by Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., while
acknowledging a threat by Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., to attempt to block action
on any of Clinton's nominees.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to Inhofe conceded that Lott's promise will probably prevail regarding
Paez and Berson. Inhofe vowed last month to try to block all of Clinton's
nominees until the president leaves office, claiming the White House violated an
agreement limiting recess appointments while Congress was not in session.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch said nearly 40 percent of the active federal judges in the country
were appointed by Clinton and confirmed with the support of Republicans in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In 1999, over 50 percent of the nominees that the Judiciary Committee
reported to the full Senate were women and minorities,'' Hatch said. ``But if
the nominee is a judicial activist or is for some other reason unqualified to
serve for a lifetime appointment on the federal bench, that nominee should not
and will not have the support of the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to a recent count by Senate Democrats, there are 73 openings in
the federal judiciary. Clinton has 35 nominations pending in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief Justice William Rehnquist has complained of severe backlogs in the
federal court system. Last year, 33 new judges were confirmed, down from 65 in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton specifically referred to two Hispanic men he has nominated to the
federal bench, Enrique Moreno of El Paso, Texas, for the Fifth Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals, and Julio Fuentes for the Third Circuit, which is
headquartered in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   While he conceded that politics often intrudes in the appointment process
when the Senate is controlled by one party and the president belongs to another,
Clinton argued that his appointees have been subjected to unreasonable delays.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There has never been an example like what we've seen of the deliberate
slow walk and refusal to have hearings, refusal to vote up or down on judges,''
Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Communist Urges Russian Reforms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov pledged
Wednesday to rewrite the constitution and renationalize Russia's banks, oil
fields and energy utilities if he is elected president.
</P>
<P>
	   Zyuganov finished second against Boris Yeltsin in 1996 and is the top
challenger to acting President Vladimir Putin in Russia's March 26 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
	   But polls give him little chance of defeating Putin, whose popularity has
been bolstered by his tough handling of the military offensive in Chechnya and
his image as a man of action.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference Wednesday, Zyuganov said Russians could either choose
leaders associated with Yeltsin or get a fresh start with the Communists.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Russia is to choose now with whom it will walk into the 21st century: with
Yeltsin's heirs ... or will Russia choose those who will once and for all do
away with the shameful legacy of Yeltsinism and lead Russia to national revival
and greatness?'' Zyuganov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Zyuganov's formula for restoring Russia includes bringing back state control
over natural resources, the fuel and energy sectors, banks and insurance
companies, plus a state monopoly on the sale of alcohol, Interfax reported. He
also said property ``stolen during savage privatization must be returned to
citizens and the state.''
</P>
<P>
	   Zyuganov has been a leading critic of Russia's post-Soviet privatization
drive, during which scores of valuable state-controlled enterprises were sold
off for prices far below their market worth.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he would rewrite the Russian Constitution to redistribute power
between the legislative and the executive offices, but gave few details.
Russia's current constitution gives the president enormous powers.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin, meanwhile, said he supported free-market reforms and might bring the
architect of Russia's privatization program, Anatoly Chubais, back into the
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People with pro-market, liberal views will be needed,'' Putin said in a
question-and-answer session with readers of the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Chubais is detested by many Russians for his role in the privatization
program, which enriched a few insiders while impoverishing millions of ordinary
citizens. He now heads Unified Energy Systems, a state-owned electricity
monopoly.

<HEADLINE> Ventura May Leave Reform Party  </HEADLINE>
   By ROCHELLE OLSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura and at least one of his top
advisers are considering breaking away from the national Reform Party, which has
been rocked by infighting for months, party officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If things continue on the path that they are, I don't think it's a matter
of if, it's a matter of when,'' Minnesota planning agency director Dean Barkley,
the Ventura adviser, said of leaving the party. ``It comes to a point you can't
spend all your time fighting with a group that doesn't like you because it
detracts from what you're trying to do here in the state.''
</P>
<P>
	   Barkley said he would leave the party if national Chairman Jack Gargan, who
was installed with Ventura's backing, is removed at a dissidents' national
committee meeting Saturday in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
	   A Reform Party official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Ventura has
told associates he is considering leaving the party. Ventura scheduled a news
conference Friday to discuss a political matter. Neither he nor aides would say
more.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've scheduled a news conference for 1 p.m. on Friday and we'll deal with
that issue at that time,'' Ventura said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Barkley has been a leader in the Minnesota Reform Party, recruiting Ventura
to run for governor. He and others have frequently been at odds with what they
view as a top-down management style by party founder Ross Perot and his
supporters, who arranged the Nashville showdown.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent months the party has been split between the Perot and Ventura
factions. Perot supporters favor Pat Buchanan as a presidential candidate and
want the national convention in Long Beach, Calif. Ventura supporters favor New
York developer Donald Trump and a convention here.
</P>
<P>
	   Barkley said he had spoken with Minnesota state Chairman Rick McCluhan and
Ventura about breaking away from the national party for several months. Barkley
blames the turmoil in the national organization for the state party's inability
to recruit top defectors from the Democratic or Republican parties.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't want to be a part of it (the national party) because what it's
going to do is take down the state Reform Party with it. If you see the horses
running toward the cliff, you want to disengage the stage coach,'' Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaving the national party would be difficult. Phil Madsen, director of
Ventura's political operation, said members belong to state parties, not the
national party.

<P>
	   The state party couldn't break from the national party unless delegates
voted to do so at the state convention this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Gargan of Cedar Key, Fla., said he had not heard that Ventura would be
leaving and he doesn't put any stock in anything that happens Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a non-meeting so even if they did remove me, it doesn't mean
anything. It was not properly called, it's not going to be properly
credentialed,'' said Gargan, who has called an emergency convention in March in
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice Chairman Gerry Moan of Tucson, Ariz., views Gargan as the problem and
will push for his removal Saturday, but believes it's far from guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want this thing to stop Saturday, regardless of the outcome,'' Moan
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gargan isn't tired of fighting yet, but the day may come.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'll go down fighting. I'll go down swinging. I'm not just going to walk
away from it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Joust Over Schools  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Democratic rivals Al Gore and Bill Bradley offered dueling
education packages Wednesday, with Bradley proposing help for distressed public
schools and arguing that Gore's tenure in office has seen ``educational
malpractice'' in many schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said Bradley was coming to the issue too late and proposing too little.
He touted his own plan to help parents who set aside money to send their
children to college.
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing Democratic primary voters put education at the top of
their priority list, both sought the high ground.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Quality education is a fundamental Democratic principle and it is one of
the crucial issues at stake in this election,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   His proposal would double federal money for distressed schools, to $16
billion, and also allow parents to choose different public schools if their own
don't measure up.
</P>
<P>
	   It also would set aside $500 million for charter schools, boost standards
for teachers and create ``report cards'' for schools to help parents decide
where to send their youngsters.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bradley announced his plan at a St. Louis school, Gore headed to a
child development center in Michigan to propose an expansion of the savings
program that allows parents to set aside money for college.
</P>
<P>
	   Those parents can currently put money in an education savings account,
deferring taxes as long as the money is used for college expenses. Gore would
index those accounts to take out the effects of inflation and also would ensure
the money could be used across state lines.
</P>
<P>
	   At the child care center, Gore squeezed into a tiny seat near the pet
turtles, pet cockroach and pet worms and snacked on carrots and broccoli with
preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
	   But there was a cutting edge to his comments about his opponent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fourteen months have passed in this presidential campaign and three states
have had elections now, and only today, for the first time in 14 months has
Senator Bradley made his first speech on education.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is late to the issue, having spent the money and now, based upon what
I've heard, he still does not propose universal preschool or new help for
college tuition,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bradley argued he was offering the most sweeping education plan of the
campaign, and he dismissed Gore's claim of focusing on schools.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Vice President Gore says education is his top priority, but he spends more
new money on defense than on improving schools,'' he said. ``Parents know the
last seven years have been long on promises and short on progress.''
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest proposal Bradley offered would be to build up some of the worst
schools. While the bulk of school funding is state and local, Bradley aides said
that up to 30 percent of the money for schools in low-income areas comes from
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, those schools would be graded on their performance, and
parents would be allowed to move their children from schools not performing
well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Children who attend failing schools must not be trapped there,'' Bradley
said. ``We have separate but unequal in the quality of education in America.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also said he would boost standards for teachers, requiring them to
hold a college major in the area they teach, or pass a competency test.
</P>
<P>
	   ``During the past seven years, we've heard a lot of talk about education,
but too often the rhetoric hasn't been backed up by action,'' said Bradley. ``In
far too many schools in this country, there is what amounts to educational
malpractice.''
</P>
<P>
	   There's plenty of room for controversy in Bradley's package, because he said
he would demand more of the nation's teachers, pointing to studies saying
thousands are unqualified.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Warm bodies are just not good enough for our children,'' said Bradley. ``I
will set aside money for schools to give teachers signing bonuses and merit
bonuses for outstanding performances.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said his proposal would reshape federal education policy by not only
increasing funding but demanding that schools demonstrate performance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To strengthen public education, we must hold failing schools accountable
and give parents some real choices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Wednesday, Gore spoke at an Ohio AFL-CIO dinner in Dayton and asked
union members to help him in the state's March 7 primary. Although he pocketed
the labor federation's endorsement last fall, Gore said he knows he must reach
out to the rank and file to ``make them feel like yes, my local leader or
international president or the AFL-CIO president is telling me the right thing
here.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm going to do my part. I just believe that it's common sense and I think
that one of the keys is communicating in a meat and potatoes way without a lot
of fancy language,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Air Inspecting Fleet  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM VERDIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Alaska Airlines and American Airlines ordered
inspections of their MD-80 airplanes Wednesday after investigators recovered a
section of the tail assembly in the wreckage of Alaska's Flight 261 and found it
to be damaged.
</P>
<P>
	   The airlines said they wanted to check a component called a jackscrew. It
drives the horizontal stabilizer, which is the focus of the investigation into
the Jan. 31 crash that killed 88 people off the coast of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
	   A two-foot section of the screw was recovered with the main wreckage of the
MD-83 about 10 miles off the coast. At first Alaska said Wednesday the jackscrew
was found to be stripped, but later the airline changed its statement and said
only that the screw had been damaged, reflecting the description by the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It appeared to investigators who looked at the mechanism ... that there
was some damage to it,'' NTSB Chairman James Hall said. ``It was unclear whether
the damage was pre-impact or from hitting the water.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska said it would inspect all 34 of its MD-80 series planes as a
precaution. The inspections were expected to be completed by the end of
Wednesday and were not expected to cause significant service delays.
</P>
<P>
	   American said it would take a week to complete inspections on its 284 MD-80s
and MD-90s.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This voluntary inspection should alleviate public concerns following the
Alaska Airlines accident,'' American Vice Chairman Bob Baker said.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 1,100 MD-80 series aircraft are flown by nearly 70 airlines
worldwide, making them some of the most popular commercial jetliners ever built.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Aviation Administration has not told airlines to make additional
checks of the tail section of MD-80 series aircraft, but that could change as
the investigation evolves, agency spokesman Paul Turk said. ``We won't hesitate
to do whatever is necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators in the Alaska Airlines crash are focusing on the stabilizer, a
wing-like device on the jet's tail, because pilots reported problems with it
after taking off from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, for San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   The jackscrew is powered by two motors and resembles the corkscrew-like
device that opens many automatic garage doors. If the jackscrew was damaged
during flight, the horizontal stabilizer could move beyond its normal range,
causing the tail wing to stall, or lose its lift, said William Waldock,
associate director for the Center for Aerospace Safety Education at Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
	   It would be nearly impossible to recover from such a stall, Waldock said.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilots would not be able to control the up-or-down motion of the
aircraft -- which would be consistent with flight data that shows the plane went
into a 3.4-mile nosedive and radar tracking that shows something may have fallen
off the plane as the dive began.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane's autopilot was disengaged when the jetliner reached 29,000 feet,
and the jet was flown manually for one hour and 53 minutes. Pilots say it is
unusual to fly manually for that long and could suggest a problem with the
autopilot or any number of other systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said the MD-83 involved in the crash had two maintenance write-ups
last fall for problems with the horizontal stabilizer. In October, the system
was checked and the plane returned to service. A month later, mechanics replaced
a switch.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Great-Uncles Have Had DUIs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Two of Elian Gonzalez's great-uncles, who are among those
fighting to keep the boy from being returned to his father in Cuba, have been
convicted of driving under the influence at least twice in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
	   State records show Lazaro Gonzalez, 49, with whom Elian has been living in
Miami, was found guilty of driving under the influence at least twice from 1991
to 1997. His license has been revoked or suspended at times, records show.
</P>
<P>
	   Records show his 62-year-old brother, Delfin Gonzalez, also has been found
guilty at least twice of driving under the influence. Delfin Gonzalez lives in
Marathon but has been residing at his brother's home.
</P>
<P>
	   The convictions may make it more difficult for Elian's relatives in Miami to
argue that they can offer Elian a better life than his father in Cuba, experts
on child custody law said.
</P>
<P>
	   Spencer Eig, an attorney representing Lazaro Gonzalez in his effort to keep
Elian from being returned to Cuba, told The New York Times in a story published
Wednesday that the great-uncles' driving convictions are less troubling than
comments by one of Elian's grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
	   In a recent interview on Cuban television, Elian's paternal grandmother,
Mariela Quintana, said she had ``played jokes'' with the boy during a meeting
Jan. 26 at the home of a Roman Catholic nun in Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Quintana said she bit Elian's tongue to get him to talk and unzipped his
pants.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly, said Wednesday that
it was not in Elian's best interests to remain with the Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``According to my research, practically everyone surrounding him either has
been, or may be in the future, joining the prison system in the U.S.,'' he said.
``That's an additional reason, as if more reasons were needed, to immediately
place the boy in a safer place.''
</P>
<P>
	   Two other relatives who have been periodic visitors at the Miami home have
had run-ins with the law.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Cid, 32, a nephew of Lazaro Gonzalez, went to jail last month on a
13-year sentence for grand theft, forgery and violating probation, according to
the Miami-Dade Department of Corrections. His twin brother, Luis Cid, goes on
trial Feb. 18 on charges relating to a robbery last fall.

<HEADLINE> Bush Begins New Campaign Strategy  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- The hallmark of the old Bush campaign appearance
was the handshaking marathon at the end. Now, it's the lengthy
question-and-answer session on subjects from guns to God.
</P>
<P>
	   Do you support physician-assisted suicide?
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe in the sanctity of life.''
</P>
<P>
	   What do you think about flying the Confederate flag?
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's up to you.''
</P>
<P>
	   What does ``truth'' mean?
</P>
<P>
	   ``In politics, it's doing what you say you'll do.''
</P>
<P>
	   Should Jane Fonda be on a list of the top 100 women of the century?
</P>
<P>
	   ``She didn't make my list.''
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush has changed his campaign style, taking a page from rival John
McCain after his loss to the Arizona senator in the New Hampshire primary. Gone
is the long speech at the podium, followed by a few questions and hours of
autographs. In its place are abbreviated remarks, followed by an Oprah-like
standup routine in a theater-in-the-round setting.
</P>
<P>
	   This is no appearance makeover, the kind Vice President Al Gore underwent
last fall when he adopted earth-tone outfits as Bill Bradley crept up in the
race for the Democratic nomination. Bush looks the same as before.
</P>
<P>
	   And he has always taken questions. But now he stands close to his audience
on a stage bare except for a microphone. The only thing behind him is a sign
bearing his new campaign slogan: ``A Reformer With Results.''
</P>
<P>
	   When he gets hot, he takes off his coat.
</P>
<P>
	   It is a cozy, informal format that President Clinton used to beat Bush's
father in 1992. In New Hampshire, McCain used a similar ``town hall'' format to
build a populist image that helped win the primary over his rival for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush team decided he needed some freshness on the trail. One answer: Let
him take on all comers, as long as they wanted.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite widespread questions about his intellect and grasp of issues, the
Texas governor is showing he can give as good as he gets.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Stand up and fire away,'' he urged students at North Greenville College
this week. They responded with a volley of 21 topics over a period of 40
minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What's your feeling about gun laws?'' asked one student in a heavy
Southern drawl, prompting laughter from both the candidate and the audience.
``Let me guess your position,'' Bush replied, extending the chuckle.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he believed that all law-abiding citizens should be allowed to carry
guns, but new buyers should face an instant background check.
</P>
<P>
	   One after another, the questions came in.
</P>
<P>
	   Sometimes Bush jousted and gibed with his questioners. As often, he tried to
transform his answer into criticism of McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   When a student started celebrating with his friends after the governor
called on him, Bush said wryly: ``Don't be slapping high-fives until you've
asked your question. I may just decide not to answer your question.''
</P>
<P>
	   As the student went on to indicate he believed Bush was the Lord's chosen
candidate in the race, the governor became visibly irritated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've got a personal faith, but far be it from me to tell you this is God's
will,'' Bush said. ``I don't get to put words in God's mouth and neither do you.
All I know to do is be the best I can in life.''
</P>
<P>
	   Risks remain in the new arrangement. The campaign can't always keep control.
</P>
<P>
	   At Newberry College on Wednesday, when a white student stood up and asked
Bush his position on the Confederate flag flying over South Carolina's
Statehouse, he gave his oft-stated answer that it was up to the state's voters
to decide.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd cheered.
</P>
<P>
	   But then a black student stood up. Herb Leggette, a 20-year-old junior from
Andrews began pressing Bush: ``We need a leader to step in. ...''	   The crowd
began booing.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush regained control. ``Wait a minute, allow this question,'' he called
out, and Leggette continued, pressing the candidate to say he would intercede.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I come from a political philosophy that says there are some issues that
the people of South Carolina have got to figure out,'' Bush said. ``In my state
of Texas we had this decision, we had this issue. We fly a Lone Star flag over
our Capitol because that's what our citizens decided to do.''
</P>
<P>
	   The students applauded.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Plane Hijack Talks Held  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROLINE BYRNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Contact with the hijackers of an Afghan airliner
broke down Wednesday after the flight crew escaped, but police regained
communication and expressed confidence they were on track to win release of the
150-plus hostages aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The negotiations became strained after four crew members staged a daring
escape through a cockpit window. Police were left to wonder if anyone aboard
could fly the Ariana airlines Boeing 727.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can imagine their (the captors) reactions when they discovered that
the flight crew had gone,'' said Joe Edwards, an assistant chief constable of
Essex County police. ``Perhaps understandably, things went quiet.''
</P>
<P>
	   But contact resumed later Wednesday at Stansted airport near London and
negotiators grew more hopeful about the release of the 150-plus hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards said Wednesday night that negotiations were going well. ``It's going
in the right direction. The key to it is trust.''
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiators insisted that the armed men had made no formal demands,
political or otherwise. The men, believed to be Afghans armed with grenades,
pistols and daggers, had requested only that food, water and other comfort items
be brought to the plane, parked on a runway.
</P>
<P>
	   Speculation mounted in the British media, however, that the plane was seized
as part of an elaborate bid for political asylum -- and that some of the
hostages were in on it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``HI-HOAX? Hijackers and hostages may be asylum seekers,'' the tabloid
Mirror blared on its front page. The Daily Star lamented ``Oh no! They ALL want
to stay (and we'll have to pay).''
</P>
<P>
	   Fueling the asylum speculation was the arrival Tuesday of an observer from
the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. The observer would be
providing expertise but would not be joining the negotiating team, said Edwards.
The commission's London office identified the observer as Hope Hanlan.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to questions about the validity of the asylum theory, Edwards
said: ``Why are they still in there? We've been asking them to come out since
Monday.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was believed that 151 people, including 21 children, remained aboard the
aircraft, which was hijacked early Sunday 20 minutes into a domestic flight
leaving Kabul, Afghanistan's capital. It then began a meandering journey across
the former Soviet Union, stopping in Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Among them were 39 members of one family who were traveling to a wedding in
the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif -- including the would-be bride, said
Mohammed Daoud Sharisi, who sells tickets at the Ariana office in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
	   Early in the day, the hijackers ejected a flight attendant, who was seen
being sent forcibly down a set of stairs at the rear of the plane. His departure
came four hours after four crew members -- the captain, second captain, first
officer and flight engineer -- escaped by using a rope to lower themselves from
the cockpit and jumping onto the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we are not able to determine is whether any of the remaining crew on
board or any of the passengers are able to fly this aircraft,'' said John
Broughton, an assistant chief constable of Essex County police.
</P>
<P>
	   Four men, presumed to be hijackers, appeared briefly on the ground at the
rear of the plane Wednesday morning to collect fresh supplies. That evening, two
men descended the jet's rear steps and collected an evening meal -- a result of
the continuing negotiations. They appeared to carry out an inspection of the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the crew members, the hijackers have released 31 passengers
so far.
</P>
<P>
	   In Kabul, an Ariana employee said Wednesday that several airline officials
responsible for security checks on the hijacked flight had been arrested. An
Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said several
employees were questioned but allowed to go back to work.

<HEADLINE> Drug dealer says he sold cocaine for Camden Mayor Milton Milan in  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A convicted drug dealer testified Wednesday that he
sold cocaine for Mayor Milton Milan on a city street corner in the 1980s -
before Milan was elected mayor.
<P>
	   Saul "Gordo" Febo said he was a "trapper" for about a year for Milan and
other dealers, selling bundles of cocaine in exchange for a portion of the
profits. He also testified that Milan sold drugs in the mid-80s.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every time they gave me a chance I do it - sell a couple of bundles here
and there," Febo testified. "They were greedy."
</P>
<P>
	   The allegations emerged in testimony in the drug conspiracy trial of two
reputed drug lords accused of running the largest cocaine ring in Camden history
before it was toppled in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Milan, 37, a first-term Democrat elected in 1997 as the city's first Latino
mayor, is not charged in the case and has not been accused of any wrongdoing. He
has denied any involvement in the drug organization.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just ridiculous," Milan said during a public appearance in North
Camden. "I really don't care what they have to say. I think you have a lot of
character assassination."
</P>
<P>
	   A high-ranking member of the drug ring, Febo, 32, of Pennsauken, is a key
witness in the prosecution case against Jose "J.R." Rivera and Luis "Tun"
Figueroa.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Febo, another admitted dealer, Ernesto Padilla, testified
Wednesday that Milan sold cocaine in his North Camden neighborhood around 1987
or 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked by the prosecutor who else sold drugs with him, Padilla replied,
Milton was out (there)."
</P>
<P>
	   Padilla also testified that Rivera offered to set up Milan when authorities
began closing in on the drug ring in August 1997. Rivera said he would call
Milan and suggest that the two set up "another one of those $200,000 deals," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Padilla did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   "What it means is that he knows they want to get the mayor," said Milan's
attorney Carlos A. Martir, who also represents Figueroa. "He made it clear the
mayor was going to be set up."
</P>
<P>
	   During the trial, in its sixth week, Milan's name has repeatedly surfaced in
testimony. Two convicted dealers have alleged that Milan purchased kilo
quantities of cocaine at least twice in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, another dealer testified that Milan, after becoming mayor,
tipped drug dealers about pending raids. Authorities have said the ring was able
to operate for so long because it had inside connections with police.
</P>
<P>
	   Last August, federal authorities investigating alleged corruption in Camden
raided Milan's home and City Hall Office. His attorney has said Milan is a
target of the probe.
</P>
<P>
	   Febo is expected to testify about the 1993 slaying of a rival drug dealer,
Manuel "Manolin" DeJesus. Febo identified Figueroa as the triggerman and
admitted turning up the volume on a radio to muffle the gunshots.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses have said DeJesus was killed - execution-style - because he was
plotting to take over a drug set called The Alley. Figueroa faces state charges
in the killing. Febo and several other witnesses have admitted they participated
in the killing, but have not been charged.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators have said the organization - Camden's most entrenched and
significant drug cartel - controlled the market through threats and violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Rivera, 40, a Camden businessman, and Figueroa, 34, are accused of running a
multimillion dollar drug operation. Authorities allege that Rivera financed the
ring and laundered its profits and Figueroa was its enforcer.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourteen people were indicted on drug conspiracy charges, but only Figueroa
and Rivera have stood trial. The others pleaded guilty and many are cooperating
with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody did something - everybody that's in this indictment," Febo said.
"If they didn't do it they wife did it. Ain't nobody an angel."
</P>
<P>
	   Febo, who testified for about an hour before testimony recessed until
Thursday morning, detailed the inner workings of the lucrative drug trade in
Camden and his rise through the ranks.
</P>
<P>
	   After his arrest on drug charges in 1987, Febo said he briefly stopped
selling drugs. He eventually resumed, setting up in The Alley, selling $20 bags
of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   Febo said business became so brisk that he had to hire help - first 14
workers and then 14 more. The drug set was a 24-hour operation, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyone wanted work. Every day it was a new person coming to me wanting a
job," Febo testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Figueroa was recruited to work in The Alley in 1992, bagging cocaine, Febo
said. In several months, he moved up to become the manager and eventually was
made partner, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I gave him the opportunity so he could make some profits himself," Febo
said. The Alley generated about $80,000 to $90,000 monthly in drug profits, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted, Figueroa and Rivera face life in prison.

<HEADLINE> Ag Inspectors Admit Accepting Bribes  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Seven U.S. Department of Agriculture produce inspectors
pleaded guilty Wednesday to accepting bribes from wholesalers in exchange for
lowering grades for fruits and vegetables, thereby cheating farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspectors will face as much as two years, nine months in prison and
fines as high as $60,000, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspectors, appearing relaxed in business suits, each read from brief
statements admitting that they had accepting bribes ranging from $50 to $350 to
falsely grade produce lower.
</P>
<P>
	   When farmers make deals with companies that distribute fruits and vegetables
to merchants, the farmers promise that the produce will be of a certain quality.
If an inspector grades the produce lower than had been agreed upon, the farmers
are paid less.
</P>
<P>
	   Even slight variations in the grade of produce can affect the overall
contract price by several thousand dollars, depending on the size and value of
the shipment, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   The seven inspectors, who all pleaded guilty to a single count of bribery,
were based at the Hunts Point Terminal Market in the Bronx. An eighth inspector
pleaded guilty in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said the Hunts Point produce inspectors had routinely accepted
cash from owners and employees of wholesale produce firms since at least 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   Charges against Hunts Point wholesalers are still pending in federal court.
Two wholesalers have pleaded guilty to bribery and are awaiting sentencing.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Complains About Giuliani  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- In the sharpest attack yet against her Senate rival,
Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday accused Rudolph Giuliani of ``injecting
religion into this race.''
</P>
<P>
	   At issue was an eight-page fund-raising letter sent to people identified by
Giuliani as politically active conservatives and signed by the Republican New
York City mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter, a copy of which was distributed by the Clinton campaign, was
first reported on by the weekly Village Voice newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hillary Clinton further revealed her hostility towards America's religious
traditions when she attacked Gov. George W. Bush's idea that we should look
toward America's faith-based charities more than government programs to address
social problems,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said the first lady had never
attacked Bush's proposal and supports using faith-based charities to carry out
social programs if it is done in a constitutional manner.
</P>
<P>
	   And the first lady, who was raised in a devout Methodist family, said she
was outraged that Giuliani ``would inject religion into this campaign in any
form whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``As a person of faith, I am appalled that he would make false statements
about me and my respect for religion in order to raise money for his campaign,''
the first lady told reporters at a Rochester hotel, a message she later repeated
to more than 1,500 people at Syracuse University.
</P>
<P>
	   During a November speech at the New York Theological Seminary in Manhattan,
she thanked ministers for providing services to the homeless and others in need.
Later, in response to a question from a minister, she stated: ``I believe in
faith-based institutions providing services.''
</P>
<P>
	   At a City Hall news conference Wednesday, the mayor said, ``I stand by
everything I said in the letter.'' He said he would ``be more than happy to have
everyone in the state read that letter.''
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor, laughing and noting the letter had been sent out in October,
maintained ``it's the Clinton campaign that injected it into the race. ... The
reality is nobody attacked her.''
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's letter also complained about ``liberal judges'' who oppose
posting the Ten Commandments in public schools. The mayor -- who was educated in
Catholic schools and who was once a First Amendment lawyer -- said Wednesday he
supports posting the Commandments but added that it should not be required.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter also attacked Clinton for her complaints when Giuliani sought to
cut off city funding last year for the Brooklyn Museum of Art because of its
display of a painting of the Virgin Mary adorned with elephant dung and naked
body parts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the minds of left-wing activists like Hillary Clinton, I guess it's
okay to use taxpayer funds to subsidize religious exposition as long as it
involves the desecration of religious symbols,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton noted Wednesday that she had said ``I was personally offended by
that exhibit. I said it many, many times.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton also used her speech at Syracuse to call for a program to
recruit teachers across the country. She said she would introduce legislation to
provide college scholarships worth $5,000 to $10,000 a year to 60,000 students
who agree to teach for four years in high-need schools.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, meanwhile, Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., said he was considering
the New York Conservative Party's invitation to enter the Senate race. But he
said he would only do so if he ran on the Republican line as well. He added that
he still has not ruled out challenging Giuliani for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazio had $4 million in the bank and was prepared to seek the GOP nomination
for U.S. Senate last year before Gov. George Pataki urged him to step aside in
favor of the better-known mayor.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Workers Go On Strike  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RENTON, Wash. (AP) -- More than 10,000 engineers and technical workers at
Boeing Co. walked off the job Wednesday in one of the biggest white-collar
strikes in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
	   Production at the world's largest airplane maker continued without
interruption because assembly employees belong to a separate union and have a
clause in their contract requiring them to work regardless of what other Boeing
employees do.
</P>
<P>
	   The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, which
represents about 10 percent of Boeing's work force, went on strike after
contract talks broke down Tuesday night. No further talks were scheduled.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the union -- who are involved in such fields as research and
development, designing of planes and overseeing production work -- left their
jobs at Boeing offices and plants throughout the Seattle area at 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just went to work, shut down my computer, copied my hard drive to Zip
disks and got the hell out of there," said Stan Sorscher, a physicist who led
one of the negotiating teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Union members gathered for a rally and march at Renton Memorial Stadium,
near the factory where Boeing builds 737 and 757 jetliners. The crowd cheered as
union executive director Charles Bofferding said Boeing negotiators "thought
they could bully us, and they were wrong."
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing has said a strike would not affect the building of aircraft. However,
if the walkout were to last for a couple of weeks, it could interfere with the
inspection and delivery of aircraft to airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing spokesman Peter B. Conte said Wednesday the company was still
measuring the effects of the walkout.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously we are disappointed that we were unable to reach an acceptable
solution through the course of mediation in the past two days," he said. "Boeing
is a company that strives to work with unions to negotiate in good faith and to
be fair and reasonable in the offers it makes."
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing stock fell $2 a share to $38.81 1/4 Wednesday on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The union has sought more guaranteed pay raises and bonuses similar to those
received by the 46,000-member Machinists union. Boeing has insisted on mostly
selective pay increases, reductions in life insurance benefits and some changes
in health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   In negotiations last year, the Machinists won annual raises of 4 percent, 4
percent and 3 percent in a three-year contract, plus a 10 percent signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing's most recent offer was narrowly defeated by members of the
white-collar union, 51 percent to 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   White-collar employees at Boeing worldwide average about $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The AFL-CIO-affiliated union represents 63 percent of Boeing's 22,600
professional and technical workers.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the first full-scale strike in the union's 56-year history, and some
members had questioned whether the white-collar workers were willing to engage
the company. The union's only previous strike was a symbolic one-day walkout in
1992.
</P>
<P>
	   "A year ago, I would've said a strike was crazy," said SPEEA President Craig
Buckham. "I'm telling you, these people today are seriously energized. I don't
want to strike, but it's good to see we have the strength to do it."
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the union cheered when they were told a Teamster-driven truck
from United Parcel Service honored the picket line Wednesday. Bob Gorman, state
director of the AFL-CIO, said other unions would support the strike.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Gov May Have Urged Against Veto  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Former Gov. William Weld urged his successor not to veto a
drug program that his new law firm helped craft, despite a pledge to stay away
from lobbying, The Boston Globe reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Weld made several calls last November to Gov. Paul Cellucci, who was under
pressure from the state's biotechnology industry to kill the bill, which was
backed by Democrats. Weld and Cellucci are Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill is designed to allow the state to pay lower prices for prescription
drugs for elderly and poor citizens by buying in bulk.
</P>
<P>
	   Weld and his law firm, McDermott Will &AMP; Emery, had helped Citizens Energy
Corp. draft the new law, which was put into the state budget without debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Cellucci said Weld did speak to him about the bill, but said he didn't see
it as official lobbying.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He did weigh in on that, and Joe Kennedy, and others,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cellucci said he speaks to Weld frequently. He denied approving the bill
because of pressure from Weld.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the purpose -- trying to reduce the cost of prescription drugs,
particularly for senior citizens -- is a very good one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State William Galvin said Wednesday it did not appear that
Weld's phone calls violated the state's lobbying laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Weld did not return phone calls about the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Citizens Energy, founded by former congressman Joseph P. Kennedy II, said it
wanted to use its expertise gained through buying discount oil for the poor and
elderly to negotiate with insurers to get reduced pharmaceutical prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Weld has moved to New York City to head his law firm's Manhattan
office, he has kept a home in Cambridge.

<HEADLINE> Russian Aircrafts Bombard Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
   By LYOMA TURPALOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   URUS-MARTAN, Russia (AP) -- Russian planes on Wednesday bombed Chechnya's
southern mountains, where the main rebel forces are believed to be concentrated,
while militants staged hit-and-run attacks on federal posts in
Russian-controlled territories.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian warplanes dropped 1 1/2-ton bombs on suspected rebel hideouts in the
Argun Gorge -- the heaviest bombs used in the offensive so far, the military
said, according to the Interfax news agency. Rebels have used the Argun and
Vedeno gorges in the southern mountains as supply routes, and have bases hidden
along the snowy slopes.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels also were on the attack. Overnight, small groups of rebels struck
federal posts in two Russian-controlled districts in the southwest,
Achkhoi-Martan and Urus-Martan. They also hit Argun, a large town about 10 miles
east of the capital, Grozny, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian shelling of villages in the southwestern plains -- where rebels were
believed to be hiding after escaping Grozny last week -- eased up after days of
pounding. But automatic gunfire was heard through the night in the regional
center, Achkhoi-Martan.
</P>
<P>
	   Villagers in Shaami-Yurt, Katyr-Yurt and Gekhi-Chu reported heavy civilian
casualties -- hundreds of people killed or wounded, and damage to close to
three-quarters of the houses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are innocent, why are you killing us?'' one woman shouted at a passing
Russian military truck Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Refugees were streaming out of the villages as Russian forces moved in
Wednesday to search for Chechen fighters trying to blend in with civilians. Four
Russian helicopter gunships, flying in pairs, were making constant circles over
the area.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians have been trying to keep rebels who fled Grozny last week from
reaching the south, where the military estimates 7,000 guerrillas are based.
Russia will likely have a tougher time ousting militants from the mountains
because the terrain favors the rebels' hit-and-run tactics.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of civilians are blocked in the Argun Gorge and regional elders
have spent a month trying to get Russian forces to give them a safe corridor to
escape, said Abdul-Kasim Zhureabov, an elder from the Itum-Kale district.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told reporters in Moscow that the military
would soon start a serious offensive in the southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   He was quoted as saying that ``after the completion of operations in Grozny,
the troops will rest for a couple of days, service their weapons and military
equipment, and increase their efforts in the direction of the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the Russian general staff, said
on Russia's ORT television that two regiments soon would be withdrawn from
Chechnya, but about 50,000 troops would stay to finish off the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 200 rebels were killed in the past 24 hours, Interfax cited the
Russian Interior Ministry as saying. The military reported no casualties of its
own. The claims could not be independently confirmed. Both sides in the conflict
are believed to overstate the other's losses and minimize their own.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal command said about 300 rebels remain in Grozny, though it
maintains Russian forces are in full control of the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Rare bursts of machine-gun fire and artillery could be heard in Grozny on
Tuesday night, with occasional flares arching into the sky. Black plumes of
smoke hung over the city following Russian artillery strikes on oil refineries.

<HEADLINE> Nissan, Toyota Show Off New Cars  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- With competition heating up in the market for small trucks,
two Asian automakers introduced new versions Wednesday aimed at keeping their
sales up -- and perhaps even stealing a few from the American leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Nissan Motor Co. showed off a restyled version of its Frontier pickup, and
announced a new top-of-the-line engine for the model at the Chicago Auto Show
media previews. Toyota Motor Co. showed off a four-door version of its Tacoma
compact pickup.
</P>
<P>
	   While the market for such pickups has not grown in recent years, the
Japanese automakers see their offerings as a way to bring new buyers into their
fold -- and hopefully keep them as customers for years to come.
</P>
<P>
	   "We feel a lot of our growth potential is on the truck side," said Don
Esmond, general manager of Toyota's U.S. sales arm.
</P>
<P>
	   The new versions of the Frontier that will hit dealerships later this summer
will carry the same mechanical pieces under a tougher looking exterior, with
such touches as painted, exposed bolts over the wheel wells. The old model
"didn't have a lot of testosterone going for it, visually," said Jerry
Hirshberg, the chief of Nissan Design International.
</P>
<P>
	   Later this year, the Frontier will get some mechanical testosterone as an
option -- a supercharged V6 that puts out 210 horsepower. Nissan did not offer a
price for the new version; the old models sell from $11,500 to $21,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Nissan expects the restyled Frontier -- sold in two-door, four-door,
extended cab and four-wheel-drive versions -- to add about 5,000 sales to last
year's total of about 105,000. It will still be built at Nissan's plant in
Smyrna, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't see a lot of growth, which is why you've got to do something bold,"
said Jed Connelly, vice president and general manager ofNissan North America.
"You've got to get noticed."
</P>
<P>
	   Connelly also said Nissan was exploring building a full-size pickup and SUV
models for the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Another reason for keeping small pickups up-to-date is that they have some
of the youngest buyers. Esmond noted that the average buyer age on some models
of the Tacoma is 36 years old -- a young group that Toyota can target for other
sales.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tacoma Double Cab will go on sale in October, and Toyota expects to sell
from 30,000 to 45,000 vehicles. The company did not release pricing; a Tacoma
Xtracab can cost up to $24,000.
</P>
<P>
	   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are scheduled to show off new
versions of their own compact pickups Thursday. Ford's Ranger is the top-seller,
followed by the Chevrolet S-10.
</P>
<P>
	   GM also showed off two concept cars Wednesday. The Pontiac Piranha is a
swoopy hatchback with removable mesh seats and a carrying cart for large cargo.
The Chevrolet Traverse is a four-door sedan with a two-piece hatchback and a
microcomputer built into the dash.
</P>
<P>
	   The concepts were part of a group of 10 GM introduced last fall, but this is
the first time these models two are off the design page and on the auto show
floor. GM officials have said the concepts show the general direction of GM
design, and some of them are being considered for production.
</P>
<P>
	   The auto show opens to the public Friday.

<HEADLINE> As Forbes says goodbye, some fellow Republicans say good riddance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - So what did publishing magnate Steve Forbes get for
the $66 million he spent running twice for the Republican presidential
nomination?
<P>
	   "You get to realize that unfortunately your message just didn't resonate,"
said New Jersey GOP chairman Garabed Haytaian.
</P>
<P>
	   Carl Golden, a veteran of GOP administrations and campaigns, said all Forbes
got was a costly confirmation that he shouldn't have run at all. "It was very
hard to look at Steve Forbes as viable."
</P>
<P>
	   For the Bedminster Republican, this failure to resonate amounted to total
collapse in the 2000 presidential sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, Forbes prevailed at least in the Delaware and Arizona primaries. On
Tuesday, the best Forbes could manage in Delaware was a third place finish
behind Sen. John McCain, who didn't even set foot in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   So Forbes is expected to announce his withdrawal from the GOP contest
Thursday after canceling campaign events Wednesday and abruptly returning home.
He has been spending his own money at a pace of $1 million a week since Labor
Day, and of the 54 delegates who were up for grabs so far, Forbes got two.
</P>
<P>
	   And Forbes may be in for something of a chilly welcome home.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman, for one, will not embrace him as a native son
returning from the national field of battle. Forbes' hard swing to the right
alienated him from his neighbor and childhood friend.
</P>
<P>
	   "His message was inconsistent and irregular," said Whitman's spokesman,
Peter McDonough. "It had changed dramatically over the past four years, six
years."
</P>
<P>
	   David Rebovich, political analyst at Rider University, said moderate
governors in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Connecticut have been
struggling mightily to pull their Republican party in from the fringe.
</P>
<P>
	   "And then you have Forbes sticking out like a sore thumb, saying that we are
going to put abortion doctors in jail," Rebovich said. "It was very upsetting
for folks up here."
</P>
<P>
	   "What we found and what I think he has to understand is that he never really
connected with people," said state Sen. Diane Allen, R-Burlington. "I don't
think people deal well with it when you change radically from one position to
another."
</P>
<P>
	   But others said now that he is out, Forbes has made himself a fixture in the
GOP, and they hope to hear more from him on the New Jersey scene.
</P>
<P>
	   "He moved to the right because it was a presidential campaign situation,"
said Senate President Donald DiFrancesco. "He is very wealthy and his name
recognition is very high. I don't know what he would like to do, but he could do
a lot."
</P>
<P>
	   Allen said, "I would hope that he would come back and maintain a very active
stance in the state of New Jersey."
</P>
<P>
	   From now until April 13, speculation will run rampant on whether the
millionaire would jump into the New Jersey primary for U.S. Senate. Most give it
long odds.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebovich relished a Senate race pitting Forbes against Wall Street
millionaire Jon Corzine, a Democrat, as a clash of the self-financing titans.
"You never know. He has a big ego. Maybe it is something that could attract
him," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But neither Rebovich nor anyone else would actually predict such a move by
Forbes, whose campaign staff Wednesday said he had no plans for the U.S. Senate
race.
</P>
<P>
	   Most agree Forbes will fold his campaign tent for the foreseeable future, if
not forever.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think he honestly has much in the way of a political future," said
Golden. "Whether (his) is a voice people are going to listen to seriously, I
don't know."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Czar: Drug War is No Real War  </HEADLINE>

<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The retired general who leads America's ``war on drugs''
said Wednesday he doesn't even think it's a war anymore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of our problems is that the U.S. population likes the term ``the war

efforts and meet with top officials here, told a university audience he now
prefers to think of the drug problem as ``a cancer affecting social life.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCaffrey, the top U.S. drug policy official wants an attack on drugs that
incorporates more treatment, addiction therapy, child care and education.
</P>
<P>
	   But he conceded that violence ``is one of the most serious impediments'' to
controlling the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
	   While spending for treatment and outreach programs grows in the United
States, McCaffrey said more force may still be needed in countries like
Colombia, where government troops are fighting rebels funded by the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They (the Colombian government) are really in a perilous situation, and I
think we ought to stand with them,'' McCaffrey said, noting that the United
States will give 63 helicopters in 2000 ``so their armed forces can reenter the
southern part of the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Even in Mexico, drug interdiction forces -- like the kind McCaffrey will
visit on Mexico's southern border Thursday -- have suffered frequent attacks; in
1999, gunmen fired on and damaged 10 police helicopters in the Pacific coast
state of Guerrero alone.
</P>
<P>
	   McCaffrey said the problems of violence and corruption are linked; threats
can make law enforcement agents more likely to take bribes, or at least look the
other way.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said about 55 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States
enters the country through Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Women's Groups Bash Jeb Bush's Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID MARK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Women's groups bashed Gov. Jeb Bush's ban to cut
back racial and gender preferences in state programs Wednesday, saying they have
been helped the most by affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor's ``One Florida'' plan has been criticized in a series of
rallies recently, mostly by blacks. Women's groups had been largely quiet on the
plan until Wednesday, when legislators joined with groups like the National
Organization for Women to defend gender and racial preferences.
</P>
<P>
	   ``From day one, the group hurt most by One Florida is women,'' said
Democratic state Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz. ``Whatever crumbs he's using
will not help women in this state.''
</P>
<P>
	   One Florida would eliminate race and gender as factors in university
admissions and the awarding of state contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the plan, students who take a difficult enough course load and finish
in the top 20 percent of their high school graduating class would be guaranteed
admission to some state universities.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan would also encourage businesses owned by women and minorities to
bid for state government contracts and streamlines the application process.
</P>
<P>
	   Wasserman Schultz said the plan was an attempt to stop an anti-affirmative
action ballot measure by Californian Ward Connerly, and a way to boost the
presidential prospects of Bush's brother, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe it's all about the letter 'W' -- George W. and Ward,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has insisted his plan would improve diversity in education and
contracting by increasing outreach efforts to minorities historically shut out
of opportunities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When the governor talks about promoting diversity of opportunity he's
talking about more opportunity for African Americans, Hispanics and certainly
women and any other minority,'' Bush spokeswoman Elizabeth Hirst said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, worried about the increasingly hostile political environment, asked
his father, former President George Bush, to cancel his scheduled March 9
appearance before the Florida Legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's not going to put his father in any position where there may be a
blatant display of disrespect,'' Hirst said.
</P>
<P>
	   The timing of former president's scheduled visit was sharply criticized by
Democrats and some Republicans as little more than a campaign appearance to
benefit George W. Bush in the Florida presidential primary just five days later.

<HEADLINE> Trial Opens in Isuzu Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WHITE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Consumer Reports rigged tests that showed the 1996 Isuzu
Trooper tends to tip onto two wheels during sharp turns, an attorney for the
automaker said Wednesday as trial opened in a lawsuit seeking damages from the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   A lawyer for the magazine said Isuzu Motors Ltd. was seeking $300 million,
but the automaker denied that and said the amount has not been made public.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine and its publisher, Consumers Union, orchestrated a public
relations campaign against the sport utility vehicle to boost declining
subscriptions and revenues, attorney Andy White claimed in opening statements to
a federal court jury.
</P>
<P>
	   "This trial results from an attack on Isuzu's reputation and the safety of
the Trooper," White said.
</P>
<P>
	   Isuzu's lawsuit claims defamation, product disparagement and unlawful,
unfair and fraudulent business practices.
</P>
<P>
	   From 1992 to early 1996, Consumer Reports subscriptions dropped from 5.3
million to 4.3 million, representing millions in lost revenue, White said, and
the losses prompted the magazine to target the Trooper in tests to produce
something dramatic.
</P>
<P>
	   The consumer organization also wanted to use the Trooper test results to
persuade the government to adopt stability testing standards, White said.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers Union attorney Joseph Cotchett said the organization had no plan
to attack Isuzu and, in fact, was surprised when the Trooper failed the road
test.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not out to trash anyone," he said. "We test, we inform and we
protect. We do that by comparison testing."
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine gave the matter heavy publicity because it recommended the
Trooper to readers months earlier in its annual automobile edition, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "They believed they had a duty and an obligation to tell the public about
the '96 Trooper," Cotchett said.
</P>
<P>
	   As evidence of the magazine's good intentions, Cotchett played a video that
showed that in the first test the driver did not ask for outriggers on the
Trooper to prevent it from tipping over. Had the driver anticipated instability,
the bars would have been in place, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the initial test, the Trooper was retested 192 times and it tipped 75
times, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cotchett denied the magazine had a circulation decline and showed a bar
graph that indicated circulation increased from 1995 through 1999. He did not
provide figures.
</P>
<P>
	   During a recess, Cotchett said it was possible the magazine lost money
during 1995 but the amount would have been "minuscule."
</P>
<P>
	   Trooper sales fell in 1996 and 1997 because of competition and other
internal problems, not because of the Consumer Reports article, Cotchett said in
court.
</P>
<P>
	   He showed the jury two internal Isuzu memos that blamed the sales decline on
stronger competition, lack of advertising, a large carryover of 1995 models and
aggressive leasing programs.

<HEADLINE> Cuba To Host Third World Summit  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Cuba will host a Third World summit in April, a
gathering aimed at helping put developing nations in the mainstream of the
global economy and the technology revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   Nigeria's U.N. Ambassador Arthur Mbanefo said Wednesday that more than 70
heads of state or government are expected to attend the summit in Havana on
April 10-14.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Havana summit is aimed at restoring the commitment of the member
states of the Group of 77 to a new economic platform for the south,'' said
Mbanefo, whose country holds the group's rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   The group was established in 1964 by 77 developing countries and has
increased its membership to 133 nations. It is the largest Third World coalition
at the United Nations, promoting the economic and social interests of the
world's poorer nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Through the summit, ``we shall make the struggle against underdevelopment
the binding cement of the solidarity of the south,'' the group's foreign
ministers said in a recent statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The summit will explore the growing trend of globalization; increasing
access to knowledge and technology; enhancing the dialogue between countries in
the south and the richer developed nations in the north; and increasing
cooperation, investment and trade among the southern nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba offered to host the summit. It has played host to a number of other
international conferences, including a summit of Latin American and European
leaders in November.
</P>
<P>
	   The summit will be preceded by several related events in Havana in March,
including a forum for voluntary and grassroots organizations from the south, a
workshop on north-south relations, and a forum for businessmen from the south.

<HEADLINE> Camden County unveils plans for $50 million civic center arena  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LAWNSIDE, N.J. (AP) - Camden County officials announced plans Wednesday
to build a $50 million civic center and sports arena to bring a hockey team,
concerts and conventions to this historic borough.
<P>
	   The proposed South Jersey Civic and Conference Center would be built on a
120-acre tract here. Construction on the 6,000- to 10,000-seat facility is
expected to begin in September and take nearly two years to complete.
</P>
<P>
	   The major draw for the arena will be a yet-to-be-acquired franchise team of
the United Hockey League, said county Freeholder Frank Spencer. Negotiations are
also under way to land a professional basketball team, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the optimum location," Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1.4-square-mile borough is about 10 miles southeast of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   The Camden County Improvement Authority will finance the project through the
sale of $50 million in low-interest revenue bonds guaranteed by the county.
About $35 million will be spent to build the center and the remainder used to
acquire land and other costs, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials estimate that the arena, expected to open in 2002, will operate
initially with a $1 million deficit annually. The county will absorb the deficit
without raising taxes, Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
	   "That subsidy would decrease over time as attendance builds and cost of
tickets inflates," said Philip P. Rowan, executive director of the Improvement
Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Once completed, the facility will be operated by SFX Entertainment, which
also manages the E-Centre on the Camden waterfront. The facility would then be
leased on a per diem basis to the ice hockey team which is expected to play 38
home games at the arena a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Spencer said the arena will fill a void in southern New Jersey for residents
seeking affordable entertainment locally. Spencer said 1 million people live in
surrounding Burlington, Camden and Gloucester counties.
</P>
<P>
	   The facility will be used primarily for sports events - professional, high
school and collegiate - but it will also be used for family-oriented
entertainment, concerts, trade shows and conventions, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the proposal, the arena would also include 40,000-square-feet of
convention space and rooms that can be used to conduct workshops. A 3,000-car
parking lot will also be built.
</P>
<P>
	   A consultant recommended Lawnside, a community of 3,200, over several other
Camden County towns. Spencer said Lawnside is easily accessible to major roads
and a high-speed rail line.
</P>
<P>
	   "It certainly will put us on the map," said Mayor Mark K. Bryant. "We think
it's going to be good for our town."
</P>
<P>
	   Lawnside, which was founded by freed slaves, has few ratables to generate
taxes. The arena would be the biggest new commercial project in the community in
years.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan must still clear several hurdles in Lawnside. The proposed site
must be rezoned as a redevelopment area and several residents may have to be
relocated.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant said the borough will receive $100,000 a year from the county in lieu
of taxes. He hopes the project will be a magnet for an additional $100 million
in development nearby, including hotels and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
	   "The snowball effect from this could be astronomical," said Council
President Clifford Still. "It's a major windfall for Lawnside."

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted of 1976 Murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- A man was convicted Wednesday of the 1976 murder of a
teen-age girl, after the jury rejected his claim that her death was accidental
but he tried to make it look like a crime.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury needed just 25 minutes to convict James Brian Kuenn, 40, of
first-degree murder in the slaying of Carol Hutto, with whom he had a secret
romance. Hutto's partially clad body was found in a shallow pond, weighed down
with concrete blocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Kuenn, who has spent his adult life in the Navy, could face life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors alleged that Kuenn killed the girl after she refused to have sex
with him. DNA evidence linked him to the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   Kuenn said that the girl's death was an accident, and that he tried to hide
his involvement with her by making her death look like a crime committed by
someone else.
</P>
<P>
	   Kuenn said he and Hutto had arranged a rendezvous at a house under
construction. He said they were chasing each other in the house when she fell
backward.
</P>
<P>
	   Kuenn said he tried to revive her, but couldn't. He said he took Hutto's
clothes off, made strangulation marks with his hands on her neck and hit her
with a piece of wood to make it appear as if she'd been attacked. He dumped her
body in a pond behind the house.
</P>
<P>
	   An autopsy determined that Hutto had drowned.
</P>
<P>
	   The case had been unsolved for nearly two decades when a detective reopened
the file in 1994 and saw that Kuenn -- whose name was found in Hutto's diary --
hadn't been ruled out as a suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   The detective interviewed Kuenn and noticed that he gave a different
explanation of his whereabouts. That reopened the investigation, and by then,
police had a new weapon -- advanced DNA testing that could be used on smaller
bits of evidence.

<HEADLINE> 'Beach' Film Blights Real Islands  </HEADLINE>
   By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAYA BAY, Thailand (AP) -- ``The Beach,'' which opens in London on Wednesday
starring Leonardo DiCaprio, tells the story of an amoral backpacker whose quest
for the perfect tropical beach leads him to a secret commune on a remote Thai
island.
</P>
<P>
	   But utopia isn't quite what it seems and paradise turns into bloody
savagery. Likewise, the image of sunny, sandy perfection achieved in making the
20th Century Fox film has destroyed the once-pristine beach where it was shot,
environmentalists say.
</P>
<P>
	   Maya Bay, a strip of sand and vegetation backed by dramatic cliffs, is
located on Phi Phi Le island, part of a national park about 350 miles south of
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of its islands have been blighted by developers who bribed corrupt
officials to look the other way while bungalows and hotels sprang up in
theoretically protected areas. Phi Phi Le and the beach at Maya Bay were largely
spared, providing a setting worthy of Alex Garland's best-selling novel.
</P>
<P>
	   But for filmmakers, led by director Danny Boyle and producer Andrew
Macdonald, who earned fame with ``Shallow Grave'' and ``Trainspotting,'' it
wasn't quite perfect enough.
</P>
<P>
	   After obtaining permits from the Forestry Department and paying a $110,000
damage deposit, the filmmakers brought in bulldozers to widen and flatten the
beach and strip away native grasses, scrub and other vegetation. They also
removed a lot of garbage that had washed ashore.
</P>
<P>
	   Seizing on the film's high profile, activists who had for years
unsuccessfully campaigned against the environmental damage to Thailand's parks
joined with local residents in a series of demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
	   They succeeded in getting the number of coconut trees -- a non-indigenous
species -- planted by the filmmakers reduced from about 100 to 60, but they lost
court challenges to impose a restraining order on filming.
</P>
<P>
	   The filmmakers pledged to restore the beach to its original state and set
stakes in the sand to prevent erosion.
</P>
<P>
	   But by the time the monsoon season ended in November, it became clear the
stakes didn't work nearly as well as native vegetation. More sand than anyone
could remember was washed away by the annual storms.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, Thai tourism officials, eager to cash in on publicity from the
film, have offered travel agents free trips to Thailand for so-called ``DiCaprio
Tours'' -- further angering activists, who have brought a $2.6 million lawsuit
against Fox, the Forestry Department and the Agriculture Ministry for damage to
Maya Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Their campaign is about greed, not reality,'' said Prasertpongse Sornuwat,
a local council member. ``There is no beautiful beach anymore. They just want to
cash in on the movie, with no concern about environmental impact.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some tourists agree.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The beach looks awful,'' said Alastair Short, 40, a tourist from
Worcester, England, visiting the island with friends. ``We decided to come by
and see with our own eyes what had happened. It's just a shame.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've gotten close to 30 signatures a day from tourists who promise they
won't patronize the movie, because it was made by damaging the environment of
the island,'' Prasertpongse said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Thai theater owners say they are not worried and have plastered
cinemas with posters of DiCaprio emerging from the sea ahead of the film's
release next month in Thailand. It opens Friday in U.S. theaters.
</P>
<P>
	   A lawyer for 20th Century Fox defended the filmmakers, saying they took
every precaution and the erosion was caused by unusually severe storms, not the
filmmakers' actions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We only need to give the beach time to recover on its own,'' said the
lawyer, Dusit Walee. ``I'm confident the claim about the erosion is
groundless.''
</P>
<P>
	   The damage to Maya Bay may not be finished yet. Ecologists fear the loosened
sand could damage fragile coral reefs on the beach front.
</P>
<P>
	   That could threaten the livelihoods of hundreds of boatmen who bring
sunbathers to Maya Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Maya Bay is falling apart in front of us,'' said Surat Saewkok, who has
taken tourists sight-seeing here for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Who wants to visit an eroding beach?'' Surat said. ``The film people are
all gone and are going to make money selling their movie, but villagers here are
paying the price.''

<HEADLINE> Commission cuts Atlantic Coast horseshoe crab harvest 25 percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) - A management board of the Atlantic States Marine
Fisheries Commission ordered the first coastwide cap on the horseshoe crab
harvest Wednesday, ordering states from Maine to Florida to cut their commercial
harvest 25 percent by May 1.
<P>
	   Conservation groups had lobbied for a 50 percent cut in the crab harvest to
protect the crab and its eggs, which are a significant source of food for
migrating birds.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening had also backed a 50 percent cut.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission also recommended that the National Marine Fisheries Service
consider banning the harvest of horseshoe crabs in waters within a 30-mile
radius of the mouth of the Delaware Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Delaware Bay is the nexus for a lot of the spawning of the horseshoe
crabs. That's a very vulnerable area," Andrew T. Manus, director of the Delaware
Division of Fish and Wildlife, said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision established a state-by-state cap at one-fourth below previously
fished levels of almost 3 million crabs harvested from 1995 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   States such as New Jersey and Maryland that already have more restrictive
regulations on horseshoe crab harvests would be encouraged to keep those
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey has restricted catching of crabs by trawlers in the Delaware Bay
and the ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryland in 1997 slashed its harvest by 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have every intention to maintain those levels," said Eric Schwaab,
director of the fisheries service for the Maryland Department of Natural
Resources.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is going to establish a cap in the neighborhood of 2.2 million. This
is going to be a big step forward," Schwaab said.
</P>
<P>
	   Horseshoe crabs are a popular bait with commercial watermen, who use them to
fish for lobster, eel and conch. The medical industry also uses horseshoe crab
blood for certain tests. Demand is so high for the horseshoe crabs that a
single, egg-filled female can fetch from 75 cents to a $1 on the bait market.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce Freeman, chairman of the commission's horseshoe crab management board,
said the decision to reduce the harvest was difficult because there is a lack of
complete data to evaluate the crab population.
</P>
<P>
	   The prehistoric species is not endangered, but conservationists contend that
horseshoe crabs are being overfished and that the reduction in crabs already is
hurting migratory shorebirds that rely on the crabs' eggs for food. The crabs
spawn on the bay beaches just as the migrating birds arrive to feast.

<HEADLINE> Russian Aircraft Bombard Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
   By LYOMA TURPALOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   URUS-MARTAN, Russia (AP) -- Russian planes on Wednesday bombed Chechnya's
southern mountains, where the main rebel forces are believed to be concentrated,
while militants staged hit-and-run attacks on federal posts in
Russian-controlled territories.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian warplanes dropped 1 1/2-ton bombs on suspected rebel hideouts in the
Argun Gorge -- the heaviest bombs used in the offensive so far, the military
said, according to the Interfax news agency. Rebels have used the Argun and
Vedeno gorges in the southern mountains as supply routes, and have bases hidden
along the snowy slopes.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels also were on the attack. Overnight, small groups of rebels struck
federal posts in two Russian-controlled districts in the southwest,
Achkhoi-Martan and Urus-Martan. They also hit Argun, a large town about 10 miles
east of the capital, Grozny, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian shelling of villages in the southwestern plains -- where rebels were
believed to be hiding after escaping Grozny last week -- eased up after days of
pounding. But automatic gunfire was heard through the night in the regional
center, Achkhoi-Martan.
</P>
<P>
	   Villagers in Shaami-Yurt, Katyr-Yurt and Gekhi-Chu reported heavy civilian
casualties -- hundreds of people killed or wounded, and damage to close to
three-quarters of the houses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are innocent, why are you killing us?'' one woman shouted at a passing
Russian military truck Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Refugees were streaming out of the villages as Russian forces moved in
Wednesday to search for Chechen fighters trying to blend in with civilians. Four
Russian helicopter gunships, flying in pairs, were making constant circles over
the area.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians have been trying to keep rebels who fled Grozny last week from
reaching the south, where the military estimates 7,000 guerrillas are based.
Russia will likely have a tougher time ousting militants from the mountains
because the terrain favors the rebels' hit-and-run tactics.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of civilians are blocked in the Argun Gorge and regional elders
have spent a month trying to get Russian forces to give them a safe corridor to
escape, said Abdul-Kasim Zhureabov, an elder from the Itum-Kale district.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told reporters in Moscow that the military
would soon start a serious offensive in the southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   He was quoted as saying that ``after the completion of operations in Grozny,
the troops will rest for a couple of days, service their weapons and military
equipment, and increase their efforts in the direction of the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the Russian general staff, said
on Russia's ORT television that two regiments soon would be withdrawn from
Chechnya, but about 50,000 troops would stay to finish off the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 200 rebels were killed in the past 24 hours, Interfax cited the
Russian Interior Ministry as saying. The military reported no casualties of its
own. The claims could not be independently confirmed. Both sides in the conflict
are believed to overstate the other's losses and minimize their own.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal command said about 300 rebels remain in Grozny, though it
maintains Russian forces are in full control of the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Rare bursts of machine-gun fire and artillery could be heard in Grozny on
Tuesday night, with occasional flares arching into the sky. Black plumes of
smoke hung over the city following Russian artillery strikes on oil refineries.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Ruled Out of Nuke Case  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN FINUCANE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- The federal government knew an experimental nuclear therapy
was producing questionable results, but it can't be held liable in a civil
lawsuit for the deaths of two patients, a judge ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief U.S. District Judge William Young ruled in the case of two families
who said their relatives' brains were damaged by boron neutron capture therapy
in the early 1960s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 200 people underwent some form of the therapy in the 1950s and
1960s, the families estimate.
</P>
<P>
	   The now-defunct U.S. Atomic Energy Commission backed the research into the
brain cancer treatment, but those who were running the experiment were
essentially independent contractors, Young said.
</P>
<P>
	   In order for the government to be held liable, it had to be shown
responsible for closely overseeing the research, Young said.
</P>
<P>
	   In October, a federal jury in Boston issued a verdict against Massachusetts
General Hospital and Dr. William Sweet, ordering them to pay $8 million in
damages to the families of cancer patients George Heinrich and Eileen Sienkewicz
for negligence and wrongful death.
</P>
<P>
	   The two were treated in 1960; Heinrich, who was 35, died that year and
Sienkewicz, who was 39, died in 1961.
</P>
<P>
	   At trial, MIT was found not liable. The judge -- and not the earlier jury --
considered the case against the government because the United States can't be
sued in a jury trial, Young said.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit was filed in 1995 after news reports broke focusing on Cold War
human radiation experiments.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony Roisman, another attorney representing the families, said the
plaintiffs were considering whether to appeal.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Plane Hijack Talks Held  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROLINE BYRNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Contact with the hijackers of an Afghan airliner
broke down Wednesday after the flight crew escaped, but police regained
communication and expressed confidence they were on track to win release of the
150-plus hostages aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The negotiations became strained after four crew members staged a daring
escape through a cockpit window. Police were left to wonder if anyone aboard
could fly the Ariana airlines Boeing 727.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can imagine their (the captors) reactions when they discovered that
the flight crew had gone,'' said Joe Edwards, an assistant chief constable of
Essex County police. ``Perhaps understandably, things went quiet.''
</P>
<P>
	   But contact resumed later Wednesday at Stansted airport near London and
negotiators grew more hopeful about the release of the 150-plus hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards said Wednesday night that negotiations were going well. ``It's going
in the right direction. The key to it is trust.''
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiators insisted that the armed men had made no formal demands,
political or otherwise. The men, believed to be Afghans armed with grenades,
pistols and daggers, had requested only that food, water and other comfort items
be brought to the plane, parked on a runway.
</P>
<P>
	   Speculation mounted in the British media, however, that the plane was seized
as part of an elaborate bid for political asylum -- and that some of the
hostages were in on it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``HI-HOAX? Hijackers and hostages may be asylum seekers,'' the tabloid
Mirror blared on its front page. The Daily Star lamented ``Oh no! They ALL want
to stay (and we'll have to pay).''
</P>
<P>
	   Fueling the asylum speculation was the arrival Tuesday of an observer from
the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. The observer would be
providing expertise but would not be joining the negotiating team, said Edwards.
The commission's London office identified the observer as Hope Hanlan.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to questions about the validity of the asylum theory, Edwards
said: ``Why are they still in there? We've been asking them to come out since
Monday.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was believed that 151 people, including 21 children, remained aboard the
aircraft, which was hijacked early Sunday 20 minutes into a domestic flight
leaving Kabul, Afghanistan's capital. It then began a meandering journey across
the former Soviet Union, stopping in Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Among them were 39 members of one family who were traveling to a wedding in
the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif -- including the would-be bride, said
Mohammed Daoud Sharisi, who sells tickets at the Ariana office in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
	   Early in the day, the hijackers ejected a flight attendant, who was seen
being sent forcibly down a set of stairs at the rear of the plane. His departure
came four hours after four crew members -- the captain, second captain, first
officer and flight engineer -- escaped by using a rope to lower themselves from
the cockpit and jumping onto the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we are not able to determine is whether any of the remaining crew on
board or any of the passengers are able to fly this aircraft,'' said John
Broughton, an assistant chief constable of Essex County police.
</P>
<P>
	   Four men, presumed to be hijackers, appeared briefly on the ground at the
rear of the plane Wednesday morning to collect fresh supplies. That evening, two
men descended the jet's rear steps and collected an evening meal -- a result of
the continuing negotiations. They appeared to carry out an inspection of the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the crew members, the hijackers have released 31 passengers
so far.
</P>
<P>
	   In Kabul, an Ariana employee said Wednesday that several airline officials
responsible for security checks on the hijacked flight had been arrested. An
Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said several
employees were questioned but allowed to go back to work.

	   Government Faces Questions About Human Resources Grants
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Eight numbered companies that got $3.9 million in grants from
the Human Resources Department can't be traced through corporate ownership
lists, say Conservative MPs Jean Dube and Peter MacKay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There doesn't seem to be any indication that these companies even exist,''
a frustrated Dube said Wednesday after raising the matter in the Commons.
</P>
<P>
	   Tory researchers tried unsuccessfully to find listings for the firms in
databases compiled by Dunn and Bradstreet, Statistics Canada and other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   MacKay maintained that raises serious questions about the government's
ability to track its spending and ensure that job creation and other projects
are achieving desired goals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What's dodgy about numbered companies, as everyone knows, is you can set
these companies up very quickly -- there's no level of accountability,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ghislain Charron, a department spokesman, said the fact that cash went to a
numbered company does not mean bureaucrats don't know who is getting it or what
is happening to it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The project can be (listed) under a numbered company, but the check is
always sent to an accountant somewhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Contracts are signed with individuals, not anonymous numbers, and the
department has their names, addresses and telephone numbers.

	   Federal Budget To Be Presented Feb. 28
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Days after his boss let the fiscal cat out of the bag,
Finance Minister Paul Martin confirmed Wednesday that he'll bring down the
federal budget on Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Jean Chretien told reporters late last week the budget would
come out at the end of the month, leading to broad speculation that meant Feb.
28.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin confirmed the date Wednesday in the Commons under questioning by the
Opposition Reform party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is true that there was a little bit of speculation last week from an
unknown source as to the date of the budget but I am pleased to announce that
speculation was accurate,'' he said, as Chretien chuckled nearby.
</P>

	   Parizeau: Referendum planning will take at least two years
</P>
<P>
	   QUEBEC (AP) -- It will take the Quebec government two years to re-do all the
homework needed to prepare for sovereignty because the existing research is
outdated, former premier Jacques Parizeau said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   But following the Parti Quebecois' ``heroic efforts'' to bring the
province`s deficit under control, it could soon start the planning for another
referendum before the next election, said Parizeau.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are still questions to solve like health, but at one point somebody
will say -- and that has to be the premier -- I push the button and we start,''
said Parizeau.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even with considerable experience in this, it takes two years before you
can think of going into a referendum.''
</P>
<P>
	   The former premier made the comments following a presentation to an
all-party committee studying Quebec`s counter legislation to the federal
government's proposed referendum rules.
</P>
<P>
	   Parizeau supported the province`s efforts to reaffirm the right of Quebecers
alone to decide their future, calling the law the basis for a constitution.

	   Romanow Stays Away From Saskatchewan Legislature
</P>
<P>
	   REGINA (AP) -- Not even a grandmother's hunger strike could get Premier Roy
Romanow back to the Saskatchewan legislature Wednesday to face angry farmers
occupying the building for a third straight day.
</P>
<P>
	   As Lillian Kurtz and dozens of other protesters dug in their heels, Romanow
cooled his 250 kilometers away in Saskatoon.
</P>
<P>
	   And it doesn't appear that either side is about to budge anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurtz, 49, has been on a hunger strike since Monday, when members of the
Saskatchewan Rally Group -- a grassroots organization demanding more provincial
aid money for farmers -- began occupying the legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   About three dozen protesters have slept in the cafeteria each night.
Reinforcements boost their numbers to about 100 each day.
</P>
<P>
	   They want the province to put up $300 million to help grain farmers
struggling through the worst year for farm incomes since the Depression.
</P>
<P>
	   Romanow maintains the province simply can't afford to bail out farmers and
argues it's Ottawa's duty to protect them from the unfair foreign competition
that created the crisis.

	   Report Says Secretive Counter-Terrorist Unit Should be Expanded
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Joint Task Force Two, the military's secretive
counter-terrorist unit, is too small to be used outside Canada in a serious
crisis and should be expanded, says a study last year from the Canadian Forces
Staff College.
</P>
<P>
	   The document, obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information
Act, looked at potential mobilization for a major future war.
</P>
<P>
	   It was part of the Toronto college's 45-week course to prepare majors for
more senior rank.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the RCMP is no longer actively involved in counter-terrorism, the
report said, more resources should be devoted to JTF2 ``before a war or national
domestic threat becomes a reality.'' stems from long-standing grievances that
just happen to be coming to a head at the same time.
</P>
<P>
	   But he also said the problems have been aggravated by provincial budget
slashing in the early 1990s followed by federal cutbacks to transfer payments
that started in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Tricon Global Earnings Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Tricon Global Restaurants, the company that owns
Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, on Wednesday reported a 42 percent increase in
fourth-quarter earnings, though sales declined by 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   For the quarter ended Dec. 25, the Louisville-based company had operating
earnings of $122 million, or 78 cents per share, compared with $87 million, or
55 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The results beat Wall Street estimates by 11 cents a share, according to
First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, earnings from continuing operations were $412 million, or
$2.58 per share, up from $286 million, or $1.83 per share, for all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Tricon reported $2.3 billion in revenues for the quarter, down from $2.5
billion in the year-ago period. Annual revenues were down 8 percent, to $7.8
billion from $8.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. revenues declined 13 percent for the quarter and 11 percent for the
year. Tricon attributed the decline to the re-franchising of nearly 300 stores.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales at the three restaurant chains increased 7 percent for the fourth
quarter and 6 percent for the year. Sales at Pizza Hut rose 6 percent in the
quarter, which David Novak, chief operating officer for Tricon, attributed to
strong sales of the Big New Yorker pizza.

<HEADLINE> Documents Surface in Coke Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN BACHMAN AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Coca-Cola Co. was a place where black employees formed
networking groups for "sanity checks" and to compare hostile work experiences,
according to documents the company released Wednesday to plaintiffs in a racial
discrimination lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   The documents, part of the ongoing discovery in the federal suit filed last
year, contain a December 1995 report on diversity from Carl Ware, the former
head of Coke's Africa Group, to M. Douglas Ivester, who then was Coke president
and will retire in April as chairman and CEO.
</P>
<P>
	   In the fall of 1995, Ware led a discussion group of five black senior Coke
officials who reviewed the company's efforts at diversifying its work force and
the environment in which black employees worked.
</P>
<P>
	   The group concluded that some black employees were seen as "lacking the
skills and intelligence to succeed in certain areas," and that group members
credited their advancement to mentors and their "ability to depersonalize
prejudicial behavior."
</P>
<P>
	   "To me this is like the litigation equivalent of the fall of the Berlin
Wall. They have no more moral standing left," said Cyrus Mehri, a Washington
attorney representing the eight plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
	   "The documents show that senior African-Americans at Coke earnestly and
constructively raised the issues to Doug Ivester ... and the red flags were
ignored."
</P>
<P>
	   Coke said neither Ware nor Ivester was available to discuss the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight current and former employees contend in a lawsuit that Coca-Cola has
discriminated against blacks in pay, promotion and performance evaluations.
Their lawyers are seeking to have the case declared a class action, expanding it
to represent more than 2,000 black employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Atlanta-based soft drink giant has denied the allegations of
discrimination and is fighting the efforts to certify the lawsuit as a class
action.
</P>
<P>
	   In an order made public Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Richard Story said the
parties must "attempt in good faith to settle this case by participating in
non-binding, confidential mediation," in which a neutral third party attempts to
reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   James Voyles, a Marietta attorney representing the plaintiffs, said
Wednesday that the mediation is expected to start in two to three weeks. He
declined to reveal who the mediator is.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke spokesman Ben Deutsch said the diversity report documents were made
public because "a great deal of attention has been focused on these documents
and we just want to be sure the information is put in the proper context."
</P>
<P>
	   Deutsch added, "The court had ordered us to hand over these documents to the
plaintiffs and we did so. We have nothing to be ashamed about or hide."
</P>
<P>
	   He said many of Ware's recommendations had been implemented, including a
formal minority recruitment and training program, a quarterly networking program
for black employees and diversity training for all managers starting this year.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Jack Stahl, who is to replace Daft as president, said the
company is committed to renewing its diversity efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   "While the company has taken some actions since that report was written, we
are not where we want to be where diversity is concerned," Stahl said. "We must
and will make accelerated progress."
</P>
<P>
	   Douglas Daft, who was elected president in December and has been tapped to
succeed Ivester, has made a series of swift management decisions in recent
weeks, including persuading Ware to change his mind about leaving the company
and announcing worldwide job cuts of 6,000 workers as the Atlanta-based company
struggles to stem declining profits.

<HEADLINE> Many Factors in Alaska Crash Search  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Besides searching the main wreckage area 10 miles off the coast of southern
California, Navy deep-sea salvage teams are exploring the ocean floor four miles
from the Alaska Airlines crash site for parts that might have torn off the
jetliner.
</P>
<P>
	   National Transportation Safety Board officials used radar hits to identify
what appeared to be debris falling away from the aircraft as it began its fatal
dive on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Finding the pieces depends on the size of the search area, the sea floor's
terrain and the number of other submerged objects that could provide false
leads.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If there are a bunch of other needles in the haystack and you're looking
for a particular one, you could pull that wrong one out a dozen times,''
Jonathan Howland, a research engineer with the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   If the wreckage fell in shipping lanes, for instance, it could be mixed with
general debris scattered across the sea floor, providing myriad hits on the
side-scan sonar, Howland said. Even natural features could be confused with the
wreckage, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It can be very difficult to tell whether it's an outcropping of rock or a
piece of something manmade,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Once sonar detects a ``contact'' -- something that might be what crews are
searching for -- a deep-sea robot examines the object.

<HEADLINE> Plane Collisions Prompt Debates  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Two recent collisions involving small airplanes have some
urging improved air traffic control for such aircraft, which often take off and
land at facilites without control towers.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, two small planes collided over suburban Chicago, killing three
and sending smoldering wreckage into a densely populated area. Only a day
before, four people died in Los Angeles after their planes collided over a golf
course.
</P>
<P>
	   Those who fly such planes call the collisions Monday and Tuesday a tragic
fluke. But others argue the accidents point to a problem.
</P>
<P>
	   National Transportation Safety Board investigators were sorting through
wreckage Wednesday in Zion, about 45 miles north of Chicago, to find clues to
what caused Tuesday's crash over a hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   The crash killed popular Chicago radio personality Bob Collins and a friend
flying with him, as well as the student pilot in the other plane.
</P>
<P>
	   A control tower at the nearby Waukegan Regional Airport had cleared both
Collins' two-seat Zlin stunt plane and the four-seat Cessna 172 to land, one
after the other.
</P>
<P>
	   But in this case, as with most operations of small, noncommercial planes, it
was up to the pilots to make sure their air space was clear before landing,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ideally, the pilots should be able to see each other,'' said David
Bowling, an NTSB air traffic investigator.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins and the student pilot, Sharon Hock, 31, both were warned of other
planes in the area, and Collins told controllers he saw Hock's plane.
</P>
<P>
	   But Hock, who had been practicing take-offs and landings, said she could not
see Collins' plane and investigators say it appears she may have turned into its
path.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators will check the aircraft for ``witness marks'' that would
indicate their positions when they collided, Bowling said. They also plan to
interview a third pilot who witnessed the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   The presence of a control tower at the Waukegan airport -- and at the Van
Nuys Airport, near the site of Monday's crash in Los Angeles -- is unusual.
</P>
<P>
	   Warren Morningstar, a spokesman for the Maryland-based Aircraft Owners and
Pilots Association, said only 543 of the about 5,300 public-use airports in the
United States have control towers.
</P>
<P>
	   That means pilots of smaller planes that are not tracked by radar must rely
on a common radio frequency, their instruments and their eyes to assure safety,
Morningstar said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fact that two such collisions occurred in such quick succession raises
questions about the ability of the pilots of small aircraft to monitor their own
actions, said Jim Poole, the Chicago-based regional vice president for the
National Air Traffic Controllers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Control towers that do exist are often understaffed, and other towers that
should still operate have been removed, leaving pilots that sometimes have very
little flying experience to muddle through a takeoff or landing with no
guidance, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Certainly you're cutting the cost ... but you're also cutting the
safety,'' Poole said.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the time, the ``rules of the road'' approach to flying works, FAA
statistics show. In 1998, for example, general aviation aircraft -- those that
are not government, military or commercial -- had 1,907 accidents, or 7.12 per
100,000 flight hours. Of those, 361 were fatal.
</P>
<P>
	   Midair collisions were extremely rare, with preliminary NTSB data for 1999
showing 18 such crashes.

<HEADLINE> Congressman Finds Dead Woman  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Indiana congressman discovered the body of a woman
lying in blood in his apartment building on Capitol Hill this week, an aide said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Edward Pease was leaving the Hill House Apartments around 7 a.m. Monday
on his way to the Capitol a few blocks away when he found the body at the bottom
of a stairwell, said Brian Kerns, the congressman's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was quite shaken and disturbed by the entire incident,'' Kerns said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pease felt the woman's back to see if she was breathing and then returned to
his apartment to call 911, Kerns said. Pease waited for police to arrive to let
them into the secure building where several members of Congress live.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerns said Pease didn't know the woman, who also lived in the building, but
he had said hello to her occasionally while passing in the hall.
</P>
<P>
	   Police identified the woman as Mary Katherine Shaw, 55, and said she had
apparently suffered blunt force injuries to her head. It was not known what
caused her injuries. The District of Columbia medical examiner's office was
conducting an autopsy.
</P>
<P>
	   Pease, a second-term Republican, has had a string of bad luck since coming
to Washington in 1996. Soon after taking office, the congressman's apartment was
broken into and the burglars stole clothes and ate his food, Kerns said. In
1998, Pease was robbed at gunpoint while delivering Christmas presents to
friends in suburban Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Pease, 48, has also suffered heart problems and partly for that reason has
decided not to seek re-election, Kerns said.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted of 1976 Murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- A man was convicted Wednesday of the 1976 murder of a
teen-age girl, after the jury rejected his claim that her death was accidental
but he tried to make it look like a crime.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury needed just 25 minutes to convict James Brian Kuenn, 40, of
first-degree murder in the slaying of 16-year-old Carol Hutto, with whom he had
a secret romance. Hutto's partially clad body was found in a shallow pond,
weighed down with concrete blocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Kuenn, who has spent his adult life in the Navy, could face life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors alleged that Kuenn killed the girl after she refused to have sex
with him. DNA evidence linked him to the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   Kuenn said that the girl's death was an accident, and that he tried to hide
his involvement with her by making her death look like a crime committed by
someone else.
</P>
<P>
	   Kuenn said he and Hutto had arranged a rendezvous at a house under
construction. He said they were chasing each other in the house when she fell
backward.
</P>
<P>
	   Kuenn said he tried to revive her, but couldn't. He said he took Hutto's
clothes off, made strangulation marks with his hands on her neck and hit her
with a piece of wood to make it appear as if she'd been attacked. He dumped her
body in a pond behind the house.
</P>
<P>
	   An autopsy determined that Hutto had drowned.
</P>
<P>
	   The case had been unsolved for nearly two decades when a detective reopened
the file in 1994 and saw that Kuenn -- whose name was found in Hutto's diary --
hadn't been ruled out as a suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   The detective interviewed Kuenn and noticed that he gave a different
explanation of his whereabouts. That reopened the investigation, and by then,
police had a new weapon -- advanced DNA testing that could be used on smaller
bits of evidence.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Air Inspecting Fleet  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM VERDIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The builder of MD-80 jetliners urged airlines Wednesday
to inspect their fleets after a damaged piece of the tail wing that could have
contributed to the crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 was recovered.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boeing Co. recommended that mechanics visually check the jackscrew that
moves the horizontal stabilizer, a tail-mounted wing that is the focus of the
investigation into the Jan. 31 crash that killed 88 people off the coast of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
	   The recommendation covers about 2,000 planes, in the MD-80 series like the
Alaska Airlines plane, as well as MD-90s, DC-9s and Boeing 717s.
</P>
<P>
	   Carriers should check the jackscrew assemblies at their convenience, Boeing
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prior to the Boeing announcement, Alaska Airlines and American Airlines on
Wednesday ordered inspections of their MD-80 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
	   A two-foot section of the screw was recovered with the main wreckage of the
MD-83 about 10 miles off the coast. At first Alaska said Wednesday the jackscrew
was found to be stripped, but later the airline changed its statement and said
only that the screw had been damaged, reflecting the description by the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It appeared to investigators who looked at the mechanism ... that there
was some damage to it,'' NTSB Chairman James Hall said. ``It was unclear whether
the damage was pre-impact or from hitting the water.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska said it would inspect all 34 of its MD-80 series planes as a
precaution. The inspections were expected to be completed by the end of
Wednesday and were not expected to cause significant service delays.
</P>
<P>
	   American said it would take a week to complete inspections on its 284 MD-80s
and MD-90s.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This voluntary inspection should alleviate public concerns following the
Alaska Airlines accident,'' American Vice Chairman Bob Baker said.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 1,100 MD-80 series aircraft are flown by nearly 70 airlines
worldwide, making them some of the most popular commercial jetliners ever built.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Aviation Administration has not told airlines to make additional
checks of the tail section of MD-80 series aircraft, but that could change as
the investigation evolves, agency spokesman Paul Turk said. ``We won't hesitate
to do whatever is necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators in the Alaska Airlines crash are focusing on the stabilizer, a
wing-like device on the jet's tail, because pilots reported problems with it
after taking off from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, for San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   The jackscrew is powered by two motors and resembles the corkscrew-like
device that opens many automatic garage doors. If the jackscrew was damaged
during flight, the horizontal stabilizer could move beyond its normal range,
causing the tail wing to stall, or lose its lift, said William Waldock,
associate director for the Center for Aerospace Safety Education at Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
	   It would be nearly impossible to recover from such a stall, Waldock said.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilots would not be able to control the up-or-down motion of the
aircraft -- which would be consistent with flight data that shows the plane went
into a 3.4-mile nosedive and radar tracking that shows something may have fallen
off the plane as the dive began.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane's autopilot was disengaged when the jetliner reached 29,000 feet,
and the jet was flown manually for one hour and 53 minutes. Pilots say it is
unusual to fly manually for that long and could suggest a problem with the
autopilot or any number of other systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said the MD-83 involved in the crash had two maintenance write-ups
last fall for problems with the horizontal stabilizer. In October, the system
was checked and the plane returned to service. A month later, mechanics replaced
a switch.

<HEADLINE> 'Beach' Film Blights Real Islands  </HEADLINE>
   By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAYA BAY, Thailand (AP) -- ``The Beach,'' which premiered in London on
Wednesday starring Leonardo DiCaprio, tells the story of an amoral backpacker
whose quest for the perfect tropical beach leads him to a secret commune on a
remote Thai island.
</P>
<P>
	   But utopia isn't quite what it seems and paradise turns into bloody
savagery. Likewise, the image of sunny, sandy perfection achieved in making the
20th Century Fox film has destroyed the once-pristine beach where it was shot,
environmentalists say.
</P>
<P>
	   Maya Bay, a strip of sand and vegetation backed by dramatic cliffs, is
located on Phi Phi Le island, part of a national park about 350 miles south of
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of its islands have been blighted by developers who bribed corrupt
officials to look the other way while bungalows and hotels sprang up in
theoretically protected areas. Phi Phi Le and the beach at Maya Bay were largely
spared, providing a setting worthy of Alex Garland's best-selling novel.
</P>
<P>
	   But for filmmakers, led by director Danny Boyle and producer Andrew
Macdonald, who earned fame with ``Shallow Grave'' and ``Trainspotting,'' it
wasn't quite perfect enough.
</P>
<P>
	   After obtaining permits from the Forestry Department and paying a $110,000
damage deposit, the filmmakers brought in bulldozers to widen and flatten the
beach and strip away native grasses, scrub and other vegetation. They also
removed a lot of garbage that had washed ashore.
</P>
<P>
	   Seizing on the film's high profile, activists who had for years
unsuccessfully campaigned against the environmental damage to Thailand's parks
joined with local residents in a series of demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
	   They succeeded in getting the number of coconut trees -- a non-indigenous
species -- planted by the filmmakers reduced from about 100 to 60, but they lost
court challenges to impose a restraining order on filming.
</P>
<P>
	   The filmmakers pledged to restore the beach to its original state and set
stakes in the sand to prevent erosion.
</P>
<P>
	   But by the time the monsoon season ended in November, it became clear the
stakes didn't work nearly as well as native vegetation. More sand than anyone
could remember was washed away by the annual storms.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, Thai tourism officials, eager to cash in on publicity from the
film, have offered travel agents free trips to Thailand for so-called ``DiCaprio
Tours'' -- further angering activists, who have brought a $2.6 million lawsuit
against Fox, the Forestry Department and the Agriculture Ministry for damage to
Maya Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Their campaign is about greed, not reality,'' said Prasertpongse Sornuwat,
a local council member. ``There is no beautiful beach anymore. They just want to
cash in on the movie, with no concern about environmental impact.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some tourists agree.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The beach looks awful,'' said Alastair Short, 40, a tourist from
Worcester, England, visiting the island with friends. ``We decided to come by
and see with our own eyes what had happened. It's just a shame.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've gotten close to 30 signatures a day from tourists who promise they
won't patronize the movie, because it was made by damaging the environment of
the island,'' Prasertpongse said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Thai theater owners say they are not worried and have plastered
cinemas with posters of DiCaprio emerging from the sea ahead of the film's
release next month in Thailand. It opens Friday in U.S. theaters.
</P>
<P>
	   A lawyer for 20th Century Fox defended the filmmakers, saying they took
every precaution and the erosion was caused by unusually severe storms, not the
filmmakers' actions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We only need to give the beach time to recover on its own,'' said the
lawyer, Dusit Walee. ``I'm confident the claim about the erosion is
groundless.''
</P>
<P>
	   The damage to Maya Bay may not be finished yet. Ecologists fear the loosened
sand could damage fragile coral reefs on the beach front.
</P>
<P>
	   That could threaten the livelihoods of hundreds of boatmen who bring
sunbathers to Maya Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Maya Bay is falling apart in front of us,'' said Surat Saewkok, who has
taken tourists sight-seeing here for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Who wants to visit an eroding beach?'' Surat said. ``The film people are
all gone and are going to make money selling their movie, but villagers here are
paying the price.''

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Museum Recovers Artifacts  </HEADLINE>
   By LEON BARKHO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- The Iraqi Museum has recovered more than 5,000
artifacts from southern Iraq, some that had been buried for nearly 5,000 years,
the country's chief archaeologist said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The finds were made at three little-known sites that date back to the
Sumerian civilization of 3000 to 2000 B.C., said Rabi'ya al-Qaisy.
</P>
<P>
	   The museum rushed excavation teams to the area following reports that
antiquity smugglers were pilfering the sites, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq is in a race with antiquity traffickers who are believed to have
intensified their scavenging of ancient sites in southern Iraq despite heavy
penalties.
</P>
<P>
	   Foremost among the recovered artifacts are scores of cylinder seals which
Iraqis used as signatures in the Sumerian period, said Raya Younis, a scientist
at the museum.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some of the impressions on these seals, as well as their size and
manufacture, are unique to the long history of Mesopotamia,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some seals show lions hunting gazelles and goats. Other show revelers
drinking alcohol, mainly beer, which the Sumerians made from barley and dates.
</P>
<P>
	   One signature depicts a sick man on a bed with physicians preparing herbal
medicine while a mythical bird -- the enzu -- hovers overhead. The enzu has the
head of a lion and the wings of a falcon. Raya said it was the symbol of
Ningersu, the Sumerian god of death and war.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are fascinating seals of which only a handful exist in world
museums,'' Raya said.
</P>
<P>
	   The archaeologists also found clay tablets inscribed in cuneiform. One
tablet details the food rations that the Sumerians used to pay civil servants,
soldiers and workers.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Great-Uncles Have Had DUIs  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Attorneys for Elian Gonzalez's great-uncle have asked a
federal judge to appoint an independent guardian to represent the 6-year-old's
legal interests.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of the boy's Miami relatives say the move will send a message to
the judge that they have his best interests at heart. But run-ins with the law
by some of those relatives may play a role in the custody dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   Records show Lazaro Gonzalez, the great-uncle, and his brother Delfin
Gonzalez have been convicted of driving under the influence twice in the past
decade. Two of Elian's cousins, Jose and Luis Cid, have also been in trouble.
Both have been arrested several times on felony charges.
</P>
<P>
	   The relatives' legal problems could become an issue as Lazaro Gonzalez
attempts to keep the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ideally one would not want a father figure with a history of DUI because
that would suggest a history of alcoholism,'' said Carole Lieberman, a Beverly
Hills, Calif., psychiatrist and expert in custody cases.
</P>
<P>
	   But Dr. Gilbert Kliman, Medical Director of the Children's Psychological
Trauma Center in San Francisco, said the DUI cases will probably not be the
deciding factor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The history of the attachments and the qualities of the attachments
between the child and the various parties may far outweigh the importance of the
DUIs,'' Kliman said. ``I think it would be in most cases a minor factor unless
it's associated with other evidence of substance abuse.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Havana on Wednesday, Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National
Assembly, said it was not in Elian's best interests to remain with the Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``According to my research, practically everyone surrounding him either has
been, or may be in the future, joining the prison system in the U.S.,'' he said.
``That's an additional reason, as if more reasons were needed, to immediately
place the boy in a safer place.''
</P>
<P>
	   Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Miami relatives, dismissed the
criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian is surrounded by love. Alarcon does not know the word love,'' he
said. ``The cousins don't even live here, they don't come around. And Alarcon
should know better than to try to trash a poor working family which have given
only love to this little boy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was rescued off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25 after a boating
accident that took the life of his mother and 10 others. Elian's father and four
grandparents live in Cuba and want him back.
</P>
<P>
	   But Elian's relatives in Miami say the boy should stay with them out of
respect to his mother, who died to give her child freedom in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazaro Gonzalez has filed a lawsuit seeking to block Elian's return to Cuba.
On Feb. 22, U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler will hear arguments to decide
whether the lawsuit should go forward.
</P>
<P>
	   In an 18-page motion filed Tuesday, Hoeveler was asked to honor a ruling by
Miami-Dade County Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez last month granting Lazaro
Gonzalez temporary emergency custody of the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether or not Hoeveler recognizes Rodriguez's ruling, attorneys want him to
appoint a guardian to represent Elian in legal matters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There has to be a chance for the courts to determine what is best for this
young boy,'' said Kendall Coffey, an attorney representing the boy's Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   But experts said the move could backfire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An independent person could recommend to the court that the whole matter
be dismissed and that the child be reunited with the parent,'' said Bernard
Perlmutter, director of the University of Miami's Children and Youth Law Clinic.

<HEADLINE> Tricon Global Earnings Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Tricon Global Restaurants, the company that owns
Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, on Wednesday reported a 41 percent increase in
fourth-quarter earnings, though sales declined by 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   For the quarter ended Dec. 25, the Louisville-based company had operating
earnings of $122 million, or 78 cents per share, compared with $87 million, or
55 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The results beat Wall Street estimates by 11 cents a share, according to
First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, earnings from continuing operations were $412 million, or
$2.58 per share, up 44 percent from $286 million, or $1.83 per share, for all of
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Tricon reported $2.3 billion in revenues for the quarter, down from $2.5
billion in the year-ago period. Annual revenues were down 8 percent, to $7.8
billion from $8.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. revenues declined 13 percent for the quarter and 11 percent for the
year. Tricon attributed the decline to the re-franchising of nearly 300 stores.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales at the three restaurant chains increased 7 percent for the fourth
quarter and 6 percent for the year. Sales at Pizza Hut rose 6 percent in the
quarter, which David Novak, chief operating officer for Tricon, attributed to
strong sales of the Big New Yorker pizza.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, 'Inner Nerd' Touch Base  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   McALLEN, Texas (AP) -- With his final budget gone to Congress and his wife
seeking entree into the Senate, President Clinton did Wednesday what any
suddenly un-busy politician would do: hit the road.
</P>
<P>
	   The president came to Texas to raise $1.1 million for Democrats -- and he
vowed to the handful of reporters in tow that he doesn't miss the campaign trail
at all.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You guys are going to have a great time,'' Clinton bellowed as he bounded
through the press cabin aboard Air Force One. He noted that the temperature in
south Texas was above 80 degrees.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was appearing at two fund-raising events here and one later in
Dallas that were bringing in $850,000 for the Democratic National Committee and
$250,000 for the re-election bid of Rep. Ruben Hinojosa, D-Texas. That brought
to 14 the number of fundraisers Clinton has done this year, five of them in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the first time in two decades, I'm not on the ballot anywhere,'' he
announced to the Hinojosa luncheon. He said that qualifies him to discuss this
year's presidential election, and explain why the winner ought to pick up where
he left off on the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   He then lingered for a roundtable discussion of local concerns before going
to a second fund-raising event, where he told the crowd he wanted to speak not
as president but ``as a citizen of this country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton thanked the audience for the support the Rio Grande Valley has given
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton for her Senate bid. He said he spoke with her
Wednesday, and believes her campaign is going well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you can measure how well you're doing by how hard they attack you --
which I always thought was a pretty good measure -- she's a cinch,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, at a DNC fund-raiser in Dallas, Clinton defended the party against
GOP attacks that it was beholden to Hollywood, labor unions, homosexuals and
trial lawyers, casting the Democrats as the party of inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I plead guilty to believing that we should not deprive people of jobs or
subject them to violence just because they're gay,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe everybody counts, everybody ought to have a chance, and we all
do better when we help each other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton vacillated between serious and goofy subjects Wednesday, railing
about the pace of Senate hearings for his judicial nominees, then marveling
about the warm weather. He pointed out that, while en route to the luncheon, he
saw a golf course without snow on it for the first time in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've been here now, I guess, three times,'' Clinton said of his latest
stop in south Texas. ``If it were up to me, I'd come once a month.''
</P>
<P>
	   He accused Senate Republicans of ``deliberate slow-walking'' his judicial
nominees, and urged the crowd to press senators for action. Particularly, he
cited Enrique Moreno of El Paso, a Harvard Law graduate Clinton nominated for
the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The American Bar Association said he was highly qualified to be a judge,''
Clinton said. ``I cannot even get a hearing because your senators won't support
it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Otherwise, Clinton waxed on about the goals he set for his 1992 campaign --
putting Americans ahead of politics.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last few days, Clinton has engaged in such memory lane rhetoric more
often than he did in the past, as if he's constantly bracing for the day he's no
longer in office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are always coming to me saying, 'Oh, this must be a real downer for
you, you know, that the vice president and Hillary, they're out there
(campaigning),''' Clinton said Tuesday. ``I said, 'Well, I'm using this
opportunity to get in touch with my inner nerd.'''
</P>
<P>
	   At one point Wednesday, he spotted former Texas Attorney General Dan Morales
in the crowd and jokingly asked the Democrat, who did not seek a third term in
1998: ``Is there life after politics, Dan?''
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday night, he described the sense of watching this year's election from
the outside as ``rather interesting. I feel like the cat that ate the canary
some days.''
</P>
<P>
	   But there are fewer and fewer reporters on hand to hear Clinton's thoughts.
Most of them have turned their attention to Vice President Al Gore or Texas Gov.
George Bush, the Democratic and Republican presidential front-runners.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, there were so few reporters aboard the chartered press plane
to Texas that White House aides pointed out there was ample room in the back for
those who wanted to stretch out for a nap during the three-hour flight.
</P>
<P>
	   Roughly a dozen news organizations accompanied Clinton on Wednesday, about
half the number of a year ago when his Senate impeachment trial was nearing a
close.

Government Faces Questions About Human Resources Grants
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Eight numbered companies that got $3.9 million in grants from
the Human Resources Department can't be traced through corporate ownership
lists, say Conservative MPs Jean Dube and Peter MacKay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There doesn't seem to be any indication that these companies even exist,''
a frustrated Dube said Wednesday after raising the matter in the Commons.
</P>
<P>
	   Tory researchers tried unsuccessfully to find listings for the firms in
databases compiled by Dunn and Bradstreet, Statistics Canada and other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   MacKay maintained that raises serious questions about the government's
ability to track its spending and ensure that job creation and other projects
are achieving desired goals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What's dodgy about numbered companies, as everyone knows, is you can set
these companies up very quickly -- there's no level of accountability,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ghislain Charron, a department spokesman, said the fact that cash went to a
numbered company does not mean bureaucrats don't know who is getting it or what
is happening to it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The project can be (listed) under a numbered company, but the check is
always sent to an accountant somewhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Contracts are signed with individuals, not anonymous numbers, and the
department has their names, addresses and telephone numbers.

Federal Budget To Be Presented Feb. 28
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Days after his boss let the fiscal cat out of the bag,
Finance Minister Paul Martin confirmed Wednesday that he'll bring down the
federal budget on Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Jean Chretien told reporters late last week the budget would
come out at the end of the month, leading to broad speculation that meant Feb.
28.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin confirmed the date Wednesday in the Commons under questioning by the
Opposition Reform party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is true that there was a little bit of speculation last week from an
unknown source as to the date of the budget but I am pleased to announce that
speculation was accurate,'' he said, as Chretien chuckled nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin refused to comment later.

Parizeau: Referendum Planning Will Take at Least Two Years
</P>
<P>
	   QUEBEC (AP) -- It will take the Quebec government two years to re-do all the
homework needed to prepare for sovereignty because the existing research is
outdated, former premier Jacques Parizeau said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   But following the Parti Quebecois' ``heroic efforts'' to bring the
province`s deficit under control, it could soon start the planning for another
referendum before the next election, said Parizeau.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are still questions to solve like health, but at one point somebody
will say -- and that has to be the premier -- I push the button and we start,''
said Parizeau.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even with considerable experience in this, it takes two years before you
can think of going into a referendum.''
</P>
<P>
	   The former premier made the comments following a presentation to an
all-party committee studying Quebec`s counter legislation to the federal
government's proposed referendum rules.
</P>
<P>
	   Parizeau supported the province`s efforts to reaffirm the right of Quebecers
alone to decide their future, calling the law the basis for a constitution.

Romanow Stays Away From Saskatchewan Legislature
</P>
<P>
	   REGINA, Saskatchewan (AP) -- Not even a grandmother's hunger strike could
get Premier Roy Romanow back to the Saskatchewan legislature Wednesday to face
angry farmers occupying the building for a third straight day.
</P>
<P>
	   As Lillian Kurtz and dozens of other protesters dug in their heels, Romanow
cooled his 250 kilometers away in Saskatoon.
</P>
<P>
	   And it doesn't appear that either side is about to budge anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurtz, 49, has been on a hunger strike since Monday, when members of the
Saskatchewan Rally Group -- a grassroots organization demanding more provincial
aid money for farmers -- began occupying the legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   About three dozen protesters have slept in the cafeteria each night.
Reinforcements boost their numbers to about 100 each day.
</P>
<P>
	   They want the province to put up $300 million to help grain farmers
struggling through the worst year for farm incomes since the Depression.
</P>
<P>
	   Romanow maintains the province simply can't afford to bail out farmers and
argues it's Ottawa's duty to protect them from the unfair foreign competition
that created the crisis.

Report Says Secretive Counter-Terrorist Unit Should be Expanded
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Joint Task Force Two, the military's secretive
counter-terrorist unit, is too small to be used outside Canada in a serious
crisis and should be expanded, says a study last year from the Canadian Forces
Staff College.
</P>
<P>
	   The document, obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information
Act, looked at potential mobilization for a major future war.
</P>
<P>
	   It was part of the Toronto college's 45-week course to prepare majors for
more senior rank.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the RCMP is no longer actively involved in counter-terrorism, the
report said, more resources should be devoted to JTF2 ``before a war or national
domestic threat becomes a reality.'' stems from long-standing grievances that
just happen to be coming to a head at the same time.
</P>
<P>
	   But he also said the problems have been aggravated by provincial budget
slashing in the early 1990s followed by federal cutbacks to transfer payments
that started in 1994.

<HEADLINE> France Turns Over Rwandan Minister  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A French court on Wednesday authorized the transfer a former
Rwandan education minister to an international court to stand trial on charges
of genocide.
</P>
<P>
	   Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda, 46, is accused of crimes against humanity during the
killings and massacres that swept Rwanda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   He was arrested in late November in the central French town of Bourges on a
warrant issued by the U.N. International Criminal Tribunal. He has been held in
the La Sante prison in Paris.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. Security Council established the tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania, in
November 1994 to prosecute the architects and chief perpetrators of the
government-sponsored slaughter of minority Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Prime Minister Jean Kambanda pleaded guilty to genocide in September
1998, and was sentenced to life in prison, the court's maximum penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Tribunal investigators have been in Europe recently searching for genocide
suspects who fled after Tutsi-led rebels from exile seized power in July 1994
ending the genocide.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rejects Casino Killer Request  </HEADLINE>
   By ANGIE WAGNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Confessed child killer Jeremy Strohmeyer lost his bid
Wednesday to withdraw his guilty plea and go to trial for the murder of a
7-year-old in a casino restroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Strohmeyer's claims that his attorneys coerced him into pleading guilty and
did not represent him properly were rejected by Judge Joseph Bonaventure, who
said the 21-year-old had ``the A-team of counsel.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``With the passage of time, the reality of being behind bars the rest of
one's life must become more and more disheartening,'' Bonaventure said. ``But to
poor little Sherrice, she will never again be able to walk upon this earth.''
</P>
<P>
	   Strohmeyer's new attorneys wanted the trial that their client gave up when
he pleaded guilty to killing Sherrice Iverson in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Strohmeyer was sentenced to four life terms with no chance of parole.
</P>
<P>
	   One of his former attorneys, Richard Wright, testified Wednesday that he and
Strohmeyer's other attorney, Leslie Abramson, both told their client that if a
jury couldn't decide on a sentence, they were fearful that a three-judge panel
would vote for the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Strohmeyer claimed in testimony Tuesday that he doesn't remember what
happened in May 1997 when Sherrice's body was found propped up on a toilet seat
in a women's restroom of the Primadonna hotel-casino in Primm, about 45 miles
south of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonaventure described Strohmeyer's tale of an alcohol-induced blackout
during the time of the attack as a ``self-serving and embellished view.''
</P>
<P>
	   Strohmeyer claimed Abramson, the Los Angeles attorney best known for
defending Lyle and Erik Menendez, pressured him into taking a plea bargain by
telling him he would be convicted and sentenced to death if the case went to
trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Abramson denied that. Wright testified that his own notes indicated that the
plea agreement was Strohmeyer's idea.
</P>
<P>
	   After Bonaventure read his decision, Strohmeyer mouthed ``I love you'' to
his family as he was led out of the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think justice was done a year ago, and I think justice was done again
today,'' District Attorney Stewart Bell said after the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Strohmeyer's attorneys said they may appeal the decision.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was slightly higher against the yen Thursday
morning ahead of a long weekend in Japan. Tokyo stocks fell moderately.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 108.86 yen at late morning, up 0.08 yen from late
Wednesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 109.11 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 170.07 points, or 0.85
percent, to 19,837.70 at the end of the morning session. On Wednesday, the
average closed up 138.89 points, or 0.70 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, traders were expecting the dollar to stay in a narrow
range Thursday in the absence of major market-moving news.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 108.18 yen, up from 108.06 yen
late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices opened lower on selling of high technology and
telecommunications issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Also affecting the stock market were concerns that Japan may slip back into
a recession. Those worries came after Economic Planning Agency chief Taichi
Sakaiya said recently that the country's gross domestic product is likely to
have contracted in the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 258.44 points to close at
10,699.16 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 16.21 points, or 0.93 percent, to 1,731.62. The TOPIX closed up
10.28 points, or 0.59 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.8400
percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.8750 percent. Its price rose 0.29 percent
to 98.80.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial markets in Tokyo will be closed Friday for a national holiday.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Plane Hijack Talks Held  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROLINE BYRNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Contact with the hijackers of an Afghan airliner
broke down Wednesday after the flight crew escaped, but police regained
communication and expressed confidence they were on track to win release of the
150-plus hostages aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations to free about 150 hostages on board the Ariana Air were
continuing through the night, with police were concentrating on meeting the
needs of the hostages. Police said they were willing to wait things out.
</P>
<P>
	   Early Thursday, two unidentified people were seen walking down the rear
stairs of the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are right in the middle of some very sensitive stuff,'' said Kim White,
a spokeswoman for the Essex County Police. ``We're hopeful that this will be a
good sign and this will be the start of some movement.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police said they believe it may be a critical point in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   The negotiations became strained after four crew members staged a daring
escape through a cockpit window a night earlier. Police were left to wonder if
anyone aboard could fly the Ariana airlines Boeing 727.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can imagine their (the captors) reactions when they discovered that
the flight crew had gone,'' said Joe Edwards, an assistant chief constable of
Essex County police. ``Perhaps understandably, things went quiet.''
</P>
<P>
	   But contact resumed later Wednesday at Stansted airport near London and
negotiators grew more hopeful about the release of the 150-plus hostages.
Edwards said negotiations were going well.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiators insisted that the armed men had made no formal demands,
political or otherwise. The men, believed to be Afghans armed with grenades,
pistols and daggers, had requested only that food, water and other comfort items
be brought to the plane, parked on a runway.
</P>
<P>
	   Speculation mounted in the British media, however, that the plane was seized
as part of an elaborate bid for political asylum -- and that some of the
hostages were in on it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``HI-HOAX? Hijackers and hostages may be asylum seekers,'' the tabloid
Mirror blared on its front page. The Daily Star lamented ``Oh no! They ALL want
to stay (and we'll have to pay).''
</P>
<P>
	   Fueling the asylum speculation was the arrival Tuesday of an observer from
the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. The observer would be
providing expertise but would not be joining the negotiating team, said Edwards.
The commission's London office identified the observer as Hope Hanlan.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to questions about the validity of the asylum theory, Edwards
said: ``Why are they still in there? We've been asking them to come out since
Monday.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was believed that 151 people, including 21 children, remained aboard the
aircraft, which was hijacked early Sunday 20 minutes into a domestic flight
leaving Kabul, Afghanistan's capital. It then began a meandering journey across
the former Soviet Union, stopping in Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Among them were 39 members of one family who were traveling to a wedding in
the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif -- including the would-be bride, said
Mohammed Daoud Sharisi, who sells tickets at the Ariana office in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
	   Early in the day, the hijackers ejected a flight attendant, who was seen
being sent forcibly down a set of stairs at the rear of the plane. His departure
came four hours after four crew members -- the captain, second captain, first
officer and flight engineer -- escaped by using a rope to lower themselves from
the cockpit and jumping onto the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we are not able to determine is whether any of the remaining crew on
board or any of the passengers are able to fly this aircraft,'' said John
Broughton, an assistant chief constable of Essex County police.
</P>
<P>
	   Four men, presumed to be hijackers, appeared briefly on the ground at the
rear of the plane Wednesday morning to collect fresh supplies. That evening, two
men descended the jet's rear steps and collected an evening meal -- a result of
the continuing negotiations. They appeared to carry out an inspection of the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the crew members, the hijackers have released 31 passengers
so far.
</P>
<P>
	   In Kabul, an Ariana employee said Wednesday that several airline officials
responsible for security checks on the hijacked flight had been arrested. An
Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said several
employees were questioned but allowed to go back to work.

<HEADLINE> Continental Attendants OK Contract  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HOUSTON (AP) -- Continental Airlines has reached a tentative contract
agreement with the union representing its 8,500 flight attendants, the carrier
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Continental said the new collective bargaining agreement includes
significant improvements in pay, retirement and vacation benefits and work
rules. Neither the airline nor the International Association of Machinists would
release specific terms of the contract, which still must be ratified by the
union.
</P>
<P>
	   "We promised the industry's best flight attendants that their contract would
not only contain industry standard pay, but would be the type of agreement
worthy of the best in the business," Continental chairman and CEO Gordon Bethune
said. "I am pleased to say that after five months of intensive negotiations
we've managed to do just that."
</P>
<P>
	   The 54-month contract also contains a domestic partner package and extends
companion travel to all flight attendants, Continental said.
</P>
<P>
	   Union spokesman Joseph Tiberi said he could not discuss details of the
contract until it had been presented to the flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do believe it's worthy of their consideration and they should look at
carefully," he said.

<HEADLINE> Security Established in Lee Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD BENKE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Strict security procedures have been established
by lawyers involved in the trial of former Los Alamos National Laboratory
scientist Wen Ho Lee, who is accused of mishandling classified information.
</P>
<P>
	   The order issued Tuesday by U.S. District Judge John Conway -- and agreed to
by both the prosecution and the defense -- establishes secure work areas in
Albuquerque, where the courthouse is located, and at Los Alamos for Lee and his
lawyers to discuss classified materials at issue in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee is accused of downloading classified information onto unsecured
computers and onto several computer tapes -- seven of which prosecutors contend
may still exist. Lee has said they were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
	   He is charged with breaching lab security, but not with espionage. He faces
59 counts and could get life in prison if convicted. He has appealed a ruling
that he be held without bail pending trial, which may be a year away.
</P>
<P>
	   Conway's order says no classified materials used in the trial are to be
copied or removed from secured areas, and it says only secured computers may be
used.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors contend Lee, 60, stole enough nuclear secrets to build a
functional thermonuclear weapon. They have called the information downloaded by
Lee the ``crown jewels'' of American science.
</P>
<P>
	   But in a court brief filed last week, the defense contended the taped
information was far from ``top secret.'' They said, instead, the tapes contained
information with the lesser classification of secret or confidential-restricted.

<HEADLINE> Congressman Finds Dead Woman  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Indiana congressman discovered the body of a woman
lying in blood in his apartment building on Capitol Hill this week, an aide said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Edward Pease was leaving the Hill House Apartments around 7 a.m. Monday
on his way to work when he found the body of one of his neighbors at the bottom
of a stairwell, said Brian Kerns, the congressman's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was quite shaken and disturbed by the entire incident,'' Kerns said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pease felt the woman's back and found she wasn't breathing, Kerns said. He
returned to his apartment to call 911 and then waited for police to arrive to
let them into the secure building where several members of Congress live.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerns said Pease didn't know the woman, who also lived in the building, but
he had said hello to her occasionally while passing in the hall.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman was Mary Katherine Shaw, 55, said Sgt. Joseph Gentile of the
Washington Police Department. She had apparently died of a blunt-force injury to
the head, Gentile said, but it was not clear what caused the injury.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She could have fallen over the railing and onto the stairwell,'' Gentile
said. The District of Columbia medical examiner's office was conducting an
autopsy.
</P>
<P>
	   Pease, a second-term Republican, has had a string of bad experiences since
coming to Washington in 1996. Soon after taking office, the congressman's
apartment was broken into and the burglars stole clothes and ate his food, Kerns
said. In 1998, Pease was robbed at gunpoint while delivering Christmas presents
to friends in suburban Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Pease, 48, has also suffered heart problems and partly for that reason has
decided not to seek re-election, Kerns said.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Air Inspecting Fleet  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM VERDIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The builder of MD-80 jetliners urged airlines Wednesday
to inspect their fleets after a damaged piece of the tail wing that could have
contributed to the crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 was recovered.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boeing Co. recommended that mechanics visually check the jackscrew that
moves the horizontal stabilizer, a tail-mounted wing that is the focus of the
investigation into the Jan. 31 crash that killed 88 people off the coast of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
	   The recommendation covers about 2,000 planes, in the MD-80 series like the
Alaska Airlines plane, as well as MD-90s, DC-9s and Boeing 717s.
</P>
<P>
	   Carriers should check the jackscrew assemblies at their convenience, Boeing
said. Boeing bought aircraft builder McDonnell Douglas in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Inspection reports will be studied by the Federal Aviation Administration,
which can order further action if it finds evidence of a safety problem.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've been talking to the carriers and strongly encouraging them to make
this inspection as rapidly as possible,'' said FAA spokesman Eliot Brenner.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska, American and Delta airlines said earlier in the day they had begun
inspecting their fleets. Some schedule delays were possible, airline officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska expected to have its 34-plane fleet inspected within hours, American
said it would take a week to look at its 284 series planes and Delta said all
136 of its series planes would be inspected by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
	   Pilots aboard the ill-fated flight spent their final minutes struggling to
control the stabilizer before the aircraft nose-dived into the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
	   A two-foot section of the jackscrew was recovered with the main wreckage of
the MD-83 about 10 miles off the coast. At first Alaska said Wednesday the
jackscrew was found to be stripped, but later the airline changed its statement
and said only that the screw had been damaged, reflecting the description by the
National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It appeared to investigators who looked at the mechanism ... that there
was some damage to it,'' NTSB Chairman James Hall said. ``It was unclear whether
the damage was pre-impact or from hitting the water.''
</P>
<P>
	   More than 1,100 MD-80 series aircraft are flown by nearly 70 airlines
worldwide, making them some of the most popular commercial jetliners ever built.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Aviation Administration has not told airlines to make additional
checks of the tail section of MD-80 series aircraft, but that could change as
the investigation evolves, agency spokesman Paul Turk said. ``We won't hesitate
to do whatever is necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators in the Alaska Airlines crash are focusing on the stabilizer, a
wing-like device on the jet's tail, because pilots reported problems with it
after taking off from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, for San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   The jackscrew is powered by two motors and resembles the corkscrew-like
device that opens many automatic garage doors. If the jackscrew was damaged
during flight, the horizontal stabilizer could move beyond its normal range,
causing the tail wing to stall, or lose its lift, said William Waldock,
associate director for the Center for Aerospace Safety Education at Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
	   It would be nearly impossible to recover from such a stall, Waldock said.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilots would not be able to control the up-or-down motion of the
aircraft -- which would be consistent with flight data that shows the plane went
into a 3.4-mile nosedive and radar tracking that shows something may have fallen
off the plane as the dive began.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane's autopilot was disengaged when the jetliner reached 29,000 feet,
and the jet was flown manually for one hour and 53 minutes. Pilots say it is
unusual to fly manually for that long and could suggest a problem with the
autopilot or any number of other systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said the MD-83 involved in the crash had two maintenance write-ups
last fall for problems with the horizontal stabilizer. In October, the system
was checked and the plane returned to service. A month later, mechanics replaced
a switch.

<HEADLINE> 'Hurricane' Carter lawyers fight back against families' charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Point by point, lawyers for Rubin "Hurricane" Carter on
Wednesday rebutted charges by victims' relatives that Carter is a killer who got
away with murder, saying his case was corrupted by racism and prosecutorial
misconduct.
<P>
	   And while one lawyer said the film "The Hurricane" could have explained
Carter's legal battle better, he said it accurately portrays the former
middleweight boxer's innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   "They conducted a horrendously poor investigation," said Lewis Steel, the
lawyer for Carter's codefendant, John Artis. "It's a sad day when after all
these years, officials in the state of New Jersey can't say we made a horrendous
mistake."
</P>
<P>
	   The nationwide release last month of "The Hurricane," which won a Golden
Globe award for Denzel Washington's portrayal of Carter, has renewed interest in
Carter's case and has forced the film's producers to defend themselves against
charges that they changed details of the story to make Carter look like a better
man than he was.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter's lawyers released reams of court documents Wednesday they said show
that Carter didn't kill a bartender and two patrons of a Paterson, N.J., bar in
1966, including testimony by a chief investigator who said early witness
descriptions of the men who left the bar were "not even close" to Carter and
Artis.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Vincent DeSimone of the Passaic County (N.J.) Prosecutor's Office told a
grand jury two weeks after the June 17, 1966, killings that two of the shooting
victims had said light-skinned, tall black men wearing dark clothing had left
the bar, according to the testimony. Carter was wearing a white jacket at the
time, is 5 feet 7, and wore a beard, DeSimone told grand jurors.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter and Artis were convicted twice of the murders but Carter was freed in
1985 by a federal judge who said prosecutors unfairly presented an argument that
Carter was looking for racial revenge. Artis was freed on parole a few years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to other charges made a day earlier by relatives of DeSimone and
the murder victims, the lawyers:
</P>
<P>
	   -said that victim Hazel Tanis identified two men with criminal records who
were not Carter and Artis from police photographs before she died, refuting a
statement by Tanis' daughter that Tanis named Carter.
</P>
<P>
	   -said that a bullet and a shotgun shell found in Carter's car did not
exactly match the murder weapon and were planted by police.
</P>
<P>
	   -accused police and prosecutors of influencing witness testimony to target
Carter. Witness Patty Valentine's initial description of Carter's car was vague,
attorney Myron Beldock said, but she was positive it was Carter's car at trial.
</P>
<P>
	   -said that a 1966 police report of a polygraph test administered to Carter,
in which the sergeant says Carter could have been involved with the crime, was
"a forgery."
</P>
<P>
	   Carter, speaking at Kutztown University in Pennsylvania on Wednesday night,
told a reporter from WEEU-AM in Reading, Pa., that he had no response to the
claims by the victims' relatives - and furthermore that the story didn't deserve
one. He was at Kutztown to lecture on what he called the injustices of the
justice system.
</P>
<P>
	   "This case is corrupt. It is a deceitful, fraudulent prosecution," Beldock
said. He said of the family members who have believed a different story for
decades, "people get wedded to their misconceptions."
</P>
<P>
	   The lawyers blamed prosecutors for suppressing favorable defense evidence,
coaching witnesses and injecting racism into the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Passaic County Prosecutor Ronald Fava noted Wednesday that no court has
ruled that Carter is innocent and said prosecutors only decided not to try him a
third time because witnesses had died and memories had faded.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he knew the people who worked on the case, and "they are people of
impeccable integrity and would never even consider doing anything unethical,
much less participate in the knowing framing of an innocent man."
</P>
<P>
	   Beldock said the release of the movie, largely based on Carter's
autobiography, has renewed a long-running debate but hasn't changed anyone's
mind.
</P>
<P>
	   Steel, however, said the film could have debunked the evidence against
Carter more effectively.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we all would have been better off if the movie had more carefully
analyzed the evidence," he said.

<HEADLINE> Airport Turns Away Japanese Workers  </HEADLINE>
   By AMALIE YOUNG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Some Japanese technical workers brought overseas by
Oregon and Washington companies are being turned back by immigration officials
at Portland International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to Immigration and Naturalization Commissioner Doris Meissner,
Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., wrote that several companies had complained about
business visitors being denied entry to the country for no apparent reason.
</P>
<P>
	   The same passengers were able to enter through different airports without
trouble, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problem has escalated to the point that travel agents and businesses
within Japan are now counseling travelers to avoid entrance through PDX,''
Gorton wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   According to INS port director John O'Brien, about 100 foreign workers, most
of them Japanese, were denied entry at the Portland airport last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Typically, they were cases of improper visas, O'Brien said. Some companies
may try to skip weeks of waiting for proper entry permits by using B-1 visas,
which are awarded more quickly but are limited to people attending business
meetings and not participating in actual labor, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are people in the United States who are unemployed or underemployed
who would like to get a job with one of these companies,'' O'Brien said
Wednesday. ``The Immigration Service is trying to protect American jobs for
American citizens.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The law that Congress passed is the same nationwide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gorton said immigration authorities in Portland may be using too strict
an interpretation of the law.
</P>
<P>
	   Concerns about the airport already have resulted in the cancellation of a
regularly scheduled flight by Delta, the gateway carrier serving Japan out of
Portland, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanae Conner of Shokookai, a Japanese business association based in
Portland, said she knows of at least 10 incidents in the past year where
high-ranking Japanese managers or engineers who were coming to work temporarily
were denied entry at the airport and sent back to Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is very, very embarrassing for these companies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Several high-tech companies have been lobbying Congress to expand the visa
program to allow more skilled technical workers into the country.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Workers Go On Strike  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RENTON, Wash. (AP) -- More than 17,000 engineers and technical workers at
Boeing Co. walked off the job Wednesday in one of the biggest white-collar
strikes in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
	   Production at the world's largest airplane maker continued without
interruption because assembly employees belong to a separate union and have a
clause in their contract requiring them to work regardless of what other Boeing
employees do.
</P>
<P>
	   The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, which
represents about 10 percent of Boeing's work force, went on strike after
contract talks broke down Tuesday night. No further talks were scheduled.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the union -- who are involved in such fields as research and
development, designing of planes and overseeing production work -- left their
jobs at Boeing offices and plants throughout the Seattle area at 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just went to work, shut down my computer, copied my hard drive to Zip
disks and got the hell out of there," said Stan Sorscher, a physicist who led
one of the negotiating teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing spokesman Peter Conte estimated Wednesday evening that 17,000 to
18,000 engineers and technical workers walked out Wednesday; the union estimated
19,500 participated.
</P>
<P>
	   Union members gathered for a rally and march at Renton Memorial Stadium,
near the factory where Boeing builds 737 and 757 jetliners. The crowd cheered as
union executive director Charles Bofferding said Boeing negotiators "thought
they could bully us, and they were wrong."
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing has said a strike would not affect the building of aircraft. However,
if the walkout were to last for a couple of weeks, it could interfere with the
inspection and delivery of aircraft to airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously we are disappointed that we were unable to reach an acceptable
solution through the course of mediation in the past two days," Conte said.
"Boeing is a company that strives to work with unions to negotiate in good faith
and to be fair and reasonable in the offers it makes."
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing stock fell $2 a share to $38.81 1/4 Wednesday on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The union has sought more guaranteed pay raises and bonuses similar to those
received by the 46,000-member Machinists union. Boeing has insisted on mostly
selective pay increases, reductions in life insurance benefits and some changes
in health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   In negotiations last year, the Machinists won annual raises of 4 percent, 4
percent and 3 percent in a three-year contract, plus a 10 percent signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing's most recent offer was narrowly defeated by members of the
white-collar union, 51 percent to 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   White-collar employees at Boeing worldwide average about $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The AFL-CIO-affiliated union, which represents Boeing's 22,600 professional
and technical workers, now counts 63 percent of them as dues-paying members.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the first full-scale strike in the union's 56-year history, and some
members had questioned whether the white-collar workers were willing to engage
the company. The union's only previous strike was a symbolic one-day walkout in
1992.
</P>
<P>
	   "A year ago, I would've said a strike was crazy," said SPEEA President Craig
Buckham. "I'm telling you, these people today are seriously energized. I don't
want to strike, but it's good to see we have the strength to do it."
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the union cheered when they were told a Teamster-driven truck
from United Parcel Service honored the picket line Wednesday. Bob Gorman, state
director of the AFL-CIO, said other unions would support the strike.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Hijack Appears Over  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROLINE BYRNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Dozens of hostages, including women and children,
walked out the back staircase of a hijacked Afghan plane early Thursday, raising
hopes that the crisis may be coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
	   A large-scale release was under way, with an intermittent but steady release
of people but police would not immediately confirm if the hostages had all been
freed.
</P>
<P>
	   Police vehicles were parked at the foot of the stairs and bright lights
shone up the staircase as a steady stream of people walked down the stairs.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of those leaving the plane appeared to be holding their hands in the
air. During earlier releases, passengers were not seen leaving with their arms
raised.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were hopeful earlier this evening that a resolution was close.
</P>
<P>
	   It was believed that 151 people, including 21 children, were on board the
aircraft, which was hijacked early Sunday 20 minutes into a domestic flight
leaving Kabul, Afghanistan's capital. It then began a meandering journey across
the former Soviet Union, stopping in Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Among them were 39 members of one family who were traveling to a wedding in
the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif -- including the would-be bride, said
Mohammed Daoud Sharisi, who sells tickets at the Ariana office in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
	   Early in the day, the hijackers ejected a flight attendant, who was seen
being sent forcibly down a set of stairs at the rear of the plane. His departure
came four hours after four crew members -- the captain, second captain, first
officer and flight engineer -- escaped by using a rope to lower themselves from
the cockpit and jumping onto the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we are not able to determine is whether any of the remaining crew on
board or any of the passengers are able to fly this aircraft,'' said John
Broughton, an assistant chief constable of Essex County police.
</P>
<P>
	   Four men, presumed to be hijackers, appeared briefly on the ground at the
rear of the plane Wednesday morning to collect fresh supplies. That evening, two
men descended the jet's rear steps and collected an evening meal -- a result of
the continuing negotiations. They appeared to carry out an inspection of the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the crew members, the hijackers have released 31 passengers
so far.
</P>
<P>
	   In Kabul, an Ariana employee said Wednesday that several airline officials
responsible for security checks on the hijacked flight had been arrested. An
Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said several
employees were questioned but allowed to go back to work.

<HEADLINE> Flight Delayed by Possible PCP Odor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- People aboard an American Airlines jetliner preparing for
takeoff became sick Wednesday when a passenger poured what authorities believe
was liquid PCP onto his seat.
</P>
<P>
	   The jetliner was taxiing about 1:15 a.m. for a flight to Dallas when the
crew reported a disturbance and a strong chemical odor, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   As the aircraft returned to the gate, passengers saw a man dump a liquid out
of two baby bottles, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The passenger was arrested for investigation of possession, transportation
and sale of PCP.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe the defendant had 16 ounces of liquid PCP, and the suspect, in
what we believe was an effort to destroy the evidence, poured the containers
into the seat of his plane and some on his clothing,'' said Officer Eduardo
Funes.
</P>
<P>
	   Two pilots, four flight attendants and about a half-dozen passengers got
sick after being exposed to the fumes.
</P>
<P>
	   Flight 390 was carrying 47 passengers and six crew members. The flight was
canceled and passengers were placed on other flights,
</P>
<P>
	   PCP, also known as angel dust or phencyclidine, is a psychedelic drug.

permanently.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Czar: Drug War is No Real War  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK STEVENSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey said Wednesday that drug
traffickers from foreign countries have forced American gangs out of the U.S.
wholesale drug trade.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The gringos just can't compete,'' McCaffrey said, noting that American
traffickers are more easily detected and are less likely to pile up the proceeds
in accounts hidden abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   McCaffrey said the U.S. competition was coming from traffickers hailing from
the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Mexico and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
	   He cited the latest intelligence reports to show that drug trafficking is
more complex than commonly thought.
</P>
<P>
	   He said leftist rebels in Colombia protect cocaine shipments -- and even
coordinate planting the crop and move shipments. But right-wing paramilitary
groups fighting the rebels also operate cocaine processing labs, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Traffickers are also beginning to target Panama as a transfer point for
heroin shipments to Central America and the Caribbean, taking advantage of gaps
in that country's security forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCaffrey said the influx of drugs into Panama was not a direct result of
the U.S. withdrawal from the Canal Zone in December, but rather because of the
Panama's border with Colombia and airline flights from Panama City to other
parts of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   McCaffrey spoke to reporters during a three-day visit to talk with Mexican
leaders about the new U.S.``drug kingpin'' law. The law, which takes effect June
1, will allow for the freezing of U.S. assets of foreigners linked to drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
	   McCaffrey said the about 55 percent of the cocaine used in the United States
is shipped through Mexico or Mexican waters. Previous estimates placed that
figure at 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The retired Army general said Mexico's Pacific coast has become the largest
route for cocaine shipments, usually aboard fishing boats far offshore.
</P>
<P>
	   The second most popular route, he said, was to ship cocaine from Colombia to
Central America, and from there to Haiti or Jamaica, and on to U.S. ports.

<P>
	   The largest release of hostages came about 3:30 a.m., nearly four days after
the plane was hijacked. Police said dozens of hostages and their captors were
still aboard the plane, parked at Stansted airport near London.
</P>
<P>
	   Police vehicles were parked at the foot of the stairs and bright lights
shone up the staircase as a steady stream of people walked down the stairs of
the Ariana airlines Boeing 727.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of those leaving the plane appeared to be holding their hands in the
air. During earlier releases, passengers were not seen leaving with their arms
raised.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were hopeful earlier this evening that a resolution to the four-day
crisis was close.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the release, officials said 151 people, including 21 children, were
believed on board the aircraft, which was hijacked early Sunday 20 minutes into
a domestic flight leaving Kabul, Afghanistan's capital. It then began a
meandering journey across the former Soviet Union, stopping in Uzbekistan,
Kazakstan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Among them were 39 members of one family who were traveling to a wedding in
the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif -- including the would-be bride, said
Mohammed Daoud Sharisi, who sells tickets at the Ariana office in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
	   Early in the day, the hijackers ejected a flight attendant, who was seen
being sent forcibly down a set of stairs at the rear of the plane. His departure
came four hours after four crew members -- the captain, second captain, first
officer and flight engineer -- escaped by using a rope to lower themselves from
the cockpit and jumping onto the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
	   Four men, presumed to be hijackers, appeared briefly on the ground at the
rear of the plane Wednesday morning to collect fresh supplies. That evening, two
men descended the jet's rear steps and collected an evening meal -- a result of
the continuing negotiations. They appeared to carry out an inspection of the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   In Kabul, an Ariana employee said Wednesday that several airline officials
responsible for security checks on the hijacked flight had been arrested. An
Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said several
employees were questioned but allowed to go back to work.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiators had insisted that the armed men had made no formal demands,
political or otherwise. The men, believed to be Afghans armed with grenades,
pistols and daggers, had requested only that food, water and other comfort items
be brought to the plane, parked on a runway.
</P>
<P>
	   Speculation mounted in the British media, however, that the plane was seized
as part of an elaborate bid for political asylum -- and that some of the
hostages were in on it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``HI-HOAX? Hijackers and hostages may be asylum seekers,'' the tabloid
Mirror blared on its front page. The Daily Star lamented ``Oh no! They ALL want
to stay (and we'll have to pay).''
</P>
<P>
	   Fueling the asylum speculation was the arrival Tuesday of an observer from
the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. The observer would be
providing expertise but would not be joining the negotiating team, said Edwards.
The commission's London office identified the observer as Hope Hanlan.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to questions about the validity of the asylum theory, Edwards
said: ``Why are they still in there? We've been asking them to come out since
Monday.''

<HEADLINE> Mass. Woman Can't Keep Frozen Eggs  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN FINUCANE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- The state's highest court ruled that a woman can't have four
frozen embryos she created with her former husband at a Boston-area fertility
clinic.
</P>
<P>
	   The 44-year-old woman wanted the court to allow her to become pregnant with
the embryos created in 1991. But her former husband had opposed the move, saying
he didn't want any more children with his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Supreme Judicial Court on Tuesday upheld an injunction issued by a
lower court. The court has refused to identify the couple, citing privacy
issues; the case is known only as A.Z. vs. B.Z.
</P>
<P>
	   The custody fight over the frozen embryos was a first in Massachusetts --
and one of a handful nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman, who cannot conceive a child naturally, first attempted to use the
embryos in 1995, after the breakup of the couple's 17-year marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   But her husband sued, and in 1996 Probate and Family Court Judge Anthony
Nesi ruled in the husband's favor, saying agreements signed at the fertility
clinic giving the woman custody in case of separation had expired.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said if the woman became pregnant with one or more of the embryos,
her ex-husband would face responsibility for additional children, children that
he didn't want.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This would not only be unfair to the parent, but also unfair to the child
who would enter the world unwanted by one of his or her parents,'' Nesi wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Paula Noe, who represented the husband during the 1996 case, on Wednesday
praised the wisdom of Nesi's original ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She was trying to force him to be a parent again,'' and the husband had a
right to resist, Noe said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gretchen Van Ness, who represents the woman, didn't return a message left at
her office Wednesday night.

	   OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- The Rev. Michael Feeney, a former president of St.
Martin's College who in retirement chaired a $10 million fund-raising effort for
a new campus library, died Friday. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
	   Feeney was ordained a priest in 1946. He taught at St. Martin's High School
and served later as vice principal and principal. He became president of St.
Martin's College in 1964 and welcomed the first women to campus a year later.
</P>
<P>
	   He retired as president in 1971.
Dick Gaines
</P>
<P>
	   MITCHELL, Ind. (AP) -- Dick Gaines, a member of the National Sprint Car Hall
of Fame who won more than 800 feature races, died Saturday of a heart attack. He
was 64.
</P>
<P>
	   Among his victories were two Little 500s in Anderson and the Knoxville
Nationals in Iowa. Two of the cars Gaines raced over the years are on display at
the Lawrence County Antique Auto and Race Car Museum.
Edna Griffin
</P>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Edna Griffin, an Iowa civil-rights pioneer best
known for integrating lunch counters, died Tuesday. She was 90.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1948, Griffin led the fight against Katz Drug Store in downtown Des
Moines, which refused to serve blacks at its lunch counter. Griffin staged
sit-ins, picketed in front of the store and filed charges against the store's
owner, Maurice Katz, who was fined. The Iowa Supreme Court then made it illegal
to deny service based on race.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Griffin was inducted into the Iowa African-American Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
	   She organized Iowans to attend the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 march
on Washington, D.C., and helped start the former radio station KUCB. Last
spring, Des Moines' mayor proclaimed May 15 as Edna Griffin Day.
Gus Johnson
</P>
<P>
	   WESTMINSTER, Colo. (AP) -- Gus Johnson, the acclaimed drummer who kept the
beat for jazz giants such as Count Basie and Duke Ellington, died Sunday. He was
86.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson played with the some of the most famous acts of the post-World War
II era including Benny Goodman, Ella Fitzgerald, Lena Horne, Woody Herman, Jay
McShann, Eddie ``Cleanhead'' Vinson, Stan Getz, Zoot Sims, Al Cohn and Ralph
Sutton.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson's musical career didn't begin until 1935, when he joined the Jo
Jones sextet in 1935. Johnson played with McShann's band from 1938 to 1943, when
he entered the Army. After World War II, he joined Vinson and then Earl
``Fatha'' Hines.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson was a member of Basie's band from the late-1940s to the mid-1950s.
Deborah Laake
</P>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Deborah Laake, the former Phoenix journalist, whose
bestselling book, ``Secret Ceremonies: A Mormon Woman's Intimate Diary of
Marriage and Beyond,'' angered some church members, died Sunday at her South
Carolina home. She was 47.
</P>
<P>
	   Laake had battled breast cancer since 1994. Friends said she took her own
life.
</P>
<P>
	   She joined Phoenix New Times in 1981. Laake's 1993 book, ``Secret
Ceremonies,'' made The New York Times bestseller list for 16 weeks. Her candid
account of her upbringing as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints and her later rebellion against it detailed some of the
church's temple rites.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after the book's publication, Laake was excommunicated from the
Mormon Church.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1983, she won a special award from the Columbia School of Journalism for
her story titled ``Wormboys,'' a memoir of her dating experiences in which she
found men often less than manly.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1988, Laake won the Arizona Press Club's top prize, the Virg Hill Print
Journalist of the Year Award.
Ion Gheorghe Maurer
</P>
<P>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Ion Gheorghe Maurer, Romania's first communist
premier, died Tuesday of heart and kidney failure. He was 97.
</P>
<P>
	   Maurer joined the Communist Party in 1936 when it was illegal. He acted as
an attorney for dozens of communist fighters, including former dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu, during the World War I and World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   After Romania gave up its monarchy and turned to communism in 1945, Maurer
began a political accession inside the party that led him to top posts.
</P>
<P>
	   He served as foreign minister between 1957 and 1958 and president of the
Great National Assembly from 1958 to 1961.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1961, he became Romania's first communist premier and held that post
until 1972. Before that, Romania was governed by a general secretary.
Morley Meredith
</P>
<P>
	   PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Morley Meredith, a versatile baritone who sang 40
roles in 31 seasons at New York's Metropolitan Opera, died Feb. 3 of cancer. He
was 77.
</P>
<P>
	   Meredith made his debut at the Met in 1962, singing the roles of the four
villains in Offenbach's ``Contes d'Hoffmann.'' Other roles he sang at the Met
include Rangoni in ``Boris Godunov,'' Alfio in ``Cavalleria Rusticana,'' Pizarro

</P>
<P>
	   Meredith also performed with opera companies in Chicago, Philadelphia and
San Francisco.
Claude Raymond
</P>
<P>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Former Gen. Claude Raymond, the once-dreaded
chief of ousted dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier's army, died Wednesday after more
than three years in prison. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
	   Hospital officials would not release the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
	   Raymond became Duvalier's chief of staff and interior minister when the
dictator succeeded his father, Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier, who died in 1971
after 14 years of repressive rule. Raymond retired shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
	   After Duvalier was ousted in 1986, Raymond declared himself a candidate for
the presidency. An electoral council disqualified him in 1987, calling him a
``notorious zealot'' and an architect of Duvalier's rule.
</P>
<P>
	   In July 1996, Raymond was arrested and charged with plotting to overthrow
the government. He was widely suspected of directing a Nov. 29, 1987, election
day massacre, when commandos hacked and shot to death more than a dozen voters
at a high school in the Haitian capital.

</P>
<P>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) -- Shobhana Samarth, an Indian film actress of the 1940s,
died Wednesday of cancer. She was 84.

of Sita, wife of the Hindu god Ram, in the 1943 film ``Ram Rajya'' won accolades
and launched her career.
</P>
<P>
	   Her family has become prominent in the Indian film industry. Samarth's two
daughters, Nutan and Tanuja, also acted in films in 1960s and '70s. Her
granddaughter, Kajol, was considered a top actress in the 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Chronology of Afghan Hijacking  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Chronology of the Afghan airplane hijacking:
</P>
<P>
	   -- 12:30 a.m. EST Sunday: The Ariana airlines Boeing 727 takes off Sunday

<HEADLINE> Bronx woman describes Diallo shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The first eyewitness to take the stand in the Amadou
Diallo trial backfired on the defense Wednesday when she claimed police
continued to shoot the unarmed black man after he fell to the ground.
<P>
	   Called by the defense, Schrrie Elliott testified she saw four officers kill
Diallo as she walked home from the subway after midnight on Feb. 4, 1999 in the
Bronx. She described the officers jumping out of a car with their guns drawn,
forming a semi-circle on the sidewalk outside Diallo's door and opening fire.
</P>
<P>
	   "And they continued shooting while (Diallo) was down?" prosecutor Donald
Levin asked on cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes," replied Elliott, breaking into tears.
</P>
<P>
	   The surprise testimony in the officer's murder trial prompted defense
attorneys to ask State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi to declare Elliott an
adverse witness. The judge agreed to let them cross-examine her about her
account on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi also was to rule Thursday morning on whether the defense could show
the jury a television news interview it says proves that Elliott has given
conflicting accounts of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not done with this witness," defense attorney Stephen Worth said
outside court. Elliott's attorney, Kevin Fee, refused comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott emerged as the trial's first eyewitness to the shooting after the
defense subpoenaed her to testify on behalf of Officers Kenneth Boss, 28, Sean
Carroll, 36, Edward McMellon, 27, and Richard Murphy, 27. The officers
themselves are expected to testify on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants, all white, have pleaded innocent to charges they murdered
the West African immigrant by firing 41 bullets into the vestibule of his
apartment building at close range, without warning and with abandon; 19 bullets
hit Diallo. If convicted, they face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The case sparked enough pretrial publicity and protest over police abuse of
minorities that an appeals court moved it to Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense claims the officers - in a search for dangerous criminals - saw
Diallo as a threat because he refused orders to halt, then pulled out a black
wallet that appeared to be a gun. It also argues the officers' high-powered
pistols fired fast enough for Diallo to stay on his feet, possibly up against a
wall, throughout the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors refused to comment on why they had not used Elliott as their own
witness.
</P>
<P>
	   After seeing videotape of her being interviewed by a reporter, defense
attorneys called her to testify that she heard someone yell "Gun!" before the
shooting began. The defense says Carroll shouted the warning, proving he thought
Diallo was armed.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott testified reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
	   The witness asked that her face not be broadcast or photographed. She
offered no information about her background, spoke softly and breathed heavily
during questioning by Worth.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, she told Worth, "I didn't want to speak to you all." She said
she knew the four men she spotted on Diallo's block were plainclothes officers,
because "I've had past dealings with the law." She did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Levin used his cross-examination to lead Elliott through a damaging version
of the shooting she apparently had given to a grand jury and the FBI last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman claimed she had a clear view from across the street of Diallo as
he stood in his vestibule with his back to the officers. She described watching
them corner him and fire after he turned around.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott also said none of the officers fell down. The defense has asserted
that McMellon fell as the shooting began, making the others think there was
return fire.
</P>
<P>
	   "Did you hear anyone yell 'Stop,' or 'Freeze,' or 'Show your hands'?" Levin
asked. "No," Elliott replied.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't know who said 'gun,' do you?" the prosecutor asked later. "No,"
she said. "It could have been (Diallo), right?," he continued. "Yes," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, Worth had questioned Elliott about whether she had told the
television reporter she "couldn't believe how long (Diallo) was standing" during
the shooting. She said she couldn't remember.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebroadcast Wednesday by WNBC in New York City, the interview shows Elliott
only in silhouette. She alleged the officers "just went crazy."
</P>
<P>
	   One officer "said 'gun' and that was it," she said. "They just did what they
did."
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott also suggested most of the gunfire occurred while Diallo was
upright, and - like previous prosecution witnesses - that it was interrupted by
a pause.
</P>
<P>
	   "When he was standing, it was longer," she said. "Then after they initially
started, like I said, like three or four seconds, then it was just a mess."
</P>
<P>
	   WNBC reported that it had arranged three polygraph tests for Elliott, and
that she passed them all.

<HEADLINE> Brown Names Interim President  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Brown University has named an interim president to
replace Gordon Gee, who stunned the campus by resigning after less than three
years in office.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheila Blumstein, chairwoman of the Department of Cognitive and Linguistic
Sciences, was appointed Wednesday, two days after Gee was named chancellor of
Vanderbilt University.
</P>
<P>
	   Blumstein said she was ``daunted by the responsibility'' but ``prepared to
serve'' and would not be a candidate for the permanent job. The school was
expected to form a search committee by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sheila Blumstein has an unsurpassed record of academic achievement and
service to Brown and has a thorough understanding of the University's history,
culture, needs and ambitions,'' Brown Chancellor Stephen Robert said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert has criticized Gee, saying he had breached the moral commitment he
made to Brown.
</P>
<P>
	   Gee, 56, called leaving the Ivy League school ``a wrenching decision'' and
said he chose to take the Tennessee post because of ``the excitement that occurs
from having a wider scope'' of programs. ``Vanderbilt was exactly the right
fit,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Gee will leave Brown on April 15.

	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The first eyewitness to take the stand in the Amadou
Diallo murder case backfired on the defense Wednesday when she testified that
police officers continued to shoot the unarmed black man after he had fallen to
the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys had called Schrrie Elliott to the stand, hoping her
testimony would support the officers' contention they believed Diallo had pulled
a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   But on cross-examination, Elliott said that she watched from across the

opened fire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They continued shooting while (Diallo) was down?'' asked prosecutor Donald

	   ``We're not done with this witness,'' defense attorney Stephen Worth said
outside court. Elliott's attorney, Kevin Fee, refused comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott emerged as the trial's first eyewitness to the shooting after the
defense subpoenaed her to testify on behalf of Officers Kenneth Boss, 28, Sean
Carroll, 36, Edward McMellon, 27, and Richard Murphy, 27.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers, all white, are charged with murder and could get 25 years to
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The slaying of the black West African immigrant in a barrage of 41 bullets
touched off protests against police brutality. An appeals court ordered the case
moved to Albany, 150 miles from New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense claims that Diallo refused orders to halt, then pulled out a
black wallet that appeared to be a gun. It also argues the officers'
high-powered pistols fired fast enough for Diallo to stay on his feet, possibly
up against a wall, throughout the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear why prosecutors had not used Elliott as their own witness.
The defense -- after seeing videotape of her being interviewed by a TV reporter
-- called her to testify she heard one of the officers yell, ``Gun!'' before the
shooting began.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott spoke softly and repeatedly sighed under questioning by defense
attorney Stephen Worth. She said she knew the four men she spotted on Diallo's
block were plainclothes officers because ``I've had past dealings with the
law.'' She did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Levin used his cross-examination to ask Elliott a rapid progression of
questions detailing a damaging version of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman claimed she had a clear view from across the street of Diallo as
he stood with his back to the officers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Did you hear anyone yell, `Stop' or `Freeze' or `Show your hands'?'' Levin
asked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No,'' Elliott replied.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You don't know who said, `Gun,' do you?'' the prosecutor asked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Worth later went on the attack, sarcastically asking Elliott, ``The police
shot Mr. Diallo for no good reason?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes,'' Elliott replied.

<HEADLINE> Investigation finds no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Huskies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   FARMINGTON, Conn. (AP) - Two Connecticut basketball players were cleared
Wednesday of any criminal wrongdoing after an investigation into allegations
they offered game tickets in exchange for clothing at a local mall, police said
Wednesday.
<P>
	   Freshmen Tony Robertson and Doug Wrenn were reinstated to the team Tuesday
after a four-day suspension for what coach Jim Calhoun called a violation of
team rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The two reportedly had offered employees at a Timberland store in the
Westfarms Mall game tickets in exchange for boots. A manager at the store
reportedly prevented the exchange, and three employees at the store lost their
jobs as a result of the incident, store officials have said.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmington police said no criminal charges will be brought as a result of
their investigation into the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   "It comes under the category of an unsubstantiated allegation," said Sgt.
Alan Fournier.
</P>
<P>
	   Robertson played 20 minutes in Wednesday's 87-56 victory over Boston College
and finished with two points and three rebounds. Wrenn also joined the team at
the Hartford Civic Center, but sat on the bench in street clothes. He has not
practiced with the team since he was suspended.
</P>
<P>
	   After the game, he said there is no truth to rumors that he is considering
transferring.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am going to stay at the University of Connecticut," he said. "They are
going to have to throw me out of this school, but I'm going to be a Husky until
I die."
</P>
<P>
	   Robertson, a reserve guard, was averaging over 18 minutes and 7 points a
game. Wrenn, a reserve swingman from Seattle is averaging 2.9 points and 1.2
rebounds in 17 games, including starts against Georgetown and Syracuse.

<HEADLINE> Plane Collisions Prompt Debates  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Two recent collisions involving small airplanes have some
urging improved air traffic control for such aircraft, which often take off and
land at facilities without control towers.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, two small planes collided over suburban Chicago, killing three
and sending smoldering wreckage into a densely populated area. Only a day
before, four people died in Los Angeles after their planes collided over a golf
course.
</P>
<P>
	   Those who fly such planes call the collisions Monday and Tuesday a tragic
fluke. But others argue the accidents point to a problem.
</P>
<P>
	   National Transportation Safety Board investigators were sorting through
wreckage Wednesday in Zion, about 45 miles north of Chicago, to find clues to
what caused Tuesday's crash over a hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   The crash killed popular Chicago radio personality Bob Collins and a friend
flying with him, as well as the student pilot in the other plane.
</P>
<P>
	   A control tower at the nearby Waukegan Regional Airport had cleared both
Collins' two-seat Zlin stunt plane and the four-seat Cessna 172 to land, one
after the other.
</P>
<P>
	   But in this case, as with most operations of small, noncommercial planes, it
was up to the pilots to make sure their air space was clear before landing,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ideally, the pilots should be able to see each other,'' said David
Bowling, an NTSB air traffic investigator.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins and the student pilot, Sharon Hock, 31, both were warned of other
planes in the area, and Collins told controllers he saw Hock's plane.
</P>
<P>
	   But Hock, who had been practicing take-offs and landings, said she could not
see Collins' plane and investigators say it appears she may have turned into its
path.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators will check the aircraft for ``witness marks'' that would
indicate their positions when they collided, Bowling said. They also plan to
interview a third pilot who witnessed the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   The presence of a control tower at the Waukegan airport -- and at the Van
Nuys Airport, near the site of Monday's crash in Los Angeles -- is unusual.
</P>
<P>
	   Warren Morningstar, a spokesman for the Maryland-based Aircraft Owners and
Pilots Association, said only 543 of the about 5,300 public-use airports in the
United States have control towers.
</P>
<P>
	   That means pilots of smaller planes that are not tracked by radar must rely
on a common radio frequency, their instruments and their eyes to assure safety,
Morningstar said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fact that two such collisions occurred in such quick succession raises
questions about the ability of the pilots of small aircraft to monitor their own
actions, said Jim Poole, the Chicago-based regional vice president for the
National Air Traffic Controllers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Control towers that do exist are often understaffed, and other towers that
should still operate have been removed, leaving pilots that sometimes have very
little flying experience to muddle through a takeoff or landing with no
guidance, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Certainly you're cutting the cost ... but you're also cutting the
safety,'' Poole said.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the time, the ``rules of the road'' approach to flying works, FAA
statistics show. In 1998, for example, general aviation aircraft -- those that
are not government, military or commercial -- had 1,907 accidents, or 7.12 per
100,000 flight hours. Of those, 361 were fatal.
</P>
<P>
	   Midair collisions were extremely rare, with preliminary NTSB data for 1999
showing 18 such crashes.

<HEADLINE> Ag Inspectors Admit Accepting Bribes  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Seven U.S. Department of Agriculture produce inspectors
pleaded guilty Wednesday to accepting bribes from wholesalers in exchange for
lowering grades for fruits and vegetables, thereby cheating farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspectors will face as much as two years, nine months in prison and
fines as high as $60,000, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspectors each read from brief statements admitting that they had
accepted bribes ranging from $50 to $350 to falsely grade produce lower.
</P>
<P>
	   When farmers make deals with companies that distribute fruits and vegetables
to merchants, the farmers promise that the produce will be of a certain quality.
If an inspector grades the produce lower than had been agreed upon, the farmers
are paid less.
</P>
<P>
	   Even slight variations in the grade of produce can affect the overall
contract price by several thousand dollars, depending on the size and value of
the shipment, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   The seven inspectors, who all pleaded guilty to a single count of bribery,
were based at the Hunts Point Terminal Market in the Bronx. An eighth inspector
pleaded guilty in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said the Hunts Point produce inspectors had routinely accepted
cash from owners and employees of wholesale produce firms since at least 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   Charges against Hunts Point wholesalers are still pending in federal court.
Two wholesalers have pleaded guilty to bribery and are awaiting sentencing.

<HEADLINE> More Walk Off Hijacked Afghan Plane  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROLINE BYRNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Eighty-five men, women and children walked down
the tail staircase of a hijacked Afghan plane early Thursday, raising hopes that
a hostage drama could be nearing an end.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest release of hostages so far came about 3:30 a.m., nearly four
days after the plane was hijacked. But police said dozens of hostages and their
captors were still aboard the Boeing 727, parked at Stansted airport near
London.
</P>
<P>
	   The heavily armed hijackers let women and children leave the aircraft first,
said Joe Edwards, Essex County police assistant chief constable. The hostages
will be taken to a safe location and undergo medical evaluations, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All those who left are indeed hostages,'' Edwards said. ``There are still
people on board, negotiations continue,'' he said. ``The negotiations are also
at a fairly critical stage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before the release, officials said 151 people, including 21 children, were
believed on board the aircraft, which was hijacked early Sunday on a domestic
flight leaving Kabul, Afghanistan's capital. It then began a meandering journey
across the former Soviet Union, stopping in Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   As the surprise release got under way, police vehicles parked nearby and
bright lights shined up the staircase toward a steady stream of people walking
leaving the Ariana airlines jetliner.
</P>
<P>
	   Moments before that, two people seen leaving the aircraft were hijackers
bound for a meeting with negotiators on the tarmac outside the plane, said
Edwardsd.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have worked hard throughout the day to build on the trust,'' he said.
``We have negotiated a face-to-face encounter between us and two hostage
takers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police had expressed hope on Wednesday that a resolution was close.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the captives were 39 members of one family who were traveling to a
wedding in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif -- including the would-be
bride, said Mohammed Daoud Sharisi, who sells tickets at the Ariana office in
Kabul.
</P>
<P>
	   Speculation also mounted in the British media that the plane was seized as
part of an elaborate bid for political asylum -- and that some of the hostages
were in on it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``HI-HOAX? Hijackers and hostages may be asylum seekers,'' the tabloid
Mirror blared on its front page. The Daily Star lamented ``Oh no! They ALL want
to stay (and we'll have to pay).''
</P>
<P>
	   Fueling the asylum speculation was the arrival Tuesday of an observer from
the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. The observer would be
providing expertise but would not be joining the negotiating team, said Edwards.
The commission's London office identified the observer as Hope Hanlan.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to questions about the validity of the asylum theory, Edwards
said: ``Why are they still in there? We've been asking them to come out since
Monday.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Wednesday, the hijackers ejected a flight attendant, who was seen
being sent forcibly down a set of stairs at the rear of the plane. His departure
came four hours after four crew members -- the captain, second captain, first
officer and flight engineer -- escaped by using a rope to lower themselves from
the cockpit and jumping onto the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
	   Four men, presumed to be hijackers, appeared briefly on the ground at the
rear of the plane Wednesday morning to collect fresh supplies. That evening, two
men descended the jet's rear steps and collected an evening meal -- a result of
the continuing negotiations. They appeared to carry out an inspection of the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiators had insisted that the armed men had made no formal demands,
political or otherwise. The men, believed to be Afghans, were armed with
grenades, pistols and daggers.
</P>
<P>
	   In Kabul, an Ariana employee said Wednesday that several airline officials
responsible for security checks on the hijacked flight had been arrested. An
Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said several
employees were questioned but allowed to go back to work.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rejects Casino Killer Request  </HEADLINE>
   By ANGIE WAGNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Confessed child killer Jeremy Strohmeyer lost his bid
Wednesday to withdraw his guilty plea and go to trial for the murder of a
7-year-old in a casino restroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Strohmeyer's claims that his attorneys coerced him into pleading guilty and
did not represent him properly were rejected by Judge Joseph Bonaventure, who
said the 21-year-old had ``the A-team of counsel.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``With the passage of time, the reality of being behind bars the rest of
one's life must become more and more disheartening,'' Bonaventure said. ``But to
poor little Sherrice, she will never again be able to walk upon this earth.''
</P>
<P>
	   Strohmeyer's new attorneys wanted the trial that their client gave up when
he pleaded guilty to killing Sherrice Iverson in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Strohmeyer was sentenced to four life terms with no chance of parole.
</P>
<P>
	   One of his former attorneys, Richard Wright, testified Wednesday that he and
Strohmeyer's other attorney, Leslie Abramson, both told their client that if a
jury couldn't decide on a sentence, they were fearful that a three-judge panel
would vote for the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Strohmeyer claimed in testimony Tuesday that he doesn't remember what
happened in May 1997 when Sherrice's body was found propped up on a toilet seat
in a women's restroom of the Primadonna hotel-casino in Primm, about 45 miles
south of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonaventure described Strohmeyer's tale of an alcohol-induced blackout
during the time of the attack as a ``self-serving and embellished view.''
</P>
<P>
	   Strohmeyer claimed Abramson, the Los Angeles attorney best known for
defending Erik Menendez, pressured him into taking a plea bargain by telling him
he would be convicted and sentenced to death if the case went to trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Abramson denied that. Wright testified that his own notes indicated that the
plea agreement was Strohmeyer's idea.
</P>
<P>
	   After Bonaventure read his decision, Strohmeyer mouthed ``I love you'' to
his family as he was led out of the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think justice was done a year ago, and I think justice was done again
today,'' District Attorney Stewart Bell said after the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Strohmeyer's attorneys said they may appeal the decision.

<HEADLINE> Jazz 113, Bulls 86  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Despite nagging back and finger injuries that he said
might keep him from playing in the NBA All-Star Game, Karl Malone felt strong
enough to score 30 points and grab 10 rebounds as Utah defeated Chicago 113-86
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone was 11-of-15 from the field and 8-of-9 from the line. The Jazz led
91-70 when the 6-foot-9 forward sat down for good at the end of the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone had said repeatedly the last week that his team would be best served
if he used the upcoming All-Star break to rest his 36-year-old body. Earlier
Wednesday, however, Malone's agent, Dwight Manley, said the Mailman would be
playing in his 12th All-Star game Sunday in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
	   Elton Brand brought the Bulls within 69-60 midway through the third quarter
with a layup, but Malone had seven points in a 16-6 run that gave the Jazz a
85-66 lead with 3:28 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Hornacek scored 15 and Armen Gilliam 13 for the Jazz, who have won two
in a row since a six-game losing streak that was the franchise's longest in 17
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Brand led Chicago with 13 points in 21 minutes as the Bulls limped to the
end of their six-game Western Conference swing.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah shot 58 percent and had 35 assists in its fourth straight victory over
the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago coach Tim Floyd chose to start rookie Michael Ruffin opposite Malone
and the Jazz went to the low post early and often. Malone scored 16 points in
the first quarter but the Jazz trailed 46-41 with 7:49 left until halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah didn't take control until Greg Ostertag came off the bench and sparked
a 14-1 run with five points and two blocks in a three minute span. Utah led
63-53 at the half while shooting 66 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
	   Notes: After losing 119-80 at Sacramento on Tuesday, Floyd started Matt
Maloney, Ruffin and Hawkins in place of the Bulls' usual front line of Dickey
Simpkins, Toni Kukoc and Brand. ... Utah is 14-1 against sub-.500 teams. ...
Brand had scored 20 more points in 10 of the previous 12 games.

<P>
	   The Spurs, who lost 86-84 in their last visit to Denver on Dec. 18, built a

<HEADLINE> Tultex To Give Up, Sell Assets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DANVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Fleecewear maker Tultex Corp. plans to liquidate its
assets and go out of business rather than try to reorganize and pay off its
debts, according to a company attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   Tultex is in the process of being split up and sold, after which it will
close, the lawyer, Bruce Matson, said Wednesday. Faced with increasing losses,
the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December, with plans
to restructure as a small clothing marketer and hiring other companies to make
its products. Some 3,300 workers were laid off.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the company's remaining 650 workers likely will be let go soon under
the change in plans, although it could take months or even years to complete the
selloff. Tultex assets include a 1.1 million square-foot factory in
Martinsville, a modern warehouse in Henry County and two out-of-state
distribution companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge William Anderson said he doubted Tultex can raise enough money to pay
all 11,000 of its creditors, including at least 2,400 past and present employees
hoping to collect Christmas bonus checks.
</P>
<P>
	   Tultex, which began in Martinsville in 1937 as Sale Knitting Co., was until
recently the fifth largest activewear manufacturer in the country. After a run
of 60 profitable years, the company has lost money in recent years as
competition in the industry grew.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, Tultex ceased all manufacturing.

<HEADLINE> Vikings Expected To Release McDaniel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- The Minnesota Vikings are expected to release
Pro Bowl guard Randall McDaniel to help ease the crunch of an estimated $20-$25
million salary cap overrun.
</P>
<P>
	   The team has also restructured contracts of at least three players --
offensive tackle Todd Steussie, free safety Orlando Thomas and linebacker Ed
McDaniel -- to free up more cap room.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Dennis Green is expected to ask McDaniel to retire, but Jack Mills,
the player's agent, said McDaniel is unlikely to quit football.
</P>
<P>
	   The added room would allow the Vikings to continue negotiations with punter
Mitch Berger, who is apparently the team's top-priority free agent.
</P>
<P>
	   The free agency period begins Friday, when the league requires teams to
comply with the $62.5 million salary cap.
</P>
<P>
	   McDaniel, who has been selected to 11 straight Pro Bowls, could be replaced
next season by second-year player Chris Liwienski or veteran reserve Corbin
Lacina at left guard.

Dozens of Hostages Leave Hijacked Plane
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Dozens of hostages, including women and children,
walked out the back staircase of a hijacked Afghan plane early Thursday, raising
hopes that the crisis may be ending. A large-scale release was under way, with
an intermittent but steady release of people. Police would not immediately
confirm if the hostages had all been freed. Police vehicles were parked at the
foot of the stairs and bright lights shone up the staircase as a steady stream
of people walked down the stairs. Some of those leaving the plane appeared to be
holding their hands in the air. During earlier releases, passengers were not
seen leaving with their arms raised.

Israeli Jets Hit S. Lebanon Again

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israel staged airstrikes on suspected hideouts of
Lebanese guerrillas Wednesday and warned it would set Lebanon on fire if the
militants retaliated with rockets. Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss shrugged
off the warning by Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, who said that if
guerrilla rockets hit Israeli towns, "the soil of Lebanon will burn." The 11th
straight day of Israeli strikes follow raids on Lebanese power stations and
guerrilla bases.

Bradley, Gore Joust Over Schools

<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Democratic rivals Al Gore and Bill Bradley offered dueling
education packages Wednesday, with Bradley proposing help for distressed public
schools and arguing that Gore's tenure in office has seen "educational
malpractice" in many schools. Gore said Bradley was coming to the issue too late
and proposing too little. He touted his own plan to help parents who set aside
money to send their children to college. With polls showing Democratic primary
voters put education at the top of their priority list, both sought the high
ground.

Hackers Step Up Electronic Assault

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hackers stepped up a three-day electronic assault today
against some of the Web's most popular sites, inconveniencing millions of
Internet users and deepening the mystery of the attackers' identities. The
apparently coordinated campaign spread to ETrade, ZDNet and other flagship
sites. While the timing of the attacks remained a mystery, some security experts
noted they occurred around a three-day meeting of Internet service providers in
San Jose, Calif., which ended yesterday. Hackers sometimes seek to garner
publicity by timing attacks near symbolically important events.

it will end its 15-year guerrilla insurrection against Turkey and instead pursue
a political struggle for Kurdish rights. Turkey has rejected previous overtures
from the rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, as insincere and is
unlikely to welcome the move. Turkish Interior Minister Sadettin Tantan refused

according to documents the company released Wednesday to plaintiffs in a racial

federal suit filed last year, contain a December 1995 report on diversity from
Carl Ware, the former head of Coke's Africa Group, to M. Douglas Ivester, who
then was Coke president and will retire in April as chairman and CEO.
