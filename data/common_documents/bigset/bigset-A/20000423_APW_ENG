Elian Gonzalez and Dad Reunited
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez was back in his father's
arms Saturday after federal agents used battering rams and pepper spray to
hustle him from Miami and the relatives fighting to block his return to Cuba.
The boy's Miami relatives arrived in Washington to try and see the boy. Crying
with fright, the 6-year-old Cuban boy was taken before dawn and flown to Andrews
Air Force Base outside Washington, where he was in seclusion with his father,
stepmother and baby half-brother. Though in his father's custody, Elian's fate
still remains unsettled. The courts will ultimately rule on whether the boy
should remain in the United States.

260 Arrested in Miami; Cubans Celebrate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- More than 260 people were arrested and more than 207 fires were
set Saturday by protesters on the streets of Little Havana after Elian Gonzalez
was snatched away by federal agents. Riot police with batons and shields beat
down demonstrators who set bonfires and uprooted concrete benches. In Cuba,
Fidel Castro declared Saturday a day of truce between the United States and
Cuba, praising U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and INS officials for reuniting
Elian Gonzalez with his father. About 400,000 people were called to a historic
sugar refinery to celebrate the breakthrough in the personal and political drama
that has gripped the island for five months.

Miami Kin Try To See Elian, Dad
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez followed him to
Washington Saturday, hoping to keep the 6-year-old boy from going back to Cuba.
They were turned away from the air base gate behind which Elian was reunited
with his father. The group attempted to hold a news conference outside Andrews
Air Force, but gave up amid a crush of protesters and news media, saying only
that they would make another attempt to see Elian and his Cuban father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, on Sunday. The group included Lazaro Gonzalez, who has cared
for the boy in his house for the five months since Elian's rescue at sea; cousin
Marisleysis Gonzalez, and the fisherman who rescued him, Donato Dalrymple.

   BEIJING (AP) -- A fire Saturday in a chicken processing factory in eastern

Two Planes Crash in Va.; 7 Dead
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NORTON, Va. (AP) -- Five members of a family were found dead in the wreckage
of a small plane in the hills of southwestern Virginia Saturday, more than a day
after the plane disappeared from radar, officials said. The single-engine Mooney
20G aircraft was en route from Nashville, Tenn., to Roanoke when it vanished
from radar late Friday morning near Norton. The cause of the crash was not
immediately known, but Virginia State Trooper Dan Helton said initial
investigations suggest the plane was flying too low and hit several tree tops
before going down. Also today, two people were killed when a small airplane
crashed in Shenandoah County in northwest Virginia, state police said.

DiCaprio-Clinton Interview Short

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- After all the fuss, actor Leonardo DiCaprio's 20-minute chat
in the White House with President Clinton about global warming was edited down
to two minutes on ABC's Saturday special, ''Planet Earth 2000.'' DiCaprio was
seen asking the president three questions. The interview prompted a flood of
criticism from people -- including some within ABC News -- who wondered why the
hunky ''Titanic'' star was being sent to do a journalist's job. DiCaprio is
chairman of the Earth Day 2000 celebration committee and approached ABC with the
idea of a special on global warming.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Defector Baez Wins First Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Danys Baez, the Cuban pitcher who
defected during last year's Pan American Games, earned his first
minor league victory Saturday night as Kinston defeated
Winston-Salem 6-1 in the Carolina League.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3 right-hander allowed only one run on three hits. He
struck out six in seven innings to record his first win in four
starts with the Cleveland Indians' Single-A affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was by far his best outing,'' Kinston manager Brad
Komminsk said. ''Everything was working for him. He had good
command of his breaking pitches, his fastball and changeup. He went
after the hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   The only run against the 22-year-old Baez came in the fifth on
two singles and a ground out. In the sixth, he made short work of
potential trouble -- retiring three straight hitters after a leadoff
triple.
</P>
<P>
   Baez, speaking through an interpreter, said his control and
mechanics were sound.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched for the Cuban National Team and defected while
playing in the Pan Am games in Canada. The Indians signed Baez to a
$14.5 million, four-year contract last November. Baez is ranked by
Baseball America as the No. 2 prospect in the Cleveland
organization.

   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Chad Curtis had four RBIs and Rafael
Palmeiro hit a two-run homer in the first inning as the Texas
Rangers beat the Minnesota Twins 8-3 Saturday night to stop a
five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>

walks in 3 1-3 innings.

douvle steal in the first, allowing two runs to score, but the
Rangers took a 3-2 lead in the bottom half on Curtis' solo shot and
Palmeiro's sixth homer of the year.
</P>
<P>

Alicea added a run-scoring double off Mark Redman in the seventh.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Camp Attacked in Philippines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- The Philippines launched an attack
on a remote Muslim rebel camp Saturday in an attempt to rescue 27
hostages, saying it had ''no option'' other than a military one.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 soldiers were fighting an estimated 230-250 rebels in
the rescue attempt, which was continuing late Saturday, said Gen.
Angelo Reyes, the armed forces chief of staff. Officials said at
least three government soldiers have been killed in the fighting,
which continued Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the attack, the rebels threatened to kill the
five remaining male hostages, including a priest, if the government
did not halt its rescue operation. The threat came three days after
the rebels said they had executed two male teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the operation, let (the military) come to get the heads
of each of the male hostages, including the priest,'' said rebel
spokesman Abu Ahmad.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes said the decision to attack the Abu Sayyaf rebel camp in
remote Basilan province was made by a provincial committee that has
handled the hostage negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's spokesman, Chris Puno, said the Abu Sayyaf's
earlier beheading of two hostages left the committee ''with no
option but to resort to a military operation.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels said they had beheaded the two men because the
government had ignored the conditions they set for the release of
the hostages, including the freeing of Arab terrorists held in
jails in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The group has demanded the release of Ramzi Yousef, mastermind
of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York, and
Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, accused of conspiring to blow up New York
City landmarks. The Philippine government and the U.S. Embassy have
rejected the demands.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes said he was unsure about rebel claims that nine government
troops had been killed in Saturday's rescue attempt.
</P>
<P>
   A hostage allowed by Ahmad to speak over a telephone to ABS-CBN
television, first-grade teacher Mrs. Lydia Aron, said the child
captives screamed when the assault began.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are afraid of all the shelling because our living quarters
do not offer any protection. The Abu Sayyaf are not moving us to
the bunkers because that is for them,'' she said. ''We appeal to
the government to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf said the military began pounding their camp, 550
miles south of Manila, with Howitzer cannons and mortars early
Saturday. Ahmad, the rebel spokesman, said the hostages were in
good condition despite the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels originally seized more than 50 people, including many
children, from two schools in Basilan on March 20 for use as human
shields after attacking an army outpost. Some of the hostages have
since been freed.
</P>
<P>
   In retaliation for the abduction, a group of vigilantes seized
11 relatives of Abu Sayyaf leader Khadaffy Janjalani. They are
still holding nine relatives after freeing Janjalani's pregnant
wife and a daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller but more radical of two Muslim
groups fighting for an independent Islamic state in the southern
Philippines. It has been blamed for numerous attacks on Christians,
including the abduction of foreign missionaries.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department has included the Abu Sayyaf in a list
of 28 foreign groups that threaten Americans at home or abroad.

   Johnston put Kansas City (5-0-1) ahead after taking a restart

Johnston went across the box and fired the ball past goalie Scott
Garlick and into the far corner of the net.
</P>
<P>

benched Raul Diaz Arce and Dominic Kinnear in favor of Manny Lagos
and Eric Quill in the second half.

<HEADLINE> Tamil Rebels Claim Base Seized  </HEADLINE>
By DILSHIKA JAYAMAHA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Sri Lankan rebels fighting for an
independent homeland said they captured a key military complex
Saturday after a furious two-day battle, and inflicted heavy
casualties on government troops.
</P>
<P>
   Military spokesman Brig. Palitha Fernando said he could not
confirm or deny the rebels' claim to have seized the vital Elephant
Pass base and the adjoining Yakachchi camp. But he admitted the
government has made some strategic withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have adjusted our positions in the area and we are well
prepared to defend Jaffna'' on the northernmost tip of the island,
Fernando said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels said 1,000 government soldiers were killed in the
bloody, 48-hour operation to capture the base, but the military
said only 49 soldiers and 150 rebels had died.
</P>
<P>
   A military statement issued Saturday said that heavy fighting
was continuing and that troops had ''readjusted their defense line
north of Elephant Pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach military and government officials in the
northern Jaffna peninsula were not successful. It is not possible
independently to verify government and rebel claims since
journalists are barred from the battle zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam are fighting for a homeland
for the minority Tamils. The war, which began in 1983, has left
more than 62,000 people dead in this island nation. The rebels
accuse the majority Sinhalese of discrimination against Tamils in
education and jobs, a charge the government denies.
</P>
<P>
   The base allegedly captured by the rebels Saturday guards
Elephant Pass, a strategic causeway linking the northern peninsula
with the rest of the country. The area got its name from the
elephants that once waded across the shallow lagoons in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Since November, the rebels have been trying to seize the
Elephant Pass causeway so that they can regain control of their
former stronghold, Jaffna, which they lost in 1995. The battle
escalated in March, with the rebels capturing small pockets along
the 25-mile highway.
</P>
<P>
   ''The conquest of the Elephant Pass complex, the largest and
well-entrenched military base in the north, signified a major
victory of the Tigers,'' the rebels said in a statement from their
London office. ''The LTTE fighters are now in full control of the
Yakachchi-Elephant Pass sector.''
</P>
<P>
   The LTTE said its commandos had destroyed several military
artillery pieces, tanks, armored vehicles and ammunition dumps.
They claimed that government troops had fled with the collapse of
the base and the camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Elephant Pass is 185 miles north of the capital, Colombo.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, the Defense Ministry said in a statement that
at least 56 guerrillas were killed during the last two days when
they tried to overrun military positions around Elephant Pass. It
said two soldiers were killed and 31 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Government troops also foiled a rebel sea landing during the
fierce fighting that began Thursday, the ministry said. The
military has so far admitted that the army had only withdrawn from
certain areas after losing 32 soldiers in fierce fighting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   President Chandrika Kumaratunga on Friday appointed one of Sri
Lanka's most decorated war heroes, Maj. Gen. Janaka Perera,
commander of the northern troops.

   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Ronald Cerritos and Abdul Thompson
Conteh scored two goals apiece Saturday night as the San Jose
Earthquakes broke out of a scoring slump with a 5-0 victory over
the Dallas Burn.
</P>
<P>
   The Earthquakes (2-2-1), who entered the game with a league-low
three goals, went ahead after just 10 minutes, when Cerritos
crossed a ball into the middle for Conteh, who was knocked down in
the box. Cerritos converted the resulting penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   Four minutes later, Burn goalie Matt Jordan, pressured by
Cerritos, slipped and fell as he attempted to clear the ball. Dario
Brose collected the ball and fired it in before Jordan could
recover.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks tallied twice in four minutes again before halftime,
with Cerritos making it 3-0 in the 36th minute and Conteh adding
another in the 40th.
</P>
<P>
   Conteh closed the scoring with 20 minutes remaining. Ian Russell
took the ball on the left side of the box, then crossed to the
right post. The ball went over a Dallas defender's head to Conteh,
who drove a shot past Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas fell to 3-3.

<HEADLINE> Cops Arrest Little Havana Protesters  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS, and
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Riot police with batons and shields beat down
rioting demonstrators in Little Havana Saturday after Elian
Gonzalez was snatched away by federal agents. More than 290 people
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   By midnight, however, the protest turned into a noisy but
relatively peaceful parade as thousands of cars with flags and
honking horns crawled through nearby Cuban-American neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Sporadic violence began minutes after the pre-dawn raid on
Lazaro Gonzalez's house and spread across Little Havana, with
demonstrators starting hundreds of small fires and uprooting
concrete benches.
</P>
<P>
   Police cleared out one area only to have another protest pop up
a few blocks away in the working-class neighborhood. Police roughly
dragged away protesters young and old, beating many. Demonstrators
fought among themselves and several police were injured, a few
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   As the night wore on and police closed streets and clamped down
on protesters, the demonstrators poured into surrounding
neighborhoods. Police mostly watched as the defiant late-night
protests stayed calm.
</P>
<P>
   Near midnight in Hialeah, a city just a few miles from Little
Havana, 2,000 people lined the main street for a loud, honking car
parade, complete with obscene signs for President Clinton and
Attorney General Janet Reno. Close to 1,000 cars clogged roads west
of Coral Gables, five miles from Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a Cuban, I don't agree with people destroying things or
making fires,'' said Carmen Albarello, 45. ''I'm here with my flag,
but peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   By early morning, police blocked several streets and the crowds
of cars cleared out.
</P>
<P>
   Police mostly stood by in Hialeah, a marked change from the
harsh response in Little Havana, where they fired tear gas, beat
protesters and dragged them off to buses and paddywagons.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are protesting to save the liberty of this country,'' said
Ruben Rodriguez, a 46-year-old bus driver who was gassed during the
early protests. ''Communism is right around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Three officers who were attacked with a bat were hospitalized in
stable condition, said Miami Police Lt. Bill Schwartz. A
29-year-old man was jailed on charges of attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   Four news photographers -- two video and two still -- were also
arrested on various charges, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters started more than 207 fires, mostly burning tires and
trash. Emergency crews answered at least 69 injury calls while a
nearby hospital treated 11 people, all for minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   As the night turned to early morning, much of Little Havana
appeared deserted after police blocked cars from entering the area
and urged pedestrians to leave. On 27th Avenue, the focus of many
of the day's protests, no cars could be seen -- except for police
cruisers at every intersection.
</P>
<P>
   At the home of Elian's Miami relatives -- the scene of five
months of waiting and watching -- no protesters remained by
midnight. Only residents could pass police barricades, while city
crews cleaned the mess.
</P>
<P>
   Still, sporadic fires of tires or garbage containers burned on
empty streets until fire crews reached them. Occasionally, a clump
of protesters gathered on a street corner and police chased them
away.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference early in the evening, Miami Mayor Joe
Carollo and Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas called on the community
to be peaceful, but also talked of their shock at the federal
action.
</P>
<P>
   ''That never should have happened in such a way,'' Carollo said.
''Not in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the mayors urged calm, an angry crowd tore down
the CNN tent at the house where Elian had lived. Shouting ''Get
out, get out,'' several dozen stormed into the tent and knocked its
equipment over.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of police wearing gas masks and helmets cleared the
street. Later, police officials told reporters they could no longer
protect them.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, no protesters remained. But a few blocks
away, 70 police in riot gear faced off against 60 booing protesters
on street corners, with more waving flags from apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, police in small groups or walking 30-strong down
the avenues shooed away protesters and scuffled with those that
resisted.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly man was handcuffed and dragged on his knees toward a
police wagon. Officers threw down a girl in her 20s wearing
flip-flops and handcuffed her. A teen-ager riding a bicycle was
knocked down by police in an unmarked car, beaten and handcuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is terrible,'' said Cristina Valdes, 67, who was among
dozens of people venting their anger by banging on a parked van.
''I'm ashamed to be an American. Clinton is a coward, coward,
coward.''
</P>
<P>
   Police were not nearly as patient with demonstrators Saturday as
they were in early January, when hundreds of Cuban-Americans jammed
downtown streets for hours to protest Reno's decision to return
Elian to his father. Police arrested about 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   About 800,000 Cuban-Americans live in Miami-Dade County,
accounting for 35 percent of its 2.1 million residents. In Tampa,
several hundred people protested peacefully Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Saul Sanchez, a protest organizer who had urged
nonviolence, said he was planning a work stoppage in the city on
Tuesday to protest the federal government's swift snatching of
6-year-old Elian.
</P>
<P>
   In the shocked moments after federal agents swept in before
dawn, demonstrators responded with shouts and accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters climbed onto state highways and stopped traffic near
the airport, while others deliberately slowed their vehicles. State
troopers cleared them away. A motorcycle trooper was struck by a
car and seriously injured. Police said it appeared to be an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Many protesters refrained from violence, waving Cuban flags and
upside down American flags.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of people doing the wrong thing. The escalation
is just ridiculous,'' said Omar Silva, 42, who carried a giant
Cuban flag.
</P>
<P>
   Others set fire to a pile of tires, rubbish and plastic trash
cans at an intersection a few blocks from the house where Elian was
taken.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been quiet and kept in my home until now,'' said Ozzie
Zamora. ''But what our country did today was wrong. Everyone should
come out and protest.''
</P>
<P>
   One protester who jumped through the glass window of a service
station was chased down by eight officers. They smashed his head
into the ground, handcuffed him and took him away.
</P>
<P>
   At the home of Elian's relatives, people called a man a
communist infiltrator and beat and kicked him, then poked him in
the eye. A mob of at least 20 crowded around while others urged
calm.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not animals,'' a woman yelled as the scuffling crowd
tumbled down the street. ''We don't want to be like Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   Two high school students, standing a few blocks from the worst
of the unrest, held up a bedsheet scrawled with this message:
''Miami, Please Not Another L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters lashed out at President Clinton and Reno, who ordered
the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ''Send Chelsea to Castro,'' said one protester's sign. ''Reno,
you have betrayed our trust. Ten children in Waco and Elian
condemned today,'' said another, a reference to the 1993 raid on
the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Others denounced the government for snatching Elian the day
before Easter.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is like crucifying the Messiah all over again. This is a
slap in the face to the Cuban-American community and the Christian
community,'' said Ralph Anrrich, a social worker.
</P>
<P>
   Photos were released after the boy was reunited with his father
showing Elian smiling. But protester Emy Peterson said Elian's
father isn't the issue -- Fidel Castro is. She carried a sign
saying: ''Reno: Which 'experts' on child psychology did you
consult? Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   Others predicted there would be no end to the demonstrations
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not over yet. How can you forget something like this?''
asked Ivette Morales, 30. ''It's been 40 years since the Bay of
Pigs and we still haven't forgotten that.''

Elian Reunited With His Father
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez was back in his father's
arms Saturday after federal agents used battering rams and pepper spray to
hustle him from Miami and the relatives fighting to block his return to Cuba.
The boy's Miami relatives arrived in Washington to try and see the boy. Crying
with fright, the 6-year-old Cuban boy was taken before dawn and flown to Andrews
Air Force Base outside Washington, where he was in seclusion with his father,
stepmother and baby half-brother. Though in his father's custody, Elian's fate
still remains unsettled. The courts will ultimately rule on whether the boy
should remain in the United States.

They were turned away from the air base gate behind which Elian was reunited
with his father. The group attempted to hold a news conference outside Andrews
Air Force, but gave up amid a crush of protesters and news media, saying only
that they would make another attempt to see Elian and his Cuban father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, on Sunday. The group included Lazaro Gonzalez, who has cared
for the boy in his house for the five months since Elian's rescue at sea; cousin
Marisleysis Gonzalez, and the fisherman who rescued him, Donato Dalrymple.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A tentative contract agreement has been
reached to end a nearly three-week-old janitors' strike, though
workers won't return to their jobs until the deal is ratified, a
union official said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was reached Saturday night, after about seven
hours of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   A ratification vote was scheduled set for Monday, three weeks to
the day that 8,500 janitors walked off the job throughout Los
Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for both sides refused to release details pending the
vote, but pronounced themselves pleased with the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Garcia, president of Service Employees International Union
Local 1877, said he hopes the janitors approve the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good deal, but we can't comment more than that,''
Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Davis, a chief negotiator for the cleaning companies, said
unionized janitors could be back on the job as early as Monday
night if the contract is approved.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a decent deal for both sides,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies had been using replacement workers since April 3, when
the janitors walked struck against 18 cleaning contractors who
handle most of the city's commercial properties.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reached Saturday was with nine contractors that
handle 97 percent of the affected buildings, Davis said. The other
firms are small and are expected to agree to any deal struck, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The janitors generally earn between $6.80 and $7.90, and were
seeking wage increases of $1-an-hour per year for each of the next
three years. Contractors had offered more modest raises.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's talks were the first held since last Wednesday, when
negotiations broke off with both sides only a nickel apart on
wages.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said some property owners worked behind the scenes to
encourage both sides to settle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a little give and take with both sides'' led to
agreement, he said. ''It's been a tough strike for both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   The first week of the strike was marked by a series of ''rolling
strikes'' in which janitors shut down more and more buildings as
each day went by. Wearing red T-shirts and hoisting ''Justice for
Janitors'' signs, they marched through downtown streets, blocked
busy intersections, held candlelight vigils.
</P>
<P>
   They also staged mass protests that stopped traffic around
high-rises and office buildings in West Los Angeles and neighboring
Beverly Hills. Sympathy strikes were staged in New York, Chicago
and other cities.

<HEADLINE> Arrest Made in N.M. Pilgrim Deaths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALCALDE, N.M. (AP) -- A man was arrested early Sunday and charged
with murder in the deaths of two teen-agers killed during a Good
Friday pilgrimage to a church where thousands of people hope for
miracles.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Herrera, 19, of Espanola, was arrested at a friend's home
in Alcalde around 2:40 a.m., said state police Sgt. Royleen
Ross-Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   She said Herrera was an acquaintance of the 17-year-olds
shooting victims, Richard Martinez and Karen Castanon, but did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was found lying on a highway before daybreak Friday
about 30 miles north of Santa Fe. Castanon, his girlfriend, was
found several miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers were among thousands of pilgrims making the
annual spiritual trek to the Santuario de Chimayo, a small Roman
Catholic church in the tiny village of Chimayo that is said to
contain healing dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Ross-Weaver said the arrest was made after police made a public
appeal for help and received a phone tip. ''We were able to develop
the suspect and we also have physical evidence linking him to the
crime,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 200 years, pilgrims have journeyed to Chimayo to
visit the church. Last year, an estimated 65,000 people visited the
church during Holy Week.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of the church, in a room next to the sanctuary, is a
small hole with dirt thought to possess healing power. Left nearby
are crutches, canes and rosaries left by believers.

<HEADLINE> Inner Work of Cancer Cells Studied  </HEADLINE>
By VICKIE CHACHERE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Cancer researchers sometimes liken their work
to wandering through a forest of genetic material hoping to find
the paths that lead to better diagnosis, treatments and possibly
cures.
</P>
<P>
   Now researchers at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research
Institute have a new high-tech guide for their journey. They are
using a machine called a DNA microarray that can scan the thousands
of genes in a cancer cell at one time and point out new paths to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Moffitt doctors said research that took them 10 years to conduct
can now be accomplished in a single afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great new stuff,'' said Jack Pledger, associate center
director for basic research. ''It's at the forefront of cancer
research.''
</P>
<P>
   The Moffitt effort is part of a $4.1 million National Cancer
Institute project that established microarray laboratories in 24
institutions nationwide. The Moffitt laboratory is the only one the
NCI awarded for Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The microarray is actually a collection of machines and
computers that can take the genetic material of a cancer cell, copy
it onto a computer chip and scan it into a computer that compares
the diseased cell to a healthy one.
</P>
<P>
   In vivid green, blue and fuchsia dots the machine highlights
differences for researchers to further explore.
</P>
<P>
   Pledger said as scientists learn more about the molecular basis
of cancer, they eventually hope to further distinguish between
different types of cancer that attack the same part of the body.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they hope that will make for more accurate diagnosis
of the disease, aid in the development of new drugs that target the
damaged DNA and improve the treatment decisions patients and their
doctors make, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be doing a better job of diagnosis,'' said Lou Stoudt,
a National Cancer Institute senior investigator who oversees a
microarray project in Bethesda, Md. ''We will be rewriting the text
books on cancer diagnosis and giving cancer a molecular diagnosis
instead of just what it looks like under the microscope.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its high-tech promise, the microarray appears as a
humble-looking collection of machines. One resembles an office
copier, another looks strangely like a rotisserie cooker.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-hour process begins with researchers extracting the
genetic material from a cancer cell, transferring its image to a
slide that can be read by the computer that does the comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Moffitt keeps a library of computer chips that store all the
known genes and some unknown genes from healthy cells to use for
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   On a computer screen, researchers can clearly see the healthy
and diseased cells line up next to each other, the differences
between them apparent. Whether the abnormalities the researchers
can see in the cancer cell is exactly what's causing it to grow out
of control requires further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Deepak Agrawal, scientific director of Moffitt's microarray lab,
said the machine doesn't do all the work for researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 100,000 genes in a human cell, scientists know the
function of only about 7,000. But that body of knowledge is
expanding under the Human Genome project in which scientists hope
to map all of the body's genes.
</P>
<P>
   The NCI's Stoudt said the microarray has created entirely new
opportunities for cancer exploration that didn't exist a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''You wouldn't do this work without these machines,'' he said.
''We in molecular biology have looked at one or two or three genes
at a time. Here on our microarrays we look at 18,500 genes at a
time. It gives you sort of a birds-eye view of the workings of a
cancer cell that hadn't been seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors eventually hope to expand the use of microarrays to
other genetic diseases, particularly those of the immune system
like lupus.
</P>
<P>
   Pledger said he hopes the microarray might lead doctors to the
answers of some of a patient's most difficult questions about
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why do some people smoke a pack a day and never get lung
cancer and some people never smoke and do? Why does chemotherapy
work for some people and not for others?'' he asked. ''We don't
know. This kind of machinery, this is what will do it for us.''

<HEADLINE> Professors Study Potholes  </HEADLINE>
By MARK JEWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) -- Each day, Tom Papagiannakis and Eyad Masad
wrestle with their own version of the classic question about the
chicken crossing the road.
</P>
<P>
   Only there's no chicken.
</P>
<P>
   The question the Washington State University civil engineering
professors ask is this: Why did the pothole form in the road?
</P>
<P>
   Or, more precisely: Where did a mistake occur that led to the
pothole's formation -- in the selection and mixing of the asphalt's
aggregate and binders, or in the placement of the materials on the
road bed?
</P>
<P>
   It's a question the pavement sleuths frequently get from highway
officials this time of year -- ''the evil season,'' as Papagiannakis
calls it, when potholes can make a Sunday drive seem like a trip on
the highway to hell.
</P>
<P>
   Early spring is the harshest season for northern roads. Road
beds frozen solid in the winter become soggy and vulnerable when
they thaw.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could prevent those potholes if people agreed to stay off
the roads for two weeks at the end of March,'' Papagiannakis says.
''But I don't think that's going to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   So Papagiannakis and Masad look for other ways to stretch the
public's road funds as politicians talk of cutting gas taxes to
ease the sting of rising fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   The professors are believers in Superpave, a road-building
approach pioneered in the late 1980s and early '90s through a $50
million federal research program at government and university labs
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Superpave is not a new type of pavement, but a new way of
designing it. Using exact specifications, engineers who once took a
largely one-size-fits-all approach to road building now can tailor
the asphalt mix to the climate and traffic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Superpave approach helps equip experts like the WSU
professors with the answers paving crews seek as they try to extend
the life of highways carrying ever-larger trucks and more traffic.
</P>
<P>
   How do you prevent ''shoving'' that occurs when the force of
vehicles stopping at traffic lights leaves ruts in the asphalt?
Make sure the rocks in the mix are angular rather than round, and
be careful to tightly bind them with liquid asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   How to keep pavement from cracking in freezing conditions?
Choose an extremely strong binder, for starters.
</P>
<P>
   Papagiannakis and Masad consider Superpave the biggest advance
in the field since the late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ''It put us on the right track to look at the scientific reasons
behind pavement failures,'' Masad says.
</P>
<P>
   The university's role in promoting Superpave got a boost with
the Feb. 1 opening of the Washington Center for Asphalt Technology,
headed by Papagiannakis and Masad.
</P>
<P>
   The center, supported in part by donations from the
road-construction industry and state Department of Transportation,
features $300,000 in equipment that allows the professors to design
asphalt mixes to meet Superpave specifications. The gear also
enables the center to test asphalt core samples from roads that
developed potholes and other problems for microscopic clues as to
what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The lab's most expensive tool is a $40,000 compactor that can
simulate 10 years of road wear in 24 hours. The lab also features
ovens that test asphalt in temperature extremes from 180 degrees
Fahrenheit to minus-30.
</P>
<P>
   A state transportation department lab in Tumwater has similar
equipment, but it is geared more toward work related to specific
road projects, said Linda Pierce, a pavement engineer at the state
lab.
</P>
<P>
   WSU's center, one of about a dozen university-based asphalt
technology labs around the country, can collaborate with other
universities to conduct broader research.
</P>
<P>
   ''This offers a forum where industry and academia can get
together with the state and prioritize some areas of research,''
said David Spivey, executive director of the Asphalt Paving
Association of Washington, which helps fund WSU's lab.
</P>
<P>
   Superpave has been introduced gradually over the last seven
years, with some states now using the design method for nearly all
major roads projects and others just beginning to test it.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a fifth of the state's major roads projects use
Superpave methods, with plans to completely switch over by 2005,
Pierce says.
</P>
<P>
   Costs for the state's first Superpave projects were higher than
with traditional methods. But the difference is negligible now that
highway officials and contractors are familiar with the new
process, Pierce says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Contractors like it, and we like it,'' she says.

<HEADLINE> Sands Drift From N.C. State Park  </HEADLINE>
By MELINDA DESLATTE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGS HEAD, N.C. (AP) -- Jockey's Ridge State Park, the tallest
sand dune on the Atlantic Coast and one of the most extraordinary,
natural, living wonders in the world, has a unique problem: It
won't stay put.
</P>
<P>
   Strong winds are pushing the 419-acre park steadily south at a
rate of 3 feet to 6 feet each year. Three hurricanes since last
August reshaped the dune, which swallowed a miniature golf course,
migrated 600 feet in some areas and routinely spills onto back
yards and driveways.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials want to preserve the dune because it provides a
habitat for a variety of plants, wild game, birds and rodents that
can survive the harsh and windy climate. Researchers and park
officials have joined in trying to devise a long-term plan to
corral the shifting sands.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1995, officials asked the public for recommendations.
Five years later, the suggestion box is still open.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here we are trying to manage resources in a park that is
inherently mobile within a fixed boundary,'' said Sue Regier, who
is in charge of the resource management program at the North
Carolina Division of Parks and Recreation.
</P>
<P>
   At about 85 feet in height, Jockey's Ridge contains 10.4 million
cubic yards of sand, enough to fill about six million dump trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Five scientists recently completed a two-year study of the
park's geological history and likely future movement. The
researchers studied when and how the dune formed and how it has
changed. They examined the sand supply, vegetation, wind and
visitor impact.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials say the study will help them better understand
the sand movement so they can contain Jockey's Ridge within its
boundaries, but the options are limited.
</P>
<P>
   Jockey's Ridge, bordered on one side by Roanoke Sound, is the
southernmost in a series of massive dunes extending north to False
Cape, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's over a mile long. I tell people it's visible from the
space shuttle,'' said Marshall Ellis, a resource management
specialist with the park service. ''It's quite a sand pile. It just
won't stay still.''
</P>
<P>
   The park is beginning to encroach on Soundside Road, which
borders the southern end of the dune and is the site of several
homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the trouble spot. That's the cork in the bottle,'' said
Ellis, who has been studying the dune.
</P>
<P>
   When the sand became too serious a threat to six homes, the park
service bought them. A massive pile of sand now occupies the spot
where one house was torn down.
</P>
<P>
   The sand dune was designated a state park in 1975 and is a
popular attraction for hang gliders, campers and anyone with a kite
and an adventurous spirit. Scientists believe the sand originally
came from offshore islands and was transported by strong winds.
</P>
<P>
   But recent storms -- including Hurricanes Dennis, Floyd and Irene
last year alone -- continue to wreak havoc on the dune.
</P>
<P>
   ''This place is pretty fragile. Anything you do has an effect on
it,'' said park superintendent George Barnes. ''It moved a lot
faster because of the storms. The storms really messed us up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, more than 1.2 million people visited the park last
year, and a 25th anniversary celebration is planned for June.
</P>
<P>
   Cola Vaughan co-owns and manages a rental home on the same side
of Soundside Road as Jockey's Ridge. Part of the sand dune looms
over his back yard. When that happened before, he said, the park
service moved the sand.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not terribly concerned. If they do a haul like they did
four or five years ago, that will keep the sand under control,'' he
said. ''They want their sand. It's like owning a dairy farm, and
the cows keep wandering off.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say the dune is losing its height, although the
amount of sand is the same. Once a pointy, 110-foot-tall behemoth,
it now is 25 feet shorter and rounder.
</P>
<P>
   The park service installed fences and bulldozed sand. It bought
the six homes and the land that was the site for the miniature golf
course after the course was swallowed by the dune. Today, the
turrets of a miniature castle poke from the mounds of sand. Barnes
said officials will consider buying other properties if the owners
make an offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''(But) we can't keep buying up property. Our neighbors probably
wouldn't want that,'' Regier said. ''We're dealing with them as
willing sellers. We're not actively pursuing them, though the dune
could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Four-foot-tall fences and old Christmas trees placed throughout
the park to catch the sand now are buried in it. Only a few
branches and fence posts are visible.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers and park officials are reviewing countermeasures.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've basically got three choices,'' Ellis said. ''You can do
nothing, which is not an option, you can haul sand away on a
regular basis, or you can vegetate it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hauling is what we've been doing, but hauling sand is
expensive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Regier said 50,000 cubic yards of sand could be moved about
every five years from the park's southern end to the northern end
for recycling back through the dune.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said 40,000 cubic yards of sand were moved in 1994; 8,000
cubic yards in 1996; and 4,000 cubic yards in February. Park
officials are seeking permits to move another 40,000 to 50,000
cubic yards of sand this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Regier said a regular bulldozing program could put the park on a
cycle that might control sand movement without harming the dune.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hauling sand seems to be the only sure decision now,'' Ellis
said. ''Hauling sand is the easy thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Park officials also are considering planting vegetation. The
study shows the dune was stabilized twice that way since its
development, but fire, wind or salt spray destroyed the vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   Regier and Ellis warn that anchoring the dune with plants would
defeat the purpose of having an active dune system.
</P>
<P>
   Most residents feel the same way, said Majid Elbers, who lives
at the northern end of the park and is president of the board of
directors for the Friends of Jockey's Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody who has been involved in this project in any way has
(been opposed) to grassing it over,'' she said. ''What's exciting
about the park is the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wright Brothers Memorial in nearby Kill Devil Hills once had
a marching dune, but in the late 1920s, the state stabilized the
dune with grass, and it is now a grassy hill, Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we're going to vegetate (Jockey's Ridge), we're only
talking about this southern end. But the majority of the park, we
would not even consider that,'' he said. ''We acquired the dune
because we wanted to keep it as a naturally functioning dune.''

<HEADLINE> Non-Nuke States Urge Disarmament  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Countries without nuclear weapons say they
intend to let the United States and other nuclear powers know they
want an unequivocal commitment to disarmament at a conference that
starts Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When 187 nations gather for the four-week dialogue to review the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the non-nuclear states will likely
cast a critical eye at the United States, Russia, Britain, France
and China.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years after the treaty was signed, nations that disavowed
nuclear weapons are frustrated that the treaty's goal of a world
free of nuclear weapons appears to be slipping away -- even with
Russia's ratification of two key nuclear agreements last week.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will be among the first
speakers Monday and is likely to defend Washington's record.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some countries have the quite unrealistic notion that
disarmament is something that happens overnight,'' said State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin. ''The fact is that the United
States has led the way among the nuclear powers in trying to
reverse the nuclear arms race.''
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, which went into force in 1970, represented a bargain
between the nuclear haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   In return for a pledge from non-nuclear states not to acquire
nuclear weapons, the treaty committed nuclear-weapon states to
pursue nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when the treaty's 25-year term was set to expire, the
United States led the successful campaign to extend the treaty
indefinitely, promising ''systematic and progressive efforts''
toward disarmament and a global ban on nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   But there is widespread feeling that the efforts have not gone
far enough and that the spread of weapons has in fact increased.
India and Pakistan have become official nuclear states after
conducting rival nuclear tests in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the 66-nation Conference on Disarmament, the main
disarmament forum, has deadlocked on a new disarmament agenda.
There has been no progress on a treaty to cut off production of
weapons-grade plutonium and uranium. Ten years after the Cold War,
thousands of U.S. and Russian warheads remain on ''hair-trigger''
alert.
</P>
<P>
   Global disarmament negotiations on a host of issues were
virtually gridlocked until the Russian Duma ratified the
long-delayed START II treaty to cut nuclear arsenals last week. On
Friday, the Duma ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which
the U.S. Senate refused to ratify last year.
</P>
<P>
   Russia hopes the two votes will generate support for its drive
to stop the United States from building a nuclear missile defense
system -- an issue that is likely to feature prominently in the
conference. Critics say the U.S. system would trigger a new arms
race.
</P>
<P>
   The recent Russian action ''helps to relieve some of the gloom
surrounding some of this conference, and will help to answer some
of the criticism with regard to nuclear disarmament,'' said U.N.
Undersecretary-General for Disarmament Jayantha Dhanapala.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that criticism is expected to come from a group of
moderate countries called the New Agenda Coalition, which has
successfully lobbied the U.N. General Assembly to approve a
resolution on steps toward a world free of nuclear weapons for the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition, which consists of South Africa, Brazil, Ireland,
Egypt, New Zealand, Mexico and Sweden, has demanded that
nuclear-weapon states ''make an unequivocal undertaking to
accomplish the speedy and total elimination of their nuclear
arsenals and to engage without delay in an accelerated process of
negotiations, thus achieving nuclear disarmament.''

<HEADLINE> Yemeni Drug Comes to America  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In a tiny Brooklyn cafe with faded tourist
posters of Yemen in the window, the mood at a table of Arab men
darkens when the topic turns to khat.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my country, khat is easy,'' says Abdul Rahman. ''Everybody,
the president, they have it. ... I don't understand this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahman, a 26-year-old Yemeni, was working at the cafe on the
Islamic holiday Eid al-Adha when narcotics officers walked in and
busted three men in the basement on drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   Raids at the Blue Province Restaurant and two other Yemeni
businesses last month had nothing to do with cocaine, designer
drugs or even marijuana. Instead, the target was people selling
khat, a stimulating leaf that many in the Middle East chew like
tobacco and consider no more sinister than a double espresso.
</P>
<P>
   Rahman and other Arab immigrants in Brooklyn say that before the
raids they had no idea khat (pronounced cot) was illegal here.
</P>
<P>
   ''The community has been consuming khat for a long time -- this
is not a secret,'' said Ali Sharaf, a member of a Yemen-American
student group. ''I'm surprised that now it's a big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Yemen, khat chewing is commonplace, often a daily
practice. It's the same in Djibouti and Somalia on the Horn of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities got interested when khat appeared more and more
in Arab communities around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a serious problem,'' said New York City police
spokesman Sgt. Andrew McInnis. ''We responded to complaints about
the negative impact on the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities allege the suspects arrested in the raids were
breaking laws banning possession of cathonine -- the key ingredient
in freshly cut khat leaves, which look like basil. The federal
government lists cathonine as a ''Schedule I'' controlled
substance, the same category as heroin, LSD and ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Khat chewers say it gives them energy and a feeling of euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   But the Drug Enforcement Administration maintains that khat is
psychologically addictive.
</P>
<P>
   Compulsive use, the DEA says, ''may result in manic behavior
with grandiose delusions or in a paranoid type of illness,
sometimes accompanied by hallucinations.''
</P>
<P>
   Khat is believed to have been traded as a commodity even before
coffee. Its use originated in Ethiopia, then spread through east
Africa and parts of the Middle East. Muslim legend has it that its
stimulant effect enabled all-night prayer vigils.
</P>
<P>
   But now some people in Yemen are worried that too many
government workers were wasting away their afternoons -- and their
income -- chewing khat. President Ali Abdullah Saleh has tried to
set an example by announcing he will only chew on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations estimates that in Djibouti, 98 percent of the
men use khat to numb the pain of poverty. Somalian warlords dole it
out to soldiers as part of daily rations.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the market for khat appears to be limited
and nonviolent. Customs officers confiscated 49,000 pounds of khat
in fiscal 1999, compared to 1.2 million pounds of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the khat was seized at the New York area airports.
Agents who caught a whiff of the plant's pungent smell during
random inspections last year found a total of 30,500 pounds stashed
in luggage, mainly in amounts so small the couriers weren't
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Seizures also have been made at Denver's airport, on the New
Jersey Turnpike and in Minneapolis. In San Jose, Calif., a Yemeni
man was arrested in 1998 for growing 1,000 plants in what was
described as the first khat plantation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, khat ''is probably not one of our priorities,'' said New
York DEA spokesman Stan Skowronski.
</P>
<P>
   Police launched the Brooklyn investigation about six months ago
after learning that street dealers were peddling khat around Arab
storefronts. The going price was $40 for a day's supply.
</P>
<P>
   On March 15, an undercover officer bought khat at a Yemeni
restaurant. The next day, the Islamic holiday, officers found
customers lined up for refrigerated khat being cut up and sold at
the Blue Province Restaurant, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time officers wrapped up the investigation, they had
seized about 240 pounds of khat and arrested eight people. The
defendants face up to seven years in prison if convicted of felony
drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   James Palumbo, attorney for one suspect, said his client was
shocked to find himself the target of a drug bust. The community,
he added, doesn't need to see anyone go to jail to be scared
straight.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are law-abiding people,'' he said. ''The cops have made
their point.''
</P>
<P>
   One young Yemenite, who identified himself only as Jamil,
admitted buying khat at the Blue Province only an hour before the
police raid.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're around (khat), you've got to have it,'' Jamil
said. ''But it's bad for us. We need to stop it.''

<HEADLINE> Baby Photographed Reaching From Womb  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOUGLASVILLE, Ga. (AP) -- Samuel Armas' parents love to show off
photos of their baby boy, particularly one taken nearly four months
before he was born.
</P>
<P>
   The photo, shot during in-utero surgery to correct a birth
defect, shows Samuel's penny-sized fist reaching outside Julie
Armas' womb, grasping at a doctor's finger.
</P>
<P>
   That tiny fist has added fuel to an international abortion
debate, appearing on anti-abortion billboards in Ireland and in
newspapers in France, Germany, Norway, Singapore and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents say the image shows fetuses -- even at only 21
weeks -- are viable and aware.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights supporters say the parents' decision to have
fetal surgery to correct spina bifida is a good example of how
every woman should have the right to determine the course of her
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It mushroomed beyond what we thought it would,'' said Mrs.
Armas, 28. ''We wanted people to know that when we found out about
our baby, it was not the end of the world. There are options to
abortion and even to traditional treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Alex, 29, allowed USA Today in the
operating room for an article on the surgical team at Nashville's
Vanderbilt University.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel was the youngest fetus to have the surgery. Doctors
opened his mother's womb Aug. 19, 1999, and closed the opening in
his spine caused by the spina bifida, a congenital disease that
often leads to paralysis and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Joseph Bruner prepared to close the womb, Samuel rolled
over and thrust his fist through the surgical opening. Bruner
gently tucked the tiny hand back inside and finished the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Free-lance photographer Michael Clancy's captured the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows a baby before when we would consider it to be viable.
Clearly you have a tiny hand,'' said Laura Echevarria, spokeswoman
for the National Right to Life Committee. ''With the notoriety the
picture has garnered, we're seeing people becoming more educated
about fetal development. With that knowledge comes a renewed
respect for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights supporters, however, say the photo doesn't hurt
their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the prime examples of where it must be between
the doctor and the family,'' said Patricia Ireland, President of
the National Organization for Women. ''Just as the decision to have
in-utero surgery was made in this case, it cannot be a political
decision. It has to be a decision made by the woman that's carrying
the fetus.''
</P>
<P>
   The Armases had suffered through two miscarriages before
learning Mrs. Armas was pregnant with Samuel. Even after an
ultrasound revealed spina bifida and doctors told them the baby may
never walk and could have serious brain damage, the hope of having
a child overwhelmed their fears.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we had the first indication something was wrong, I didn't
care,'' Mrs. Armas said. ''I was 14 weeks pregnant. We still had a
heartbeat. I had a baby that was alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Armas, a registered nurse, began researching spina bifida
and read about a group of doctors in Nashville who were pioneering
fetal surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel, now 14{ pounds, is developing normally at the family's
home in Douglasville, a suburb 35 miles west of Atlanta. It's still
unclear whether he'll be able to walk; he sees a physical therapist
weekly and doctors monitor his progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''For us, there's a lot we want for him,'' Mrs. Armas said. ''He
will be computer literate, he'll speak Spanish. There are
multitudes of possibilities he could do. He'll swim and play
golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Tears well up in her eyes as she considers the challenges
overcome and those yet to be faced.
</P>
<P>
   But the problems caused by spina bifida are a small part of the
boy's life, added Aramas, an engineer for Delta Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ''The details of his limitations become insignificant,'' he
said, ''and that's the understatement of the year.''

<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Dr. Claudia L. Osborn teaches medical
students, but when she goes to the post office to mail a letter,
she sometimes mails her car keys by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   She is an excellent cook, but before beginning the task, she
must draw diagrams of exactly how she will prepare the food.
</P>
<P>
   And when she gets behind the wheel to drive, a little beeper on
her wrist goes off every three minutes to remind her to look at a
note on the dashboard, which states her destination.
</P>
<P>
   Osborn, author of ''Over My Head: A Doctor's Own Story of Head
Injury from the Inside Looking Out,'' is visiting Rochester on
Wednesday to talk about learning to live with a head injury.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago at age 33, Osborn was director of residency
training at two Detroit hospitals and a professor at Michigan State
University's College of Osteopathic Medicine. That all ended when
she went for a bike ride without wearing a helmet and was struck by
a car.
</P>
<P>
   Some initial symptoms -- difficulty speaking and understanding
others -- eventually improved. But she had permanent weakness to her
right side and damaged short-term memory.
</P>
<P>
   Most devastating was the loss of ''executive function,'' the
ability to carry out more than one task at a time. This left her
easily distracted and unable to generate ideas, organize thoughts
or make plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't do much of anything,'' Osborn said. ''I was told
over and over that I had a brain injury, but I had no way to absorb
that information. I couldn't perceive that anything was different
because my brain wasn't telling me it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborn insisted upon returning to work seven weeks after the
accident. When she forgot to look at a patient's X-ray, which could
have jeopardized the patient's life, Osborn was so shaken that she
went to a neurologist, who told her not to work until she received
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   In the hope of regaining her career, she spent 18 months at the
Head Trauma Program at the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation
Medicine at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. A few
months into the program, she began to realize the extent of her
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a sense of overwhelming devastation,'' she said. ''I
couldn't imagine living a life without medicine or how limited my
life had become.''
</P>
<P>
   Her injury also left her adynamic, which meant she spoke in a
monotone and had poor eye contact and little facial expression. By
watching tapes of herself, she learned how to become more animated
and ''eventually started to feel some of those emotions again.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a coach who was ''very good at instilling
hope,'' she learned how to use ''memory props'' to compensate for
the parts of her brain that no longer functioned. She maintained a
notebook containing her daily activities and placed cue cards
around the house instructing her how to carry out simple daily
tasks, like brushing her teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, her props are more sophisticated. She uses a portable
computer instead of a notebook and carries a digital recording
device to remind her to perform tasks. For example, when she lets
her dog out, she records a message, ''Let Mike back in in 20
minutes.'' Twenty minutes later, the recording goes off, reminding
her to do so.
</P>
<P>
   A second beeper goes off every 15 minutes, reminding her to
check her daily planner.
</P>
<P>
   This way of life is as exhausting as it sounds. ''By the end of
the day you can't have a very good conversation with her,'' said
her mother, Jeanne Findlater of Naples, Fla. ''She tires more
easily mentally and tries to work several breaks into her day.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Osborn seven years to write her book, but she said it is
her proudest achievement. She now spends much of her time on the
lecture circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling alone, she likens her first trips to I Love Lucy
episodes, where misunderstandings keep rippling until they are out
of control. If Osborn checked her bags at the ticket counter, went
to the bathroom and then forgot to set her alarm, she might become
disoriented. Instead of waiting for her flight, she'd return to her
car.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parking attendant knows me and tells me, 'You just arrived
half an hour a go, do you think you really want to leave?'''
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Osborn will be the first to tell you that the person she
was before the accident no longer exists. But she has learned to
develop her strengths -- her writing and teaching abilities.
</P>
<P>
   She is an associate clinical professor of medicine at Michigan
State University. And through her public appearances, Osborn tries
to impart to others with brain injuries what she has learned.
</P>
<P>
   ''The acceptance of self is essential if anyone is going to make
it -- the ability to move forward instead of sitting there and
remembering the old person you used to be,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> 'Glass Ceiling' Shows Some Cracks  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The ''glass ceiling'' that historically has
been a barrier to advancement by women in the workplace is showing
some cracks, a gradual change backed up by Census Bureau figures.
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough to ensure clear upward mobility for women, say
analysts and women's advocacy groups, but noticeable enough to
suggest that those comfortable corner offices and plush leather
chairs are no longer the sole dominion of men.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest government estimates, there were more
than 7.1 million women in full-time executive, administrative, or
managerial positions in 1998 -- a 29 percent jump from 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 9.4 million men had the same kinds of significant
jobs, but that represented only a 19 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''The glass ceiling definitely exists, but at the same time,
there are an increasing number of women who are breaking through
it,'' said Debra Meyerson, a professor of management, science and
engineering at Stanford University. ''It's proof that more women
are entering the workforce.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's more proof: In 1998, there were 514,000 more women in
executive positions than in 1997, compared to 392,000 more males in
such top-level posts during that same time frame.
</P>
<P>
   The broad category of executive, administrative and managerial
positions covers jobs from chief executives, to mid-level and
lower-level management positions, to women who own their own
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts point to a variety of factors, including the growing
number of single mothers and two income households in the
workforce. Females also make up 51 percent of the overall
population.
</P>
<P>
   But don't confuse those important gains in upper mobility with
reaching the long sought-after goal of pay equality with men, said
Wendy Rayner, chief information officer for New Jersey Gov.
Christine Whitman and a member of the organization Women Executives
in State Government.
</P>
<P>
   While the median income level for men and women in executive
positions both rose at the same 20 percent clip in 1998, men made
nearly $17,000 more -- $51,351, the statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a huge gap in term of funding, salaries and
compensation for what we do,'' Rayner said. ''But what we do have
is recognition; women are recognized now that they can contribute
equally at the boardroom, as men. We are recognized for that but we
are not finished.''
</P>
<P>
   But while more women are running their own businesses and own
seats on corporate boards, the gains must be viewed with caution,
Meyerson said.
</P>
<P>
   A study by Catalyst, a women's advocacy group based in New York,
found that women represented 11.9 percent of corporate officers in
America's 500 largest companies as of Mar. 31, 1999 -- a 37 percent
increase since 1995. The Catalyst study also showed the number of
companies with two or more women officers increased 28 percent,
from 220 to 282.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, men still hold 93 percent of what's known as ''line''
officer jobs -- high-profile jobs with profit-and-loss
responsibility that often lead to the top spots, the same study
shows. That means, said Meyerson, that many women who achieve
executive or management level are shuffled into ''staff'' positions
such as human resources or public relations.
</P>
<P>
   There are an increasing number of factors in the corporate
workplace that may seem neutral, but which turn out to adversely
affect women, she said. For instance, Meyerson pointed out that
women who stay late for meetings and fight to ''defend their turf''
in order to stay ahead are looked at in some companies as ''control
freaks'', while men with the same characteristics are merely
considered ''passionate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The exact same behavior was interpreted in different ways,''
Meyerson said. ''So women managers got bad reputations.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution won't arise until women get more access to the
so-called ''old-boy'' networks, where many informal discussions and
decisions take place, said Linda Stewart, secretary of the
Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, a $2.3 billion
agency with 2,200 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think you have to look at income level clearly, but I think
you also need to look at diversity of employment levels,'' she
added. ''That will tell you if there's been a real trend in terms
of getting women employed across the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, women are unmistakably making their mark on the workplace
in spite of the income disparity, said Marna Whittington, managing
director and chief operating officer of the Investment Management
Division at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's where a woman has an equal opportunity to use her skills
and do what she wants to do,'' she said, ''to be treated fairly as
a colleague, as a professional, and not as a woman.''

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court To Hear Gay Scout Case  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It took James Dale 11 years to rise through
the ranks of the Boy Scouts. It took the Boy Scouts only 11 days to
kick him out after learning he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   Dale was a Cub Scout at 8, a Boy Scout at 11, a member of the
Order of the Arrow at 13, an Eagle Scout at 17. His mom was a den
mother. His dad was a scouting commissioner. At 18, Dale became an
assistant scoutmaster.
</P>
<P>
   But the Boy Scouts of America expelled him in 1990 after
discovering he was co-president of Rutgers University's gay and
lesbian organization.
</P>
<P>
   James Anderson, faculty adviser to the group and Dale's friend
said the expulsion was a real setback for Dale.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Scouting) was really so central to his life, to his growing
up, to becoming a man,'' Anderson said. ''They slapped him for such
a core aspect of his being.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale struck back with a 1992 lawsuit accusing the Boy Scouts of
discrimination. The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments in the case
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts of America says homosexuality contradicts its
oath requiring scouts to be ''morally straight.'' That policy has
withstood numerous court challenges, said Gregg Shields, national
spokesman for the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've always taught traditional family values,'' Shields said.
''That goes back to our founding in 1910. An avowed homosexual
would not be a role model for those values.''
</P>
<P>
   But Evan Wolfson, who will argue Dale's case before the Supreme
Court, said an organization that claims to be open to all boys and
works in partnership with public schools ''cannot discriminate
against any young boy or young man because of his identity as
gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale, now 29, lives in New York City and is advertising director
for a magazine for people who are HIV-positive. He declined an
interview through his representatives at the Lambda Legal Defense
and Education Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In public comments over the years, Dale has spoken highly of his
scouting experience, saying it instilled in him the self-confidence
and fortitude he now needs in his legal battle. But he has nothing
good to say about the organization's treatment of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 interview with The Advocate, a national gay and
lesbian news magazine, Dale said the Boy Scouts spend valuable
resources defending their anti-gay policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are often these drives for kids to go to camp who can't
afford it,'' Dale said. ''If they stopped suing people for being
gay, they could afford to send a lot more people to camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale -- who changed his name before the dispute with the scouts --
is the younger of two sons of Gerald Dick, a lieutenant colonel in
the Army Reserve, and his wife Doris.
</P>
<P>
   As a student at a military high school in New Jersey, ''I
remember hoping to God that I wouldn't be gay,'' Dale told The New
York Times in 1992. ''It wasn't part of my big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers offered Dale a new vista. His friendship with a gay man
the summer between his freshman and sophomore years helped him
accept his homosexuality. He joined the campus gay and lesbian
organization, becoming co-president after three months.
</P>
<P>
   It was in that capacity that Dale attended a daylong conference
in 1990 on the struggles of lesbian and gay adolescents. A story on
the conference in the July 8, 1990, Newark Star-Ledger quoted Dale
describing his difficult path toward accepting his homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The story was not well received at the Monmouth Council of the
Boy Scouts, which 16 months earlier had made Dale an assistant
scoutmaster of Troop 73 in Matawan, N.J. In a letter dated July 19,
council executive James W. Kay notified Dale that his registration
was revoked.
</P>
<P>
   Dale demanded an explanation. Kay responded with a second letter
citing ''the standards for leadership established by the Boy Scouts
of America, which specifically forbid membership to homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   ''James and I were enormously shocked and distraught,'' Gerald
Dick wrote in an affidavit filed in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Dale sued the scouts under a 1992 New Jersey law protecting the
civil rights of gay people. He lost round one in 1995, but last
year the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled unanimously in Dale's
favor. The court called the Boy Scouts a public accommodation to
which anti-discrimination laws apply.
</P>
<P>
   The case has fueled other disputes around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Threatened with litigation by a gay 16-year-old Eagle Scout, the
Narragansett Council of the Scouts in Rhode Island declared a Scout
can be gay, so long as he does not advertise it.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Cozza, an Eagle Scout in Petaluma, Calif., is leading a
group called ''Scouting for All'' that advocates the elimination of
the prohibition on gays scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Dale calls Cozza ''my hero.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Clinton, Gore Raise Cash  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Politics makes strange bedfellows, but the
trio of politicians sharing the spotlight Monday night has some
truly bizarre dynamics. For the first time this political season,
President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and first lady-cum-Senate
candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton are to appear side by side at a
fund-raising party in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The president is keenly interested in seeing Gore elected as his
successor. Clinton is also the game political spouse these days,
offering encouragement and a little behind-the-scenes strategizing
to his wife, the rookie Senate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the vice president took pains to distance
himself from the scandal-tinged boss. He has made several political
solo flights, including a break with the White House over the Elian
Gonzalez case.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton, charting her extraordinary role reversal from
helpmate to candidate, has also kept her political distance from
man who is both her husband and her party's top fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was a silent partner during his wife's formal campaign
announcement in February, and her campaign still refers to her
simply as ''Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   None of that bothers Clinton, who shares fundamental political
beliefs with his vice president and wife, aides say.
</P>
<P>
   ''He recognizes that they will have different points of view
from time to time, but on the big things ... they all see pretty
much eye to eye,'' said White House spokesman Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a one-man money-making machine for Democrats, gives
two, four, sometimes eight fund-raising speeches a week now. He
never misses an opportunity to tout Gore's candidacy. He also
mentions his wife's Senate bid frequently, often with a joke about
his own aspirations to join ''the Senate spouses' club.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not running for anything,'' he says in nearly every
speech. He drew an affectionate laugh from a partisan audience in
Atlanta this month when he added: ''Most days, I'm OK with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Graff, a political science professor at Columbia
University, said Hillary Clinton has shed much of the carpetbagger
image in New York, but remains immutably linked to her husband, for
good or ill.
</P>
<P>
   That said, ''why shouldn't hubby come and help her? She helped
him plenty,'' Graff said. ''And Al Gore has now decided that the
most popular politician in America is Bill Clinton, and why
shouldn't he be attached to him?''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee, which doles out campaign cash
to Democratic candidates nationwide, hopes to raise $2 million at
Monday's event. Tony Bennett is the featured entertainment, with
political jokes and introductions by comic Jon Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The White House says it is only the first of several joint
appearances by the ''principals;'' Clinton, Gore, Mrs. Clinton and
Tipper Gore. All four are next slated to appear together on May 24
in Washington, at a DNC tribute to Clinton called the ''blue jean
bash.''
</P>
<P>
   The president has put in a couple of appearances at fund-raisers
for his wife's campaign, but a big-money Hollywood bash last
weekend was his first political appearance with Gore this year.
</P>
<P>
   The stepped-up money hunt partly reflects the rhythm of the
political season, which is speeding toward the party nominating
conventions this summer and the expensive television advertisements
and other national campaigning that will follow.
</P>
<P>
   The willingness of Gore and Mrs. Clinton to team up with the
president also reflects the fading of the impeachment and Monica
Lewinsky scandals and a recognition, says Columbia's Graff, that
Clinton remains a popular figure and adept fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are people in the Democratic Party who wish Bill Clinton
could run a third time,'' Graff said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hope that doubling or tripling up the party's top
officeholders will draw more donors and energize party activists
and volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can't hurt,'' offered Siewert.

<HEADLINE> Fake Web Site Fools Democratic Party  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tennessee guitarist Jim Williams set up a
vulgar political Web site as a joke, but Georgia congressional
candidate Jim Williams doesn't think it's funny the state
Democratic Party mistook it as his.
</P>
<P>
   The guitarist set up the page a few months ago as a spoof of
politics in general, not any specific candidate.
</P>
<P>
   A bright-colored banner proclaims ''Jim Williams: Congress
2000,'' and in bold print next to that is the slogan of the phony
campaign: ''Vote for me and I'll kiss your (backside).''
</P>
<P>
   Among the items listed on the fake campaign platform are
promises to deport Jerry Falwell and put a picture of X-Files star
Gillian Anderson on the new $100 bill. There also is a link to the
guitarist's e-mail address that says: ''E-mail your special
interests to Jim.''
</P>
<P>
   Several have tried. He has received lobbying mail from a
pharmaceutical company and an invitation to speak at a Georgia
Sierra Club meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still funny,'' the musician from Knoxville, Tenn., said
in a telephone interview. ''As soon as it quits being funny, I'll
take it down. This just shows any idiot with a little money and too
much time can put up a'' realistic-looking Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he never had heard of candidate Jim Williams, a
Democrat who ran in 1998 and got 45 percent of the vote against
Republican Bob Barr. This year he's in a three-way race for the
party nomination to take on Barr in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Candidate Williams said he learned of the vulgar Web site
several months ago when a flier handed out at a gathering of Cobb
County Democrats listed the site as his. He immediately alerted
party officials and assumed the problem was corrected.
</P>
<P>
   When told Thursday the party referred a reporter to the
guitarist's site, Williams was angry. He said it confirmed his
hunch that the state party considers him an afterthought to
candidate Roger Kahn, a businessman who has $1 million in campaign
funds, half from his own pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's well known that the state Democratic Party is for Roger
Kahn,'' said Williams, who has raised less than $5,000. ''He's a
money man in the party and has been for some time, but I haven't
confronted them about that. I've just said the heck with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Democratic Party officials said they have not endorsed a
candidate to take on Barr.
</P>
<P>
   Party spokesman Stephen Boggs said he's not sure why the party
had the guitarist's site listed as the candidate's, but promised it
would be corrected.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court case pits gay Eagle Scout against Boy Scouts ofAmerica  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It took James Dale 11 years to rise through
the ranks of the Boy Scouts. It took the Boy Scouts only 11 days to
kick him out after learning he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in New Jersey, Dale was a Cub Scout at 8, a Boy Scout
at 11, a member of the Order of the Arrow at 13, an Eagle Scout at
17. His mom was a den mother. His dad was a scouting commissioner.
At 18, Dale became an assistant scoutmaster.
</P>
<P>
   But the Boy Scouts of America expelled him in 1990 after
discovering he was co-president of Rutgers University's gay and
lesbian organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was such a blow,'' said James Anderson, faculty adviser to
the group and Dale's friend. ''(Scouting) was really so central to
his life, to his growing up, to becoming a man. They slapped him
for such a core aspect of his being.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale struck back with a 1992 lawsuit accusing the Boy Scouts of
discrimination. The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments in the case
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts of America says homosexuality contradicts the
oath that requires scouts to be ''morally straight.'' That policy
has withstood numerous court challenges, said Gregg Shields,
national spokesman for the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've always taught traditional family values,'' Shields said.
''That goes back to our founding in 1910. An avowed homosexual
would not be a role model for those values.''
</P>
<P>
   But Evan Wolfson, who will argue Dale's case before the Supreme
Court, said an organization that claims to be open to all boys and
works in partnership with public schools ''cannot discriminate
against any young boy or young man because of his identity as
gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale, now 29, lives in New York City and is advertising director
for a magazine for people who are HIV-positive. He declined an
interview through his representatives at the Lambda Legal Defense
and Education Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In public comments over the years, Dale has spoken highly of his
scouting experience, saying it instilled in him the self-confidence
and fortitude he now needs in his legal battle. But he has nothing
good to say about the organization's treatment of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 interview with The Advocate, a national gay and
lesbian news magazine, Dale said the Boy Scouts spend valuable
resources defending their anti-gay policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are often these drives for kids to go to camp who can't
afford it,'' Dale said. ''If they stopped suing people for being
gay, they could afford to send a lot more people to camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale -- who changed his name before the dispute with the scouts --
is the younger of two sons of Gerald Dick, a lieutenant colonel in
the Army Reserve, and his wife Doris.
</P>
<P>
   As a student at a New Jersey military high school, the Marine
Academy of Science and Technology in Sandy Hook, ''I remember
hoping to God that I wouldn't be gay,'' Dale told The New York
Times in 1992. ''It wasn't part of my big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers offered Dale a new vista. His friendship with a gay man
the summer between his freshman and sophomore years helped him
accept his homosexuality. He joined the campus gay and lesbian
organization, becoming co-president after three months.
</P>
<P>
   It was in that capacity that Dale attended a daylong conference
in 1990 on the struggles of lesbian and gay adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   ''James and I ... did a lot of speaking engagements, trying to
educate people about homophobia and what it was like coming out as
gay in a sometimes hostile world,'' recalled Sharice Richardson,
the other co-president, who also attended the 1990 conference.
</P>
<P>
   A story on the conference in the July 8, 1990, Star-Ledger of
Newark quoted Dale describing his difficult path toward accepting
his homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The story was not well received at the Monmouth Council of the
Boy Scouts, which 16 months earlier had made Dale an assistant
scoutmaster of Troop 73 in Matawan, N.J. In a letter dated July 19,
council executive James W. Kay notified Dale that his registration
was revoked.
</P>
<P>
   Dale demanded an explanation. Kay responded with a second letter
citing ''the standards for leadership established by the Boy Scouts
of America, which specifically forbid membership to homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   ''James and I were enormously shocked and distraught,'' Gerald
Dick wrote in an affidavit filed in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Dale sued the scouts under a 1992 New Jersey law protecting the
civil rights of gay people. He lost round one in 1995, but last
year the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled unanimously in Dale's
favor. The court called the Boy Scouts a public accommodation to
which anti-discrimination laws apply.
</P>
<P>
   The case has fueled other disputes around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Threatened with litigation by a gay 16-year-old Eagle Scout, the
Narragansett Council of the Scouts in Rhode Island declared a Scout
can be gay, so long as he does not advertise it.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Cozza, an Eagle Scout in Petaluma, Calif., is leading a
group called ''Scouting for All'' that advocates the elimination of
the prohibition on gays scouts. Dale calls Cozza ''my hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay, whose letter to Dale launched the legal battle, is still
the chief executive of the Monmouth County Boy Scouts. He said he
looks forward to the case being over.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everybody who's been around it just wants the decision
to be made,'' he said, ''and we'll deal with the decision and move
on.''

   SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore's consumer price index for March was
down 0.3 percent over February, reflecting cheaper food and lower

</P>
<P>
   The CPI was 1.2 percent higher than in March of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Food prices fell by 1.6 percent in March 2000, due mainly to

<HEADLINE> State Police nearing purchase of new weapons  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey State Police could get its
first shipment of new handguns in the next several months, despite
a canceled contract with the former gun manufacturer and problems
with several replacement weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Attorney General's Office and the State
Police said bids are expected next month to replace the weapons
used by all 2,700 troopers since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The officials maintain they expect no further delay in replacing
the current guns, now the subject of a complaint by the trooper's
union, which alleges the pistols are worn and unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   The state canceled its contract with German gunmaker Heckler and
Koch after the company said it could not produce enough weapons at
once to cover the state contract, said State Police spokesman John
Hagerty.
</P>
<P>
   State Police administrators looked to simply extend the contract
and buy replacement guns, rather than an entirely new type of
weapon, Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   But Heckler and Koch told the state it needed to retool its
factory since it no longer produces the weapon used by New Jersey
troopers, Hagerty said. The company could not supply all of the
weapons at once, as required by the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers also found ''slight problems'' with ''quality control
issues'' in a number of the 450 replacement weapons recently
shipped by the manufacturer, Hagerty said. Testing officers found
the gun sights to be ''slightly off,'' Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Col. Carson Dunbar, the State Police
superintendent, to cancel the order, Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The superintendent thought it best to terminate the
contract,'' Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers last year approved $1.5 million in funding to buy
nearly 3,000 sidearms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The dollars are there, now it's just a matter of which weapon
the state police will use,'' Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   The bids should be received by the end of May, said Roger
Shatzkin, a spokesman for Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Once a weapon is chosen, it will be subjected to testing by
State Police weapons experts, Shatzkin said. Then the guns could be
distributed to the troopers ''within a month'' after approval, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For troopers, ''that's good news and bad news,'' said Ed Lennon,
president of the State Troopers Fraternal Association of New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers want the new weapons and are willing to wait while the
state looks for a new contractor, Lennon said.
</P>
<P>
   The 9mm weapons they carry are ''so bad I was forced to file a
complaint'' with the state Public Employee Occupational Safety and
Health Advisory Board, Lennon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have had a number of malfunctions at the range,'' Lennon
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the union complaint, nearly 14 percent of the
weapons used in training exercises last spring malfunctioned.

<HEADLINE> 'U-571' Hits 1st Place at Theaters  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The submarine flick ''U-571'' surfaced as the
new box-office leader in its opening weekend, sending another
military drama sinking into third place, according to studio
estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''U-571,'' a World War II yarn starring Matthew McConaughey and
Harvey Keitel, took in $20.3 million for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Its success helped push ''Rules of Engagement,'' the military
court drama starring Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones, down
two slots with $8 million after two weeks as the No. 1 movie.
</P>
<P>
   Second place was grabbed by ''Love and Basketball,'' co-produced
by Spike Lee, which debuted with $8.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''U-571'' centers on the crew of a U.S. submarine sent to steal
a decoding device from a disabled German U-boat. When their sub is
sunk, the Americans take over the enemy vessel and try to sail it
home.
</P>
<P>
   While submarine movies are fairly rare, recent ones have done
well. ''The Hunt for Red October'' topped the box office with $17.2
million in its opening weekend in 1990, and ''Crimson Tide'' was
No. 1 with $18.6 million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The success of ''U-571'' came in spite of its debut during the
Easter weekend, when many movie-goers stay home with their
families.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a thrill ride, and audiences are really responding,''
said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution for Universal, which
released ''U-571.'' ''Easter weekend is a tough weekend for the
business, so we're really happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The film continues Hollywood's recent trend of opening big
action movies well before Memorial Day, the start of the summer
film season. Other pre-Memorial Day hits have included ''Twister''
in 1996, ''Deep Impact'' in 1998 and ''The Matrix'' and ''The
Mummy'' last year.
</P>
<P>
   '''U-571' has all the earmarks of a summer film. It's an action
film, and it has this feel of being an event picture,'' said Paul
Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks
ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   In limited release, ''The Virgin Suicides'' opened strongly with
$238,000 in 18 theaters for a $13,222 average. The darkly comic
drama is directed by Sofia Coppola, daughter of filmmaker Francis
Ford Coppola and wife of ''Being John Malkovich'' director Spike
Jonze.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final
figures are to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''U-571,'' $20.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''Love and Basketball,'' $8.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''Rules of Engagement, $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''28 Days,'' $7.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''Keeping the Faith,'' $7.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''Erin Brockovich,'' $5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''The Road to El Dorado,'' $5.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''Return to Me,'' $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ''The Skulls,'' $2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   10. ''Final Destination, $2.78 million.

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs Water Heaters Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Consumers have until the end of the year
to file claims for repairs on more than 14 million water heaters
under a nationwide settlement.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Howard F. Sachs on Friday approved a
settlement between consumers and 99 percent of the manufacturers of
water heaters.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs' decision Friday affirmed preliminary approval he gave the
settlement in November, which allowed manufacturers to begin
repairs on water heaters made between 1993 and 1996 that have a
defective piece of plastic called a dip tube.
</P>
<P>
   The tube, which funnels cold water to the bottom of a water
heater, can break apart, hurting the heater's performance and
clogging plumbing, faucets or appliances with plastic chips.
</P>
<P>
   Two dozen class-action suits have been filed against the water
heater manufacturers and Perfection Corp., which made the defective
dip tubes manufacturers used.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers that sold the defective water heaters under
several brand names were Rheem Manufacturing Co., A.O. Smith Corp.,
Bradford White Corp., American Water Heater Co. and Lochinvar Corp.
State Industries also sold some defective water heaters, but it
stopped using Perfection's dip tubes before the other manufacturers
did.
</P>
<P>
   Perfection said it could not agree to the lawsuit because of a
dispute with its insurers over covering the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, new water heaters will be installed if
pieces of the dip tube can't be removed. Otherwise, a new dip tube
will be installed.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who have already paid for repairs have until June 30
to file a claim. Those who have not had their water heaters
repaired have until Dec. 31 to file claims.
</P>
<P>
   Claim forms and information are available by calling
800-329-0561 or on the Internet at www.diptubesettlement.com.

<HEADLINE> Former La. Gov. Case To Go to Jury  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIE GOTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Money scattered on the floor. Money
exchanged in high stakes poker games. Money hidden under ducks in
the freezer. Briefcases full of money. Money in trash bins. Money
in ash bins. Money in broken down trailers.
</P>
<P>
   Big-money tales are nothing new in the 40-year public saga of
Louisiana's rougish four-time ex-governor, Edwin Edwards. But this
time the tales of money, money everywhere, could land him in a
federal prison beyond what he calls his ''biblically allotted
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Look him straight in the eye and tell him he's guilty,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Harper told jurors during closing
arguments last week near the close of his federal racketeering
trial.
</P>
<P>
   After 16 weeks, the case will be in the jury's hands on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards is accused of masterminding a series of schemes to
extort millions of dollars from applicants for lucrative riverboat
casino licenses before and after his final term ended in January
1996. Also charged are his son Stephen, a state senator, a state
gambling board member and three of Edwards' friends. Their trial
started Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted on all counts, Edwards, 72, faces more than 300
years in prison -- a term he joked he would never serve.
</P>
<P>
   Elected four times despite -- possibly because of -- his unabashed
love of high-stakes gambling and his reputation as a ladies man,
Edwards by his own count has been the target of nearly two dozen
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   A probe in the 1980s into his investments in hospital and
nursing home deals led to two trials. The first ended with a hung
jury in 1985. He was acquitted in a retrial a year later.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, they had Edwards' own words to use against
him. With wiretaps and a hidden microphone and video camera, the
FBI secretly recorded 1,500 hours of conversations involving
Edwards and his co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution's case also includes three witnesses who claimed
they paid extortion money to Edwards, and financial experts who say
Edwards outspent his reported earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards takes it in stride. With his 35-year-old wife, Candy, on
one side and his 50-year-old daughter, Anna, on the other, he
sauntered into the courthouse every day with his head held high,
giving a slight wave to the reporters he's forbidden to talk to
because of a gag order.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses say the payoffs came in the form of vehicles,
appliances and cash. A former casino owner, who said he keeps
hundreds of thousands of dollars hidden under ducks and deer in his
freezer, said he sometimes left the cash in trash bins or ash bins
behind restaurants or in a trailer behind his office.
</P>
<P>
   Former San Francisco 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. told jurors
that Edwards threatened to cause problems for DeBartolo's
application for a riverboat casino license if Edwards was not paid
$400,000. DeBartolo handed Edwards the money -- $100 bills stacked
in a briefcase -- at the San Francisco airport. DeBartolo said
Edwards showed him a money belt when DeBartolo asked how Edwards
planned to transport the money without passing it through an
airport X-ray machine.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards denied the claims with his typical aplomb when he took
the witness stand for four days.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he was lying, Edwards had a simple answer: ''No,
and if I were, you've got to assume I wouldn't be telling you.''
</P>
<P>
   When lead prosecutor Jim Letten accused him of answering a
question in a way to embarrass Letten, Edwards responded: ''I don't
think I have the capacity to embarrass you.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the jurors, whose faces remained expressionless throughout
most of Edwards' testimony, cracked a smile at that one-liner.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also paraded in contractors and designers who
testified that Edwards paid them in cash when he was building a new
home. In all, Edwards paid $733,567 in cash for his $1.4 million
house. A delivery man said Candy Edwards paid him $4,500 in $100
bills. When he stepped inside the house to collect the money, he
said he saw $100 bills lying on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The cash Edwards spent between 1986 and 1997 far exceeds the
cash he took home from his lucrative trips to casinos -- he once won
$220,000 in Atlantic City -- or what he pulled in at the high stakes
poker games at the Governor's Mansion, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all the evidence the five-person prosecution team
does have -- 1,500 hours of testimony and 66 witnesses -- defense
attorneys say there has not been a ''smoking gun.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Where is the evidence that Edwin Edwards, Stephen Edwards,
Andrew Martin and Cecil Brown actually sat down and talked about
manipulating the licensing process?'' asked attorney Jim Cole, who
represents Stephen Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Harper said the evidence is in all
of the conversations. They talked about hiding money, cheating on
their taxes and of secret payments, Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the last Louisiana hayride for these men and they were
determined to extract all they could,'' Harper said.

<HEADLINE> Grad Students Voting on Unionizing  </HEADLINE>
By ARLENE LEVINSON, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In her climb up the academic ladder, Laura
Tanenbaum teaches freshman writing at New York University while
working on her doctorate. It pays $11,500 for a nine-month stint, a
pittance in high-priced New York, the 25-year-old complains.
</P>
<P>
   What graduate teaching and research assistants need is the right
to bargain collectively for better pay and benefits, Tanenbaum and
some of her colleagues say.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in a move NYU officials warn could shatter academic
freedom but students insist means survival, 1,400 graduate teaching
and research assistants at the university will vote whether to form
a union represented by the United Auto Workers.
</P>
<P>
   A ''yes'' vote could make NYU the first private American
university subject to collective bargaining with graduate
assistants. About two dozen public universities already are.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're looking for is recognition from the university that
we're adults who provide a service,'' Tanenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   NYU officials argue that teaching and research duties come with
students' financial aid packages, so they're not workers entitled
to a union.
</P>
<P>
   They also say private universities lack the protection state
laws give their public counterparts, such as curbing strikes and
barring interference with course content.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be impossible, or virtually impossible, to separate
the educational issues from employment issues,'' said Robert Berne,
NYU vice president for academic development.
</P>
<P>
   Union organizers deny this.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not looking for and we do not believe we could legally
obtain any say in curriculum,'' said Patrick McCreery, 33, an NYU
doctoral candidate in American Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The National Labor Relations Board will supervise balloting set
for Tuesday through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, NYU appealed to the NLRB to stop the election, or at
least hold results while the board hears the case.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said Friday that the election would take place.
Unless it rules on the appeal by Thursday, the votes will be
impounded until the case is decided. Any outcome could be
challenged in federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   The university's case was dealt a setback this month when the
NLRB regional director ruled graduate teaching assistants are
employees entitled to organize. Excluded were scientific
researchers paid by outside funds.
</P>
<P>
   What comes of the vote at NYU could effect the 100 or so private
institutions among the nation's 220 schools with doctoral programs.
Graduate assistants, primarily teachers and researchers, nationwide
number some 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a test case, and we're entering into unchartered
waters,'' said Catharine Stimpson, dean of NYU's Graduate School of
Arts and Science.
</P>
<P>
   Pitting graduate students against their school could upset
collegial tradition and threaten academic freedom, said Jon Fuller
of the National Association of Independent Colleges and
Universities.
</P>
<P>
   ''These institutions are run by collective governance,'' Fuller
said. ''By the same rationale ... the management of General Motors
couldn't form a union. They run the place.''
</P>
<P>
   NYU teaching and research assistants get tuition assistance,
stipends and other financial help, and the financial packages are
good and improving, school officials says.
</P>
<P>
   Packages vary, but in the arts and science school, assistants'
tuition and fees are free, they get money for child care, and this
fall the department's minimum stipend rises to $13,000 plus $400
for health care.
</P>
<P>
   The number of state universities with graduate assistants unions
has grown this past decade to a couple dozen at a time of growing
financial pressure on schools and students.
</P>
<P>
   The waning influence of the labor movement has turned unions'
eyes to college campuses. In the mid-1990s, unions began offering
summer internships.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's part of the labor movement's attempt to reach a broader
audience,'' said Elissa McBride at the AFL-CIO in Washington.
''We're looking for allies.''

   The union experience at schools is mixed.
</P>
<P>
   A year after the University of California's eight campuses
formed unions, contracts remain unsettled. Last week some students
went on strike for a day.
</P>
<P>
   It may not even bring better pay but contracts keep duties clear
and promote equality, said Paul Prew, president of the Graduate
Teaching Fellows Federation at the University of Oregon in Eugene.
''It tends to reduce the amount of favoritism that tends to be
played out in graduate school,'' he said.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Def Jam Records co-founder Russell Simmons is
adding a retail store to his growing list of ventures outside the
music arena.
</P>
<P>
   The planned 14,000-square-foot flagship store in Harlem will
carry Simmons' own Phat Farm clothing line, as well as that of
hip-hop mogul Sean ''Puff Daddy'' Combs, Polo and Versace.
</P>
<P>
   But it also will offer items ranging from home furnishings and
jewelry to pagers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a megastore. It's a lifestyle store,'' Simmons told the
New York Post. And it is ''the first of what should be many, many
stores.''
</P>

   The rap music impresario said he is in the final stages of
lining up a lease for the property.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Sparks SWAT Debate  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN SLEVIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Despite lawsuits claiming that faster
SWAT team action could have saved lives at Columbine High School,
experts say the specially trained officers won't change their slow,
methodical approach.
</P>
<P>
   What will change is the training for beat patrolmen, who are
being taught to act faster to control dangerous situations until
the SWAT teams arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some times when you need to rush into things,'' said
David Klinger, who is conducting a federally funded study of SWAT
operations.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, law enforcement leaders have been reluctant to send
ordinary patrolmen into tense situations because they have been
accused of being trigger happy, said Klinger, a criminologist at
the University of Missouri-St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many departments are training patrol officers to enter a
building immediately if shots are being fired -- as soon as they
have a team of four to provide 360 degrees of coverage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen lawsuits have been filed by the families of
the survivors and the 13 people killed after student gunmen Dylan
Klebold and Eric Harris opened fire at Columbine a year ago. Both
gunmen committed suicide during the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits accuse sheriff's deputies of acting too slowly; one
claims teacher Dave Sanders was left to bleed to death for more
than three hours while police waited to enter the school.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a bunch of cowards. They had guns, they had vests, they
had helmets, they should be prepared to go out and they might get
shot. These were 17- and 18-year-old kids in there,'' said Connie
Michalik, whose son, Richard, was paralyzed in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff John Stone says the SWAT team members were heroes and
saved many lives with their actions.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Glick, executive director of the National Tactical
Officers Association, thinks the victims' families need someone to
blame and, since the gunmen are dead, they are focusing on police.
</P>
<P>
   ''Officers are ready to lay their lives on the line,'' Glick
said. ''And they would have if they knew exactly where Dylan
Klebold and Eric Harris were.''
</P>
<P>
   There were too many unknowns when the SWAT officers first
entered the school, said Glick, who has interviewed many of the
officers who responded to the shootings at Columbine. They heard
screams and alarms but no gun shots. And after bombs were found in
backpacks the killers had dropped, every backpack became a
potential booby trap, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police also were unsure of their targets. And they didn't know
if the school had plastic windows that could have deflected their
bullets, possibly toward students, said Commerce City Police Chief
Brian Hebbard, a former SWAT team commander who had members of his
team at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   Glick said no one would have been helped if SWAT members had
recklessly exposed themselves to danger.
</P>
<P>
   ''When there's so much uncertainty, you move slowly and
methodically,'' Glick said. ''You don't just run past closed doors
and open doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Columbine, law enforcement agencies ran into obstacles
just trying to train SWAT teams. Klinger said many towns and
schools have refused to let them run drills.
</P>
<P>
   ''For 20 or 30 years, the message was 'don't think about it,
don't train for it,''' Klinger said. ''They thought it wouldn't
happen at their school. The problem is that it happens at
somebody's school and somebody dies because law enforcement hasn't
had the opportunity to do the practice it needs to.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC ''Today'' show host Matt Lauer says sure
he's chummy during his chats with stars, but he admits celebrities
and politicians often frustrate him.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're trying to schmooze you,'' Lauer, 42, says in the
upcoming USA Weekend magazine. ''Politicians and movie stars
practice (their responses), and it's very hard to know if you're
getting a real window into anything that resembles their
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   A case in point: During an interview last month with Madonna,
the singer told him on the air that she wasn't pregnant. Turns out,
she was.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was very convincing,'' Lauer recalled. ''But now, when I
look at the tape and see that certain smile on her face, I realize
I was probably just naive.'''
</P>

tour to destinations unknown to viewers for the show's ''Where in

<HEADLINE> Reeve Pushes Stem-Cell Research  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Christopher Reeve says a federal law banning
government funding of research involving human embryos should be
lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we prolong the stem-cell debate, millions continue to
suffer. It is time to harness the power of government and go
forward,'' Reeve, who was paralyzed in a 1995 horse riding
accident, says in an essay in Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers believe they can learn how to use the cells culled
from human embryos to make body parts or to find new therapies for
Alzheimer's and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But the use of the cells has generated opposition from
anti-abortion forces and some members of Congress, who say the
cells are covered by the federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Reeve said such research should be funded and supervised by the
federal government through the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ''That will avoid abuses by for-profit corporations, avoid
secrecy and destructive competition between laboratories and ensure
the widest possible dissemination of scientific breakthroughs,''
the ''Superman'' actor said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Squatters Allowed To Stay  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Some 200 armed black squatters occupied
another white-owned farm, and police allowed them to stay Sunday,
while warning them not to use violence.
</P>
<P>
   Squatters and ruling party supporters have seized around 1,000
white-owned farms in what they say is a protest against unequal
land distribution, but what critics say is a bid by President
Robert Mugabe to rally supporters and intimidate opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The occupiers moved onto Lynton Farm Saturday afternoon and beat
and whipped some workers, said the cattle farm's owner, John
Malzer.
</P>
<P>
   Police visited the group of squatters early Sunday and told them
not to use violence. Malzer said he was disappointed that police
had allowed the squatters to stay, but that the visit had helped
calm an explosive situation.
</P>
<P>
   He remained in his home on the farm in the Marondera district,
40 miles east of Harare, saying he thought he was relatively safe.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, there was a standoff at a farm owned by the
Forresters family in Mvurwi district 60 miles north of Harare.
Squatters who had occupied the farm were preventing the owner's
wife from leaving her house and barring the farm owner from
entering, a neighbor said.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Minister Robin Cook said Sunday that other
southern African leaders had urged Mugabe to resolve the crisis
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said Mozambique's president, Joaquim Chissano, as well as
the president of South Africa and Namibia, had urged Mugabe at a
summit Friday to ensure that a Zimbabwean delegation takes a
positive stance in talks with the British government in London on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has said it is willing to resume funding to help
redistribute white-owned lands to landless blacks -- but only if
Mugabe ends the occupations.
</P>
<P>
   Two white farmers have been killed in the past two weeks, both
supporters of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change. Two
other MDC members, both black, were killed April 15, and several
farmers with opposition links have been beaten.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, an explosion went off outside Zimbabwe's only
independent daily newspaper, which has been sharply critical of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   State-controlled Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corp. reported Sunday
that the blast, which caused only light damage and no injuries, was
probably caused by a device hurled from a passing car.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the device, apparently a stun grenade, was
believed thrown from a Mazda 626 that was seen speeding away from
the scene after the blast, state radio and television reported.
</P>
<P>
   Police had no suspects in the bombing, spokesman Emmanuel
Chiwanda said.
</P>
<P>
   Two Daily News reporters visiting white-owned farms occupied by
illegal squatters were abducted and robbed earlier this month by
men claiming to be veterans of the bush war that led to Zimbabwe's
independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   After the reporters were released unharmed, Chenjerai Hunzvi,
head of the National Liberation War Veterans Association, argued
they were biased against Mugabe's ruling party. ''We hate The Daily
News,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunzvi's group claims to have led the occupation of the farms,
which began on Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has refused Supreme Court rulings ordering police to
remove the squatters, calling their actions a legitimate protest.
His opponents say he is allowing the occupations to shore up his
flagging popularity ahead of elections expected to be called in
May.

<HEADLINE> Six Killed in Kentucky Car Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINCHESTER, Ky. (AP) -- A van crossed the center line of the
Mountain Parkway in eastern Kentucky and struck another vehicle
nearly head-on, killing six people and injuring three others, State
Police said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the wreck was still under investigation Sunday but
officers said alcohol was not believed to have been a factor.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the van lost control Saturday evening about nine
miles east of Winchester, and the vehicle swerved into the opposite
lane, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident happened in clear weather in an area before the
highway enters mountainous sections of eastern Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   State police identified the victims as Emanuel Miller, 21;
Catherene Burke, 19; Jimmy Miller, 13, and App Miller, 14, all of
Jackson all in the van; and Ricky J. Lucas, 37, and Don W. Ratliff,
62.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Emanuel Miller was driving the van and was the only
one wearing a seat belt. Police could not say for sure Sunday how
any of the victims were related.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Troops Battle For Jaffna  </HEADLINE>
By DILIP GANGULY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Sri Lankan government troops on Sunday
girded for what was expected to be a bloody battle for control of
Jaffna, a strategic stronghold that rebels are determined to
recapture.
</P>
<P>
   State-run radio in the capital of Colombo appealed to people to
donate blood, apparently fearing heavy casualties in the fight for
Jaffna, which the military captured from rebels five years ago. The
report said 500 people had already lined up to donate blood.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of fierce fighting, rebels on Saturday seized the
key Elephant Pass causeway in northern Sri Lanka -- the doorstep to
Jaffna. A 25-mile stretch of forest and rivers falls between the
pass and the outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The military on Sunday sent reinforcements to Jaffna's airport,
which remains the only link with the mainland after the fall of the
causeway. Although Jaffna can be reached by ship, government
soldiers would be vulnerable to rebel artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
   A military officer said on condition of anonymity that
government troops withdrew from the Elephant Pass area after it
became clear that it would be very difficult to hold on. Troops
left through a narrow land corridor and headed toward Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   The officer said the military's biggest concern now was to stop
the rebels from moving their artillery closer to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam said it killed more than
1,000 soldiers in the two-day battle for the causeway. The Defense
Ministry said only 72 soldiers and seven officers were killed, and
625 were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   It also said more than 160 rebels died in the battle, including
12 who were killed Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Retaking Jaffna would be a huge morale boost for the rebels, who
are waging a 17-year-old war to set up an independent homeland for
minority Tamils. It would also give them an advantage in peace
talks being brokered by Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffna, 186 miles north of Colombo, remained cut off from the
mainland after telephone links were suspended to prevent the rebels
from establishing contacts with fighters believed to be hiding in
the city.
</P>
<P>
   A city of 500,000 people, Jaffna is the center of Tamil culture
and was the rebel capital until December 1995, when the military
captured the city. The defeat came as a huge blow to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The war, which began in 1983, has left more than 62,000 people
dead in this island nation near India's southern tip. The rebels
accuse the majority Sinhalese of discrimination against Tamils in
education and jobs, a charge the government denies.
</P>
<P>
   President Chandrika Kumaratunga was returning home from London,
where she went for a medical checkup. She was hurt in the eye
during a failed Tamil rebel assassination attempt in Colombo on
Dec. 18.
</P>
<P>
   In the Norwegian capital of Oslo, Tormod Endressen, a spokesman
for Norway's Foreign Ministry, confirmed the Tamil rebels had asked
the government to send a delegation to Sri Lanka. Endressen did not
say whether Oslo had agreed to the request.
</P>
<P>
   Norway began a peace initiative this year after both the Sri
Lankan government and Tamil Tiger rebels asked for help in
returning to the negotiating table after five years.

<HEADLINE> Mourners Mark Serbian TV Bombing  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Family and friends gathered around a
simple stone monument Sunday to mourn 16 Serbian state TV employees
killed when NATO targeted the network's building last year. One
word etched on the tablet summed up their grief: ''Zasto'' -- Why?
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 people attended the memorial service, led by
priests of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Family and friends of the
victims read speeches blaming both President Slobodan Milosevic's
regime and NATO for the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''NATO committed a terrible crime and so did the managers of
Serbian Radio Television who bear responsibility for the deaths,''
said Mirjana Stojmenovska, the mother of 25-year-old technician
Darko who died in the pre-dawn raid last April 23.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why did you gamble with the lives of our loved ones? Why did
you use the lives of innocent people to try to show NATO you are
invincible?'' Stojmenovska asked, in a speech largely condemning
Milosevic's government, which tightly controls the dominant state
network.
</P>
<P>
   ''For cheap political propaganda, you sacrificed 16 innocent
lives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Only technicians, cameramen, security guards and a makeup artist
were on duty the night when two NATO missiles struck the network's
main building in downtown Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The 78-day bombing campaign was launched to make Milosevic
accept a Western peace plan for Serbia's Kosovo province, where
government troops had cracked down on pro-independence ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's defiance increased in the first weeks of the bombing
and the alliance added to target lists to include infrastructure
and institutions considered vital to his rule. The state network
was -- and still is -- the government's chief mouthpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Before the attack, NATO urged the state network to either change
its editorial policies or face missiles. The television's chief
editors openly defied the warning, and said they were prepared to
withstand attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''But none of the key people from the television were in the
building that night,'' said Zanka Stojanovic, the mother of
Nebojsa, a 26-year old technician who was killed. ''My son and
others were sacrificed,''
</P>
<P>
   The casualties, along with hundreds of others suffered in the
bombing, have been presented by the authorities as proof that NATO
committed ''aggression,'' rather than intervention toward peace.
</P>
<P>
   However, the TV building deaths have sparked intense debates
here and increasing suspicion that the government deliberately did
nothing to protect the low-ranking employees.
</P>
<P>
   Recent reports in independent media have said the authorities
evacuated key network staff from the building hours before the
attack. Top editors and executives of the network have tersely
denied the allegations, but avoided any open debate on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   None of them attended the service, and instead attended a
separate ceremony Sunday with a narrow circle of top managers led
by the television's chief executive, Dragoljub Milanovic. He called
the victims ''heroes,'' saying they should ''rest in peace and no
one should speculate with their heroic deaths. The murderers were
NATO pilots, Gen. Wesley Clark and Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stojmenovska insisted officials shared responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many pieces of the horrible picture have come together,'' she
said. ''The authorities knew when NATO was going to strike. Instead
of evacuating the people, the workers' shifts were extended.''
</P>
<P>
   At least two documentary films have been made here about the
tragedy by independent journalists seeking to shed more light on
what happened.
</P>
<P>
   There is ''no doubt these people were victimized and the regime
is ready to victimize many more just to stay in power,'' said Veran
Matic, head of the Association of Independent Electronic Media and
producer of one of the documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''One year after the bombing, the pain is only bigger.''
Stojanovic said. ''Those who wanted the war and waged the war are
all alive and well, and my son is dead.''

<HEADLINE> Leaders Embrace Elian Struggle  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- As federal agents moved in to take Elian Gonzalez,
Ramon Saul Sanchez threw himself in their path and took a rifle
butt in the head.
</P>
<P>
   He got up, wrapped a bandage around his bloodied head and
continued his work -- soothing an angry crowd, focusing their rage
while imploring them to protest without violence.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, an office clerk and street activist known more for
organizing traffic slowdowns than political muscle, emerged during
the Elian standoff as one of the most visible Cuban exile leaders
in the most Cuban of American cities.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he will hold onto that power is an intriguing question.
With no single, influential leader and a three-year power vacuum,
Cuban-American leaders now have a decisive moment to shape their
political future -- and that of the community.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the community -- Sanchez, of the Democracy Movement;
Jorge Mas Santos, of the influential Cuban American National
Foundation; elected officials of Cuban descent; aging former
political prisoners, and veterans of the failed Bay of Pigs
invasion -- all embraced the Elian struggle, reinvigorating the
exiles' 41-year-old conflict with Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the Bay of Pigs shaped a whole generation and influenced
Cuban-American politics from 1961 to 2000, this raid will influence
Cuban-American politics for the next generation,'' said Dario
Moreno, a political science professor at Florida International
University in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real new leaders that are emerging are in many ways even
more hard line than the people they are replacing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban exiles saw Elian's plight as a symbol of their suffering
under Castro. Their passion drove many to 24-hour vigils and sent
hundreds out in protest after the boy was snatched by federal
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Their fervor was not shared by most other Americans, however.
Polls show most people nationwide saw not a political tug-of-war
but a small boy being kept from his father. To them, Castro and
Communism seem Cold War relics.
</P>
<P>
   ''This community is reminding me more and more of the National
Rifle Association,'' said Norman Ornstein, a political analyst at
the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. ''They are viewed
as shrill and rigid even as their members are becoming more
united.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans hold extraordinary power in Florida, a key state
in national politics. With a dense, unified vote, they help shape
policy on the issue that matters most here: Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The influential Cuban American National Foundation was founded
by Jorge Mas Canosa, whose death in 1997 left the power vacuum.
Along with leading old-guard groups like Brigade 2506 -- veterans of
the Bay of Pigs fiasco -- CANF is a stalwart proponent of the U.S.
economic embargo on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Lisandro Perez, director of the Cuban Research Institute at
Florida International University in Miami, said Mas Canosa, father
of Jorge Mas Santos, combined the business community and the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think he has really been replaced,'' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   Filling the void are several groups with often strongly
different views on U.S.-Cuba policy, protest methods and influence.
A minority seeks an open dialogue with the Castro regime.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe the Cuban exile community has always rallied for
just causes,'' said Sylvia Iriondo, who organized daily prayer
vigils outside the home of Elian's relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are also seizing the chance to lobby, and encourage
Cuban-Americans to vote against Vice President Al Gore in November,
stop traveling to Cuba and limit how much money they send to
relatives there.
</P>
<P>
   Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas and Miami Mayor Joe Carollo
also took prominent roles in the Elian struggle and aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo lashed out at the Cuban and U.S. governments alike, then
railed at his own police chief for helping with the federal raid.
Penelas said U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and President Clinton
would be held responsible for any bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   As fires erupted on the streets of Little Havana on Saturday,
they called for calm while many other Cuban-Americans, furious over
the surprise raid and the police response to the day's protests,
heaped blame on the mayors.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Sanchez. Not a supporter of the U.S. embargo on
Cuba -- unlike the CANF and many old-guard exile groups -- his
profile has risen during the Elian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sanchez is sort of setting the tone for the new leadership in
the Cuban-American community,'' Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, once a hardline militant who turned to nonviolent
protest, drew hundreds to his brand of protest while Mas Santos
went to Washington and failed to negotiate a handover, Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Mas Santos) was unable to deliver, and Ramon Saul Sanchez has
had a consistent position, has been able to control the protests,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez has called for a general strike and rally Tuesday, but
it's unclear how influential he will remain without Elian's
presence.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of the road, there will be, unfortunately, some
political casualties,'' said Sanchez. ''At the same time, it will
provide the opportunity to refresh the leadership and the position
of the exile community in the years to come.''

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Visits Israel  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EILAT, Israel (AP) -- Jordan's new king on Sunday paid his first
state visit to Israel, underplaying the pomp and ceremony in a
pointed reference to the precarious state of Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah II eschewed a high-profile reception for the
visit, which had been scheduled for February but was delayed due to
escalated fighting between Israel and Lebanese guerrillas. At his
insistence, he met Prime Minister Ehud Barak for a scant four hours
in Eilat, a southern Red Sea resort remote from Israel's bustling
center.
</P>
<P>
   The young king, whose country concluded a peace agreement with
Israel in 1994, made it clear that the collapsed talks with Syria
and the troubled Palestinian track were making it harder for him to
maintain warm ties.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of trading land for peace, he reminded Barak in his
opening remarks, ''has been accepted by all parties since 1991 and
must continue to guide us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians say Israel is not offering them enough of the
West Bank, and Syria wants a prior commitment that Israel will
return the disputed Golan Heights. Barak says he first wants to see
the security arrangements the Syrians have to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking power in March of last year, Abdullah has tried to
restore Jordan's ties with the Arabs, strained by his late father
King Hussein's pronounced pro-Western outlook.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Barak appeared sensitive to his guest's position, and
avoided pressing demands for warmer ties.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are aware that social and economic processes are by
definition slow and require determination and perseverance,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But some of Barak's ministers said they wished Abdullah would do
more to warm up what has become Israel's showcase relationship with
an Arab neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wish it had been sooner,'' Regional Cooperation Minister
Shimon Peres said of the visit, noting that Abdullah had waited
more than a year since his coronation. He added: ''We wish it were
in Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah said the circumstances had not been right while
tensions were flaring. ''I didn't want our visit to Israel to be
used in such a way that it didn't promote peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sides radiated friendliness. Abdullah twice referred
to Eilat as a ''beautiful city.'' He and Barak discussed plans for
an international airport that would serve Eilat and its Jordanian
sister city, Aqaba.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's trade minister, Ran Cohen, met with his Jordanian
counterpart during Sunday's mini-summit, and later announced that
the countries agreed to launch free-trade zone negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   However, the king at the last minute chose not to bring business
leaders along with him -- apparently further evidence of his efforts
to downplay the importance of the visit.
</P>
<P>
   The king, who has served as a mediator between Israel and Syria,
insisted that the prospect of renewed talks were not as bleak as
recently portrayed by Barak, who has said that ''the door is open,
but only a crack.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're on the threshold of a new beginning here in the Middle
East, not only the Palestinian track, but the Syrian track,''
Abdullah told Israel television.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Israeli-Palestinian talks are back on track -- with
a third round starting in Eilat next Sunday -- the sides sounded
upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sides remain far apart, even on procedural issues.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat insisted that the outline of a
permanent agreement must be in place by the current May deadline.
But Barak said he anticipated it would take ''two to three months''
to achieve the outline of an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is not just academic: delaying the outline of an
agreement until June or July jeopardizes the Sept. 13 deadline for
a full-fledged agreement. Arafat has promised the Palestinians
their long-awaited statehood by then. If he misses the deadline --
it won't be the first time -- it would seriously undermine his
credibility among the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The sides remain apart on territorial issues as well. Barak's
minister in charge of Jerusalem affairs, Haim Ramon, suggested
Sunday that the future of Jerusalem -- one of the touchiest facing
negotiators -- would not be settled this year, and should be left
for a later date, along with the status of about 20 percent of West
Bank territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians reject such compromises out of hand, demanding
a full agreement by September.

<HEADLINE> Castro Praises Janet Reno  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Fidel Castro praised U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno on Sunday for ''just'' action in returning 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez to his father and denounced U.S. presidential candidates
as unethical for resisting the child's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   When federal agents stormed the house of Elian's relatives in
Miami to remove him and reunite him with his father Saturday,
Castro called ''a truce'' with the United States for the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban leader said Sunday that it would not have ''seemed
elegant'' to attack the U.S. government that day, ''because they
had done something just'' and because Reno already was being
criticized by anti-Castro forces in the United States for the
action.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I were going to complain,'' he said, it would be that Reno
''did too much'' in pursuing negotiations to try to avert the need
for the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ''Really, at that extreme point she wanted a negotiated and
peaceful settlement at all costs,'' he told reporters at a polling
station after voting in Cuba's municipal elections Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said the Miami relatives -- led by Elian's great-uncle --
had wanted the father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to stay with them
during a handover period -- a proposal he said the father rejected
as interfering with his right to the child.
</P>
<P>
   The father has said repeatedly that he wants to take the child
back home to Cuba, although he must stay in the United States until
a court rules on an appeal for political asylum lodged on the
child's behalf by the Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The raid led to violent protests in Miami by anti-Castro
demonstrators who claimed it was a victory for the Cuban leader.
Castro has led a five-month campaign for the return of the child
rescued in late November off the coast of Florida after a shipwreck
killed his mother and other would-be immigrants to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Castro repeatedly insisted that he was not celebrating victory
and noted that Cuban state television and radio urged Cubans to
avoid open celebrations of the child's return to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said he could understand that claims he had won a victory
''could cause worry'' for the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Castro also denounced the two main U.S. candidates for
president, Al Gore and George W. Bush, for supporting a delay of
the boy's return to Cuba ''out of pure demagoguery.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The candidates, almost without exception, have a terrible
position, bad, without any ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The principal reason is the myth that the (anti-Castro) mafia
decides the voting in Florida,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said after the raid that the issue of Elian's custody
''should have been handled through a family court and with the
family coming together.'' Bush was directly critical of the raid,
saying the government should not have resorted to ''the terror of
middle of the night raids.''

<HEADLINE> Chechnya Rebels Step Up Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By RUSLAN MUSAYEV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Russian troops have finished a two-month
operation to clear Chechnya's war-ravaged capital of mines, but
rebels elsewhere were stepping up attacks on Russian-held areas,
the military said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, sappers and special agents discovered more than
120,000 mines underground or in the rubble of Grozny's bombed-out
buildings, the city's military commandant, Maj. Gen. Vasily
Prizemlin, told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   After rebels abandoned Grozny in February, the Russians barred
civilians from parts of the city for fear of mines.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear what Russia plans to do with Grozny. Some
officials have suggested moving the capital to Chechnya's
second-largest city, Gudermes, instead of spending the huge amounts
of money needed to rebuild Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Five months of Russian air and artillery strikes left the city a
charred shell. Many streets are impassable heaps of torn-up
asphalt, and the sewage and electricity systems have been
devastated. Many of its remaining residents are surviving on gruel
from Russian aid officials.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russia's top commander in Chechnya, Gennady Troshev,
ruled out peace talks with Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov.
Maskhadov, with whom Moscow negotiated an end to the 1994-6
Chechnya war, claimed last week that he had ordered a rebel
cease-fire and was seeking a peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot sit at a negotiating table with him. ... To sit a
negotiating table with bandits would be a betrayal of the army,''
the hawkish Troshev insisted on Russia's NTV television Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has indicated recently it is seeking a political solution
to the war, reporting some contacts with Maskhadov through
intermediaries. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he would
talk with Maskhadov -- if he gets the rebels to surrender. But
Maskhadov is at odds with many rebel commanders and is unlikely to
be able or willing to meet that demand.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, a top Interior Ministry officer said an increase in
attacks by militants this weekend could be a preparation for a
major rebel operation. There has been a lull in large-scale
fighting for more than a week, while both sides apparently regroup
their forces.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, militants twice attacked a checkpoint in the Zavodsky
region of Grozny, and fired at a Russian warehouse guard in Botlikh
in eastern Chechnya, ITAR-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel gunmen opened fire Saturday on a police post at the
railway station in Chernokozovo northeast of Grozny, and at a
police precinct in the southeastern town of Vedeno, said officer
Sergei Arenin, according to ITAR-Tass.
</P>
<P>
   At least five Russians were wounded in the attacks, the military
said. Rebel casualties were unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The military command estimated Sunday that 2,500 to 4,000 rebels
remain in eastern regions of Chechnya bordering the republic of
Dagestan, from where they could easily stage a cross-border attack,
ITAR-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya-based militants invaded villages in Dagestan in August,
which helped prompt Russia to send troops into Chechnya in
September.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians took about two-thirds of Chechnya in the first
months of the war, but have stalled in the mountains, the last
major area still under Chechen control.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a delegation from the European Committee for the
Prevention of Torture on Sunday visited a huge detention camp at
Chernokozovo, where human rights groups say Russian forces
routinely torture inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Stevenson, leading the delegation, said he did not see
signs of torture but that abuses probably had occurred earlier,
according to Interfax and ITAR-Tass.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chechens continued to flee into neighboring
Ingushetia, with about 1,900 refugees arriving Sunday, officials in
the Ingush capital Nazran said. Another 1,800 Chechens returned to
areas under Russian control.

<HEADLINE> Neb. Law at Center of Abortion Case  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN O'HANLON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- When Nebraska lawmakers passed a bill in
1997 banning so-called partial-birth abortions, Sen. Ernie Chambers
knew the issue was far from resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The unicameral Legislature's senior member cast the lone vote
against its passage and warned his colleagues that the measure
would fail to pass constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear a challenge to
Nebraska's ban -- its first major case dealing with abortion rights
in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   People on both sides of the issue say the court's decision will
either safeguard or significantly erode abortion rights in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is at stake ... is whether the court will extend the
right to abortion outside the womb to encompass the killing of
children who are partially delivered,'' said James Bopp, general
counsel for the National Right to Life Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Benshoof of the Center for Reproductive Law &AMP; Policy takes
the opposite view:
</P>
<P>
   ''The Supreme Court will determine whether states have the right
to force a woman to sacrifice her life and health to promote an
extremist political agenda to outlaw abortion outright,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Partial-birth abortion'' is not a medical term, it is the term
used by abortion opponents. Nebraska's law defines the banned
procedure as ''partially delivering vaginally a living unborn child
before killing the unborn child and completing the delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska Attorney General Don Stenberg, who is using the case as
the cornerstone of his U.S. Senate campaign, plans to argue that
the ban is limited to a procedure doctors call D&AMP;X, or dilation and
extraction, which involves cutting the skull of a fetus and
draining its contents before extracting it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. LeRoy Carhart, whose lawsuit is challenging the law,
maintains the ban is written in such a way that it could be used to
outlaw all abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Nebraska law, performing the procedure described in
the law for any reason other than to save the life of the mother is
punishable by a 25-year prison sentence. The law was put on hold
until the matter was resolved in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Similar laws against partial-birth abortion are on the books in
30 states, but courts have blocked enforcement of most of them.
President Clinton has twice vetoed a federal ban enacted by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The high court took the Nebraska case because of conflicting
decisions by federal appeals courts. One court struck down the
Nebraska law along with measures in Iowa and Arkansas, saying the
law was vague and too broad. Another court upheld nearly identical
laws in Illinois and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Carhart, one of only three doctors in Nebraska known to perform
abortions, said he performs more than 1,200 abortions a year, of
which about 20 involve the D&AMP;X procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure is estimated to be used in one out of 1,800
abortions performed nationwide, yet it has become the rallying
point of anti-abortion groups.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure is used most often in cases where the woman has
developed heart disease, diabetes or other life-threatening
ailments. Carhart said the method is one of the safest abortion
procedures because it reduces the risk of leaving parts of the
fetus inside the woman.

<HEADLINE> Russia Aims For Economic Growth  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin's long-awaited economic
program will aim for doubling Russia's gross domestic product
within 10 years and trim the government's role in the economy, one
of its designers said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Ulyukayev, an economist with the Center for Strategic
Developments, which Putin formed to put together his long-term
economic policy, said a key goal of the plan would be increasing
average personal incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Russia's RTR television, Ulyukayev said the economic
program would aim at increasing the average Russian family's
monthly purchasing power from the current $100 a month to $250 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The plan will aim at doubling GDP within 10 years, an ambitious
aim in a country where the economy has shrunk steadily for most of
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economy is plagued by corruption and deep structural
problems, and Putin frustrated his rivals in the recent
presidential campaign by saying he would release his economic plan
only after the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who easily won the vote last month, has indicated he
would continue market reforms, but he is also a proponent of a
strong state.
</P>
<P>
   Ulyukayev said Putin's economic plan would reduce direct
government influence in the economy, except in social services and
infrastructure. He said the government ''should flex its muscles''
in enforcing law.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Won't Use Old Spy Files  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder spoke out against
using old East German spy files in parliament's investigation into
the financial scandal surrounding the opposition Christian
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published Sunday in the Bild am Sonntag
newspaper, Schroeder also called on former Chancellor Helmut Kohl
to break his silence over the source of illegal campaign donations
that are at the center of the months-old scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time is ripe to adhere to the law and name the names of
the donors,'' Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl admitted in December having accepted some $1 million in
undeclared party donations in the 1990s, but has refused to reveal
the sources as required by law, insisting he gave his word to the
donors to keep them anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said it was up to the parliamentary committee
investigating the affair to decide whether to use recently surfaced
files kept by the communist secret police, known as the Stasi, on
Kohl and other prominent West German politicians.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ''I don't think much of falling back on such
records.''
</P>
<P>
   Parliament is investigating allegations that money was traded
for political favors under Kohl's 16 years in office, something
Kohl has steadfastly denied.
</P>
<P>
   Some have speculated the Stasi files could help identify Kohl's
secret donors, but Volker Naumann, chairman of the investigative
committee, has said his panel will not use the material, including
transcripts of bugged conversations, because it was collected
illegally.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Police Tactics To Be Probed  </HEADLINE>
By STAN LEHMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTO SEGURO, Brazil (AP) -- Federal prosecutors said Sunday they
would investigate the tactics used by police trying to quell
Indians protesting the celebration of the 500th anniversary of
Portugal's arrival in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Violent clashes between riot troopers and Indians protesting
what they called Portugal's ''invasion'' of this country erupted
Saturday at this seaside resort where Portuguese navigator Pedro
Alvares Cabral first made landfall on April 22, 1500.
</P>
<P>
   Police used clubs, tear gas and rubber bullets to break up a
crowd of about 2,000 Indians from all over Brazil who marched from
the nearby Coroa Vermelha reservation to join the protest. Many
Indians carried spears and banners in Portuguese reading ''500
years of resistance'' and ''Who said Brazil was discovered?''
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred protesters from black rights, student and labor
groups tried to join the Indians but were gassed and pushed back by
police, who had orders not to let them get near President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, who was at the celebrations 10 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Police detained and later released 141 protesters, including 30
Catholic missionaries. According to unofficial reports, at least 15
people, mostly Indians, were injured during the clashes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Indians and their supporters were violently deprived of
their constitutional right of free expression,'' said federal
prosecutor Marcio Torres, who called the police approach
''heavy-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other federal prosecutors signed a note with Torres
criticizing the police action as ''illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   The O Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper reported that an arrest
warrant had been issued for the police colonel who led the action
against the protesters. It was not possible to immediately confirm
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Minister for Institutional Security and Army General Alberto
Cardoso defended the police, saying they used ''adequate force to
prevent the demonstrators from marring the celebrations.''

<HEADLINE> Leading Iran Journalist Jailed  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- A media crackdown by Iranian hard-liners
intensified Sunday, with five liberal publications shut down and a
prominent journalist thrown in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The latest developments came three days after Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, the hard-line supreme leader whose powers supersede those
of the elected president, said there were 10 to 15 reformist papers
undermining Islamic and revolutionary principles, insulting
constitutional bodies and creating tension and discord in society.
His comments were widely seen as a warning to all reformist
newspapers and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, police seized Latif Safari, director of the banned
Neshat daily, and took him to Tehran's Evin prison, his son,
Amir-Hossein, told The Associated Press. Safari, whose arrest comes
a day after authorities detained the nation's top investigative
reporter, is the third journalist to be imprisoned this month.
</P>
<P>
   A press court ordered the closure of the reformist dailies Fath,
Asr-e-Azadegan, Aftab-e-Emrooz, and Arya as well as the leftist
monthly Iran-e-Farda, journalists at each of the publications said.
</P>
<P>
   The editors of Fath, Asr-e-Azadegan and Iran-e-Farda met to
decide their next move, journalists said. They were not expected to
defy the court order. The news of the closure of Aftab-e-Emrooz and
Arya came later.
</P>
<P>
   Safari was sentenced in September to 27 months in jail for
insulting Islam, police and lawmakers and provoking riots with
articles about an attack on a Tehran University dormitory by police
and hard-line vigilantes, his son said. The raid last July, in
which one student was killed, ignited riots in several large
cities, the worst unrest since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   An arrest warrant against Safari was issued last Wednesday after
his appeal was denied, said his son, who is a journalist at the
liberal Asr-e-Azadegan daily.
</P>
<P>
   Before Safari's sentencing last year, the hard-line judiciary
had closed down Neshat, the nation's top reformist newspaper, on
charges that included insulting Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Safari's arrest comes amid efforts by hard-line opponents of
President Mohammad Khatami to limit press freedoms and crack down
on a liberal media that has widely backed presidential reforms.
Nearly every leading reformist journalist has been summoned for
questioning by the judiciary, which is controlled by the
hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Akbar Ganji, the nation's top investigative
journalist, was summoned to court and arrested on the spot for
violations of the press law.
</P>
<P>
   Ganji, whose articles in several reformist newspapers had
suggested a shadowy group of hard-line officials were behind the
murders of five dissidents in the fall of 1998, is something of a
national hero. His books about the killings are best sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the judiciary upheld the conviction of
Mahmoud Shams, editor in chief of Asr-e-Azadegan, giving him a
2{-year jail term on charges of ''insulting religious sanctities.''
Shams has been a leading voice for press freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Saeed Hajjarian, another leading journalist, was shot
in the face and gravely wounded. Reformist newspapers and officials
have blamed the attack on hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign against the liberal media could intensify if the
strongly conservative Guardian Council approves legislation passed
Tuesday by hard-liners who dominate the outgoing Parliament to give
the judiciary more teeth in curbing outspoken newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami hit back at his opponents Saturday, saying the
hardliners were pushing the country toward ruin and despotism by
claiming that reforms threatened both Islam and Iran's
revolutionary ideology.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebels Kidnap 12  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- At least 12 people were kidnapped by a
leftist rebel faction when a landslide blocked holiday traffic on a
rural highway, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrillas from the People's Liberation Army, or EPL, snatched
their victims from buses and private cars near the town of
Riosucio, 130 miles northeast of Bogota, said Highway Police
commander Col. Alvaro Sandoval.
</P>
<P>
   Leftist rebels often mount roadblocks on isolated country roads,
especially on holiday weekends, charging ransoms for the release of
their victims.
</P>
<P>
   The 500-strong EPL is the smallest of Colombia's main guerrilla
groups.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Activist Office Closed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Palestinian Authority shut down the Gaza
City office of a Palestinian political activist group, the
organization said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Civic Forum Institute said in a statement
released to the press that their office was shut down last week in
a ''blatant violation of basic democratic rights'' by Palestinian
security officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian police in the Gaza Strip say the office was
closed because it is not registered with the Palestinian Ministry
of the Interior.
</P>
<P>
   The forum, which organizes lectures on refugee and social
issues, is run by Khatem Abdel Khader, a Palestinian legislator,
who has criticized corruption in the Palestinian Authority, but
supports Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian human rights groups have said that that torture,
political detention and restrictions on speech are rampant under
the Palestinian Authority.

<HEADLINE> 7.7 Tons of Marijuana Seized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Federal police found 7.7 tons of marijuana
earlier this week when they searched a truck heading to Mexico's
northern border with a load of 246 natural gas tanks, officials
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The plastic-wrapped marijuana bundles were found inside the
tanks, after police stopped the truck at a roadside checkpoint
about 90 miles south of the New Mexico border, a statement from the
Attorney General's Office said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before, police at the same checkpoint had stopped
another truck and found 46 pounds of cocaine hidden in a secret
compartment aboard the vehicle. The drivers of both trucks were
turned over to magistrates on suspicion of drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   In another operation on the Pan-American highway, just south of
the border, federal police found a man carrying 7.26 pounds of
heroin in a suitcase aboard a passenger bus. That man was also
detained.

<HEADLINE> Irish Archbishop Urges Peace Process  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Politicians must spare no effort
to revive Northern Ireland's 2-year-old peace accord, the leader of
the Anglican-affiliated Church of Ireland said in an Easter address
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Time is no longer a luxury in the search for that stability.
The longer solutions are delayed the greater are the opportunities
for those with undemocratic agendas to exert influence on our
lives,'' Archbishop Robin Eames told worshippers at St. Patrick's
Cathedral in Armagh.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Good Friday peace accord laid the framework for a
power-sharing administration bringing together Protestant,
pro-British unionists, who want Northern Ireland to remain within
the United Kingdom, and Catholic, pro-Irish nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   But in February the British government suspended the
administration after just 11 weeks to avoid a walkout by the
province's main Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, over the
Irish Republican Army's failure to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting this week in London, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern said they were
optimistic about a solution. But in its traditional Easter message,
the IRA offered no hint that it will disarm and blamed Britain for
upsetting the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party echoed those
sentiments at rallies throughout Ireland to commemorate the 1916
Easter Rising rebellion against British rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''If all the guns are to be taken out of Irish politics, and
that is an honorable objective, then the only way to do it is to
prove politics work,'' said Martin McGuinness, a reputed former IRA
commander, speaking at a rally in Dublin.

<HEADLINE> Expos 6, Brewers 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Vladimir Guerrero went 2-for-3 with two RBIs and
was walked intentionally with first base occupied during Montreal's
four-run fourth as the Expos beat the Milwaukee Brewers 6-4 on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Vazquez (2-0) pitched seven innings allowing four hits,
including a three-run homer to Geoff Jenkins, who homered for the
third straight game.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero hit an RBI single in the first and added his 100th
career double in the third for his 25th RBI of the season. He
raised his average to .439 (29-for-66).
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero was walked intentionally with runners on first and
third and two outs in the fourth after Rondell White singled in the
go-ahead run off Jaime Navarro (0-4) to make it 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Matt Williams replaced Navarro and issued
back-to-back walks to Lee Stevens and Trace Coquillette to increase
Montreal's lead to 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Ugueth Urbina came on with runners at first and third and two
outs in the eighth and allowed an RBI single to Kevin Barker.
Urbina struck out the final four batters for his fifth save in
seven opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 2-0 on Guerrero's two RBI hits, Vazquez gave up a
leadoff double to Mark Loretta in the fourth for the Brewers first
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Jeromy Burnitz, who had walked in the first, was hit by a pitch
and Jenkins put Milwaukee ahead 3-2 as he launched a high drive
into the right-field stands for his seventh homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The lead was short-lived as the Expos rallied for four in the
bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro allowed six runs and eight hits in 3 2-3 innings to see
his ERA go from 10.66 to 11.57. He walked four, including two
intentional walks.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Montreal has won six of its last eight home games to raise
its overall record to 10-8. ... Navarro has allowed 28 hits and 15
walks in his four starts. ... The Brewers are 1-4 on their current
nine-game road trip, Milwaukee's second-longest trip of the season.
... Guerrero has 99 career homers. ... Tony Armas threw 80 pitches
Saturday night in a rehab outing for Class-A Jupiter. Armas, who
allowed three runs -- two earned -- and just one hit in 4 1-3
innings, is on the 15-day disabled list with tendinitis in his
right elbow. ... Vazquez has gone at least six innings in each of
his four starts.

<HEADLINE> Panama Faces U.S. Flag Decision  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY (AP) -- Months after the U.S. flag was lowered here
for the last time, Panama may allow the Stars and Stripes to fly
once again -- over a cemetery. But even that symbolic proposal faces
opposition, a nationalist group said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the executive branch sent a proposal to congress to
grant permission for the U.S. flag to fly over the canal-side
Corozal cemetery, which contains about 5,000 graves, mostly
American soldiers or U.S. citizens who helped build the waterway.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Movement for the Defense of Sovereignty said
the proposal would be a reminder of the nearly nine decades in
which the United States dominated the country.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is ''anti-nationalistic and promotes a painful colonial
enclave,'' the group said in a press statement. The proposal would
not involve U.S. control of the graveyard. The United States
lowered its last flag over the canal zone -- which it once
controlled -- in December.
</P>
<P>
   The plan still must be approved by Panama's legislature.

<HEADLINE> Quotes From the Elian Gonzalez Case  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Quotes from the Elian Gonzalez case:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''We waited four, five months, the attorney general herself went
down and tried to negotiate a deal. I'm not sure what much more the
federal government could have been expected to do. We were forced
into the action that we took by the intransigence of that family in
Miami.'' -- Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder.
</P>
<P>
   ''His father speaks for him. He is with his father.'' --
Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner Doris M.
Meissner.
</P>
<P>
   ''You bet there'll be congressional hearings.'' -- Republican
Whip Tom DeLay of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time for some peace here for this boy. It's time for him
to have a chance in solitude and privacy to reconnect with his
family. That's going on right now. And the worst thing that could
possibly happen would be to reintroduce the circus atmosphere, the
television lights, the cameras, and the emotions of Miami into this
family reunion which is so special.'' -- Gregory Craig, attorney for
Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is absolutely no justification for using force to take a
little boy away from a home in Miami at gunpoint. That's just not
America. I am so disheartened at what I have seen over these last
several days.'' -- Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today our focus is: examination of any legal options we may
have to make sure that in the coming days no more harm happens to
him.'' -- Kendall Coffey, attorney for the Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seemed to the point that they (the Miami relatives) were
negotiating on a card they did not have. Elian became a Cold War
trophy. The issue really is about Castro.'' Rev. Jesse Jackson,
civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Juan Miguel was very sensitive. He's not trying to ask
his son questions about what happened yesterday or what's going to
happen tomorrow.'' -- Joan Brown Campbell of the National Council of
Churches and a friend of Juan Miguel Gonzalez who was present at
their reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened yesterday morning was an armed assault on an
innocent family, an unarmed family, where a young boy was taken
from his home forcefully. ... Their boy was taken from them.'' --
Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H.
</P>
<P>
   ''Listen, let's get on with it. The cycle is complete. The boy
was snatched from his father five months ago, he was found in the
Atlantic Ocean, he's in this country, he's been here five months,
albeit illegal, he's now this wonderful kid in the loving arms of
his father.'' -- Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.

<HEADLINE> Singer Neal Matthews Jr. Dead at 70  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRENTWOOD, Tenn. (AP) -- Neal Matthews Jr., who sang backup to
Elvis Presley, Patsy Cline and many others as part of the singing
quartet The Jordanaires, has died. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews died Friday of an apparent heart attack at his home
outside Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   The Nashville native joined the Jordanaires as second tenor in
1953 and the group began performing with Presley in 1956. Their
gospel-influenced background harmony was an integral part of
numerous Presley recordings, including ''Hound Dog'' and ''Don't Be
Cruel.''
</P>
<P>
   The group also recorded with Ricky Nelson, Marie Osmond, Jimmy
Dean, Merle Haggard and Tom Jones. On stage, they backed stars like
Marty Robbins, Kitty Wells, Jim Reeves, Tennessee Ernie Ford and
Don Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews returned to performing after suffering a stroke five
years ago. He recently sang with the quartet in Las Vegas was
scheduled to return there in May.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Matthews wrote a book titled ''Elvis: A Golden
Tribute.''

<HEADLINE> German Synagogue Attack Probed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ERFURT, Germany (AP) -- Federal agents joined the investigation
Sunday into an attempted arson attack on a synagogue in eastern
Germany, the first such incident in Germany since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Saying they didn't have any suspects in the attack Thursday --
Adolf Hitler's birthday -- local authorities offered a $5,000 reward
for help in solving the crime. The synagogue is in Erfurt, the
capital of Thuringia state in former communist eastern Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Local and federal investigators said they were looking closer
into a previously unknown group that claimed responsibility in a
letter found near the synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   The note, which ended with ''Heil Hitler,'' was signed ''Die
Scheiteltraeger,'' or ''the side-part wearers,'' a reference to
Adolf Hitler's severe haircut that is usually used by leftists as
an insult for the far right.
</P>
<P>
   A leading ex-communist lawmaker in the Thuringia statehouse,
Bodo Ramelow, told police he received a threatening phone call
Saturday night from a man who identified himself as
''Scheiteltraeger.''
</P>
<P>
   Police would not release details of the call, but said they were
taking it ''very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramelow has been active in organizing demonstrations against the
far right in Thuringia, an economically depressed state of 2.5
million where unemployment reaches 20 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   He recently has been campaigning to block the annual May 1 march
by the far right National Party of Germany, to be held this year in
Weimar.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler's birthday was also marked in Sweden, where dozens of
neo-Nazis gathered in two cities in the south this weekend to mark
the day.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 neo-Nazis held a party Saturday night in the industrial
district of Helsingborg, 300 miles southwest of the capital,
Stockholm. Police did not intervene, and said participants came
from Sweden and Germany. The Swedish news agency TT reported that
some also came from Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Another 55 neo-Nazis carried torches and banners during a
10-minute march late Saturday through the center of Karlskrona,
also in southern Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration was illegal because the marchers did not have
a permit, but police said they did not stop them because the march
was over so quickly and the demonstrators dispersed without
incident.
</P>
<P>
   A Molotov cocktail filled with diesel fuel was thrown at the
synagogue in Erfurt Thursday night, but the wick fell out on the
street and the flames were stamped out by a neighbor. The building,
built in 1952 to replace one destroyed by the Nazis, was undamaged.
</P>
<P>
   It was believed to be the first such attack in Germany since
neo-Nazis set a synagogue in Luebeck ablaze in 1994 and again in
1995.

<HEADLINE> 3 Fans Reported Dead At African Cup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Thousands of fans forced their way into an
overcrowded soccer
stadium in Liberia on Sunday, leaving at least three people
reported dead and others injured.
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the World Cup qualifier in Monrovia, some fans tried to
storm the field but were brutally beaten back by troops. Many in
the crowd had been waiting in the hot sun for more than eight
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross officials said three people carried out of the stadium
on stretchers died of suffocation. Several other people were
seriously injured. It was unclear whether there were any arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimated 50,000 to 60,000 people attended the game,
almost double the stadium's capacity of 33,000. Liberia and Chad
played to a 0-0 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the fans, including women carrying babies on their
backs, entered the stadium by scaling barbed wire fences and
overpowering police and soldiers who tried to drive back the
onrushing crowd with batons.
</P>
<P>
   President Charles Taylor warned government officials earlier in
the week that their jobs could be on the line if they did not
attend.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia played all its European-based players, including former
world player of the year George Weah. It advanced to the next round
on the strength of its 1-0 victory in Chad this month.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Kenyan fans rioted, causing a World Cup qualifier
to be abandoned with several minutes left. Fans in the crowd of
20,000 threw bottles and stones on the field and ripped out seats
in the stadium in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in World Cup qualifying play Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   At Luanda, Angola, Alves Antonio ''Paulao'' scored twice as
Angola trounced Swaziland 7-1 and advanced to the second round.
</P>
<P>
   At Kinshasha, Congo, the Congolese routed Djibouti 9-1 on a hat
trick by Yamweni Ngidi and moved on to the second round. Two
Djibouti players were ejected early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt beat Mauritius 4-2 a week after it scored a 2-0 victory in
the first game in Cairo. The second game was played in Alexandria
at Mauritius' request, which feared a recurrence of
religious-inspired violence at home.
</P>
<P>
   At Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso defeated Ethiopia 3-0 and moved to
the next round of World Cup qualifying play. Ethiopia won the first
game 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   At Accra, Ghana a perennial African soccer powerhouse, missed
numerous chances in a 3-2 victory over Tanzania, one of Africa's
traditionally weaker teams. The match featured defensive mistakes
by both sides. Ghana, which also beat Tanzania 1-0 in the first
game, advanced to the next round on a 4-2 aggregate.

<HEADLINE> Devil Ray's Saunders Pitches  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Tony Saunders, the Tampa Bay pitcher
who broke a bone in his left arm last year, threw off a bullpen
mound Sunday for the second time in three days.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, we're just building strength,'' Saunders said after
his five-minute throwing session. ''Hopefully mine will come back
pretty quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Saunders fractured his left humerus -- the bone from the shoulder
to the elbow -- in a game against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got a stubborn personality, and in this situation that's
great,'' Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild said. ''He's made up
his mind he's going to pitch again and he's taken strides toward
that. He's set a goal and now he's going about accomplishing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Three other pitchers since 1989 -- Dave Dravecky, Tom Browning
and John Smiley -- have had similar injuries, but never fully
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first day I started throwing three months ago, I had to
forget about it,'' Saunders said. ''It's not something you can sit
there, think about and still throw.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no timetable for when Saunders will pitch in a game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever it happens, it happens,'' Saunders said. ''If we set
a target date and I don't make it back, then I'll be mad, or
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Saunders is currently on a schedule where he will throw off a
bullpen mound every other day.

<HEADLINE> Princeton area, switching to new economy, is U.S. dot.com capital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -- Albert Einstein's old stomping ground
doesn't get the same buzz -- or respect -- as Silicon Valley, yet
high-tech companies here are expanding so fast that competition for
the best workers has become cutthroat.
</P>
<P>
   The Princeton area now has more Internet domain names on a
per-capita basis than Boston, Silicon Valley or New York's Silicon
Alley, according to domain registrar Network Solutions. Companies
and individuals here have registered more than 4,750 domain names,
and government data shows nearly 1,200 high-tech companies or
business services were in Princeton and surrounding towns in 1997,
The Times of Trenton reported for Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies are poised to go public with the initial stock
offerings, about a dozen venture capital firms are based in
Princeton, and businesses that support those high-paying, high-tech
companies, such as law and accounting firms, are opening up nearby.
</P>
<P>
   It seems just one thing is missing.
</P>
<P>
   ''In New Jersey, we still don't have an AOL or Microsoft or
Apple, a name-brand technology company,'' Maxine Ballen, president
of the New Jersey Technology Council, told the newspaper. ''But I
really think it's just a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more successful firms, RCN Corp. of West Windsor,
buoyed by a recent $1.6 billion investment from Microsoft
co-founder Paul Allen, is scouting locations in nearby Lawrence and
Ewing townships for a bigger headquarters: about 1.5 million square
feet of space that could eventually employ 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Another West Windsor mainstay, Sarnoff Corp., which invented
color television, has been a trailblazer in commercializing
in-house research.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the past seven years, we've spun off 18 companies,'' 13 of
which have stayed here, Sarnoff spokesman Tom Lento said. ''We are
also starting an incubator that will focus on Internet-related
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that distinguishes the Route 1 corridor in central New
Jersey is the fact that executives of Internet startups and other
high-tech firms are more likely to be mature and experienced than
Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Given the historically high salaries paid to top researchers in
company-sponsored facilities such as Sarnoff and Bell Labs, most
stayed put, said Jim Clingham. A 20-year Sarnoff veteran, he is now
guiding a handful of Internet startups.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of guys in their 50s like me who are getting
involved in startups,'' Clingham said. ''Up and down the Route 1
strip, people are coming to the conclusion that it's time to go it
on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Another difference from Silicon Valley, according to John
Martinson, chairman of a Lawrence venture capital firm called
Edison Venture Fund, is that the economy in Princeton's technology
corridor is less volatile than in other regions. That's partly
because of the high number of business service and health-care
firms that diversify the area's economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the corridor suffers from two problems: New Jersey's
perennial poor image and technology companies growing so fast they
have nearly exhausted the area's talent pool.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies are now looking outside the state for qualified
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're using the Internet and sites like Monster and
HotJobs.com'' to find people, said Douglas Ford, Sarnoff's
personnel director. ''Workers are coming not only from other parts
of the country but also from overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the state and private groups are trying to bring in
even more high-tech businesses and polish the area's image.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Gov. Christie Whitman announced $165 million in
state, federal and private funds will be spent on work force
training, early funding for startups and upgrading the state's
Internet presence.
</P>
<P>
   A Trenton-based nonprofit called Prosperity New Jersey will tout
the state as ''The Innovation Garden State'' in a marketing
campaign intended to attract out-of-state workers and even more
dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Jersey is really a high-tech powerhouse, and we really
need to do something to raise awareness of this,'' said Steven
Sasala, Prosperity's president. ''The only way we're going to do
that is to overcome the negative image of 'The Sopranos' and Jay
Leno jokes.''

<HEADLINE> Two Released in Border Graves Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Wrapping up an investigation into bodies
buried in clandestine graves along the U.S. border, prosecutors
have released the only two men arrested in the case from house
arrest, local media reported Sunday,
</P>
<P>
   Mexican and U.S. officials decided in January to end their joint
two-month excavation of suspected grave sites after turning up nine
bodies at three different sites. The dead are believed to be the
victims of drug-related violence,
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Reforma reported that the two men had been
released after 90 days' house arrest. They were identified as a
co-owner and caretaker of the La Campana ranch in the border city
of Ciudad Juarez where six of the bodies were found.
</P>
<P>
   The Attorney General's Office was unable to confirm the report
of their release.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man had been formally charged in the case, and both
claimed they had become involved with the property well after the
bodies -- some bound, gagged and executed -- had been buried there.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began Nov. 29 with 65 FBI agents and 600
Mexican military and federal judicial police, after a U.S.
government informant told authorities as many as 100 bodies might
be found at the ranch and three other sites.

<HEADLINE> Twins 5, Rangers 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Brad Radke pitched eight strong innings
as the Minnesota Twins beat the Texas Rangers 5-4 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Radke (2-2) got 18 outs on ground balls to help the Twins to
their second victory in the three-game series. Radke allowed three
runs and nine hits in eight-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Radke cruised through he first eight innings before allowing a
double to David Segui and walking Ruben Mateo to start the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wells relieved and got two outs before Royce Clayton hit a
three-run homer to right-center field, his third of the season.
</P>
<P>
   After Luis Alicea doubled, Wells got Jason McDonald to ground
out to second for the reliever's third save.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous start, Radke allowed one run and six hits over
eight innings, retiring 24 of the 31 batters he faced in a 3-1
victory over Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Texas had beaten Minnesota 13 straight times before the weekend
series. The Twins have won five of six overall.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez's eight-inning RBI single ended Radke's bid for
his fourth career shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has lost six of its last seven.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's Matt Lawton drove in two runs and went 3-for-4 to
extend his hitting streak to 10 games, matching his career high.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins scored three runs in the fifth against Darren Oliver
(0-1). Cristian Guzman had an RBI single and Lawton had a two-run
single.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Huskey's sacrifice fly in the eighth pushed Minnesota's
lead to 4-0.

<P>
   Oliver allowed four runs and nine hits in 7 1-3 innings. He
struck out two and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Hocking's RBI double in the ninth made it 5-1.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Texas third baseman Mike Lamb singled in the third in his
first major league at-bat. Lamb also committed his first error,
throwing high to first on a sixth-inning grounder. ... Lawton has
hit in 10 straight games three times in his career. ... Texas'
Rafael Palmeiro had a rare triple in the fourth. Palmiero has one
triple in each of the last three seasons. ... The Twins hit into
four double plays. ...Minnesota's Jason Maxwell had his first
three-hit game, going 3-for-4.

<HEADLINE> Two Soccer Fans Shot in Brazil  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) ---- Two people were shot and other
fans were assaulted with rocks and sticks during pregame violence
Sunday at a soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation erupted while groups of fans of traditional
rivals Flamengo and Vasco were headed to Maracana Stadium for the
afternoon game, police Sgt. Joao Lucas said. The teams are renowned
for their passionate and often violent army of fans.
</P>
<P>
   Shots were fired, and two people were taken to the hospital with
an unspecified number of gunshot wounds, according to several media
reports. No further information on their condition was available.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas said about 2,500 police officers were dispatched to patrol
the area during the decisive match in the first round of the Rio de
Janeiro state championship.

<HEADLINE> Miami Protests Said Handled Well  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MEADOWS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The images were flashed around the world: Hour
after hour of police grabbing, sometimes beating protesters in the
streets of Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Rocks and bottles flying through the air. Smoke rising from
torched trash bins and tires. Police marching to the tap, tap, tap
of batons against acrylic shields and clouds of tear gas sprayed
into the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   A full-scale riot was the last thing Miami officers wanted over
the removal of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   They got their wish, but they still had to handle scores of
angry demonstrators and the aftermath of a federal raid most local
authorities knew very little about.
</P>
<P>
   And fresh in the minds of many were the scenes of police
grappling with protesters from Seattle to Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Seattle demonstrators were able to block key
intersections and keep World Trade Organization delegates from
attending opening sessions. Police quickly lost control and
downtown Seattle suffered more than $2.5 million in damage and the
governor declared a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the District of Columbia prevented bands of
protesters from sabotaging world finance meetings, but still had
nasty street confrontations that led to more than 1,300 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, there were more than 350 arrests, but no serious
injuries. The problems tapered off Sunday morning and the streets
around the Little Havana home of Elian's relatives were quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Outside observers praised Miami police for their work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things could have been a lot worse,'' said Hubert Williams of
Police Foundation, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit dedicated to
improving policing through better training and technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''In spite of the high emotions, this thing did not get out of
hand. The police used pepper spray. They didn't use bullets,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Miami has suffered through its share of riots. Police learned
from the worst: The Liberty City riot of 1980, a Rodney King-like
response to a jury verdict over a confrontation between a black man
and police in which 18 people died.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Police Chief William O'Brien said in 1980, officers were
completely caught off guard and the result was lost lives and
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The city absolutely burned, there was massive destruction of
property, massive looting. As a result we developed the plan we
worked under yesterday,'' O'Brien said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   During Saturday's protests, many on the street criticized the
police response as too heavy-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on a corner amid clouds of tear gas, Martha Chisholm,
41, a Cuban born American, called the response a disgrace. She said
civil disobedience was a right police trampled.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel betrayed, we feel hurt,'' she said. ''It's a sad day
in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami Mayor Joe Carollo was also angry with the police chief,
saying he had ''lost all confidence'' in O'Brien for not notifying
the mayor or other city officials of the raid in advance.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien told The Miami Herald: ''This was a police issue, not a
political issue.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien and a handful of others were told of the raid Friday
afternoon. Despite the short notice, they were prepared after weeks
of anticipating trouble if federal agents took Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Still, O'Brien said the world's view of Miami has been
tarnished. ''How many people do you think are booking trips to
Florida who haven't been here before?''

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Archbishop Criticizes Govt.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- A Lebanese archbishop criticized his
country's government and the Syrian press Sunday for claiming that
recent student protests against Syria were inspired by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Christian students demonstrated in Beirut last week, calling for
Syria to withdraw its 30,000 troops in Lebanon. Eight students were
arrested in clashes with riot police.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese President Emile Lahoud said Friday the protests served
Israeli interests. On Sunday, the Syrian state-run newspaper
Tishrin accused Israel of instigating the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a sign of deep weakness,'' Archbishop Elias Audi told
his congregation in a Palm Sunday sermon. The cleric's Eastern
Greek Orthodox Church celebrates Easter next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Audi said those judgments equated Lebanese protesters with
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we silence the university, who will speak out? The
ignorant?'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop, who rarely criticizes the government, did not
name Lahoud and the Syrian newspaper, but was clearly referring to
their statements.
</P>
<P>
   Syria has stationed troops in Lebanon as peacekeepers since
1976, a year after a Christian-Muslim civil war erupted. Lebanon's
pro-Syrian government says the Syrian military is a stabilizing
factor in the country's postwar recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But sections of the Christian community fear that Syria's
dominant role in Lebanon could be strengthened after Israel
withdraws its troops from south Lebanon, a pullout due to take
place by July.

Elian Kin Rebuffed at Military Base
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives were rebuffed again today
in trying to get on to the Andrews Air Force Base in Washington where the
6-year-old boy is staying with his father, stepmother and baby half-brother.
Elian was insulated from the clatter over the armed raid used to take him away
from the Miami relatives' house. The only accounts of Elian's state of mind
since the reunion came from Gregory Craig, lawyer for the father, and another
supporter, Rev. Joan Brown Campbell. She said on ABC's ''This Week'' that Elian
acted like a ''very happy, mischievous, normal little boy'' when she visited
yesterday. Craig released two photos after the reunion, showing Elian smiling in
his father's embrace and playing with his baby brother. The Miami relatives
contended the images were manipulated.

Pope Offers Easter Wishes for Peace

<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Capping a grueling Holy Week schedule, a weary-sounding
Pope John Paul II offered Easter wishes for peace in 61 languages and called on
the world today to end racism and xenophobia. So many Holy Year pilgrims,
tourists and Romans turned out for the pope's late-morning Mass in St. Peter's
Square that by the time he delivered his Easter message at noon, the crowd,
numbering close to 150,000, was spilling over into the boulevard leading to the
Vatican. Sounding tired toward the end of the two-hour appearance, John Paul
expressed hope that the sense of life associated with Easter may ''overturn the
hardness of our hearts'' and ''impel individuals and states to full respect''
for human rights.

thrown in jail. The latest developments came three days after Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, the hard-line supreme leader whose powers supersede those of the
elected president, said there were 10 to 15 reformist papers undermining Islamic
and revolutionary principles, insulting constitutional bodies and creating
tension and discord in society. Today, police seized and imprisoned Latif
Safari, director of the banned Neshat daily, his son, Amir-Hossein, told The

Jordanian King Visits Israel

   EILAT, Israel (AP) -- Jordan's new king on today paid his first state visit
to Israel, underplaying the pomp and ceremony in a pointed reference to the
precarious state of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. King Abdullah II eschewed a
high-profile reception for the visit, which had been scheduled for February but
was delayed due to escalated fighting between Israel and Lebanese guerrillas. At
his insistence, he met Prime Minister Ehud Barak for a scant four hours in
Eilat, a southern Red Sea resort remote from Israel's bustling center. The young
king made it clear that the collapsed talks with Syria and the troubled
Palestinian track were making it harder for him to maintain warm ties.

decline, analyst Trilby Lundberg said. Gas prices nationwide, including all
grades and taxes, averaged $1.532 per gallon, which was down 3.89 cents from the
$1.5709 average on April 7. That was down 2.5 cents from the year's high of

Elias Sports Bureau said that appears to be the first time two teammates have
accomplished the quirky feat. Williams hit a two-run homer from the left side in
the first inning, and a three-run shot from right side in the fourth. Posada
homered left-handed in the second, and added a two-run homer batting
right-handed in the fourth.

<HEADLINE> Rain Halts Indians-Red Sox Again  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Ever the romantic, Pedro Martinez likes long walks
in the rain and curling up in bed on a stormy night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's romantic. It's nice to cuddle in,'' he said
Sunday after his start was rained out for the fourth consecutive
game. ''I like cloudy days and storms when I'm sleeping. But that's
if I'm sleeping -- not to play baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox and Cleveland Indians postponed their entire series
this weekend because of a storm that drenched Boston. The same
storm postponed Martinez' originally scheduled start on Thursday
night, in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the long layoff, Martinez warmed up in the outfield
on Sunday for about 12 minutes and pushed his start back to Tuesday
in Texas. His brother Ramon will pitch the series opener against
the Rangers, and Jeff Fassero will pitch on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know, being a power pitcher, you normally lose your touch if
you go too long without throwing,'' said Pedro Martinez, who added
that it was his idea to reschedule. ''Nine days is too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Three times the Red Sox and Indians came to the ballpark, and
three times they left without a pitch being thrown. Sunday was a
double-dip: The team postponed a doubleheader that had to be
scheduled because of Saturday's rainout.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost like an All-Star break,'' said Indians first
baseman Richie Sexton. ''But I don't think anybody really cares.
You get banged and you move on, jump on a plane and head to
Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game was rescheduled for 6:05 p.m. on June 8, which had
been an off-day for both teams. Cleveland will stop in on its way
home from a road trip in Milwaukee, and the Red Sox will come home
for one day between series at Florida and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   To make up the other games, the teams will play a pair of split
doubleheaders on Sept. 20 and 21. Both days will have separate
admission games at 1:05 p.m. and 7:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians left after Sunday's rainout for Seattle. Chuck
Finley, Charles Nagy and Jaret Wright will pitch for Cleveland
there.
</P>
<P>
   Finley said he sat in the dugout until about 3:30 p.m., when
they told him the game was called. The announcement wasn't made to
the fans or press until 4:27 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to come out there and start letting my guard
down,'' he said. ''I sat there and watched the video about six
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Other players said they did anything they could to pass the
time. But after three days, they were running out of ways to kill
time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ate breakfast. Ate lunch. Played cards. Played cribbage. Guys
worked out. Guys watched TV,'' Red Sox first baseman Mike Stanley
said. ''What else could there have been to do in the confines of
the clubhouse. We pretty much exasperated all of it.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A Palestinian military court sentenced the
general director of the Palestinian Environment Ministry on Sunday
to five years in prison for beating his boss -- the environment
minister.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling against Hamdi Abu Jharbia and three of his
subordinates and relatives to five years in prison for the beating
of Palestinian Environment Minister Yusef Abu Safia was the first
time a Palestinian court ruled against Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth, Ibrahim Abu Jharbia, was sentenced by the court in the
West Bank town of Ramallah to five and a half years in prison and
ordered to pay a $700 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Safia was injured lightly from the beating which occurred at
his office earlier this month. Palestinian police said the attack
was prompted by a power struggle between Abu Safia and Abu Jharbia.

<HEADLINE> Hal Sutton Wins Greensboro Classic  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DROSCHAK, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Hal Sutton used some gutsy play down the
stretch to win his second tournament in a month, shooting a 71
Sunday to capture the Greater Greensboro Chrysler Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton beat Tiger Woods four weeks ago in the Players
Championship by one stroke. He held a one-shot lead over playing
partner Andrew Magee with four holes left at Forest Oaks Country
Club.
</P>
<P>
   And once again Sutton was clutch, nailing a 10-foot birdie putt
on No. 15, while Magee bogeyed for a two-shot swing that enabled
the 20-year PGA Tour veteran to pick up his 13th career victory
with a 14-under 274.
</P>
<P>
   The $540,000 first-place prize moved Sutton to $2.3 million, his
best season as a pro. It was also the fifth time in his career he's
won two tournaments in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton really won this event in the first two days, going 13
under and building a big lead as he shot a 64 on Friday. He was
just 1 under over his final 36 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Magee's 1-under final round was good enough for second place,
three shots behind Sutton. Magee hasn't won since 1994, but has
seven second-place finishes since then.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Calcavecchia and Dudley Hart tied for third, another shot
back. Calcavecchia fired a final-round 65 to make a late charge,
while Hart had a 70.
</P>
<P>
   Magee pulled within one shot as he escaped with a drive into the
right woods on the par-5 13th hole. He parred as Sutton bogeyed,
but Magee wasn't so lucky two holes later as he hooked the ball off
the tee into the left woods.
</P>
<P>
   He punched out into the fairway and was actually 15 yards closer
to the green than Sutton. But his approach shot from about 120
yards came up short of the green, while Sutton stuck his shot close
to the pin.
</P>
<P>
   Magee's first pitch was 8 feet short and he missed his par putt
after Sutton had put the pressure on, rolling his 10-footer into
the center of the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia missed his last two cuts and didn't break 70 in his
previous three rounds at Forest Oaks, yet carded the best 18 of the
day to close at 10-under 278.
</P>
<P>
   He birdied three of his final four holes for his best round of
the year and best finish since he tied for third in the 1999 Canon
Greater Hartford Open.
</P>
<P>
   Magee got off to a terrible start off the tee. His first two
drives found the right rough. However, he was able to scramble and
salvage par before closing within two of Sutton, who three-putted
the third hole from 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Magee gave a shot back on the next hole, leaving his first chip
in the high rough for a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton moved in front by four shots on No. 6 with an 8-foot
birdie putt. But Magee responded a hole later, hitting a beautiful
approach shot within 6 feet for a birdie as each player made the
turn at even-par 36.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Sutton pulled back in front by three by matching
birdies with Hart. Magee also was putting the heat on with birdies
at Nos. 10 and 11, before fading at the fateful 15th hole.

<HEADLINE> Janitors Vote Monday on Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Striking janitors vote Monday on a tentative
agreement that could end a three-week walkout against major
cleaning companies that led to disruptive demonstrations in the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Janitors could be back on the job in and around Los Angeles as
early as Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides refused to discuss any details about the tentative
pact reached Saturday night, but Mike Garcia, president of
8,500-member Service Employees International Union Local 1877,
said, ''It's a good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 4,000 to 5,000 union members began walkouts on April 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a decent deal for both sides,'' said Dick Davis,
chief negotiator for nine of the 18 cleaning companies. Those firms
represent 97 percent of the affected buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Companies had been using replacement workers.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement was reached shortly before 8 p.m.
Saturday after seven hours of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Janitors, who make an average of $6.90 per hour, began the
strike demanding $1-per-hour raise for this year and each of the
following two years. The cleaning companies were offering less than
half of that.
</P>
<P>
   The first week of the strike was marked by a series of ''rolling
strikes'' in which janitors shut down more and more buildings as
each day went by. Wearing red T-shirts and hoisting ''Justice for
Janitors'' signs, they marched through downtown streets, blocked
busy intersections, held candlelight vigils.
</P>
<P>
   They also staged mass protests that stopped traffic around tony
high-rises and office buildings in West Los Angeles and Beverly
Hills.

<HEADLINE> Padres 11, Astros 10  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Eric Owens' two-run single keyed a four-run
eighth inning as the San Diego Padres rallied to beat the Houston
Astros 11-10 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Owens went 3-for-5 with a double, triple and four RBIs as San
Diego swept its first series in Houston since 1996. The Astros have
lost nine of their last 12, and are 2-7 in Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   Al Martin had three hits and three runs scored and Ryan Klesko
drove in two runs, including a tiebreaking single in the eighth
inning off Billy Wagner (0-1).
</P>
<P>
   Ken Caminiti went 2-for-3 with two homers and five RBIs for
Houston. He hit a three-run homer in the first and a solo shot in
the third. He also had a sacrifice fly in Houston's four-run
seventh that gave the Astros a 10-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Padres rallied in the eighth. Jay Powell walked Chris
Gomez to lead off the inning and one out later, Martin singled.
Both runners advanced on a passed ball and scored on Owens' single.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner came on and gave up a single to Tony Gwynn, threw a
run-scoring wild pitch to tie the game and Klesko's single that put
San Diego on top.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Whisenant (2-0) pitched 1 1-3 innings for the win. Trevor
Hoffman pitched the ninth for his fourth save.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Meluskey went 2-for-3 with a homer and three RBIs,
including a run-scoring double that made it 10-7.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Scott Elarton, who was activated from the disabled
list Saturday, pitched seven innings in his first appearance since
Sept. 26, 1999. The right-hander allowed seven runs on 10 hits,
walked one and struck out three.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego starter Brian Meadows allowed six runs and seven hits
in five innings. He also had a pair of RBI singles.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Caminiti has 19 career multihomer games. ... Biggio
increased his hitting streak to 14 consecutive games, tying a
career high set in 1997. ... There have been 32 homers in nine
games at Enron Field. ... Through nine home games the Astros and
their opponents have scored 110 runs, an average of 12.2 per game.
Through the first nine games at the Astrodome last season the two
teams scored 75 runs, an average of 8.3 per game. ... Tony Gwynn
has 2,331 career singles, moving past Cap Anson for 10th place on
the career list.

<HEADLINE> Toronto One Win Away From Round 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- The Toronto Maple Leafs know how
fortunate they are.
</P>
<P>
   With five minutes left in the fifth game of their first-round
series against the Ottawa Senators, the Leafs were down a goal and
about to move within a game of playoff elimination.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Steve Thomas tied the game Saturday night and then won
it in overtime, putting Toronto one win from a second-round meeting
with the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to play with a little more urgency,'' forward Darcy
Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators, who will play host for the sixth game Monday
night, outshot Toronto 38-31 Saturday, and all they could manage
was Joe Juneau's second-period goal in a 2-1 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ''We created a lot of good opportunities and played strong
defensively,'' Ottawa coach Jacques Martin said. ''I don't think
they had a chance from late in the first period until (Thomas'
first) goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The difference was our inability to get that second goal and
break their back.''
</P>
<P>
   If necessary, Game 7 would be back in Toronto on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to win one in their building,'' Joseph said. ''It'd be
nice to win Game 6 and not give them that Game 7 chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senators showed no sign of panic Sunday. Martin felt his
club played its best game in Saturday's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh yeah, no doubt in my mind, both offensively and
defensively,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs will need some offense from a line other than their
top unit. Thomas (five goals), Mats Sundin (two) and Jonas Hoglund
(one) have contributed eight of the team's 13 in the series. The
only other players with goals are Tucker (two), Sergei Berezin
(two) and Dmitri Khristich (one).
</P>
<P>
   ''Their defense is doing a good job,'' said Berezin, who failed
to get a shot on Tom Barrasso in Game 5. ''They're always in my
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' hard shot from the left-wing circle to the far top
corner of the Ottawa net at 15:30 of the third period forced sudden
death.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not many guys could have made that shot,'' Joseph said.
</P>
<P>
   After Vaclav Prospal's shot in overtime went off the crossbar,
the Leafs rushed the other way and Berezin slid a 2-on-1 pass that
Thomas back-handed along the ice and behind a lunging Barrasso to
end it at 14:47.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas set an NHL record by scoring his 11th career overtime
goal during the regular season. This was his first OT playoff goal
in his 14-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really think our team showed a lot of perseverance,'' Thomas
said. ''There was a point in the third period where we couldn't
even get a dump-in into their zone.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's how well they were playing defensively. It was like
there was a wall up across their blue line. But we told each other,
'It might take 58 minutes but we have to persevere.' And we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa has scored only eight goals in the series. Their defense
has kept them in the series, while the offense has sputtered.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to raise our game,'' Martin said. ''But it's
encouraging from the standpoint we've got better as the series has
gone on. We feel we can win a game in their building.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators forwards Shawn McEachern, Rob Zamuner and Shaun Van
Allen downplayed the failure of a four-minute power play in the
third period that could have iced the game for Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after, Thomas tied it 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought we were still in control at that point,'' Van Allen
said. ''There was nothing you could really do on the goal. Thomas
made a great shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Chris Phillips said: ''The positive we can take out
of it is that we controlled the game for 55 minutes. It wasn't like
it was a big defensive breakdown. We played well, but we're going
to need an even better game.''

<HEADLINE> Blues 6, Sharks 2  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Improbable playoff comebacks are
becoming a rite of spring for the St. Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Young scored three times Sunday and the Blues, trying to
match last year's feat of rallying from a 3-1 deficit to win a
first-round series, defeated the San Jose Sharks 6-2 to even their
series at three games apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Game 7 is Tuesday night at St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who has five goals in the series, opened the scoring in
the first period and added two more goals as the Blues took a 6-0
lead midway through the second.
</P>
<P>
   Jochen Hecht had a goal and three assists for St. Louis, which
had three goals on three shots in a 2:40 span of the second period
and set a team record with the five goals in one period. Chris
Pronger and Tyson Nash also scored for the Blues, and Pierre
Turgeon had three assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues, the best road team in the NHL during the regular
season, scored six times on their first 13 shots. They took 24
shots overall, while the Sharks fired 27 at goalie Roman Turek.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Nolan and Bryan Marchment scored for the Sharks, who have
never won a series-clinching game on their home ice in San Jose. It
was Nolan's fifth goal of the series, but his first since Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues are following a script similar to last year's
first-round ouster of Phoenix, but with an important difference.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in the 1999 postseason, they lost Games 2, 3, and 4 and
rallied to win Games 5 and 6. Last year, they had to win Game 7 at
Phoenix. This time, the decisive game will be on their home ice.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis is trying to become the 16th team in NHL history to
win after trailing 3-1 in a series. They also pulled off the feat
in 1991, when they rallied to defeat Detroit in the first round. No
team has done it in consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues opened the scoring when Turgeon fought off a defender
while bringing the puck up the ice and passed to Hecht, who slid a
pass to a wide-open Young at the side of the net with 7:29 left in
the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Young made it 2-0 just 21 seconds into the second when he got a
rebound and flicked a 25-foot shot over Shields' right shoulder.
Hecht completed a give-and-go with Turgeon to make it 3-0 while the
teams both skated a man down midway through the period.
</P>
<P>
   Then the roof caved in for Shields and the Sharks. Pronger's
shot trickled out of Shields' glove and into the net with 8:18 left
in the period, Nash scored 69 seconds later on a shot that went off
Shields' stick hand and Young completed his hat trick with a
power-play goal with 5:38 remaining in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan scored a power-play goal for San Jose with 2:47 left in
the second period and Marchment scored with four minutes left in
the game.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 91, Timberwolves 88  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Scottie Pippen displayed old, familiar
playoff determination, and the young Minnesota Timberwolves showed
they still have a lot to learn Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen scored 28 points and hit two crucial free throws after
being knocked to the floor with 1:26 left as the Portland Trail
Blazers rallied to defeat the Timberwolves 91-88 in Game 1 of the
best-of-five playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers trailed 75-69 to start the fourth quarter, but came
back when Minnesota, which had been making its jump shots all game,
suddenly started forcing them.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen drove to the basket and was hit across the right side of
the face by Anthony Peeler. Pippen grimaced in pain, but still made
his foul shots for an 87-82 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves got within three twice, on two free throws by
Malik Sealy and a drive by Terrell Brandon. But Pippen and Detlef
Schrempf combined for four free throws in the final 16 seconds to
seal it.
</P>
<P>
   Sealy had 23 points to lead the Timberwolves. Garnett had 12
points, a career high-tying 11 assists, and 10 rebounds, but he
shot just 6-of-20, including 1-for-5 in the fourth quarter. Brandon
had 17 points and 12 assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves, who have never won a playoff series in their
11-year history, fell to 0-4 in openers. Minnesota also had been
20-0 on the road when leading after three quarters, but that streak
ended.
</P>
<P>
   Blazers center Arvydas Sabonis had a horrible start, missing his
first six shots and getting into foul trouble. His first basket
came with 10:35 to play, and it pulled the Blazers to 75-71.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to energize the 7-foot-3 Lithuanian. He sank a
20-foot jumper and hit one of two free throws after bowling over
Joe Smith, who had to leave the game after hitting his head on the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis then fed Rasheed Wallace for a layup and a foul with
5:16 left, and Wallace's free throw gave the Blazers their first
lead since halftime, 81-79.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves hurt themselves by shooting just 26 percent in
the fourth quarter and turning over the ball five times after
committing just seven in the first three periods.
</P>
<P>
   The first quarter belonged to Pippen, who scored 13 points and
hit six of seven shots. Three of those were superb inside baskets.
First he drove and dunked left-handed over Wally Szczerbiak, then
had a more emphatic slam over Radoslav Nesterovic. Later he went up
in the air, switched the ball to his left and laid the ball in off
the glass.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen also hit an open 3-pointer and sank two more long jumpers
in the final 1:27. After the Timberwolves made the mistake of
double-teaming Schrempf inside, Damon Stoudamire wound up with a
wide-open 3-pointer to cap a 16-4 run and give the Blazers a 33-22
lead.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for the Timberwolves to come back. Peeler
scored the team's first five points, and Brandon hit two mid-range
jumpers as Portland hit just one field goal in the first 6{
minutes. A short hook by Nesterovic capped a 13-2 run and tied it
at 35.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen hit a 3, and the teams traded leads four times the rest
of the half. Garnett launched a 20-footer over Wallace that dropped
in at the buzzer to pull Minnesota within 48-47.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Portland's Bonzi Wells, a valuable backup to Steve Smith
during the regular season, struggled in his first playoff game. He
had zero points on 0-for-2 shooting as Minnesota held a 19-4 edge
in bench scoring. ... Smith has made 43 of his last 47 postseason
free throws, dating to last season with Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Elect City Councils  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cubans elected city councils across the island on
Sunday, in voting that officials argue is more democratic than in
most other countries, despite Communist Party dominance of the
political system.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 8 million Cubans aged 16 and over were eligible to vote,
and the vast majority had done so well before midday, choosing
between two or more candidates in each district.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three elections since 1992, more than 97 percent of
eligible voters came to the polls. Turnout Sunday was projected at
more than 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   After voting in the Vedado area of Havana, President Fidel
Castro charged that in the United States, ''democracy consists
simply of who has more money for publicity, for the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns are virtually banned in Cuba. ''No candidate has a
program or makes promises,'' said Justice Minister Roberto Diaz
Sotolongo, head of the National Electoral Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The only information about each candidate is posted at the doors
of polling places: a single-page biography listing their job
history and activities in organizations such as the Communist Party
or labor groups.
</P>
<P>
   There are no parties listed on the ballot and nonmembers of the
Communist Party can run, though most of the 31,000 candidates seem
to be party members.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Communist Party is the party that directs the Cuban
people, that directs our society,'' Diaz Sotolongo said.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates are chosen in neighborhood meetings open to all.
</P>
<P>
   Dissent rarely rears its head in the process: Cubans are more
likely to express private complaints or emigrate, though officials
argue that much of that emigration is for economic reasons. People
from about 15 percent of the island's households have applied for
visas to emigrate to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz Sotolongo said that under electoral rules, government
opponents could become candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why doesn't that happen? Because the counterrevolution does
not have a majority in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting is secret and anyone, including foreign visitors, can
watch votes being counted.
</P>
<P>
   Critics claim that Cubans are afraid to nominate opposition
figures or not vote for fear it might count against them in a
country where the overwhelming majority of jobs are in state
organizations. Even private companies hire from lists vetted by the
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz Sotolongo insisted that ''there is no discriminatory
treatment of any kind for not voting ... There is no mechanism of
punishment either.''
</P>
<P>
   While advocating abstention can be considered a crime, none of
numerous Cubans interviewed about the elections have said they know
anyone who suffered for not voting, although few knew of any who
had abstained. A few admitted concern about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no pressure to vote; it's not obligatory,'' said Jose
Antonio Lescaille, 29, who said he was ''proud of my country.'' But
he said the party's neighborhood committees might take note of not
voting ''as something else you've done.''
</P>
<P>
   But another voter, Julia Garcia, 50, said ''there is no kind of
repression'' of those who do not vote.

single of the cycle as the Chicago White Sox beat the Detroit
Tigers 9-4 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There were no flareups following Saturday's two bench-clearing
brawls, in which 11 people were ejected.
</P>
<P>
   James Baldwin (3-0) won his first start since getting drilled in
the chest by Greg Vaughn's comebacker April 12, and Chicago
battered Dave Borkowski for eight runs in the first two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago extended its winning streak to five game, while Detroit
lost for the seventh straight time.
</P>
<P>
   Recalled before the game, Borkowski started in place of Brian
Moehler, who underwent an emergency appendectomy Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Borkowski didn't last long, giving up eight runs on six hits
over 1 2-3 innings as Chicago batted around in each of the first
two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Durham tripled leading off the first and scored on a passed
ball. Jose Valentin and Frank Thomas drew walks and Magglio Ordonez
hit his third homer, a three-run shot to center, to make it 4-0.
Ordonez went 4-for-5.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Higginson went 4-for-4 and hit his first two homers of the
year for the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Higginson hit his first homer of the year to pull
Detroit within three at 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Durham led off the second with a single and scored on Thomas'
sacrifice fly. Ordonez hit an RBI double and Chicago then loaded
the bases. Mark Johnson relieved Borkowski, and Norton greeted him
with hit a two-run single to make it 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez and Dean Palmer also homered for Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin allowed four runs -- all on solo homers -- on seven hits
over 5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The game was delayed by rain for 2 hours, 34 minutes. ...
Chicago is 12-6, matching its best start in 18 years. The White Sox
haven't started 13-6 since 1977. ... Baldwin equaled his
career-best 3-0 start in 1996. He won nine of his first 10
decisions that year. ... Chicago's last three-game sweep of the
Tigers at Comiskey Park happened July 18-20, 1994. ... Outfielder
Chris Singleton robbed Deivi Cruz of a hit in the sixth. Singleton
got his glove underneath a blooper, flipped the ball up in the air
and caught it as he slid feet first. ... Baldwin allowed a
franchise-record 34 homers last year, fourth-most in the AL. ...
Gonzalez's homer was his first hit on the road after starting
0-for-14. Gonzalez is 8-for-21 (.381) at Detroit's Comerica Park.
... It was Higginson's 10th career multi-homer game. ... Juan
Encarnacion's single in the sixth gave Detroit three consecutive
hits for the first time this year.

<HEADLINE> Violent Kashmir Takeover Supported  </HEADLINE>
By ROSHAN MUGHAL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- More than 10,000 people rallied at
a soccer stadium here Sunday in support of a bloody secessionist
movement in Indian-ruled Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no other alternative but to wage jihad (holy war)
against Indian troops,'' Syed Salahuddin, chief of the militant
Hizbul Mujahedeen group told participants at a conference in
Muzaffarabad -- the capital of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ''Indians are killing innocent Kashmiris, raping our women and
setting our houses on fire,'' said Salahuddin, who also heads the
United Jihad Council -- an umbrella organization of at least 12
guerrilla groups fighting in Indian Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Salahuddin complained the United Nations was unable to implement
its resolutions on Kashmir and said the international community was
indifferent to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir, a former princely state, is divided between Pakistan
and India and has already been the cause of two of their three wars
since independence from Britain in 1947. Both the countries claim
the region in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. resolutions call for a plebiscite among Kashmiris to
determine the future status of the territory. But New Delhi flatly
rejects international mediation and calls Kashmir -- the only
Muslim-majority state in Hindu-dominated India.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade Indian troops have sought to curb the
secessionist movement in Kashmir, where more than 25,000 people
have been killed in fighting. Muslim militants want Kashmir's
merger with Islamic Pakistan or independence.
</P>
<P>
   Rally participants shouted ''Down with India'' and ''Indians
quit Kashmir,'' while waving Pakistan's green and white flag. A
number of uniformed participants were armed with assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
   New Delhi accuses Pakistan of sponsoring the insurgency and
sending infiltrators. Islamabad denies the charge and labels it a
home grown movement.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Hernandez: Cuban Boy Abused  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Cuban defector Orlando Hernandez said Elian
Gonzalez was abused when he was taken away in an armed raid by
federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, a star pitcher for the New York Yankees who defected
three years ago, disagreed with the U.S. government's treatment of
the 6-year-old boy on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was real abuse,'' Hernandez said Sunday through an
interpreter. ''I never thought something like that could happen in
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who like Gonzalez was rescued at sea, said he was
''very saddened.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When I woke up yesterday and saw the news, I felt they were
taking the freedom of my kid,'' Hernandez said. ''The words of
Janet Reno and (Bill) Clinton were not the most convincing. The
happiness of the kid should come before politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said this hasn't changed his feelings about his new
country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy with my opportunity for freedom, but they also have
to remember the opportunity for Elian's freedom,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Honduras 2, Canada 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- Hesler Phillips and Luis Ramirez each scored
as Honduras posted a 2-0 victory over Canada in an Olympic soccer
qualifying game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, Honduras (1-1) kept alive its hopes of
advancing to the semifinal round of the six-team tournament, which
will send its top two finishers to the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Canada (0-1), making its first appearance in the preliminary
round, will play the United States on Tuesday night. The Americans
blanked Honduras 3-0 on Friday and are in excellent shape for
advancing to the final four. The Canadians must defeat the U.S.
team 2-0 or score at least three goals in a victory over the
Americans to move into Friday night's semifinal round.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Americans and Hondurans move on.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips gave Honduras a 1-0 lead in the 32nd minute when his
shot from about 10 yards flicked off a Canadian defender and soared
over goalkeeper Mike Franks.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian left fullback Jason Mathot was sent off for hitting
Honduras' Elvis Danilo Turcios in the face with about 15 minutes
remaining. Still, Canada had a great chance to tie the game in the
90th minute. But Kevin McKenna's header off Jim Brennan's free kick
smacked the underside of the crossbar, dropped to the goal line and
bounced away.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, in stoppage time, Ramirez tacked on a goal to
seal it for Honduras.

<HEADLINE> Giants 12, Diamondbacks 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Bill Mueller and Bobby Estalella homered during
San Francisco's eight-run first inning as the Giants beat the
Arizona Diamondbacks 12-7 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds hit his 453rd home run, a two-run shot in the ninth,
to take sole possession of 21st place on the career list.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kent and Rich Aurilia also homered for the Giants, who have
won three straight after losing 11 of their first 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gonzalez hit his fifth homer and Erubiel Durazo hit his
third for Arizona, which has lost three in a row for the first time
since Aug. 31-Sept. 3. The Diamondbacks had not been swept since
dropping three straight to Cincinnati on June 21-23.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco had eight batters reach base safely before the
Diamondbacks recorded an out. The Giants' eight-run inning was
their largest since they scored nine runs in the fifth inning
against Oakland on June 22, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Reynoso (1-3) allowed seven runs, six hits and a walk
without retiring a batter in the shortest outing of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Benard singled to center and Mueller homered just over
the right-field fence to put San Francisco ahead 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds then singled to right, moved to second on a single by Kent
and scored on J.T. Snow's double down the right-field line to make
it 3-0. Reynoso walked Ellis Burks to load the bases before Aurilia
lined a two-run single over second baseman Jay Bell for a 5-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Anderson replaced Reynoso and was called for a balk,
scoring Burks before Estalella hit a two-run homer to right to cap
the eight-run inning.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nathan (1-0) allowed six runs and seven hits in five innings
for the Giants. Nathan, coming off three straight no-decisions, was
nearly as shaky in the bottom of the inning as six of the first
seven Diamondbacks hitters reached base safely.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona cut the lead to 8-4 on an RBI single by Gonzalez,
Durazo's homer and Andy Fox's run-scoring groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Kent made it 9-4 in the fifth when he homered into the picnic
pavilion above the center-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez answered in the bottom of the inning with his second
homer in as many days into the pool area and Travis Lee had an RBI
groundout to pull Arizona within 9-6.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Giants, who entered the three-game series having lost
six straight to Arizona, swept the Diamondbacks for the first time.
... Reynoso's outing was the shortest in the Diamondbacks'
three-year history. ... San Francisco has scored 43 runs in its 11
losses and 61 runs in its seven victories. ... Anderson's
four-inning relief stint matched the team record set April 5 by
Mike Morgan. ... Kent went 6-for-15 with two homers and eight RBIs
during the three-game series. The second baseman also robbed Tony
Womack of a hit in the sixth when he leaped high to snag a line
drive. ... The Diamondbacks went 3-4 during their homestand, their
first losing homestand since June 14-27, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Wood Has Blister On Hand  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Kerry Wood's return to the Chicago Cubs
from elbow surgery might be delayed by a blister.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year who missed all of last
season, pitched threw seven strong innings Sunday for the Triple-A
Iowa Cubs before being pulled in the eighth after a blister
developed on the middle finger of his throwing hand.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander allowed four hits, four walks and two earned
runs, while striking out seven.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's frustrating, just because this could've been my last one
-- or should've been,'' Wood said of his third rehabilitation
assignment. ''I felt like I've got everything together, and now we
get to this point and something small like this comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubs general manager Ed Lynch said trainers will examine the
hand Monday before making a decision on Woods' status.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said he had hoped Wood would be ready to join the major
league club as early as Friday, when the Cubs return to Wrigley
Field for the start of a three-game series with Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ''If not for the blister, I'm convinced that he's ready right
now,'' Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   Wood's two previous outings came at Class-A Daytona, where he
picked up a pair of wins. In the two games, he allowed two earned
runs, struck out 17 and walked five in 12 innings.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Wood threw 99 pitches -- 62 strikes, 37 balls -- before
being pulled with a 3-0 count on backup catcher Darron Cox in the
eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Wood threw at least 94 mph in each inning, including a high of
98 in the first.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like I'm close and I should be up there getting major
league hitters out,'' Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   The first Sky Sox run against Wood came in the fourth inning on
a solo home run to left field by Scott McClain. After Wood left the
game in the eighth, McClain hit a three-run homer as Colorado
Springs rallied to win 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Wood and Lynch said the design of the Triple-A baseballs
contributed to the blister.
</P>
<P>
   ''Daytona balls did not give him a problem. Major league balls
did not give him a problem,'' Lynch said. ''But for some reason,
the balls today, with the higher seams, caused a little problem
with his middle finger on his pitching hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood also collected a hit as he beat out an infield single in
the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   But the postgame discussion centered around what Lynch called
''a dime-sized piece of skin'' on his throwing hand.
</P>
<P>
   Wood now must wait 24 hours to find out how the hand responds.
</P>
<P>
   ''It can't be any tougher than waiting 12 months,'' Wood said.

<HEADLINE> Logan Airport Delays Expected  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Logan International Airport controllers guided
arriving planes Sunday using a composite radar system from three
regional airports, one day after a wind storm knocked out its
central antenna.
</P>
<P>
   Delays and cancellations at the country's ninth busiest airport
were felt nationwide over the Easter holiday weekend, a busy travel
time as families gather for celebrations and students return from
spring break.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish it was happening last weekend, or next weekend. But
there's really no ideal time,'' said Bart Bartanowicz, New England
regional administrator for the Federal Aviation Administration
</P>
<P>
   New radar equipment from a supply center in Oklahoma City
arrived at Logan Sunday, officials said. A team of five technicians
was traveling with the heavy equipment, which could take several
days to assemble and test, Bartanowicz said.
</P>
<P>
   Until the new radar is ready, Logan was using a triangular
''composite'' system of radar from Truro, on Cape Cod; Cummington,
in western Massachusetts near the Berkshire Mountains; and
Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   The antenna damage -- plus rainy and windy weather -- caused 210
cancellations Saturday and 130 by noon on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were supposed to be home by now,'' said Abby Lang, who came
to Boston with her aunt to celebrate her 16th birthday. The Langs'
flight home to Washington, D.C., was routed to New Hampshire and
delayed four hours.

<HEADLINE> Ryan Has Double-Bypass Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Nolan Ryan underwent emergency
double-bypass surgery Sunday at the Heart Hospital of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame pitcher did not suffer a heart attack, Rangers
spokesman John Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, 53, experienced shortness of breath and chest pains around
9 a.m. after taking a morning walk with his wife, Ruth, at the Dell
Diamond in Round Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan was there to watch a 2 p.m. game between the Texas League
Double-A Round Rock Express, which he owns, and the Midland
RockHounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Ryan drove her husband to the Round Rock Medical Center,
where doctors performed an electrocardiogram and blood tests. He
was then taken to the Heart Hospital of Austin, where an angiogram
showed a substantial blockage of the left main coronary artery,
according to J.J. Gottsch, Express director of media and public
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Felger performed a double vessel bypass there at 3 p.m.
Gottsch said the surgery was a success.
</P>
<P>
   Blake said Ryan is expected to be hospitalized for about a week.

Elian Case Quiets Down
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez spent a secluded Easter with his father and
got a visit from the Easter Bunny, insulated from the clatter in two nation's
capitals and a shaken Miami over the armed raid used to take him away. After a
day of raw anger, street fires and violence in the Little Havana neighborhood,
Miami fell quiet for Easter celebration today morning, still under tight police
control after more than 350 arrests. Praising U.S. officials for their forceful
action, the communist leader declared a ''truce'' in his enduring Cold War-era
struggle with the United States, but added: ''Tomorrow the battle continues.''

Pope Gives Easter Sermon
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Capping a grueling Holy Week schedule, a weary-sounding
Pope John Paul II offered Easter wishes for peace in 61 languages and called on
the world Sunday to end racism and xenophobia. So many Holy Year pilgrims,
tourists and Romans turned out for the pope's late-morning Mass in St. Peter's
Square that by the time he delivered his Easter message at noon, the crowd,
numbering close to 150,000, was spilling over into the boulevard leading to the
Vatican. Sounding tired toward the end of the two-hour appearance, John Paul
expressed hope that the sense of life associated with Easter may ''overturn the
hardness of our hearts'' and ''impel individuals and states to full respect''
for human rights.

precarious state of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. King Abdullah II eschewed a
high-profile reception for the visit, which had been scheduled for February but
was delayed due to escalated fighting between Israel and Lebanese guerrillas.
The young king made it clear that the collapsed talks with Syria and the

Russians Seize $28M in Stolen Gems

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian police have cracked an international crime ring
dealing in stolen gems and seized $28 million worth of emeralds and other
precious stones, a top official said Sunday. Presenting part of the booty, a

Minister Vladimir Kozlov said the confiscated gems included stones from Russia's
Ural Mountains region and fake diamonds from other countries. A Russian
organized crime ring known as Uralmash was a key player in the gem deals, Kozlov
said on Russia's RTR television Sunday night.

   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Nolan Ryan underwent emergency double-bypassurgery
today at the Heart Hospital of Austin. The Hall of Fame pitcher did not suffer a
heart attack, Rangers spokesman John Blake said. Ryan, 53, experienced shortness
of breath and chest pains around 9 a.m. after taking a morning walk with his
wife, Ruth. Ruth Ryan drove her husband to the Round Rock Medical Center, where
doctors performed an electrocardiogram and blood tests. He was then taken to the
Heart Hospital of Austin, where an angiogram showed a substantial blockage of
the left main coronary artery, according to J.J. Gottsch, Express director of
media and public relations.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 117, Kings 107  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It's been Shaquille O'Neal's season, and if
what happened Sunday is an accurate indication, the playoffs might
be his, too.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, a virtual lock for his first NBA Most Valuable Player
award, equaled a career playoff high with 46 points, and also had
17 rebounds and five blocked shots as the Los Angeles Lakers opened
the playoffs with a 117-107 victory over the pesky Sacramento
Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the sellout crowd of 18,997 at Staples Center chanted,
''MVP, MVP,'' in the final minute of play, after O'Neal had been
taken out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old O'Neal hasn't won an NBA championship and has
said repeatedly that's his main priority.
</P>
<P>
   His chances right now look pretty good under first-year Lakers
coach Phil Jackson, who coached the Chicago Bulls to six titles in
the 1990s -- none before Michael Jordan turned 28.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 in the best-of-five series will be played Thursday night,
and Sacramento is home for the third game next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant scored 23 points and Glen Rice 18 for the Lakers,
who haven't won a championship since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Webber, limited to 27 minutes by foul problems, led the
Kings with a career playoff-high 28 points and five rebounds before
fouling out with 6:53 left.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Williams added 20 points and Tony Delk 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings dropped three of four games to the Lakers this season,
but lost by only three, one and seven points, while winning by 12.
</P>
<P>
   They trailed by six with 4{ minutes to play in this game before
the Lakers scored six straight to put them away.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings trailed by 16 points when Webber fouled out, but
scored 10 straight -- the final five by Vlade Divac -- to make it
105-99. But that's as close as the Kings would get.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant beat the shot clock with a jumper and, after Divac missed
two free throws, O'Neal made a short bank shot and a dunk to make
it 111-99 with 3:03 left.
</P>
<P>
   Webber picked up his fifth foul, and a technical as well, with
1:14 left in the third quarter and the Lakers up 86-76. It was
91-79 entering the final period, and Webber fouled out two seconds
after returning to the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings entered the series bucking history as well as the
Lakers. Since the 16-team playoff format was instituted 16 years
ago, the underdogs have won just two of the 32 first-round series
between No. 1 and No. 8 seeds.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Jackson's 112-41 record (.732) in playoff games is the best
in NBA history, percentage-wise. ... The Lakers, whose 67-15
regular-season record gives them home-court advantage throughout
the playoffs, finished 23 games ahead of the Kings (44-38). ... In
the last 20 years, 15 teams who had the best regular-season record
advanced to the NBA Finals, and 11 won the championship. ... The
Lakers won 16 of their last 17 regular-season games at Staples
Center, and their 36-5 home record tied Indiana for the NBA's best.
... The Kings lost 14 of their final 17 away games to finish 14-27
on the road. ... The Kings led the NBA in scoring this season,
averaging 105 points per game, but they allowed 102. The Lakers
ranked sixth in scoring with a 100.8-point average, and gave up
92.3. ... The franchises last met in the playoffs 16 years ago,
when the Kings were based in Kansas City, and Los Angeles swept
that first-round series 3-0. The Kings moved to Sacramento the
following year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Gas Prices Down Nearly 4 Cents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- The average price of gasoline in the
U.S. dropped nearly 4 cents a gallon at the pumps in the past two
weeks, the Lundberg Survey reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Lower crude oil prices and increased production were behind the
decline, analyst Trilby Lundberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The retail price cut speeded up the past two weeks. Lower
crude oil prices are the main cause, however, gasoline is also in
greater supply,'' Lundberg said after examining results of Friday's
survey of 10,000 gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   Gas prices nationwide, including all grades and taxes, averaged
$1.532 per gallon, which was down 3.89 cents from the $1.5709
average on April 7. That was down 2.5 cents from the year's high of
$1.5958 on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a much bigger drop than last time and further gas
price cuts are more likely than not,'' Lundberg said, adding she
was still cautious about predicting pump price drops.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot predict the immediate future. There are contrary
trends at work,'' she said, referring to some fluctuation in crude
prices while production increases.
</P>
<P>
   The Camarillo-based Lundberg Survey showed the national average
price of gasoline, including taxes, at self-serve pumps was $1.4835
for regular, $1.5805 for mid-grade and $1.6643 for premium. At full
service pumps, the average was $1.8136 for regular, $1.910 for
mid-grade and $1.9776 for premium.

<HEADLINE> Chase for Campaign Cash Doesn't Stop  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore and George W. Bush raise millions of
dollars, setting records along the way, even as they talk about
campaign fund-raising abuses and a need for reforming the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: it's big-money politics as usual, a
quarter-century after Watergate changes were supposed to clean
things up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody knows it's completely lurched out of control,'' said
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who made changing the campaign finance
rules the centerpiece of his presidential run that caught fire then
flamed out.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee, has raised
more money than any other presidential candidate. Vice President
Gore, the Democratic rival who faces continuing criticism of his
fund-raising practices during the 1996 election, touts his own plan
to change the way campaigns are financed. At the same time, the
Republican and Democratic parties have set new highs for raising
''soft money,'' the unregulated contributions from unions,
corporations and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The chase for campaign cash never stops.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, President Clinton, Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton,
who's running for a U.S. Senate seat in New York, are scheduled to
share the stage at a fund-raising gala in New York City, a week
after Clinton and Gore appeared together at a Hollywood event. The
two Democratic fund-raisers together were adding an estimated $4
million to party coffers.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, a Bush-headlined black-tie gala in Washington for
the Republican National Committee is expected to bring in at least
$15 million -- a record one-day haul.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe the system that was supposed to have been cleaned
up after Watergate has gone astray.
</P>
<P>
   The tactics used to pump record amounts of money into political
campaigns were unknown when President Ford signed a
Watergate-inspired bill in 1974. The new law added disclosure
requirements, limited donors to giving candidates $1,000 each per
election, and created the Federal Election Commission to enforce
the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Congress voted to allow corporations and labor
unions, though banned from contributing directly to federal
campaigns, to make unlimited ''soft money'' contributions to the
political parties. That started a trickle that has become a flood.
The two major parties, which raised $86 million in soft money in
1991-92, boosted their intake by 160 percent, to $224 million, in
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   These ''soft money'' funds were at the heart of the 1996
campaign finance abuses, when foreign sources pumped millions of
dollars into Democratic coffers. The money was refunded and a
Justice Department task force indicted 22 people. One of them, Gore
friend and veteran fund-raiser Maria Hsia, recently was convicted
of arranging more than $100,000 in illegal donations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has undercut another Watergate innovation: partial public
financing for presidential candidates who agree to limit spending.
Bush rejected the taxpayers' money and instead set new marks for
campaign cash by raising more than $80 million through April 6.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the courts have rejected efforts to regulate
spending, citing First Amendment protections for free speech.
Judges have thrown out restrictions on advertisements that don't
use such phrases as ''vote for'' or ''vote against,'' leading to a
deluge of campaign commercials designed to influence elections
without overtly saying so.
</P>
<P>
   These court decisions allow groups and individuals to spend
millions of dollars on ads going after candidates by name without
disclosing who's paying for them. A group known as Republicans for
Clean Air spent $2.5 million on ads against McCain; the money came
from Sam and Charles Wyly, two Texas brothers who have supported
Bush for years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Voters have less knowledge of the financial interests
supporting candidates and we have a much greater threat of
corruption because it's becoming more and more difficult to trace
the millions of dollars flowing through the system, which all too
often come from interests with business before the federal
government,'' said Anthony Corrado, a professor of government at
Colby College in Waterville, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Others maintain the system works fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Money is the way you communicate to the public about issues,''
said James Bopp Jr., general counsel for the James Madison Center
for Free Speech, who has successfully sued the FEC over its efforts
to regulate campaign spending. ''When we have a situation in
America where the general public is woefully ignorant about who the
name of the congressman or senator who represents them is, the
party they belong to and the issues that they stand for, we need
more communication and more discussion of issues, not less.''
</P>
<P>
   While lawmakers responded to Watergate with new rules, they
haven't passed legislation in response to the 1996 abuses. Some
lawmakers are still pressing for an investigation of Gore's actions
despite Attorney General Janet Reno's refusal to name an
independent counsel to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ''By and large, big money goes to the benefit of incumbents,''
said Donald Simon, former executive vice president of Common Cause,
an advocacy group. ''The very people who have to change the system
to fix these problems are the ones with the least incentive to do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, FEC Chairman Darryl Wold said: ''The disclosure
provisions are intact and the limitations on contributions are
intact. Those are at the heart of the campaign finance
regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   While playing under the current rules, Gore and Bush call for
changing the game. Gore, who admits to mistakes during the 1996
re-election campaign, proposed an endowment with tax-deductible
contributions to fund congressional elections, free air time for
candidates and a ban on soft money. Bush opposed most of Gore's
plan but agreed on banning soft money from unions and corporations
only, not individuals.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapped Colombia Athlete Released  </HEADLINE>
By JAIRO ANCHIQUE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia's second-largest rebel group
released a national soccer star on Sunday, two days after
kidnapping him and violating a holiday truce.
</P>
<P>
   The National Liberation Army, or ELN, freed Andres Estrada in a
remote area of the turbulent western state of Antioquia. Estrada is
a former national team member and currently plays for the Atletica
National club in Medellin.
</P>
<P>
   At least 12 people were kidnapped over the weekend by a far
smaller leftist rebel faction when a landslide blocked holiday
traffic on a rural highway. Guerrillas from the 500-strong People's
Liberation Army, or EPL, snatched their victims from buses and
private cars 130 miles northeast of Bogota, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada, 32, said the rebels who seized him Friday night as he
was on a rural highway in his luxury car subsequently told him they
had erred in kidnapping him, but couldn't release him ''until they
received orders from their superiors.''
</P>
<P>
   The soccer star missed a Sunday afternoon game that didn't start
until his fellow athletes knew he was safe at home. They had all
signed a joint letter demanding Estrada's release.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada is the third major Colombian sports figure to be
kidnapped this year. Cycling stars Oliverio Rincon and Luis Herrera
were also seized, though Herrera was only kept one day.
</P>
<P>
   Leftist rebels often mount roadblocks on isolated country roads,
especially on holiday weekends, and charge ransoms for the release
of their victims. Colombia has the world's highest kidnapping rate.
</P>
<P>
   The ELN had declared an Easter week truce, giving holiday
travelers and commercial vehicles a break from harassment on the
nation's highways.
</P>
<P>
   The group, with an estimated 5,000 fighters, wants peace talks
with the government and last week freed eight hostages it had
seized in the April 12, 1999 kidnapping of an entire airline
flight. It still holds five people from that abduction.
</P>
<P>
   Though ELN commanders have said they would seek ransom for some
of the hostages, President Andres Pastrana was quoted in an
interview Sunday with the El Pais newspaper of Cali that no ransom
was paid in last week's releases.

<P>
   HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- Freddy Garcia's goal in the 80th minute gave
Guatemala a 1-1 tie with favored Mexico on Sunday, advancing the
Guatemalans in the CONCACAF Olympic soccer qualifying tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala (1-0-1) will play in Friday night's semifinals against
an opponent to be determined. Mexico (0-0-1) and Panama (0-1) will
play Tuesday night to determine the other team from the three-team
group to advance.
</P>
<P>
   Honduras defeated Canada 2-0 in the first game of the
double-header. The United States, which defeated Honduras 3-0 on
Friday night, will play Canada on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   With his team trailing 1-0, Garcia uncorked a shot toward the
left post off a header from teammate Dwight Pezzalossi. Airborne
Mexican keeper Adrian Zermeno was unable to catch the ball, opting
to smack it into the air. Zermeno then tumbled into the cage and
the ball landed on top of him for the tying goal.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico took the lead late in the 43rd minute when a blistering
strike by Hector Altamirano from just off the left touchline was
headed in by Joaquin Beltran. Guatemala keeper Luis Pedro Molina
had a chance at Beltran's redirected shot, but the ball went
through his outstretched hands and landed in the right corner of
the net.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A day after being reunited with his father, Elian Gonzalez
spent Easter Sunday secluded with his Cuban family. But criticism mounted over
the government's tactics, with congressional Republicans calling the actions
akin to those of the communist regime that the Cuban boy had fled with his
mother. ''We were forced into the action we took by the intransigence of that
family,'' Eric Holder, deputy attorney general, said of the boy's Miami
relatives. ''We probably should have taken a decisive action sooner.'' Elian's
Miami relatives, flying to Washington soon after Elian was taken from their

American university subject to collective bargaining with graduate assistants.
About two dozen public universities already are. What comes of the vote at NYU

<HEADLINE> S.E. Asian Dominos Fell Other Way  </HEADLINE>
By MORT ROSENBLUM, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The rueful joke, back in 1975, was that
if Vietnamese troops invaded Thailand, the only thing to stop them
from knifing on through Malaysia to Singapore was Bangkok's
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Today, troops could skirt the thriving Thai capital on freeway
overpasses. But Vietnam is now peaceable and, in any case, so
impoverished it would have trouble scraping up cash for the
tollbooths.
</P>
<P>
   The domino theory, a multifaceted scenario of communist
contagion that brought America into the Vietnam War, has slipped
into history. Cambodia fell, and so did Laos. Elsewhere, though,
Southeast Asia boomed with free-market capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Even in distant hindsight, those who lived through the era of
teetering dominoes are divided over how serious the threat was.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Americans had not fought in Vietnam, Thailand would be
communist today,'' pronounced Maj. Gen. Bunchon Chawansin, former
head of military intelligence against guerrillas in southern
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   ''No way,'' countered Thongchai Suwanvihok, who as Comrade
Chaung was Bunchon's enemy in a bloody jungle war. ''We would never
have won. The Thai society and culture would not support
communism.''
</P>
<P>
   But the two men, now like-minded fishing buddies who were
interviewed together, agree on an overriding lesson of the Vietnam
War: dominoes and nations have little in common.
</P>
<P>
   Thongchai, site manager for a private power company, says Thai
communist leaders rejected Vietnam's offer of 50,000 men, with
heavy armor, to seize eastern Thailand between the Cambodian border
and Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   ''We opposed American imperialism, but we did not want to give
up our country to anyone else, either,'' he said. ''Rural farmers
only supported us because they wanted a better life, and we
promised that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunchon said the government realized that in 1980. ''Instead of
trying to kill every communist we could, like in Vietnam, we tried
reconciliation,'' he said. ''We developed rural areas. They stopped
fighting. It was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the
Philippines pooled resources to create the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations. If the thrust was economic, defense issues were
close behind.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning, Singapore Trade Minister George Yeo once
remarked, ASEAN's members came together as ''frightened, huddled
sheep.'' Before long, the metaphor shifted to economic tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam ended up joining ASEAN in 1995, followed by Laos and
Cambodia, but its role in a region dominated by business is a pale
shadow of the military and political power it once had.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, I could use the word minuscule,'' Ian Buchanan, a
Southeast Asian specialist with Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton in Singapore,
replied when asked to assess Vietnam's impact on regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam has enormous potential. At 76 million, its population is
second only to Indonesia in a country of rich earth and varied
beauty. Despite lingering suspicion of outsiders, tourism is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   By most measures, however, neighbors that once feared its shadow
now tower above it. Vietnam's annual gross domestic product ranges
above $300 a person. Thailand's is 10 times higher. Singapore's is
100 times as much.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vietnam needs a next step of bold reform, but they don't seem
to have the political courage to do it,'' said Daljit Singh, of the
Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, as its Soviet ally liberalized with perestroika,
Vietnam's ''doi moi'' -- renovation -- policies opened up the
economy. Until 1995, its gross domestic product grew more than 8
percent a year. Foreigners flocked in to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Singh said the early promise evaporated because of red tape,
corruption and discord within the government over how much freedom
to allow in the tightly controlled state economy. Asia's 1997
economic crisis added a crippling blow.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first ASEAN partners thought they would benefit from the
ability to organize, focus and work hard that Vietnam showed in the
war,'' Singh said. ''These days, we've forgotten all about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vietnamese officials say they are moving with care, having seen
from the region's 1997 crisis that unbridled capitalism could knock
them over like a domino from the other direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to prepare ourselves adequately before we expose
ourselves to (capital) flows,'' said Le Linh Lan of Vietnam's
Institute for International Relations. ''Opening up our economy in
a rush to catch up may be counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   With neither convertible currency nor a stock market, Vietnam
suffered most as others began to recover, she said, ''and the
impact was quite severe and enduring.''
</P>
<P>
   However Vietnam develops, analysts agree, that fearful domino
theory seems today like a curious footnote of overestimation.
</P>
<P>
   In an ''eyes only'' document dated July 15, 1975, declassified
only this year, the U.S. National Security Council advised
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger that Vietnam was a much greater
threat than its neighbors realized.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most nations in Asia apparently believe that revolutionary
warfare of the Vietnamese model, like a car accident, is something
that happens to other people,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia, Singapore and Australia, it added, sought more U.S.
protection after the war in what the memo called ''the reverse
domino effect, as countries that felt safe now begin to wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   From the perspective of 25 years, the former Thai enemies can
joke about the threat without that touch of rue.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems very funny now,'' Gen. Bunchon said. ''We laugh about
where we each were when the other was shooting, about trying to
trick each other. I learned that if you treat everyone fairly,
guerrillas cannot win.''
</P>
<P>
   Thongchai expressed relief he opposed Vietnam's proposal that
its soldiers come to help the Communist Party of Thailand. ''I am
very happy that we did not make that big mistake.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Reported Dead At African Cup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Thousands of fans forced their way into an
overcrowded soccer
stadium in Liberia on Sunday, leaving at least three people
reported dead and others injured.
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the World Cup qualifier in Monrovia, some fans tried to
storm the field but were brutally beaten back by troops. Many in
the crowd had been waiting in the hot sun for more than eight
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross officials said three people carried out of the stadium
on stretchers died of suffocation. Several other people were
seriously injured. It was unclear whether there were any arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimated 50,000 to 60,000 people attended the game,
almost double the stadium's capacity of 33,000. Liberia and Chad
played to a 0-0 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the fans, including women carrying babies on their
backs, entered the stadium by scaling barbed wire fences and
overpowering police and soldiers who tried to drive back the
onrushing crowd with batons.
</P>
<P>
   President Charles Taylor warned government officials earlier in
the week that their jobs could be on the line if they did not
attend.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia played all its European-based players, including former
world player of the year George Weah. It advanced to the next round
on the strength of its 1-0 victory in Chad this month.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Kenyan fans rioted, causing a World Cup qualifier
to be abandoned with several minutes left. Fans in the crowd of
20,000 threw bottles and stones on the field and ripped out seats
in the stadium in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   At Hershey, Pa., the U.S. team profitted even though it didn't
play in CONCACAF's final Olympic qualifying tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Hesler Phillips and Luis Ramirez each scored as Honduras posted
a 2-0 victory over Canada. Honduras (1-1) kept alive its hopes of
advancing to the semifinals of the six-team tournament, which will
send its top two finishers to the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Canada (0-1), making its first appearance in the preliminary
round, will play the United States on Tuesday night. The Americans
blanked Honduras 3-0 on Friday and are in excellent shape for
advancing to the final four. The Canadians must defeat the U.S.
team and score at least three goals to move into Friday night's
semifinal round.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Americans and Hondurans move on.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in World Cup qualifying play Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   Cameroon defeated a young and inexperienced Somalia 3-0 despite
missing a penalty kick in the second half. Somalia, fielding a team
in a Cup qualifier for the first time in nearly two decades, rarely
challenged the African champions, who dominated offensively and
advanced on a 6-0 aggregate.
</P>
<P>
   Antigua ousted Bermuda in a CONCACAF series, getting a late
tying goal by Derrick Edwards for a 1-1 tie. The teams' previous
match ended 0-0, so Antigua advanced because of more away goals.
That goal came off a cross by substitute Gayson Gregory in the 74th
minute that Edwards put in.
</P>
<P>
   At Luanda, Angola, Alves Antonio ''Paulao'' scored twice as
Angola trounced Swaziland 7-1 and advanced to the second round.
</P>
<P>
   At Kinshasha, Congo, the Congolese routed Djibouti 9-1 on a hat
trick by Yamweni Ngidi and moved on to the second round. Two
Djibouti players were ejected early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt beat Mauritius 4-2 a week after it scored a 2-0 victory in
the first game in Cairo. The second game was played in Alexandria
at Mauritius' request, which feared a recurrence of
religious-inspired violence at home.
</P>
<P>
   At Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso defeated Ethiopia 3-0 and moved to
the next round of World Cup qualifying play. Ethiopia won the first
game 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   At Accra, Ghana a perennial African soccer powerhouse, missed
numerous chances in a 3-2 victory over Tanzania, one of Africa's
traditionally weaker teams. The match featured defensive mistakes
by both sides. Ghana, which also beat Tanzania 1-0 in the first
game, advanced to the next round on a 4-2 aggregate.
</P>
<P>
   The Republic of Congo beat Equatorial Guinea 2-1 and moved on.
The hosts also won at Equatorial Guinea 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Host Mali beat Libya 3-1, but the Libyans advanced on a 4-3
aggregate after winning 3-0 in Tripoli earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Togo beat visiting Guinea-Bissau 3-0 to win their series. The
teams had tied 0-0 in Guinea-Bissau.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe moved on with a 3-1 victory over Central African
Republic that followed a 1-0 win in the first game.
</P>
<P>
   Senegal edged Benin 1-0 for a 2-1 aggregrate to advance.
</P>
<P>
   Guinea won 3-0 against Uganda, giving it a 7-4 overall edge.
</P>
<P>
   Ivory Coast's 2-0 win against Rwanda advanced it after the teams
tied 2-2 in their opener.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan lost 2-1 to Mozambique, but advanced because the teams
tied 2-2 in aggregate goals and the Sudanese scored more away
goals.

<HEADLINE> Caffe Latte Wins At Santa Barbara  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- In a duel between two of the country's
top turf females, Caffe Latte overtook Happyanunoit entering the
stretch to win the Santa Anita Park's $250,000 Santa Barbara
Handicap on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Caffe Latte beat Happyanunoit by three-quarters of a length and
finished in 2:00 2/5.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very special filly,'' Corey Nakatani said after what
was his fourth of six riding victories on the card.
</P>
<P>
   Happyanunoit, the 19-10 favorite who hadn't raced since
November, dug in determinedly with Brice Blanc while finishing four
lengths ahead of Country Garden in third.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish Fern, Aistoire Sainte and Marie de Bayeux completed the
order of finish.
</P>
<P>
   Caffe Latte, the 2-1 second choice who carried 116 pounds, paid
$6.40, $3 and $2.60. Happyanunoit, the 121-pound high weight, paid
$3.20 and $2.60. Country Garden, ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye, paid
$4 to show.
</P>
<P>
   By winning six races with eight mounts during the 10-race
program, Nakatani became the eighth jockey in Santa Anita Park's
63-year history to win six races on a single card. The last was
Martin Pedroza in 1992.

Saturday was his third homer and sixth hit in 12 career pinch-hit
at-bats. ''I just love to be up there with the game on the line,''
Trammell said. ''You shouldn't be here if you don't.'' ... On
Sunday, the Devil Rays wrapped up the first of three straight
three-game homestands. Their next three road trips are each
six-games long. ... Tampa Bay is 2-10 when scoring less than seven
runs.
Twins-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA-- Minnesota has won only four season series from Texas
over the past 12 years -- in 1988, 1993, 1996 and 1998. ... Entering
Sunday's game, Twins relievers were 2-0 with a 3.06 ERA and two

14 games for Oklahoma.
Indians-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Because of four consecutive rainouts, Pedro Martinez

10-day layoff. ... 3B John Valentin is expected to fly to Florida
on Monday to begin rehabbing his left knee tendinitis.

see a hand specialist this week after preliminary X-rays revealed a
hairline crack in a bone in his right wrist. Easley was hit by a
pitch in Oakland on April 5 but the injury went undiagnosed until
now. Easley was placed on the 15-day DL retroactive to April 10
after suffering a strained ribcage muscle April 9 at Baltimore. ...
LHP Sean Runyan threw a perfect 1 1-3 innings of work in a rehab

to head to Triple-A Toledo this week for more work.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO-- By going 5-for-5 Saturday, Chris Singleton became the
only player in baseball with three five-hit games over the past two
seasons. Singleton has raised his average more than 100 points in
the last five games. ... Newcomer Herbert Perry is ready. ''I
brought my boxing gloves,'' the ex-Devil Ray joked, referring to
Saturday's Chicago-Detroit brawl. Perry, who was activated Sunday
after being acquired of waivers from Tampa Bay, will be used at
third base against lefties, and will also see action at first base
and in the outfield. ''I just want to be in the big leagues,''
Perry said. ''Whatever job they have for me, I'll do.'' ... The
White Sox have been in first place for eight days, after having
spent a total of seven days on top of the AL Central over the
previous five seasons.

history, June 27-July 6, 1986. ... In eight appearances against
Seattle, Jeff Suppan is 0-3 with 8.74 ERA. ... Going back to 1999,
the Royals have lost 14 of 16 on the road (2-11 in 2000).
Athletics-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: RHP Tim Hudson, who left his last start after getting
hit by a line drive on Thursday, threw in the bullpen before
Sunday's game and was pronounced healthy. He will take his regular
turn in the rotation on Tuesday against the Blue Jays. ... 2B Randy
Velarde went through a complete workout on Sunday and is getting
closer to beginning a rehab assignment. ''Any time you do enough
work to wear yourself out, it's a good sign,'' said A's trainer
Larry Davis. ... OF Matt Stairs is 1-for-18 against lefties.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: RHP Jose Mercedes said he used a different windup to
help him beat the A's on Friday and improve to 2-0 on the season.
''I was coming over the top, but I stayed down all day,'' said
Mercedes. ''I'm a sinkerball pitcher, but all my outs were
flyballs. That kind of surprised me.'' ... The Orioles have won
five of their first six series to date, including the Oakland
series. They didn't win their first series last year until April
30-May 2. ... Baltimore is 2-3 in one-run games.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:

him to within two RBIs of Henry Rodriguez's team record of 27 RBIs
in April, set in 1996. Guerrero, who has 99 career homers, is also
two homers short of Rodriguez's record of nine homers in April
1996. Guerrero leads the NL with 10 multi-hit games. Guerrero was
also walked intentionally -- with first base occupied -- during a
four-run rally in the Expos' 6-3 win Sunday. It was his major
league-leading sixth intentional walk. ... Tony Armas threw 80

</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: The home runs by Brant Brown and Mike Lowell in the
first inning marked the first time the Marlins hit two homers in
one inning since Sept. 11, 1999 against Cincinnati. ... Injuries to
Luis Castillo and Dave Berg sped up the major league debut of Pablo
Ozuna, whom the Marlins acquired in December 1998 from the
Cardinals. Ozuna went 1-for-4. ... LF Cliff Floyd missed his second
consecutive game with a nagging groin pull. He hasn't started in
seven of the first 20 games. ... The Marlins extended their best
start ever to 12-8.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: 1B Rico Brogna was back in the starting lineup
after missing his first start of the season Saturday after being
hit in the knee with a pitch on Friday. ... The Phillies, who won
11 of 13 against Florida last season, are 1-2 this season. They're
1-5 on this seven-game road trip. ... The Phillies entered the game
with the major league lead in fielding percentage (four errors in
16 games) before committing two Sunday.
Dodgers-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Los Angeles is 1,000-973 against the Reds. The only
team with more wins over Cincinnati is San Francisco, which has
1,086. ... Kevin Brown, who broke the small finger on his right
hand while trying to bunt on April 8, threw without problem again
Sunday and is scheduled to return against Atlanta on Tuesday. ...
The eight-run sixth inning was the Dodgers' biggest since they
scored nine runs against Chicago on April 24, 1998. It was the
biggest inning allowed by the Reds since they gave up eight to the
Giants on July 24, 1998. ... Orel Hershiser, who tied the major
league record by hitting four Houston Astros on Wednesday, relieved
in the eighth and hit Aaron Boone.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: The Reds wore their all-red caps at home for the
first time since 1992 and went back to red sleeves for the first
time since the second game of the season.
Pirates-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Pittsburgh, which lost its eighth straight game at
Turner Field, is 1-11 in its last 12 games in Atlanta. ... Brian
Giles went 2-for-2 to boost his average to .400 (12-for-30) in his
last eight games. ... Walks are killing the Pirates, who issued
eight on Sunday. They dropped to 0-9 when walking four or more.
Starter Francisco Cordova and reliever Brad Clontz each issued a
pass that led to an Atlanta run. ... By losing 5-3 on Sunday, the
Pirates guaranteed themselves of a non-winning April for the fifth
straight year. In the homestand that begins Tuesday, Pittsburgh
would need six straight wins just to get to 12-12.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Braves manager Bobby Cox lists John Burkett as
day-to-day. The No. 5 starter, who left Saturday's game after three
innings with pain in his right shoulder, could land on the DL.
Regardless, Bruce Chen, who got the win after relieving Burkett,
will take his place in the rotation. ... Rudy Seanez, who pitched a
scoreless inning of relief for Greenville Saturday night, will make
another appearance Monday night for the Braves' Double-A affiliate.
''It feels a little sore,'' Seanez said Sunday. ''But you expect
that when you haven't been pitching much.'' The right-hander, who's
been nursing a strained muscle in his right side, hopes to be
activated from the DL during the upcoming home series against the
Dodgers. ... Steve Avery was roughed up for his second straight
outing in his minor-league rehabilitation stint. The left-hander
gave up six hits, four runs and three walks in 3 1-3 innings in a
start for Greenville on Saturday. Only one of the runs was earned.
Padres-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON-- Houston right fielder Moises Alou returned to the
starting lineup Sunday. Alou had been limited to pinch hit duty the
last six days because of a strained right calf.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO-- Tony Gwynn needs one double to tie Ted Williams for
27th place on baseball's career list. Gwynn has 524 career doubles.
... The Astros are 2-6 at home. Only San Francisco (0-5) has a
worse home record. ... The Padres' staff leads the majors with 142
strikeouts.
Rockies-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Both of RHP Rick Croushore' victories have come
against the Cardinals, who traded him last offseason in the Darryl
Kile deal. ... Jose Jimenez, who went in the same trade, has saved
both of the Rockies' victories in the series. ... Just like last
season, Larry Walker is off to a slow home run start. He hit his
first on Sunday in Game 20. Last year he didn't hit his first until
April 28, when he belted three, and finished with 37. ... Jeff
Cirillo is 9-for-17 with four RBIs against Benes for his career.
Cirillo entered the day leading the NL with nine doubles, but he
has none the last six games. ... Neifi Perez is in a 2-for-18 slump
and Mike Lansing is 0-for-15. ... LHP Greg Myers has retired 11 of
the 14 lefties he's faced and has allowed only one of 11 inherited
runners to score.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Outfielder Jim Edmonds, among the league leaders in
batting (.386) and six other offensive categories, missed his
second straight start with a strained left foot although he entered
as a defensive substitute in center in the seventh. Edmonds started
the first 17 games for the Cardinals. ... Ray Lankford, 1-for-11
against left-handers and batting .167 overall, got the day off. ...
Manager Tony La Russa blamed Busch Stadium public address announcer
John Ulett for prematurely announcing LHP Rick Ankiel as a pinch
hitter in the sixth inning. La Russa was going to use Ankiel if
there was a runner on first, but he switched to Edmonds when J.D.
Drew walked and advanced on a groundout. ... Ankiel is 5-for-9 at
the plate with a home run, triple and two RBIs.
Giants-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   GIANTS: San Francisco swept the Diamondbacks for the first time.
The teams combined for a Bank One Ballpark-record 15 homers during
the three-game set. ... Jeff Kent finished the three-game series
6-for-15 with two homers and eight RBIs. He also robbed Tony Womack
of a hit in the sixth inning when he leaped high to catch a line
drive. ... Four of Bill Mueller's 20 career homers have come at
Arizona. ... Joe Nathan allowed seven of the first eight men he
faced to reach base safely. ... Barry Bonds, one of a handful of
Giants battling the flu, said he's feeling a little stronger but
still is extremely congested. Bonds went 3-for-5, including his
453rd career homer in the eighth inning. Bonds passed Carl
Yastrzemski for 21st place. ... San Francisco has scored 43 runs in
its 11 losses and 61 in its seven wins.
</P>
<P>
   DIAMONDBACKS: Luis Gonzalez hit his second homer in as many days
into the pool area in right-center field. His fifth-inning homer
was the 16th to land in the pool, the eighth by a Diamondback
hitter. ... Lenny Harris' eighth-inning pinch single was the 116th
pinch-hit of his career, tying him with Jerry Lynch for fifth place
on the career list. ... Arizona plays 18 of its next 24 games on
the road. ... Diamondback pitchers walked 17 batters in Arizona's
18 games, then walked 18 in the last three against San Francisco.
... C Damian Miller, who strained his hamstring running out a
double Saturday, was available for emergency duty but did not play.
Manager Buck Showalter said he will be re-evaluated Monday. ...
Brian Anderson's four-inning relief stint matched the team record
set April 5 by Mike Morgan.

Elian Case Quiets Down
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez spent a secluded Easter with his father,
insulated from the clatter in two nation's capitals and a shaken Miami over the
armed raid used to take him away. But criticism mounted over the government's
tactics, with congressional Republicans calling the actions akin to those of the
communist regime that the Cuban boy had fled with his mother. After a day of raw
anger, street fires and violence in the Little Havana neighborhood, Miami fell
quiet for Easter celebration but was still a city under tight police control
after more than 350 arrests Saturday.

   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Capping a grueling Holy Week schedule, a weary-sounding
Pope John Paul II offered Easter wishes for peace in 61 languages and called on
the world Sunday to end racism and xenophobia. So many Holy Year pilgrims,
tourists and Romans turned out for the pope's late-morning Mass in St. Peter's
Square that by the time he delivered his Easter message at noon, the crowd,
numbering close to 150,000, was spilling over into the boulevard leading to the
Vatican. John Paul expressed hope that the sense of life associated with Easter
may ''overturn the hardness of our hearts'' and ''impel individuals and states
to full respect'' for human rights.

'Glass Ceiling' Shows Some Cracks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The ''glass ceiling'' that historically has been a barrier
to advancement by women in the workplace is showing some cracks, a gradual
change backed up by Census Bureau figures. According to the latest government
estimates, there were more than 7.1 million women in full-time executive,
administrative, or managerial positions in 1998 -- a 29 percent jump from 1993.
Approximately 9.4 million men had the same kinds of significant jobs, but that
represented only a 19 percent increase. Analysts point to a variety of factors,
including the growing number of single mothers and two income households in the
workforce. Females also make up 51 percent of the overall population.

Elian, Cuban Family Face Custody Case

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now that Juan Miguel has regained custody of his son, he
faces what could be a drawn out legal battle to return home to Cuba with his
family. He has said he'll remain in the United States at least until an appeal
in his custody battle with the Miami relatives is settled. The case, legal
experts say, could end in a matter of weeks or continue for months. The court
has indicated that Elian has the right to seek asylum because immigration law

<HEADLINE> Quiet Descends on Elian Case  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez spent a secluded Easter with
his father and got a visit from the Easter Bunny, insulated from
the clatter in two nation's capitals and a shaken Miami over the
armed raid used to take him away. ''Finally,'' said his father's
lawyer, ''some silence around them.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old castaway played on the grass with his father,
gave a playful kiss to a tall white Easter bunny with a black nose,
and ate a lunch of black beans and rice.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had a very quiet day, a family day,'' lawyer Greg Craig
told The Associated Press. He represents Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
Elian's father.
</P>
<P>
   But away from their hideaway at Andrews Air Force Base in
suburban Maryland, criticism mounted over the government's tactics,
with congressional Republicans calling the actions akin to those of
the communist regime that the Cuban boy had fled with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a frightening event, that American citizens now can
expect that the executive branch on their own can decide on whether
to raid a home,'' said House Republican whip Tom DeLay of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A top Justice official said the only regret was that authorities
waited as long as they did.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were forced into the action we took by the intransigence of
that family,'' Eric Holder, deputy attorney general, said of the
boy's Miami relatives. ''We probably should have taken a decisive
action sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   After a day of raw anger, street fires and violence in the
Little Havana neighborhood, Miami fell quiet for Easter celebration
but was still a city under tight police control after more than 350
arrests Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will celebrate in tears,'' said Sergio Perez, a Miami
neighbor of the relatives who kept Elian for five months until
federal agents brandishing guns burst through their door before
dawn Saturday and seized him.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, near the heavily secured air base where the
6-year-old boy is staying, DeLay said he was ''sickened'' by the
use of force and said hearings were certain on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no court order that gave them permission to raid the
private home of American citizen,'' DeLay said, appearing on NBC's
''Meet the Press. ''This has been a bungled mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Countering assertions that it acted without legal authority, the
Justice Department late Sunday released a copy of a search warrant
obtained Friday night by the Immigration and Naturalization Service
from a U.S. magistrate in Miami authorizing agents to search the
home for Elian and ''to seize same.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee,
attacked the government's course earlier and Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott of Mississippi said he thought ''this could only happen
in Castro's Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat, said President Clinton
personally assured him three weeks ago that Elian would not be
taken in the night.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was an insensitivity, a crudeness to this, to do this
one of the most deeply religious periods of the year, to do it at a
time when families are reflecting on spiritual values, to do it in
the middle of the night,'' he said of the raid, which happened at
about 5 a.m. He spoke on ABC's ''This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder, on NBC, said a previous court ruling upholding the
government's general actions in the case, combined with an order
from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, sufficed as legal
grounds for moving in.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged concern by the administration that Elian may be
used by Cuban President Fidel Castro as a political trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is Fidel Castro's history,'' Holder said. ''He has shown
that he has always tried to use whatever he can for his own
political advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Castro called Saturday ''a day of glory for our people''
as some 400,000 Cubans summoned to a rally celebrated the
father-and-son reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Praising U.S. officials for their forceful action, the communist
leader declared a ''truce'' in his enduring Cold War-era struggle
with the United States, but added: ''Tomorrow the battle
continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian, for once, was out of earshot of all the fuss. He joined
his father, stepmother and baby half-brother Saturday in private
quarters at Andrews Air Force Base, the home base of Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had a very quiet day, a family day -- I don't think they
had many visitors,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the family went for a walk and got a visit from the
base's Easter Bunny.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives, flying to Washington soon after Elian
was taken from their arms, were rebuffed again Sunday in trying to
get on to the base to see him.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued at sea on Thanksgiving Day after a boat
carrying him and other Cuban refugees sank. His mother drowned.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not leave until I see this boy,'' Marisleysis Gonzalez,
the 21-year-old cousin who acted as Elian's surrogate mother, told
a Washington news conference. ''I know he's not OK.''
</P>
<P>
   With Juan Miguel Gonzalez holed up with his two sons and second
wife at Andrews, the only accounts of Elian's state of mind since
the reunion came from Craig and another supporter, Rev. Joan Brown
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   She said on ''This Week'' that Elian acted like a ''very happy,
mischievous, normal little boy'' when she visited Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Craig released two photos after the reunion, showing Elian
smiling in his father's embrace and playing with his baby brother.
The Miami relatives contended the images were manipulated, but
Craig countered that they were taken with a ''disposable, Kodak
camera'' given to him by the father.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration agents who accompanied Elian on the flight to
Andrews reported that when they left him with his father at the
base, he was ''happily playing on the floor,'' said Maria Cardona,
speaking for the INS.
</P>
<P>
   Wailing as he was carried off in Miami, Elian was calm on the
plane, she said, napping on an immigration officer's lap, coloring
and, at one point, crying a bit.
</P>
<P>
   In a national CNN-Gallup poll taken after the seizure, six in 10
respondents supported the government's actions to reunite Elian
with his father. They were split on whether the government used too
much force.
</P>
<P>
   That question percolated through Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was sickened,'' DeLay said. ''There was no danger to Elian.
... There was no danger to anyone. In fact, the government put
these people in danger by invading their house.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, whose decision to use force was
supported by President Clinton, said authorities had heard guns
might be in the house or in the hands of crowds keeping vigil
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Holder said the government had no firm evidence about guns but
given the possibility, ''we had to make sure that our people were
protected.''

<HEADLINE> Rockies Accuse Cardinals Catcher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The Colorado Rockies believe St. Louis' Eli
Marrero tried to get hit by a pitch Sunday in the Cardinals' 6-3
rain-shortened victory.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Scott Karl accused Marrero of leaning his elbow into a
pitch in the second inning, loading the bases. One batter later,
Placido Polanco hit a grand slam to cap a five-run inning.
</P>
<P>
   Karl said the pitch was a strike, and that Marrero leaned over
the plate. He and manager Buddy Bell complained about the situation
for several minutes with home plate umpire Angel Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he wants to get hit so badly, I'm sure somebody else out
there will accommodate him,'' Karl said. ''As long as major league
baseball lets people stand up there guarded like tanks, what can
you do about it?''
</P>
<P>
   Replays appeared to confirm that Marrero stuck out his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ''He leaned right into the pitch because he's got an elbow pad
on,'' Karl said. ''They'll let anyone wear whatever they want up
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell was upset about the situation, but said it was not an
excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not what beat us,'' Bell said. ''We really didn't play
very well.''

<HEADLINE> Little Havana Calm As Easter Dawns  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA IRVINE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Easter -- one of the holiest of days in Little
Havana and the rest of the Christian world -- found Marta Rodriguez
praying for a little boy she knows only from a distance but, like
many, calls by his first name.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pobre Elian,'' the 71-year-old Cuban immigrant said after Mass
at St. John Bosco Church, where Elian's great-uncle and cousins
have attended services.
</P>
<P>
   ''He should never have been treated this way,'' she said in a
grandmotherly tone. ''My heart is broken.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was for many Miami Cubans beginning life without the
6-year-old boy reunited with his father in Washington after a swift
and stunning pre-dawn Saturday raid by federal agents. For the
first time in five months, Elian was gone from Miami. And it was
mostly quiet in Little Havana for the first time in days.
</P>
<P>
   But scattered demonstrations erupted around Miami late Sunday
night, with hundreds of cars moving slowly along normally busy
thoroughfares and small groups of pedestrians waving flags and
shouting.
</P>
<P>
   Police made a handful of arrests, but there was little violence.
There were similar demonstrations Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, at the home of the boy's Miami relatives, a
place once so overrun with journalists and protesters that it was
dubbed Camp Elian, bystanders dressed in their Sunday best stopped
briefly to look.
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief skirmish Sunday afternoon when two young women
carried signs supporting Attorney Janet Reno's order to raid.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not here! Not here!'' the protesters yelled, trying to hit one
of the women and pulling her hair as she was escorted away by
security guards. By evening, as many as 200 people gathered to
sing, pray and leave red roses, carnations and other flowers woven
in a chain-link fence surrounding the Gonzalez home.
</P>
<P>
   An emotional Mass was said for Elian Gonzalez at Our Lady of
Charity Catholic Church Sunday evening. More than 400 people packed
the small sanctuary, and many more stood outside.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation waved Cuban flags, cheered and wept. At one
point, the people sang the Cuban national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Gonzalez family sat in the front row, including
Elian's great-aunt, Caridad Gonzalez, who was met with a standing
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the church, Robert Vento, 45, said he hopes the boy's
father will decide to stay in the United States with his son.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he defects ... Castro will be unmasked,'' Vento said.
</P>
<P>
   Ileana Dopico, 45, a secretary who was among the protestors
outside the house when the federal authorities moved in Saturday,
was in tears, but remained optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think God will work out a miracle so the child won't go back
to Cuba,'' Dopico said.
</P>
<P>
   During protests that lasted into Sunday morning, police clad in
riot gear arrested more than 350 people and cleared away thousands
more demonstrators from Little Havana. Protesters set more than 200
fires, burning mostly tires and trash, but there were few serious
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Michael the Archangel Church, another Roman Catholic
church in Little Havana, parishioners held radios to their ears as
Spanish-language radio buzzed with talk of a strike Tuesday. If the
idea catches on -- there are 800,000 Cuban Americans in the area --
it could shut down much of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Postal worker Nick Perez Caurel listened to the announcements
from his home a few miles away and vowed to take part.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't missed a day of work in six years. But in my own
peaceful way, I will show my feelings,'' said Perez Caurel, whose
parents sent him from Cuba to the United States in 1962 when he was
12 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The former Boy Scout and Vietnam veteran also showed his
displeasure Saturday when he came home from work, pulled an
American flag from his hallway closet and hung it upside down in
his front yard with a black scarf pinned to it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've always hung that flag proudly -- on the Fourth of July,
days like that,'' said his wife, Rosi Perez Caurel.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Rosi -- also a Cuban immigrant -- says she's not feeling
particularly American.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a saying in Spanish, 'Te mastican pero no te tragan'
-- they chew you, but they don't swallow,'' she said. ''That's how
it feels.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood residents have photocopied and circulated an
Associated Press photograph of an armed federal agent with his hand
extended to grab a crying Elian. Some versions replaced the faces
of federal agents with those of Attorney General Janet Reno, who
gave the go-ahead for the raid, and Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   A poster-sized reproduction attached to the Gonzalez family's
front door included this label: ''Federal Child Abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in Little Havana was upset.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm in agreement that his father is his only family,'' said
77-year-old Virginia Escalona, pausing before adding, ''Well, his
grandmothers, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As she stood outside on her apartment stairwell, her husband
came out to try to quiet his wife, one of a few people becoming
braver about a view that had been all but squelched in the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are you crazy?'' Escalona's husband said. ''You don't have to
talk to the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   She shooed him away.
</P>
<P>
   ''I say what I like,'' she said. ''This is America, no?''

<HEADLINE> Pacers 88, Bucks 85  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE HERMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- One way or another, Jalen Rose was going to
get the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Rose scored 26 points, getting three straight 3-pointers midway
through the fourth quarter, a clinching free throw with 17 seconds
left and a rebound at the buzzer as the Indiana Pacers beat the
Milwaukee Bucks 88-85 in a playoff opener Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 in the best-of-five Eastern Conference series will be at
Conseco Fieldhouse on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rose had 12 points in the first quarter but went cold until his
late run. The Bucks, meanwhile, survived their own poor shooting,
came back from a 13-point deficit and tied the game 62-62 after
three quarters on six straight points by Sam Cassell.
</P>
<P>
   Two baskets by Tim Thomas -- one a 3-pointer -- at the start of
the final period gave Milwaukee its biggest lead at 67-62 before
Rose took over.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks' final edge was 69-68, before Rose's first 3-pointer
with 6:28 to go, and Indiana went up 79-71 after two more
3-pointers by Rose. Ray Allen, who had 22 of his 26 points in the
second half, pulled the Bucks within 85-84 with a minute to go.
Travis Best then scored for the Pacers and Cassell hit one of two
free throws with 43 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller, who had 21 points for the Pacers, then missed a
shot, but the ball went out of bounds to Indiana with 18 seconds
left. Rose was immediately fouled as the ball was inbounded and
went 1-of-2 from the line for the final point.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee got off two more shots, but Thomas missed a 3-pointer
and Rose grabbed the ball at the buzzer to save the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell finished with 18 points for Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The top-seeded Pacers, who swept the Bucks 3-0 in a first-round
series last year, seemed to take control with Rose's early scoring.
Indiana was 1-for-12 at the start of the second quarter but still
led by 12 points late in the period after a rebound basket by Dale
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Robinson, who missed his first six shots, hit two straight
for the Bucks, and late in the period two free throws by Robinson
and a basket by Cassell cut Indiana's lead to 40-34.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackson's 3-pointer pushed the Pacers back on top by nine,
then Davis, who had 12 of his 17 rebounds in the first half, put
back a miss by Jackson with a half-second left for a 45-34 lead at
the break.
</P>
<P>
   Allen had 12 points in the third quarter to get Milwaukee back
in the game.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Allen, who played only six minutes in the Bucks' final
regular-season game because of a knee sprain, played 34 minutes
against the Pacers but was only 9-for-22 on field goals. ...
Milwaukee's 105-84 victory at Indiana last month was the Pacers'
worst of five losses at home this season. ... Milwaukee's last
playoff victory was May 1, 1990, against Chicago. The Pacers have
reached the Eastern Conference finals the past two years. ... The
Bucks' Darvin Ham, who played for the Pacers briefly three years
ago, was 4-for-5 in the third quarter but received a technical foul
for hanging on the rim after a dunk. Cassell and Indiana's Austin
Croshere received technicals after a shoving match early in the
final period. ... Robinson, Allen and Cassell were 7-for-29 in the
first half.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 3, Orioles 2, 11 innings  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Olmedo Saenz's RBI single in the 11th
inning gave the Oakland Athletics a 3-2 victory over Baltimore on
Sunday night, snapping the Orioles' six-game winning streak and
again highlighting their bullpen problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Grieve opened the 11th with a liner into the right-center
gap that center fielder Brady Anderson, who had just entered the
game, misplayed into a triple. The ball bounced in front of
Anderson, who overran the ball and then fell trying to retrieve it.
</P>
<P>
   After two intentional walks, pinch-hitter Saenz slammed a pitch
from Tim Worrell (2-2) over the center-field fence on one bounce.
The winning pitcher was Jason Isringhausen (1-0), who entered in
the top of the 11th and got Albert Belle to ground into an
inning-ending double play with runners on first and third.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland tied it in the ninth when Ramon Hernandez led off with a
homer off Mike Trombley, who had just entered the game. It was the
fifth blown save of the season by Orioles' relievers.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth-inning collapse by the Baltimore bullpen allowed the
A's to avoid being swept in the series and spoiled a solid
performance by starter Jason Johnson, who was reclaiming his spot
in the Orioles' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who pitched so poorly in spring training he was
relegated to the minors, allowed one run on four hits in six
innings. Recalled from the minors Friday and making his first major
league appearance of the season, Johnson struck out three and
walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson escaped two jams, retiring Eric Chavez on a ball to the
wall in right with two on in the fourth and getting a shoestring
catch by left-fielder B.J. Surhoff with runners on second and third
in the fifth. Replays showed Surhoff might have trapped the ball,
hit by Matt Stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff and Cal Ripken had RBI singles in the fourth for the
Orioles. Jason Giambi had a sacrifice fly in the fifth for the A's.
</P>
<P>
   The hit was No. 3,007 for Ripken, tying him with Al Kaline for
22nd place on the career list. It was his 1,584th RBI, tying him
with Rogers Hornsby and Harmon Killebrew for 26th place. His
Orioles teammate, Harold Baines, is 25th with 1,588 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mulder, making his second major league start, allowed two
runs on four hits in seven innings for the Athletics. He walked two
and struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   The A's broke a three-game losing streak, and snapped a
five-game home losing streak. Oakland was within three outs of its
sixth consecutive loss at home, which would have been its worst
such streak in one season since dropping eight straight in May
1994.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ripken has an eight-game hitting streak. ... Johnson went
0-3 with a 6.95 ERA in six spring training games. He was 1-0 with a
0.90 ERA for Triple-A Rochester. ... The A's are 4-8 at home this
season. ... With his sacrifice fly, Giambi tied Baltimore's Mike
Bordick for the AL lead with 24 RBIs. ... Grieve's triple was his
first since May 15, 1998, at Detroit.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A former anti-Castro guerrilla leader praised the
U.S. government Sunday for forcibly taking custody of Elian
Gonzalez, saying ''the showdown in Little Havana had to come to an
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Eloy Guiterrez-Menoyo, who spent 22 years in Cuban prisons for
trying to start an uprising against Fidel Castro, issued a
statement saying Elian's Miami relatives ''misread the patience of
the government'' and ''acted with defiance'' in refusing to reunite
the boy with his father.
</P>
<P>
   As leader of the group Cambio Cubano, or Cuban Change,
Guiterrez-Menoyo has often clashed with Miami's other Cuban exile
groups suspicious of his support for working with the Cuban
government toward democratic reform. His views on the Elian drama
put him at similar odds.
</P>
<P>
   He said the group recognizes the ''paternal rights'' of Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. But he urged the Cuban government
against using the boy as ''a flag in an attempt to hide behind it
the enormous failings of the Cuban system.''
</P>

News photographer charged with throwing rocks at police
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Four news photographers were among the hundreds
arrested in the Little Havana protests, including a woman working
for the Los Angeles Times who police said threw several rocks at
police and then photographed the action.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Cole, 38, was arrested on felony charges of throwing
deadly missiles, Miami Police Det. Delrish Moss said Sunday. She
faces up to five years if convicted, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cole ''was seen throwing two or three rocks and then picked up
her camera and proceeded to take photographs,'' Moss said.
</P>
<P>
   Times Editor Michael Parks said Sunday that the newspaper is
seeking immediate dismissal of the charge against Cole.
</P>
<P>
   ''Carolyn Cole was covering the protests in Miami as a news
photographer, not participating in them, and her photographs
published in the Times make that clear,'' Parks said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''In arresting Cole and detaining her for more than eight hours
before releasing her on bond, Miami police prevented her from
continuing to report a story of national importance,'' Parks said.
''We see this as an abridgment of the people's right to know under
the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   A photo by Cole appeared on the front page of Sunday's paper,
and several ran inside. The paper also reported her arrest at the
end of a longer article.
</P>
<P>
   Moss said three other photographers were arrested on charges
that ranged from misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct to a
felony charge of battery on a police officer. He did not have
confirmation of the news outlets they worked for.

Sen. Bob Graham criticizes federal raid
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Law enforcement officials should have known they
did not need machine guns and tear gas to seize Elian Gonzalez from
the home of his Miami relatives, Sen. Bob Graham said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If law enforcement's intelligence didn't know what was
happening in that little house right in back of us for five months,
didn't have an absolute 100 percent understanding ... there was a
mammoth failure of law enforcement intelligence,'' said Graham, a
Miami Democrat and former two-term Florida governor.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, standing in front of the home of the 6-year-old boy's
Miami relatives in Little Havana, told ABC's ''This Week'' that
President Clinton assured him three weeks ago that federal agents
would not attempt to seize Elian at night.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have defended the use of force, saying they did
not know whether there were weapons in the home or what kind of
resistance agents might encounter. Armed agents snatched the boy
before dawn and whisked him to a reunion with his father.
</P>

Miami Herald prints front-page editorial
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Herald took to its front page to call for
an independent investigation into the need for an armed raid to
take custody of Elian Gonzalez. The paper also urged the community
to stay calm.
</P>
<P>
   The unsigned opinion piece, appearing at the bottom of a front
page devoted entirely to the drama, said Elian's Miami relatives
appeared to be close to a deal to reunite the boy with his father
when Attorney General Janet Reno ordered the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ''Miami needs a complete accounting of the events preceding the
raid,'' the editorial said. ''The scenes of overwhelming force from
yesterday at dawn shock the conscience. A separate question is
whether the raid was even necessary or was a betrayal of those who
were on the verge of achieving a peaceful transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said a ''full and independent investigation of
this matter is warranted.''

<HEADLINE> Nolan Ryan Has Double-Bypass Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Nolan Ryan was recovering Sunday night
after undergoing emergency double-bypass surgery at the Heart
Hospital of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today was a total shock to our family,'' said Ryan's son,
Reid, president of the Texas League's Round Rock Express, which the
Hall of Fame pitcher owns.
</P>
<P>
   ''My dad has been in perfect health. The doctor told us that he
has the heart of a 30-year-old. The fact is that his heart just
wasn't getting blood. We feel confident that he is going to recover
fully and that he can continue to lead the active lifestyle he is
accustomed to living.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, 53, experienced shortness of breath and chest pains around
9 a.m. after taking a morning walk with his wife, Ruth, at the Dell
Diamond in Round Rock. Ryan was there to watch a game between the
Express and Midland.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Ryan drove her husband to the Round Rock Medical Center,
where doctors performed an electrocardiogram and blood tests.
</P>
<P>
   He was then taken to the Heart Hospital of Austin, where an
angiogram showed a substantial blockage of the left main coronary
artery, according to J.J. Gottsch, Express director of media and
public relations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Felger performed a double vessel bypass there at 3 p.m.
Gottsch said the surgery was a success.
</P>
<P>
   Reid Ryan said the family has a history of heart-related
problems and that doctors said heredity played a large part in his
father's condition.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Rangers spokesman John Blake said Ryan is expected to be
hospitalized for about a week.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, a first-ballot Hall of Famer in January 1999, holds or
shares 48 major league, American League and National League
records. He is baseball's career leader in strikeouts with 5,714
and no-hitters with seven.
</P>
<P>
   He had 324 victories in a record 27 seasons with the New York
Mets, California Angels, Houston Astros and Rangers. He retired in
1993.
