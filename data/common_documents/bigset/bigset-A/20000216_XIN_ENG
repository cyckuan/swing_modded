<HEADLINE> India, Japan to Intensify Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- India and Japan have decided
to intensify their multifaceted dialogue in economic, commercial,
political and military areas, a foreign office spokesman told the
media here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of day-long India-Japan foreign office
consultations here today, the two sides also agreed to consult
each other and cooperate on issues relating to international
terrorism, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides expressed understanding of respective security
concerns" and agreed that bilateral relations should not be "
hostage to any single issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which had come out strongly against India's nuclear
tests in May 1998, has held that New Delhi should sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
On CTBT, the spokesman said, India reiterated its position and
told Tokyo that effort to build widest possible consensus was
continuing.
</P>
<P>
Both sides adopted a 'forward-looking approach' and "agreed
that Indo-Japanese relations should not be hostage to any single
issue," he added.
</P>
<P>
The consultations were held between Indian Foreign Secretary
Lalit Mansingh and Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Royuzo Kato.
The last round of talks between the two countries was held in
Tokyo in January last year.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the country, Kato called on External
Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh and Principal Secretary to Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had an in-depth exchange of views regarding
bilateral, regional and global issues of mutual interest as well
as reforms of the United Nations and proposed expansion of the
Security Council and agreed to cooperate in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Indo-Japanese relations were important
in the context of peace and stability in Asia and it was their
common desire to work towards a cooperative partnership.
</P>
<P>
Jaswant Singh visited Japan shortly after the Vajpayee
government came to power last October, during which the two sides
reportedly agreed to reactivate defense links, take steps to
bolster economic cooperation and be in close touch on U.N. reforms.
</P>
<P>
The visit was followed by a trip by Indian Defense Minister
George Fernandes to Tokyo last month when the two sides decided to
initiate a security dialogue.

<HEADLINE> Indian Scientists Claim To Find Nerve Impulses Linked with Thyroid Hormone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A team of researchers at the Animal Physiology Department of
Rose Institute in Calcutta, 1,460 kilometers southeast of here,
found that these messages, called nerve impulses, are directly
linked with the level of thyroid hormone in the body.
</P>
<P>
The role of thyroid hormone in the normal functioning of adult
mammalian brain had long been a mystery, Prof. Arun Ray, who led
the team working on rat brains in the laboratory, said in an
article published in journals Neuro Psychopharmacology and Neuro
Report.
</P>
<P>
"Although scientists have not been able to pinpoint the action
of thyroid hormone in the adult brain, we do know that it has a
role in growth and development of the central nervous system
during the early years," Ray told PTI.
</P>
<P>
The scientists said that their discovery could revolutionize
treatment of diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Launches Defense Policy Statement For 21st  Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government has
launched the country's defense policy for the 21st century with
focus on building capability to defend Singapore's sovereignty and
interests and respond to new security challenges.
</P>
<P>
The policy is outlined in the book "Defending Singapore in the
21st Century" or DS21 which was launched by Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister for Defense Tony Tan Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the launch ceremony, Tan explained a range of new
security challenges facing his country and the three main thrusts
behind Singapore's defense policies in the new century and its
rationale.
</P>
<P>
Tan pointed out that technology has brought about great changes
in a amazing speed but conflict and war continue to plague
countries and communities all over the world, adding this is an
area where there has been no progress and no change.
</P>
<P>
Tan said with the world becoming ever more interdependent and
with more political and economic uncertainty in the region,
Singapore's security challenges have become more diverse.
</P>
<P>
The first thrust is to maintain a strong SAF (Singapore Armed
Forces) capable of defending the country's sovereignty and
territorial integrity and dealing with a wide range of security
challenges as an integrated fighting force with high operational
readiness.
</P>
<P>
Tan said this is the bedrock of Singapore's security,
fundamental to meet any military threats and defend Singapore's
sovereignty and interests.
</P>
<P>
The second thrust is to formulate closer coordination among the
Ministry of Defense (MINDEF) and the SAF as well as other
government agencies under the concept of Total Defense to deal
with non-conventional threats such as cyberattacks, which Tan said
Singapore would face in the 21st century because it is in a
turbulent region and integrated into the world economy.
</P>
<P>
The third is for Singapore to pursue defense diplomacy with
friendly countries through bilateral and multilateral cooperation
and dialogue. Tan said this was necessary to maintain peace and
stability in the region and internationally.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that all Singaporeans have a role to play in
the defense of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Tan said "the security of Singapore can not rest upon the
efforts of MINDEF and the SAF. We need the involvement of all
Singaporeans, in National Service and in active participation in
Total Defense activities. Then we can be sure that we will have a
secure World Class home in the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Through its efforts in the past 35 years, Singapore has
transformed the SAF from a two-battalion army and two-boat navy to
a modern and well-equipped armed forces, capable of quickly
mobilizing 350,000 servicemen if it is needed, Tan noted.

<HEADLINE> Young Singaporeans Encouraged to Be More Entrepreneurial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Be more entrepreneurial and
to take risks, but no rush into internet-related companies, this
is the advice offered by Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew to
young Singaporeans.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the point on Tuesday night while addressing on the
topic of "How will Singapore compete in a global economy" to
nearly one thousand university students at the sixth Ministerial
Forum.
</P>
<P>
The Forum is a regular event organized to allow undergraduates
to meet and interact with cabinet ministers with an aim to raise
the young's awareness of current world issues and how they affect
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Lee said with internet technologies and waves
of globalization changing people's lives and the way they do
business, countries like Japan and Germany are restructuring
themselves to adapt to the changes.
</P>
<P>
Singapore must also re-think and restructure itself in order to
succeed in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the quick money made by "dot.com companies has led to a
frenzy to join the gold rush" in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, small investors have also risked their billions of
dollars to buy internet-related stocks, he said.
</P>
<P>
"While I encourage our young to be more entrepreneurial and to
take risks, do not simple rush into dot.com companies," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in certain areas young Singaporeans are encouraged
to go into competition with the best talents in the world such as
those in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
"One practical way is to study what has been successful in the
United States, adapt and use it in Singapore and the region," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also said Singapore must be a cosmopolitan center able to
attract foreign talents in order to succeed in the future.
</P>
<P>
During an question-and-answer session after delivering the
speech, Lee elaborated on cultural difference between Singaporeans
and the more enterprising Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged Singaporeans to take more risks and to start
business of their own instead of simply settling down in a company
which is owned by others.

<HEADLINE> Reformers Envision Big Win in Iran's Parliamentary Poll by Rong Song </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Two days before Iranian voters
go to polls for a new parliament on Friday, Iranian reformers on
Wednesday foresaw an overwhelming victory for supporters of the
moderate President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
"The May 23 Front will be able to win two thirds of the Majlis
seats in the polling and the result is clear now," Ali Reza Nouri,
a top reformist runner, told Xinhua at a student rally on the
campus of Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
Nouri is the younger brother of the prominent reformist cleric
Abdullah Nouri, a former interior minister who was jailed last year
on the charge of involving in "anti-Islamic" propaganda and
insulting Islamic sanctities in his pro-reform newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Nouri, a political neophyte who has gained almost overnight
recognition only after his brother's imprisonment, was widely
supported by reformist and centralist groups, including the pro-
Khatami Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF) and the Party of
Constructive Executives of Iran (PCEI) which strongly supports
former President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
He was warmly welcomed by students who waved pictures of
President Khatami and Abdullah Nouri and chanted slogans calling
for the release of Abdullah Nouri and Mohsen Kadivar, another
reformist cleric jailed for insulting the Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
"I will be among the five top winners," he said in an interview
with Xinhua at the rally. But he did not believe he could win the
post of future Majlis (parliament) speaker as some political groups
proposed.
</P>
<P>
"In my view, it is quite possible that Mr.Rafsanjani will be
elected the speaker, despite he would not be the top winner," he
said, "but it depends on the result of the polling."
</P>
<P>
Nouri dismissed suggestions by some reformers that Rafsanjani
will hinder the reformist process of President Khatami, stressing
that Rafsanjani's role will not be determining in the next Majlis,
which he believed is to be dominated by reformers.
</P>
<P>
However, some 3,000 students at the rally showed strong
opposition to Rafsanjani's re-entry to the expanded 290-seat Majlis
and chanted "with Hashemi(Rafsanjani), political development
impossible."
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, who had served Majlis speaker for almost 10 years
before being elected president in 1989, has announced to run for a
seat in the legislative body.
</P>
<P>
But major reformist groups refused to put his name in their
lists and considered him as a hurdle for Khatami's reforms because
of his close relations with the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The move has caused a split between the reformers and the
centralists, particularly the IIPF and the PCEI, which formed a
moderate coalition in the 1997 presidential elections to support
President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
However, Jamileh Kadivar, a prominent woman runner, told Xinhua
that Rafsanjani's presence in the Majlis will benefit President
Khatami, because Rafsanjani has always defended the government.
</P>
<P>
"But in my personal view, it would be better for Mr. Rafsanjani
to remain in the State Expediency Council (SEC) rather to run for
the Majlis," said Kadivar, sister of Mohsen Kadivar and wife of the
moderate Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah
Mohajerani, a close ally to Rafsanjani and Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani currently chairs the SEC, which arbitrates between
the state organs and offers suggestions to the supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Expressing regret over the differences between the IIPF and the
PCEI over Rafsanjani's candidacy, Kadivar said that the row will
not serve the interest of Khatami's government, in which both the
two parties play important role.
</P>
<P>
Maisam Saeedi, a student hopeful, said he does not care about
whether Rafsanjani will enter the Majlis or not, because Rafsanjani
will not have a decisive role in the parliament which will be
controlled by reformers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the feverish students, Hadi Khamenei, brother of the
supreme leader, also stated that reformers will definitely win the
Friday sensitive elections.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the need for political reforms in the country,
saying that without political reforms, the country can not make any
cultural and economic changes.
</P>
<P>
"Political developments (reforms) mean that the people should
know their rights and defend their rights and political
developments can remove the hurdles on the way of cultural and
economic developments," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia, NATO Agree to Revive Ties (Adds more details) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian acting President
Vladimir Putin and NATO Secretary General George Robertson agreed
to resume contacts between Russia and the Atlantic Alliance at
their meeting in the Kremlin on Wednesday, said Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that "Russia and NATO regard each other as
strategic partners and their partnership would promote European
and global security," Ivanov told a joint news conference with the
NATO chief after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Both sides intend to faithfully abide by the United Nations
Charter and the provisions of the Founding Act on Russian-NATO
relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia and NATO have resolved to contribute to the building of
a stable and indivisible Europe," he said. This was the theme of
the Putin-Robertson meeting, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The developments in Yugoslavia significantly undermined trust
between Russia and NATO. It is important to restore that trust and
define fields where cooperation is essential," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to compile a joint plan of
cooperation and teamwork, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held "in a frank and constructive atmosphere,"
he said. "We want the decisions made to promote European and
international stability. If we continue to move along these lines,
the relations between Russia and NATO will develop successfully,"
Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Asked when the relations between Russia and NATO will be fully
restored, he said "this depends on the willingness of the parties
to abide by the provisions of the Founding Act. Russia is prepared
to do this."
</P>
<P>
Robertson said, in his turn, he regarded the Kremlin meeting as
a turning point and a new page in NATO-Russia relations.
Everything is being done in the interests of all European nations
and the Euro-Atlantic region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said he is pleased that Putin has confirmed the
importance of the joint effort. Robertson said the frost in Russia-
NATO relations will retreat step by step and is confident that the
dialogue between the two sides may be intensified.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said the most pressing steps to be taken to revive
relations between Russia and NATO are a comparison of the
strategic concepts and military doctrines of the sides and the
consideration of a range of questions that include problems of the
ABM (Anti- Ballistic Missile) treaty and arms limitations.
</P>
<P>
The meetings may help clarify many complex matters and promote
the speedy revival of mutual confidence, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief stated that much time was spent on the
discussion of Chechnya at his Moscow meetings. He reaffirmed the
viewpoint that he understands why Russia is acting in Chechnya but
disagrees with the way it is being done.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ivanov said that Russian shows grave concern over
the 1999 developments in the Balkans and the NATO summit in
Washington, which approved Poland, Hungary and the Czech republic
as new alliance members and finalized new NATO military doctrine
and national security concept.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in the Balkans, Robertson said that despite
the differences of opinion with NATO, Russia played an outstanding
role in establishing peace in the region on the basis of the U.N.
resolutions He said that cooperation between the armed forces of
Russia and NATO is an important factor in strengthening peace on
the planet.
</P>
<P>
Robertson arrived in Moscow Tuesday evening for a working visit,
the first meeting of a high-ranking NATO official with Russian
leaders after the Kremlin froze ties with the alliance last year.
</P>
<P>
Angered by NATO's eastward enlargement, Moscow froze relations
last March when the Atlantic alliance began an 11-week bombing
campaign against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Greece: Oil Embargo on Yugoslavia Should End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday called for the
lifting of oil embargo on Yugoslavia, saying that the sanctions
against the country were counter-productive.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Greek Alternate Foreign Minister
Christos Rokofyllos, who said that the oil embargo imposed by the
European Union (EU) and the United States on Belgrade should be
lifted, or at least oil should be provided for schools and
hospitals in the country.
</P>
<P>
The sanction on Yugoslavia was unfair and counter-productive
because they were harming the Yugoslav people, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Greece was making efforts to achieve a decrease in
tensions over the Yugoslav issue and enable an exit from the
existing deadlock regarding the issue of shipping on the Danube.
</P>
<P>
The minister also noted that the Greek government desired
democratization in Yugoslavia, enabling Belgrade to participate in
European developments.
</P>
<P>
During the recent Balkan summit in Bucharest, Romania, Greek
Prime Minister Costas Simitis also stressed the need for the
lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the policy of isolating Yugoslavia would
bear little.

<HEADLINE> Russia, NATO Vow Joint Efforts to Build Stable Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia and NATO vowed Wednesday
to join their forces to "build a stable Europe" in a joint
statement released at the end of the NATO Secretary General George
Robertson's one-day working visit in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the Atlantic alliance are "fully determined to
contribute to building a stable and undivided Europe, whole and
free, to the benefit of all its peoples," says the statement.
</P>
<P>
The NATO and Russia "affirm that they will observe in good
faith their obligations under international law, including the
United Nations Charter, provisions and principles contained in the
Helsinki Final Act and the OSCE (Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe) Charter for European Security," it
stressed.
</P>
<P>
NATO and Russia "will promote the strengthening of security in
the Euro-Atlantic area on the basis of the Founding Act and
through cooperation within the Permanent Joint Council," the
statement reads.
</P>
<P>
"NATO and Russia will work to intensify their dialogue in the
Permanent Joint Council. They agreed to pursue a vigorous dialogue
on a wide range of security issues that will enable the two sides
to address the challenges ahead and to make their mutual
cooperation a cornerstone of European security," it concludes.
</P>
<P>
The document came after talks here between Robertson and Russia
's acting President Vladimir Putin, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief wound up his ice-breaking trip to Russia
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Angered by NATO's eastward enlargement, Moscow froze relations
with the West last March when the Atlantic alliance launched an 11-
week bombing campaign against Yugoslavia. Their ties got worse
because of the alliance's severe scolding of Russia's anti-
terrorist military operation in its breakaway province of Chechnya,
which began to rage in last September.

Malawi," Simao said, citing the Nacala Corridor, which comprises
railways and sea ports in northern Mozambique, as a good example.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that some businessmen through private trade
export goods to Malawi. Tobacco accounts for the most part of
these informal exports.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Presidential Race Kicks Off in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Presidential race has kicked off
in Turkey as the main opposition parties on Tuesday proposed an
amendment to the Constitution, seeking a direct election of next
president by the people.
</P>
<P>
The joint proposal, presented by the Islamist Virtue Party and
the conservative True Path Party, came only 91 days before the end
of the seven-year tenure of current President Suleyman Demirel on
May 16 and is expected to be processed by the parliament later this
month.
</P>
<P>
Under the current constitution which forbids a second term of
president, the parliament will elect the successor of Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Allowing Demirel a second term in office has been a major topic
of the country since April 1999 when the parliamentary elections
brought about Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit-led coalition,
comprising the Democratic Left Party of Ecevit, the Nationalist
Action Party of Devlet Bahceli and the Motherland Party of Mesut
Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, hoping to avoid divisive squabbles among his coalition
partners over who should succeed Demirel, has been campaigning to
convince his partners as well as the opposition parties to amend
the constitution to allow Demirel a second term in office.
</P>
<P>
Following months of debate on the issue, three leaders of the
ruling coalition agreed to allow a second term but to reduce
presidential term to five years from the current seven. This accord
was interpreted as "five more years with Demirel in office" after
his term expires in May.
</P>
<P>
An amendment to the constitution requires a two-thirds favor of
the parliament's 550 members, that is 367 votes, but the combined
strength of the ruling coalition in the parliament barely reaches
350, including the independent deputies who support it.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Virtue Party and True Path Party, believing that
they have gained upper hand since the government needs their
support to push its own version of a constitutional amendment
through the parliament, put forward their own proposal of the
direct election of president by the people.
</P>
<P>
But the government only agreed to have a vote on the
opposition's motion and has not pledged any support further than
that. The move to get the president elected by the public is
unlikely to clear the Turkish legislation.
</P>
<P>
So far, when the governing coalition will submit its
constitutional amendment proposal is still uncertain. On April 16,
the Turkish Parliament will start to debate if election procedures
to determine the next president are changed or not.
</P>
<P>
Demirel, whose eyes fixed on the debate on the presidency and
the upcoming parliamentary moves to amend the Constitution, has
postponed his trips abroad, including an important visit to the
United States scheduled this month.

<HEADLINE> German President Apologizes for Holocaust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting German President
Johannes Rau Wednesday apologized for the Holocaust during which
six million Jews perished, saying it is important to teach the
younger generation about the past.
</P>
<P>
"I am asking for forgiveness for what Germans have done, for
myself and my generation, for the sake of our children and
grandchildren, whose future I would like to see alongside the
children of Israel, "Rau said while addressing the Israeli Knesset,
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Rau, a long-time friend of Israel and elected president last
May, said he bowed his head in humility before those murdered in
the Holocaust during World War II.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to teach the younger generation about the
past, and referred to the building of a Holocaust memorial in
Berlin, a cornerstone of which was laid last month, as a sign of a
sincere attempt by the German people to remember.
</P>
<P>
Several Knesset members boycotted the speech in protest against
the use of German by Rau, saying the language reminded them of the
suffering of millions of Jews during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
Rau arrived here Tuesday for a four-day visit to Israel and the
Palestinian self-rule areas. He said the main theme of his Israeli
visit is reconciliation between German and Israeli youths.
</P>
<P>
A German youth soccer team traveling with him will play the
Israeli team Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Since exchanging ambassadors in 1965, the bilateral relations
between Israel and Germany have developed rapidly. Israel regards
Germany as one of its close friends in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Israel praised Germany, as part of the European Union, for its
outspoken criticism of the inclusion of the far-right Freedom Party
in the Austrian coalition earlier this month. Israel has recalled
its ambassador to Vienna to protest against the form of the
Austrian government.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Reject Only Minor Changes in Israeli Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Senior Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat on Wednesday rejected a latest Israeli offer of making
minor changes to an overdue Israeli troop pullback from the West
Bank, saying Arab suburb of Jerusalem must be included.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, who is in charge of the interim talks with Israel, said
that there was no point in making any changes to the Israeli
withdrawal maps unless Abu Dis and other Arab villages in suburb
Jerusalem were included.
</P>
<P>
He urged Israel to fulfil its obligations as agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to the remarks made Tuesday by Danny Yatom,
security adviser to Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Yatom said the
Israeli government would consider making minor changes in the
proposed handover, but he ruled out the inclusion of areas
surrounding Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement signed last year,
Israel was supposed to have transferred 6.1 percent of the West
Bank to the Palestinians on January 20. But a dispute over the
areas involved has delayed the implementation.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have demanded that Abu Dis and other Arab
villages close to Jerusalem to be included in this stage of troop
withdrawal, but the withdrawal maps approved by Israel early this
month excluded these areas.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians halted the peace talks with Israel on both
interim and permanent issues 12 days ago, after a summit between
Barak and Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat
failed to iron out the difference.
</P>
<P>
They accused Israel of attempting to dictate the peace process,
saying this approach violated signed agreements and harm the
partnership spirit needed for progress in the talks.
</P>
<P>
The two sides missed a key deadline Sunday, when they were
supposed to have reached a framework agreement on final status
issues such as final borders, the fate of Jerusalem, Jewish
settlements and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Israel's chief negotiator Oded Eran was quoted by Israel Radio
as saying Tuesday that the talks between the two sides would resume
next week during the visit of U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross.

MOSCOW, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian oil product export
revenues in 1999 reached 4.75 billion U.S. dollars, up by 27

<HEADLINE> Canada Warned of Weed Invasion in Great Lakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Great Lakes is facing a
dangerous invasion by hydrilla, "the perfect aquatic weed" which
may one day reach cottage country lakes in Ontario, the National
Post newspaper of Canada reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a scientific paper presented to a conference on invasive
species Tuesday, the newspaper said hydrilla is a fast-growing,
adaptable plant, plaguing waterways from Florida to Pennsylvania
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
It has advanced within a few hundred kilometers of the lower
Great Lakes. Some scientists say there's virtually nothing that
can stop it.
</P>
<P>
"While we can't forecast when this weed might invade the
southern Great Lakes we can reliably predict that hydrilla would
do quite well once introduced," U.S. biologist John Madsen told
the conference.
</P>
<P>
Hydrilla, a native of southeast Asia, grows up to 2.5
centimeters a day. The plant has long stems and branches that form
a thick canopy on water surface, preventing sunlight from reaching
other species underneath.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Prison Population Hits 2 Million Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. prison population
reached the two million mark Tuesday, according to a study by the
Justice Policy Institute, a Washington research organization.
</P>
<P>
"This is the most punishing decade on record," Vincent
Schiraldi, the institute's executive director, was quoted by the
International Herald Tribune as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the nation's inmate population at the start of the
1990s was one million, an unprecedented number at the time.
</P>
<P>
To double the number in just 10 years is to equal the growth of
the prison population during the previous 90 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. Justice Department's most recent data,
461 of every 100,000 Americans are now serving a prison sentence
of at least one year.
</P>
<P>
There are 483 inmates per 100,000 residents in California, home
to the largest prison population. In Louisiana, the rate is 736,
highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
Drug offenders account for the greatest percentage of new
inmates while blacks are nearly seven times more likely to be
incarcerated than whites, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Although blacks comprise about 13 percent of the U.S.
population, they make up 50 percent of the state and federal
prison population.

<HEADLINE> UK Unemployment Continues to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the broader ILO(
International Labor Organization) measure, which includes people
looking for work but not claiming benefit, fell by 4,000 to 1,718,
000 between October and December.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly believed that the fall in unemployment has been
helped by the booming service sector of the economy, which has
soaked up jobs that are still being lost in manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
Economists expect if the current rate of growth of employment
continues, the number of unemployed will be well below 1 million
by the time of the next general election.
</P>
<P>
The figures from the ONS also show average earnings grew by 5.5
percent in the year to December, a rise of 0.6 percent on the
previous month. This increase is believed to be swollen by
Millennium overtime and bonus payments.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the figures, Employment Minister Tessa Jowell
said there were clearly special factors distorting the earnings
figures but nevertheless urged wage restraint across the economy.

<HEADLINE> Russia-NATO Contacts to Be Resumed: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian acting President
Vladimir Putin and NATO Secretary General George Robertson agreed
to resume contacts between Russia and the Atlantic Alliance at
their meeting in the Kremlin on Wednesday, said Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that "Russia and NATO regard each other as
strategic partners and their partnership would promote European
and global security," Ivanov told the press after the meeting.
Both sides intend to faithfully abide by the United Nations
Charter and the provisions of the Founding Act on Russian-NATO
relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia and NATO have resolved to contribute to the building of
a stable and indivisible Europe," he said. This was the theme of
the Putin-Robertson meeting, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The developments in Yugoslavia significantly undermined trust
between Russia and NATO. It is important to restore that trust and
define fields where cooperation is essential," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to compile a joint plan of
cooperation and teamwork, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held "in a frank and constructive atmosphere,"
he said. "We want the decisions made to promote European and
international stability. If we continue to move along these lines,
the relations between Russia and NATO will develop successfully,"
Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Asked when the relations between Russia and NATO will be fully
restored, he said "this depends on the willingness of the parties
to abide by the provisions of the Founding Act. Russia is prepared
to do this."
</P>
<P>
Robertson arrived in Moscow Tuesday evening for a working visit,
the first meeting of a high-ranking NATO official with Russian
leaders after the Kremlin froze ties with the alliance last year.
</P>
<P>
Angered by NATO's eastward enlargement, Moscow froze relations
last March when the Atlantic alliance began an 11-week bombing
campaign against Yugoslavia.

Reppas said at a press briefing that Greece was in harmony with
the movements of other armed forces, however, the country was not
dealing with such a issue of sending extra forces to the region.
</P>
<P>
The participation, transfer or any other movement of Greek
forces in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo were issues for the

The spokesman said that no part of the Greek contingent in
Kosovo at the moment were being moved to the region in the
province which has seen rising violence between NATO-led
peacekeepers, ethnic Albanians and Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a strong Greek battalion of 1,200 men serving with
the NATO-led Kosovo peacekeeping force has been stationed in
Urosevac and Kosovo Polje in the province's south. It was reported
that a Greek company of 120 men would now be redeployed to the

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Early End to All Violent Acts in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- China Wednesday
condemned all acts of violence in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo
and called for effective measures by the U.N. Mission in Kosovo (
UNMIK) and the international peace-keepers (KFOR) to prevent the
situation from further worsening in the area of Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Wang Yingfan, the Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, took the floor at the
private Security Council meeting on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation voiced serious concerns at the large-
scale conflicts in Mitrovica, some 32 kilometers from the
provincial capital of Pristina, and called for an early end to all
acts of violence, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the current situation, efforts must be taken to improve
the security situation in Kosovo in order to prevent the image of
the United Nations from being tarnished, he said. "The key to this
question is the full and effective implementation of the Security
Council resolution 1244."
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted on June 10 last year, demands full
respect for the Yugoslav sovereignty and territorial integrity,
the full disarmament and disbanding of rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA), and the guarantee of security and safety for all
ethnic groups in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation held that both UNMIK and KFOR should
take effective steps at once in order to prevent the conflict in
Mitrovica from further escalation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We maintain that the Kosovo problem can only be solved within
the framework of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," he said. "
Any action by any party which could possibly lead to the
independence of Kosovo runs counter to the Security Council
resolution 1244, and will not be conducive to the maintenance of
long-term security and stability in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Ambassador Wang to attend the
Security Council meeting following his arrival in New York last
week to succeed Qin Huasun, who have returned home after his terms
of office completed.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Advises Rwanda on Rural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has recommended
the Rwandan government to enhance soil conservation, rehabilitate
the feeder road network and promote small-scale enterprise in
order to facilitate agricultural and rural development.
</P>
<P>
The bank offered the advice in its International Development
Association Country Assistance-Strategy progress report for
1999/2001, the Rwanda News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, improving soil conservation and
management and farming methods through research, extension and
information services is essential for raising productivity.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank noted that "the rehabilitation of the main and
feeder roads as well as local market infrastructure would reduce
isolation and link up rural communities to larger markets and
services."
</P>
<P>
Deterioration of the main and rural feeder road network in the
land- locked country has isolated rural communities from the
services that would improve their productivity and provide markets
for their goods.
</P>
<P>
These roads deteriorated in the past four years due to
excessive loads by relief-related vehicles and severe damage by
flooding, more recently associated with the El Nino weather
pattern.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank also advises that the promotion of private and
small- scale enterprises in the rural areas would create non-farm
employment to generate cash incomes and to take pressure off the
land.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government has an agricultural development strategy
that aims at making the agricultural sector market-oriented,
raising and increasing productivity, and boosting rural incomes.
</P>
<P>
In pursuance of those aims, government has already launched a
5.6- million-U.S. dollar project to liberalize marketing and
distribution of agricultural inputs, and to strengthen produce
markets and traders.

</P>
<P>
Addressing a Joint Ministerial Commission session, Iranian
Agriculture Minister Issa Kalantari said that Iran would beef up
its ties with Ethiopia particularly in the fields of horticulture,
agro-industries, scientific agricultural researches and mining.
</P>
<P>
Kalantari said the exchange of information and experiences as
well as the designing and implementation of various soil and water
projects were crucial to realize mutual cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran is also looking forward to expanding its trade and
investment cooperation with Ethiopia, he said, noting that given
the two countries' strong will to enhance bilateral relations,
Iran and Ethiopia will be able to strengthen their bonds of
collaboration to a far more fruitful level.
</P>

both countries since 1992, and the signing of a memorandum of
understanding on economic, scientific and technical cooperation in

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) in Angola are aiming to expand their
operation to some areas previously inaccessible, the official news
agency Angop reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As the government troops have an upper hand in the central
highlands fighting fields, international assistance can be sent to
the displaced persons living in some central villages and towns,
which demands reinforced and efficient work of the NGOs.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the NGOs and the United Nations Humanitarian
 Assistance Coordination Unit (UCAH), and Angolan government
officials are discussing how to deal with the deteriorating
humanitarian situation in these areas.
</P>
<P>
The aim of their discussion is to create positive conditions
for the self-sufficient agricultural production and facilitate the
resettlement of the displaced population.
</P>
<P>
There are currently some 3.7 million displaced persons in
Angola, 170, 000 of whom are living in the central kwanza-sul
Province.
</P>
<P>
Before the government secures its assistance, the NGOs should
encourage the displaced families to engage themselves in farming
and supply them with ploughing instruments, seeds and other
elements.
</P>
<P>
An official source noted that it is difficult for the
government to assist the displaced families due to lack of funds.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, EU Strike Compromise on Trade Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 16 (Xinhua) --The impasse on the
labelling of spirits which is holding up the implementation of the
trade agreement between South Africa and the European Union has
been resolved.
</P>
<P>
South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said at a
cabinet meeting in Cape Town on Wednesday that the cabinet had
agreed to accept a compromise with the EU to phase out the use of
certain names in spirit brands.
</P>
<P>
South Africa would phase out the terms of "grappa" and "ouzo",
as well as "korn", "jagertee" and "pacharan" over five years, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Our hope is that we can now get down to the real business of
the trade agreement, and that we have now ended this bizarre
dispute," Erwin was quoted by South African Press Association as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Italy claim that "grappa" and "ouzo" are two popular
spirit brands solely used by Greek and Italian producers. Their
objection to South Africa using the two brands had put on hold the
South African-EU agreement which was originally scheduled to be
implemented in January this year.
</P>
<P>
Germany and other European countries followed suit, objecting
South Africa using "korn", "jagertee" and "pacharan" to label its
spirits.

<HEADLINE> UNFP Allocates $13.7M to Ethiopia for Medical Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Fund
for Population (UNFP) has allocated 13.7 million U.S. dollars to
Ethiopia this year to improve reproductive health and family
planning services in the country, a UNFP official said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
UNFP representative Benson Morah told media that 11 million
dollars of the allocated fund would be applied to reproductive
health and the rest for raising public awareness.
</P>
<P>
The stated amount is part of the 30 million dollars the UNFP
has set aside for the execution of population-related projects in
Ethiopia since 1980, Benson said.
</P>
<P>
Family planning services are bearing fruits in Ethiopia, he
said, adding that the UNFP would continue to work with the
Ethiopian government to curb the spread of HIV/AIDS in the Horn of
Africa country.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics released by the Ethiopian National
Population Office, the annual population growth rate of the
country has dropped to 2.9 percent from 3.2 percent. Currently,
Ethiopia has a population of 62 million.

<HEADLINE> WHO Strengthens Malaria Control in Southern Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Heath Organization
(WHO) has launched an initiative which will ensure that health
professionals in southern Africa have access to up-to-date
information on malaria.
</P>
<P>
"The shortage of information inhibits effective malaria control
in southern African countries," WHO Southern Africa Malaria
Control Program said in a statement released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Health professionals working in malaria control in southern
Africa frequently have poor and sometimes no access to up-to-date
malaria reference books," it said.
</P>
<P>
The initiative was launched this month in collaboration with
the University of Zimbabwe's Medical School library and Australian
Agency for International Development.
</P>
<P>
The initiative comprised a malaria information resource center,
the red trunk and file which provided data to health professionals
working on the disease control throughout southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The WHO malaria control program covers Angola, Botswana,
Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania,
Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Malaria is one of the major causes of death in southern Africa.
 Every year between 200,000 and 300,000 people die of the disease.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Unveils Five-Year HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
formulated its five-year HIV/AIDS strategic plan in a bid to
prevent the further transmission of the killer disease and reduce
the social economical impact of it in the country.
</P>
<P>
The strategic plan for the period 2000 to 2004 was unveiled by
Health Minister David Mpamba on Wednesday when he opened the Red
Cross Society workshop in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Mpamba said the government's plan was targeted at certain
geographic locations in the country and socially vulnerable groups
such as women and youths.
</P>
<P>
The plan will be implemented in partnership with the private
sector, community and the relevant Non-governmental Organizations
(NGOs) such as the Red Cross movement.
</P>
<P>
He observed that HIV/AIDS was a great challenge not only to
Zambia but also to the region as a whole. And the International
Federation of Red Cross and the Red Cross Crescent Societies have
commended the Zambian government for taking a multi sector
approach to the fight to control the spread of the killer disease.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Supports Setup of Palestinian State: King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein said Wednesday his country firmly stands for the legitimate
rights of the Palestinians, including the establishment of an
independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The king made the remarks during a meeting with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, who arrived here from Vatican early in the
morning to brief Jordan on the setbacks of the Israeli-Palestinian
talks.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah expressed his appreciation for Arafat's efforts to
break the impasse over the peace talks, and called on Israeli
negotiators to cooperate with their Palestinian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The monarch reiterated Jordan's support for the rights of the
Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon to restore their lands occupied by
Israel in the Middle East wars.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, a frequent visitor to Jordan, also briefed Abdullah on
his trip to Vatican, where Palestinian officials signed wide-
ranging agreements with their Vatican counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The agreements warned Israel that any unilateral actions
affecting the status of Jerusalem will be "morally and legally
unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Abdullah also discussed ways of breaking the deadlock
arising from the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have failed to meet a
February 13 deadline to reach a framework agreement for final peace
arrangements before September, including border demarkation, water
sharing, future of Israeli settlements and Palestinian refugees in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has blamed the failure on what it called
delaying tactics by the Israeli sides, and has vowed to set up an
independent state no later than September regardless of the results
of the talks with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit to Amman is part of an ongoing consultation
mechanism between Jordan and the Palestinians on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
His last visit here was on December 20.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been a key peace broker between Israel and its Arab
neighbors since a peace treaty was signed between Jordan and Israel
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said earlier he will visit Israel to promote peace
talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors. However, Jordanian
officials said the visit is "no longer in the offing" since Israel
launched massive air raids on Lebanon last week and the Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks have reached an impasse.

<P>
KHARTOUM, February 16 ( Xinhua ) -- Statistics issued by
Sudan's national department of malaria have shown the number of
people infected by malaria is climbing in the country and more than
16,000 citizens were killed by the diesease from 1993 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese daily Alayam on Wednesday quoted the director of
the department, Hasan Baqady, as saying the reason for the malaria
rampancy in the country is the lack of response with a anti-malaria
program.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, a total of 674,854 people caught
the disease in 1999, killing 1,825 of them, the highest figure in

<HEADLINE> 10 People Injured During Strike in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people were injured
in Dhaka during the second day of the opposition 's three-day
hartal (destructive strike) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The four-party opposition alliance, grouping the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP), Jatiya Party, Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami
Oikya Jote (Islami Solidarity Front) enforced the "blockade-hartal
" across the country, demanding immediate annulment of the Public
Safety Act (PSA) and resignation of the government.
</P>
<P>
In the capital, three passengers were hospitalized after
unidentified people hurled home made bombs on a bus. Police used
tear gas and batons when activists of BNP tried to set on fire a
tempo.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said other than these incidents, they had no
report of any major violence so far with several thousand extra
police deployed in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Despite the hartal with inclusion of simultaneous blockade of
road, railway and water ways, Aviation officials said all domestic
and international flights operated normally while railway
officials reported there was no disruption in train services
across the country. The launch services to and from Dhaka were
also normal.
</P>
<P>
Several anti-hartal processions, led by the ruling Awami League
leaders and party lawmakers, were brought out in different areas
of the capital.
</P>
<P>
At least 70 people were injured in sporadic clashes between
police and opposition activists during Tuesday's countrywide dawn-
to-dusk hartal. Of them, 20 people were injured in Dhaka, the rest
in other districts.
</P>
<P>
Police filed the first case Tuesday under the PSA against two
young men on charges of exploding home-made bombs at an under-
construction building in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The PSA came into effect on February 14 after President
Shahabuddin Ahmed assented to it.

<HEADLINE> Gasoline Prices Hit Record High in Canada, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The average price at self-serve stations across Canada stands
at 67.5 cents (about 0.46 U.S. dollars), even higher than the
previous record of 67.1 cents set in November 1990, following the
invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, the Globe and Mail national newspaper
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The increased price varied Tuesday from the highest 78.9 cents(
about 0.54 U.S. dollars) a litre in Gander, Newfoundland, to 59.4
cents (about 0.41 U.S. dollars) in Calgary, Alberta.
</P>
<P>
The price hike is a result of continued fear over supply
shortages as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
adheres to production cuts implemented about a year ago, the
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Starts Surge in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Builders began work on new units at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.78 million last month, the highest level since 1.
80 million units were started in January 1999, the report said.
</P>
<P>
January's performance was much stronger than the 3.5 percent
decline many analysts were forecasting. In December, housing
starts rose by a brisk 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate
mortgage was 8.21 percent last month, up from 6.79 percent in
January 1999. Last week, mortgage rates climbed to 8.36 percent.
</P>
<P>
Even with the steady advance in mortgage rates last year, sales
of both new and existing homes posted records. Economists
attributed all this to plentiful jobs, rising incomes and stock
market gains, which fueled Americans' buying mood.
</P>
<P>
In January, housing starts were up in all parts of the country
except for the Northeast, where they fell.
</P>
<P>
For the single-family homes, starts fell by 2.1 percent in
January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.396 million
units. Starts of apartments and condos, however, jumped by a huge
17.7 percent to a rate of 379,000 units.
</P>
<P>
New building permits, a barometer of future construction
activity, grew by a strong 8.7 percent in January to a seasonally
adjusted rate of 1.763 million.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers for Pinochet Criticize Leak in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers for former Chilean
leader Augusto Pinochet reacted angrily on Wednesday to the "leak"
in Spain of a confidential medical report on Pinochet's health.
</P>
<P>
Michael Caplan, one of Pinochet's lawyers, said he was
concerned about the leak appearing in Spanish newspapers.
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter of great concern to us. I have written to
the home office asking what inquiries they propose to make... and
what course of action they propose to take," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Britain's High Court ordered Pinochet's medical
report be released to Spain, France, Belgium and Switzerland, the
four countries that are seeking Pinochet's extradition on charges
of human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
The report was released on condition of confidentiality, but
details appeared in Spanish newspapers and on the Internet
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
British Home Secretary Jack Straw said last month that he was "
minded" to free Pinochet as the report suggested that Pinochet was
too ill to stand trial in Spain. But Belgium government and other
human rights groups seeking Pinochet's extradition argued that
they should first be allowed to see it.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, the 84-year-old former Chilean leader, was arrested
in October, 1998, in a London hospital while recovering from a
minor back operation.
</P>
<P>
A Spanish judge accused him of responsibility for the deaths
and disappearances of 3,000 people, and wanted to extradite him to
face charges in Spain.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was anticipating a decision to let him return home to
Chile next week.

<HEADLINE> German Opposition Party Leader to Resign Over Funding Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Wolfgang Schaeuble, leader of
Germany's opposition party Christian Democrats (CDU), announced
Wednesday that he will step down in order to free the party from
crisis over illegal funding.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read out before reporters at CDU headquarters
in Berlin, Schaeuble also said he would quit as head of the CDU
parliamentary delegation.
</P>
<P>
Without a change in leadership, the CDU "can't be freed from
the crisis" caused by illegal campaign funds kept under former
chancellor Helmut Kohl, he said.
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble, who succeeded Kohl as the CDU party chief in 1998
after the CDU lost general elections to the Social Democrats, will
stay in office until the party holds a congress in April.
</P>
<P>
"I have decided not to put myself forward again as candidate
for party chairman at the party congress in April," he said.
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble's departure was reportedly a result of calls from
within his own party. Some CDU senior officials said earlier that
Schaeuble had come under fire from his party fellows for his
handling of the funding scandal at an emergency party meeting.
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble has admitted accepting an undeclared donation of
about 50,000 U.S. dollars from an arms dealer in 1994, whom German
prosecutors want to extradite from Canada for tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
Parliament speaker Wolfgang Thiers on Tuesday ordered the CDU
to pay 41.2 million marks (about 20 million dollars) to the
government as a fine for having accepted secret donations in
violation of laws on parties.
</P>
<P>
Due to the penalty, the CDU could face major setbacks in two
key elections in North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein
states over the next three months.
</P>
<P>
Khol, who has admitted having accepted 1 million illegal
donations and ran slush funds for the CDU, is under parliamentary
and criminal investigation.

<HEADLINE> No Fresh Review of Peace Process: Sinn Fein Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
said Wednesday there could be no fresh review of the Northern
Ireland peace process unless Britain reverses the decision it made
last Friday to suspend the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question of there being a review (of the peace
process)," Adams told reporters in London. "There cannot be a
review on the basis of a unilateral suspension" of the Northern
Ireland institutions by Britain, he said.
</P>
<P>
Adams, leader of the Irish Republican Army's (IRA) political
wing Sinn Fein, is due to meet British Prime Minister Tony Blair
later on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We (Sinn Fein) have no room at all to do anything in this
situation," he said, "The only breakthrough which can start to
make politics work is a return to the (Northern Ireland)
institutions."
</P>
<P>
But a Downing Street spokesman said Northern Ireland's power-
sharing bodies will not be restored unless the IRA explains how
and when it will disarm.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the IRA announced that it would end its
involvement with the international weapons decommissioning body
overseeing guerrilla disarmament in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The move appeared to be a major blow to Northern Ireland's

<P>
MOSCOW, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Moscow is prepared to expand
relations with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),
acting Russian President Vladimir Putin told NATO Secretary
General George Robertson in the Kremlin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We regard your visit to Russia as being within the context of
cooperation on European security as well as of Russia's relations
with NATO," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The very fact of your visit suggests that NATO attaches great
importance to relations with Russia. We are prepared to move
relations with NATO forward. On the other hand, such issues are
not easy to tackle in Russia in the wake of the developments in
Yugoslavia," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russian officials have taken note of Robertson's
remark that NATO also regards relations with Russia as very
important.
</P>
<P>
Following the opening remarks, the meeting was held behind
closed doors. It was also attended by Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Deputy Chief of the
presidential staff Sergei Prikhodko and presidential aid Sergei

LONDON -- Lawyers for former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet
reacted angrily on Wednesday to the "leak"in Spain of a
confidential medical report on Pinochet's health.
</P>
<P>
Michael Caplan, one of Pinochet's lawyers, said he was
concerned about the leak appearing in Spanish newspapers.
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter of great concern to us. I have written to
the home office asking what inquiries they propose to make... and
what course of action they propose to take," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Britain's High Court ordered Pinochet's medical
report be released to Spain, France, Belgium and Switzerland, the
four countries that are seeking Pinochet's extradition on charges
of human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
The report was released on condition of confidentiality, but
details appeared in Spanish newspapers and on the Internet

LONDON -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said Wednesday there
could be no fresh review of the Northern Ireland peace process
unless Britain reverses the decision it made last Friday to
suspend the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question of there being a review (of the peace
process)," Adams told reporters in London. "There cannot be a
review on the basis of a unilateral suspension" of the Northern
Ireland institutions by Britain, he said.
</P>
<P>
Adams, leader of the Irish Republican Army's (IRA) political
wing Sinn Fein, is due to meet British Prime Minister Tony Blair
later on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We (Sinn Fein) have no room at all to do anything in this
situation," he said, "The only breakthrough which can start to
make politics work is a return to the (Northern Ireland)
institutions."
</P>
<P>
But a Downing Street spokesman said Northern Ireland's power-
sharing bodies will not be restored unless the IRA explains how
and when it will disarm. (Britain-NIreland-Peace)

BERLIN -- Wolfgang Schaeuble, leader of Germany's opposition
party Christian Democrats (CDU), announced Wednesday that he will
step down in order to free the party from crisis over illegal
funding.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read out before reporters at CDU headquarters
in Berlin, Schaeuble also said he would quit as head of the CDU
parliamentary delegation.
</P>
<P>
Without a change in leadership, the CDU "can't be freed from
the crisis" caused by illegal campaign funds kept under former
chancellor Helmut Kohl, he said.
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble, who succeeded Kohl as the CDU party chief in 1998
after the CDU lost general elections to the Social Democrats, will
stay in office until the party holds a congress in April.
</P>
<P>
"I have decided not to put myself forward again as candidate
for party chairman at the party congress in April," he said.
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble's departure was reportedly a result of calls from
within his own party. Some CDU senior officials said earlier that
Schaeuble had come under fire from his party fellows for his
handling of the funding scandal at an emergency party meeting.
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble has admitted accepting an undeclared donation of
about 50,000 U.S. dollars from an arms dealer in 1994, whom German
prosecutors want to extradite from Canada for tax evasion. (

<HEADLINE> China's Accession Into WTO, Major Decision (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- China's decision to
accelerating negotiations for entering the World Trade
Organization (WTO) shows the firm determination of the Chinese
authorities to further reforms and open the country wider to the
outside world, according to a signed article to be published in a
leading national magazine.
</P>
<P>
The article -- A Major Decision for Promoting China's Open Door
Policy -- will be carried in the fourth issue of Qiu Shi (Seeking
Truth), a semimonthly magazine sponsored by the Communist Party of
China Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
China's entry into the WTO will have a far-reaching impact on
its social and economic development and reforms and opening
policies, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Like most countries and regions across the world, China chooses
to enter the WTO in order to better participate in international
competition and safeguard its national interests by means of the
organization's multilateral trade rules, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
China has witnessed an economic boom in the last 20 years and
ranks 7th in the world as an economic power. The Chinese economy
has become more export-oriented, it says.
</P>
<P>
Joining the WTO will, therefore, further promote China to open
wider to the outside world and help the Chinese economy to develop
rapidly.

<P>
The article states that after gaining the WTO membership, China
will abide by multi-lateral trade rules and its trade policies
will become more transparent. More fields will be opened to
foreign investors who will gradually enjoy national treatment.
</P>
<P>
By adopting such policies, "China will show to the rest of the
world that it is a responsible major power, carrying out reform
and further opening its doors to the outside world." and China
will become more attractive to overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
China's accession to the WTO enable the country to enjoy the
privileges in trade with other WTO members according to
internationally accepted trade rules. This will help increase
China's exports, it says.
</P>
<P>
Joining the WTO will also lead to a faster restructuring of
China's industries and help sharpen the competitive edge of
Chinese enterprises when China is able to make better use of
foreign capital, technology and management expertise.
</P>
<P>
China needs a stable, transparent and foreseeable multi-lateral
trade system to meet the challenges of economic globalization and
trade liberalization. By joining the WTO, China can better protect
itself during further economic globalization.

<P>
However a lot of work is necessary on China's part to face the
challenges and problems that will arise once it becomes a fully
fledged member of the WTO, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, China should gradually allow more overseas investment
into its service trade sector, such as telecommunications, banking,
securities, insurance, commerce, foreign trade and tourism. China
also should encourage overseas investment in agriculture,
infrastructure, environmental protection and high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
"We need to improve the work in approving foreign-invested
projects, tighten supervision to ensure the security of state
information and prevent financial risks, while keeping unhealthy
culture from intruding the country."
</P>
<P>
The articles also calls for further reform of China's state-
owned enterprises, which play a crucial role in the national
economy, and development of the high-tech industry to improve the
competitiveness of the nation.
</P>
<P>
China also should make use of the WTO rules, especially the
application of reasonable tariff and non-tariff measures, to
safeguard its economic security and ensure a sustained, stable and
healthy development of industries that are vital to the national
economy, says the article.

The article stresses that China should make further efforts to
support agriculture. It should guard against and reduce the
negative impacts of foreign agricultural products flooding the
domestic market after its WTO entry.
</P>
<P>
The government should continue to encourage the purchase of
grain at the state protective price, increase investment in
agriculture, promote agricultural technological progress, adjust
the structure of agricultural products, and improve their quality.
</P>
<P>
China should also improve trade and economic laws as soon as
possible and train more economic professionals so as to better
cope with international competition in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the article says, these professionals should be
familiar with WTO rules and international trade rules, have a good

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Benefit-Sharing Trading System Urged at  UNCTAD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The world needs a multilateral
trading system, which benefit all countries, developed and
developing alike.
</P>
<P>
The opinion was shared by heads of international monetary
agencies as well as representatives of various countries attending
the 10th Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD X), which was held here from February 12 to 19.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Michael
Moore said in his keynote speech at UNCTAD X Wednesday that the
WTO must ensure that trade policy is not superimposed on
development policy but reflects development objectives in a
realistic and coherent way.
</P>
<P>
He also said that trade negotiations in agriculture and
services are of vital importance to the economic future of
countries at all levels of development.
</P>
<P>
"Although the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture made some
progress towards liberalizing trade in agriculture, many
developing countries say that more needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
"With large numbers working on farms and much of their foreign
exchange earnings depending on agricultural trade, they clearly
have a large stake in such progress," Moore said.
</P>
<P>
Improved market access and reduced competition from richer
countries' subsidies in agriculture are crucial for most
developing countries both to develop their present structure of
trade and to diversify into products with potential for new
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The slower pace of liberalization in agriculture than in
manufacturers over the years and the continuing high barriers and
distortions in many markets, are a severe handicap to the
expansion of developing countries' possibilities in this field, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also elaborated on service trade, saying its development and
diversification can likewise bring considerable gains to
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Liberal, coherent and more stable policy conditions in services
and the attendant mobilization of private capital and expertise
are a precondition for efficiency enhancing reforms in main
infrastructure sector such as telecommunications, finance,
insurance and transport, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that more work must be done in removing barriers
to the exports of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The removal of trade barriers makes sense not only for
developing countries but also from the point view of the richer
countries, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that trade works in favor of the poor, a framework of
rule must be established to provide stability and predictability
to the environment within which trading relationships exist, he
added.
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's UNCTAD meeting, President of the World Bank
James Wolfensohn also called on the world community to improve the
rules of games in international trade.
</P>
<P>
He said that in order to have a balanced and inclusive world
trade system, special attention should be paid to developing
countries' current problems with the design and implementation of
the rules of the game in international trade.
</P>
<P>
"Developing country membership in the World Trade Organization
has risen rapidly in recent years, but membership does not equate
with influence," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that many developing countries lack technical capacity
to negotiate meaningfully. Meanwhile, the rules of the game are
set by the rich and the better-prepared developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"The rules have already been set, for example in the case of
customs valuation procedure, were based on developed country
models which can be inappropriate and prohibitively expensive for
poor countries," Wolfensohn said.
</P>
<P>
"If we are to have a balanced and inclusive world trading
system that attracts the adherence of developing countries, much
needs to be done to enhance these capacity to participate in the
rule making process," he added.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Holds Sub-Regional Seminar on HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A two-day Great-Mekong sub-
regional seminar on HIV/AIDS ended here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from China, Lao, Thailand, Vietnam and the host
country Cambodia attended the seminar financed by the Canadian
government and the Canadian Embassy in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The seminar provided opportunity to the Royal Government of
Cambodia to learn from the delegates of other countries on the
potential ways of computing the impact of AIDS on national
economic development and the possible way of formulating and
implementing appropriate multi-sectoral action plan for grappling
with the issue.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has the highest rate of HIV/AIDS in the region which
seriously affected the country's economic development and the
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures offered by officials at the seminar,
about 180,000 or 3.7 percent of the sexually active population (
from 15-49 years of age) were HIV positive in Cambodia in 1998.
And it is estimated 6,000 people now have AIDS. While the average
adult infection rate is below 0.1 percent for the region, in
Cambodia the rate is estimated to be at least 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The seminar has made many useful recommendations, such as
urging the government to take immediate steps to strengthen multi-
sectoral mechanisms and to formulate appropriate strategies for
implementation.
</P>
<P>
The attendants also suggested all sectors of society, including
NGOs, the private sector, communities and government, to be
involved actively in establishing, implementing and monitoring
programs based on these policies and strategies.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the seminar called on the international community
to support the governments of the sub-region in their commitment
to this expanded multi-sectoral approach.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Insists on Deadline of Hand-over by Cote d'Ivoire Military Regime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) reaffirmed its deadline of June for the
military regime in Cote d'Ivoire to hand over power to elected
civilians, according to information reaching here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lansana Kouyate, ECOWAS Executive Secretary, told media in the
Nigerian capital Abuja that his organization has not changed its
stance on the issue.
</P>
<P>
It was the first public reaction by the 16-nation organization
to the transition time-table released by the military regime
headed by Gen. Robert Guie, who sets the end of October as the
hand-over date.
</P>
<P>
Guie ousted elected president Henri Konan Bedie last December
in a bloodless military coup, which was widely condemned by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate, who was in Cote d'Ivoire during the coup, has since
been involved in top-level consultations with regional leaders on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
While explaining that consultations are continuing at the
highest level to assist the military government in Cote d'Ivoire
to adhere to the June deadline, the executive secretary noted that
nothing has happened to make the ECOWAS change its decision.

<HEADLINE> Malawi's Economy Expected to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Malawi's gross domestic product
(GDP) is expected to reach an increase of five percent this year
compared with that of 4.7 percent last year, according to a
bulletin of the National Bank of Malawi.
</P>
<P>
Stable exchange rates and price levels, prudent fiscal
discipline and favorable weather conditions hold the key to
Malawi's economic prospects, the bank said in its latest economic
and financial bulletin.
</P>
<P>
It said that the country's relations with the international
donor community are currently positive, which should facilitate
into the country adequate capital inflow for development and for
balance of payments support.
</P>
<P>
Much of the real economic growth in 1999 was relatively buoyed
by an upswing in the agricultural industry, which rose by 11.6
percent compared with 2.7 percent in 1998, said the bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank said utility and transport and communication grew by
2.5 percent and 2.9 percent respectively in 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, the manufacturing sector has been declining since
1995. The firms producing for the domestic market are already
reeling under stiff competition from imports, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The companies suffered further setbacks after the industry was
hit by 60 percent devaluation of the kwacha currency in 1998, it
added.

<HEADLINE> Toronto Internet Company Claims to Have Hacker Identity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A Toronto-based company claims
to have the identity of a hacker suspected of hitting several
major U.S. Web sites last week.
</P>
<P>
The Toronto Sun newspaper Wednesday quoted Internet Direct as
saying, "We have the identity of this person," whose nickname is "
Mafiaboy."
</P>
<P>
"With the proper warrant, we will give this information" to
police," said Colin Campbell, senior vice-president of the company.
</P>
<P>
Delphi Supernet, a company bought by Internet Direct last
summer, pulled the plug on two Mafiaboy accounts in early 1998 for
abusing its policies.
</P>
<P>
One of the sites, which are now defunct, was a hacker Web page
at www.dsuper.net/-mafiaboy/hackers.htm, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The company, however, is not sure that "This is the real
Mafiaboy" for the recent attacks.
</P>
<P>
"All we know is that we had an individual two years ago with
that name," said Campbell.
</P>
<P>
The FBI has contacted Canadian police, saying computer records
indicate a hacker calling himself Mafiaboy used a Canadian
Internet service provider as his launch pad for attacks on U.S.
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
Several major e-commerce sites, including CNN.com and E*trade,
were shut down for hours last week after computer hackers swamped
the sites with a barrage of worthless data.

<HEADLINE> Minister Calls for More Ideal Education System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- China's Minister of Education
Chen Zhili today called for effective measures to relieve the
pressure of studies among primary and middle school students.
</P>
<P>
Educational departments throughout the country should seek the
support of other professionals in providing advice and guidance to
the students before they start the new semester this spring, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
Effective measures are needed to examine the problems of
burdening students with heavy work loads and to relieve the
pressure before sitting for exams, she said.
</P>
<P>
Just before the Chinese lunar New Year, a senior high school
student in Zhejiang Province killed his mother because she wanted
him to improve his grades at school.
</P>
<P>
In another different yet related incident, a father of a high
school student in Henan Province was angry because his son was not
chosen as an "excellent student". The father went as far as
confronting his son's class teacher and assaulted him.
</P>
<P>
Lu Fuyuan, deputy minister of education, attributed these
problems to flaws in the education system and the way some parents
apply unrealistic pressure on the children.
</P>
<P>
He ordered that all primary and middle schools in the country
should stop arranging the students' names only in the order of
their scores and publishing the name lists starting from the new
semester.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that teachers and parents should work closely together
to create a favorable environment for the healthy development of
teenagers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The State Economic and Trade
Commission has issued an urgent circular requesting local
governments and transportation departments to ensure
transportation safety as Chinese return from celebrating the
Chinese lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of transient laborers and college students return

or study every year. This brings about a sharp increase in
passengers transportation during the season, known as the "Spring
Transport Season" in China.
</P>
<P>
The circular, issued on Tuesday, also calls for careful
arrangement of means of transportation and improvement in services
to ensure a smooth and safe flow of passengers.
</P>
<P>
Those who allow overcrowded long-distance buses will be
severely punished, it says.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that some 129 million passengers will take
trains during the holiday period. There will be 1.4 billion
expecting to travel by road and another 6.8 million by plane.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- A recent Jordanian survey showed that the annual
inflation rate of the country has declined from 5.4 percent in 1998
to 3.75 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Jordanian National Society for
Consumer Protection, said the decline was mainly due to the
weakening purchasing power of Jordanian consumers as a result of
the unchanged wages during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicated that prices of some 280 commodities and
services in Jordan rose by 39.20 percent in 1999 against the
previous year. The prices of 320 commodities and services declined
by 9.44 percent in 1999 as compared with 1998.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi Arabia's telecommunications company Silki
Lasilki said it will acquire the phones of advance-payment card
from a Swiss company and an Italian company under a contract it
signed to provide about 100,000 phone units nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The company said the tentative and experimental operation of the
advance-payment card system had already started in the western
province of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The company expressed in a statement its hope that around 5,000
phone units will be supplied by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Volume of trade in the Abu Dhabi emirate, except
oil and gas, rose to 22.761 billion dirham last year (about 6.2
billion dollars) from some 20.915 billion dirham (5.70 billion
dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Abu Dhabi Customs Department said the rise
in the total value of the emirate's trade was due to the increase
in imports last year which exceeded more than 21.282 billion dirham
(5.80 billion dollars) against 18.750 billion dirham (5.2 billion
dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Jordan's contribution in the investment projects in
Egypt in 1999 amounted to about 500 million Egyptian pounds (146.2
million dollars), distributed to some 174 projects.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of Industry and Trade Mohammed Halayka said
the investment cost of these projects reached 3.5 billion pounds
(1.02 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
DOHA -- Qatari official in the energy sector said the volume of
foreign investments over the past five years in the areas of oil,
gas and heavy industries amounted to 28 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Minister of Energy and Industry Abdullah Bin Hamad al-
Attiya said a zone of medium and small enterprises is being built
in Doha with an area of 11 square kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Philippine National Budget Signed Into Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada on Wednesday signed the Congress-ratified 629-billion-peso
(15.7-billion-U.S.-dollar) national budget, voicing the hope that
it would help promote the country's economy in 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to a press statement issued by the Presidential
Palace, the economic services will get 41.13 percent of the
national budget, while social services would get 6.8 percent and
defense 22.33 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economic services include agriculture, trade and industry,
power and energy, communications and transport, tourism, and
natural resources and environment.
</P>
<P>
Social services include education, culture and manpower
development, health, social security, welfare and employment,
housing and community development.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks during the signing of the budget, Estrada said
the national budget would help his administration attain up to 4.5
percent to 5.5 percent growth during the year while limiting
inflation to manageable levels.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the budget is enacted before the start of every
fiscal year or on the last day of session of Congress prior to the
Christmas recess.
</P>
<P>
However, the debate between the House of Representatives and
the Senate over the cut in the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA)
delayed the process.
</P>
<P>
After a long wait, Philippine Congress finally ratified the
bicameral conference committee report on this year's national
budget on February 2.
</P>
<P>
Under the bicameral report, the government's proposed 651-
billion-peso (16.2-billion-dollar) national budget for the year
2000 has been drastically cut by 22 billion pesos (550,000 million
dollars).

<P>
CANBERRA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Australian Governor-General
William Deane Wednesday met the Chinese legislation delegation
headed by Zhou Guangzhao, vice chairman of the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress (NPC) of China.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Deane highly commended Australia-China
relationship, describing it as one of Australia's most important
partners.
</P>
<P>
Deane said Chinese President Jiang Zemin's successful state
visit to Australia last September would further boost the
bilateral ties in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese legislators also met President of the Senate of
Australia Margaret Reid, Speaker of the House of Representatives
Neil Andrew and Foreign Minister Alexander Downer on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Downer said political parties in Australia are optimistic about
the growth of Australia-China relations and are willing to enhance
the friendly bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Zhou said the exchange of visits and communication
between the NPC of China and Australian Parliament contribute to
the promotion of bilateral understanding and friendship and will
further accelerate the cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He also said he was impressed with Australia's affluent
resources, friendly people and boomed economy during his visit.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Australia Parliament, the Chinese
delegation arrived in Melbourne, southeast Australia, last
Saturday to start the visit.
</P>
<P>
Their southern Pacific trip will also take them to Fiji, Tango

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Respond to EU's Free Trade Accord Proposal Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa could
respond as early as Thursday to an European Union (EU) proposal
for breaking the deadlock of implementing the South Africa-EU Free
Trade Agreement, South African Press Association reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and the EU last October signed in Pretoria a
bilateral free trade agreement, which should have come into effect
on January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, Italy and Greece last December threatened not to
ratify the deal because South Africa refused to abandon using the
two terms of "grappa" (a brand used by Italian liquor producers)
and "ouzo" (a brand used by Greek liquor producers) on liquor
products made in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The EU Monday made a compromise to South Africa, saying if
South Africa agreed to phase out using "grappa" and "ouzo" in five
years, the free trade accord would be implemented quickly.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was forwarded to South African Trade and Industry
Minister Alec Erwin on Tuesday, and was likely to be discussed at
a cabinet meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An EU senior official expressed the hope that there would be
some kind of response on Thursday, saying he was optimistic that
South Africa would accept the five-year transition period to phase
out the use of the two sensitive brand names.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands Donates $1.6 Million to Support OAU Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands has
donated 1.6 million U.S. dollars to the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) to support its restructuring and reform of the general
secretariat of the organization, an OAU press release said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the OAU secretary general, Daniel Antonio,
assistant secretary general in charge of Administration and
Conference Department, expressed the organization's appreciation
of the donation from the government of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Antonio said the donation is another manifestation of the
continued support the OAU has been receiving from the Netherlands,
adding that it will help put in place a General Secretariat of the
OAU with a new vision to successfully lead the continent through
the new millenium.
</P>
<P>
Pieter Marres, ambassador of the Netherlands to Ethiopia, said
his government was committed to the wellbeing of Africa and
particularly to the important role the OAU is performing within
the continent.
</P>
<P>
The government of the Netherlands appreciates its cordial
relations with the OAU, and is determined to see in Africa a very
strong OAU with the capacity to perform the commendable role it is
playing especially in the area of conflict management, Marres
said.

<HEADLINE> Survey: EU Companies Confident About 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Business chiefs in the
European Union (EU) have expressed confidence about this year's
growth, which has been the most optimistic ever recorded in the
history of an EU annual survey.
</P>
<P>
The European Report quoted the journal Economic Survey as
saying that more than 100,000 industry chiefs from 83 regions
within the EU were surveyed.
</P>
<P>
Those chiefs surveyed accounted for 95 percent of the EU gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The high level of business optimism resulted from such economic
indicators as turnover, employment and investment, according to
the survey published by the Eurochambers, previously known as the
Association of European Chambers of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Optimistic turnover expectations have been fueled by strong
domestic sales, matched by higher exports that are expected to
rise still further due to the predicted upturn in world economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Employment continues to grow rapidly in the European Union,
with 11 percent more employers planning to hire as opposed to cut
staff in 2000. This net increase of employment is the highest
recorded by the annual survey in its seven-year history.
</P>
<P>
Investment prospects have changed little over last year since
company owners are still cautious about further investment
decisions.
</P>
<P>
The survey also said that the current depreciation of the
single currency euro has had a positive effect on exports, while
the investment climate and consumption benefited from low interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
Eurochambers President Jorg Mittelsten Scheid, however, warned
against the optimism by saying that the European Union has only to
look at the United States economy to see that it can not afford to
be complacent.
</P>
<P>
He called on business chiefs to take advantage of the current
favorable economic climate to sustain business confidence,
particularly by taking long-awaited measures in employment, tax
and professional training.

<HEADLINE> EU to Extend Energy Delivery to 5 More Yugoslav Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
extend the delivery of heating oil to five more Serbian cities in
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the EU announced here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the EU executive body, the European
Commission. The five cities are Kragujevac, Kraljevo, Novi Sad,
Sombor and Subotica.
</P>
<P>
The commission also decided to deliver more heating oil to Nis
and Pirot, the two Serbian cities already benefiting from the
energy delivery program, which would deliver 15,000-17,000 tons of
heating oil in total to the two cities.
</P>
<P>
By last week some 5,500 tons of heating oil had reached these
two cities by trucks and trains, according to the commission.
</P>
<P>
The heating oil was provided to public buildings in these seven
cities, such as schools, kindergartens, hospitals, public health
and administration centers.
</P>
<P>
Energy delivery of 12,000-15,000 tons of heating oil to the
five new cities will start within a few days, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the European council of foreign ministers decided to
temporarily lift the commercial flight ban on the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia for a period of six months.
</P>
<P>
The EU has banned flights from Belgrade from landing in EU
capitals and flights from EU countries to go to Belgrade since
1998.

<HEADLINE> French Defense Minister to Explain Recent Violence in Kosovo to Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard will go to Washington next week to explain to the United
States government the position of France in Kosovo, a French
government spokesman said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The visit follows an outbreak of violence last week in the
northern Kosovo city of Kosovska Mitrovica between French troops
serving in the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo (KFOR) and
ethnic Albanian snipers.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. press criticized French troops in Kosovo for refusing
to provide help to the United Nations police force in Kosovska
Mitrovica during fights between the Serbs and the Albanians in
early February.
</P>
<P>
"Alain Richard will go to the United States next week to
explain our vision of things to the Americans. The Americans have
been given information, which in our point of view, is disputable,
" said government spokesman Daniel Vaillant.
</P>
<P>
He said the presence of French troops in Kosovo was "in
conformity with the engagement taken" by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
"It is not France which is the origin of the problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the shooting that took place between French troops and
Albanian snipers last Sunday when one Albanian was killed and five
injured, the spokesman said French soldiers opened fire because
they stood on the front line of the conflict and intended to
enforce "the cease-fire, the law and civil peace."
</P>
<P>
Two French soldiers were also injured in the shoot-out in
Kosovska Mitrovica on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
French troops are in charge of the security in Kosovska
Mitrovica, which is divided into two parts respectively inhabited
by Albanians and Serbs.

<HEADLINE> France to Continue Sending Police to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- France will continue to send
police officers to Kosovo to help train the local police force,
said the French Interior Ministry on Wednesday in the wake of a
dispute with the United Nations Civil Administrator Bernard
Kouchner.
</P>
<P>
France has promised to send 80 police officers to Kosovo, but
so far only 37 of them have arrived since July last year.
Kouchner has blamed French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre
Chevenement for deliberately blocking the process.
</P>
<P>
Kouchner, who was former French state secretary of health
before he was appointed the U.N. civil administrator, has been
criticized in private by French officials for adopting a pro-
Albanian stand.
</P>
<P>
Chevenement said earlier this week that he was skeptical about
sending more civil police officers to the Yugoslav province,
because of the violence against French peacekeepers which broke
out last week in the northern city of Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
Two French soldiers serving in the U.N. Kosovo peacekeeping
force (KFOR) were injured last Sunday in a fight with Albanian
snipers.
</P>
<P>
French military authorities said on Tuesday that they have
discovered a "terrorist strategy" to wage urban guerrilla warfare
against French troops in Kosovo.

BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Officials in the Chinese

good luck in winning the 2008 Olympics bidding.
</P>
<P>
Olympic bidding efforts started even before the Spring Festival

</P>
<P>
He said that to make itself more appealing to the international

"Everybody doing something for the bidding will be the most
important backing for our work," said Liu Jingmin, Beijing's vice-

</P>
<P>
And a recent Internet survey has found that 95 percent of the

"Economically we are fully capable of hosting an Olympics now,"
said Liu. "We are completely confident about this." He noted that
Beijing is also one of the world's safest cities, for its low
crime rate, traffic death rate and fire accident rate.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President Arrives in Qatar for Short Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar el-
Bashir arrived in Qatar on Wednesday for a brief visit as part of a
regional tour that started in Kuwait on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bashir is due to hold talks with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin
Khalifa al-Thani on ways to boost bilateral ties and on regional
and international issues of mutual concern, according to reports
reaching here from the Qatari capital of Doha.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's Ambassador in Doha Mohamed Ahmed Al-Dabi said in remarks
published by Qatar's newspaper Al-Raya on Tuesday that the planned
Sudanese-Qatari talks would deal with Sudan's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Othman Ismail also said ahead
of Bashir's tour that the Sudanese president will inform the Gulf
leaders of the political development in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Bashir dissolved the Sudanese parliament and declared a three-
month state of emergency last December, as a result of power
struggle with Hassan al-Turabi, the powerful parliament speaker and
secretary general of the ruling National Congress Party.
</P>
<P>
Qatar's Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabir al-
Thani visited Khartoum in early July, when he failed in an attempt
to bridge the differences between Bashir and Turabi, who had been
on very good terms with each other since Bashir took power in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese businessmen accompanying Bashir will hold meeting
with their Qatari counterparts to explore the possibility of
increasing Qatari investments in Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Officials in the Prime Minister's office said Tuesday that
the government has no intention of altering the maps of the
upcoming third withdrawal to include villages near Jerusalem, just
to enable talks with the Palestinians to resume.
</P>
<P>
However, security adviser Danny Yatom told Reuters that the
government would consider making minor changes in the proposed
handover. Yatom also called on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to
resume the negotiations he broke off 12 days ago, after the latter
expressed disappointment at Israel's refusal to discuss the map and
its decision not to include the Abu Dis area in a handover before a
final-status agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz announced
Tuesday that he was planning to ask for security cabinet's approval
for a proposal saying that each time IDF soldiers are fired upon
form a Lebanese village, the military will respond with a vigorous
shelling of the village.
</P>
<P>
His comments seemed to underscore the pressure being put on
Prime Minister Ehud Barak by the IDF not to let the situation in
Lebanon deteriorate, as it did earlier this month when seven
soldiers were killed in a two-week period by Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrillas, most of them firing from villages.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli government Tuesday accused the Vatican of interfering
in the peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians by signing
an accord with the Palestinians that cautioned Israel to refrain
form unilateral decisions affecting Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed Tuesday between Vatican and Palestinian
National Authority, strongly condemned Israel's hold over all of
Jerusalem as "morally and legally unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
The Vatican's stance underscored the difficulties Pope Jon Paul
II may face on his March 20-26 tour of Jordan, Israel, and the
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The number of those seeking work in January rose by 0.5
percent after unemployment fell in December 1999, according to the
Employment Service statistics.
</P>
<P>
The number of jobless Israelis registered with the Employment
Service totaled 164,200 in January, compared to 163,400 in the last
month of 1999. The list of centers of unemployment has grown to
include 28 towns and settlements.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Vatican Begin Urgent Meeting Over Jerusalem  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the
Israeli Foreign Ministry and the Vatican began their urgent meeting
here Wednesday to discuss what Israel alleged as Vatican's "
meddling with the issue of the status of Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
Eytan Bentsur, director general of Israeli Foreign Ministry,
will meet with Pietro Sambi, the apostolic nuncio in Israel to
protest Vatican's "regretful intervention" in the talks between
Israel and the Palestinians, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry had issued a statement earlier to express its "
great displeasure" with the agreement signed Tuesday by the Vatican
and the Palestinians, which cautioned Israel to refrain from
unilateral decisions on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, announced after the meeting between Pope John
Paul II and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Rome, covers the
Vatican's relations with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA),
the status of churches and the freedom of worship in the
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The text condemned Israel's occupation of the whole Jerusalem
as "morally and legally unacceptable," calling for an
internationally guaranteed statue to preserve "the proper identity
and sacred character" of the holy city for a just and lasting
peace.
</P>
<P>
It also reaffirmed both sides' rejection of Israel's annexation
of the Arab East Jerusalem after the 1967 Middle East War, which
was considered by the Palestinians as capital of their future
independent state.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel claims that Jerusalem is its eternal and
undivided capital and has repeatedly ignored previous Vatican calls
for such a status.
</P>
<P>
The final status of the city, widely acknowledged as one of the
thorniest issues in the entire peace process, is to be decided in
talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's agreement was seen as the most important development
in the relations between the two sides since the Vatican
established official ties with the PNA in 1994.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Vatican's stance will increase the
difficulties Pope John Paul II would face on his March 21-26 tour
of Israel and the Palestinian self-rule territories.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Genocide Suspects Arrested in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Two former high ranking
military officers of the Rwandan Armed Forces suspected of
involvement in the 1994 genocide were arrested respectively in
France and Denmark Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Both Francois-Xavier Nzuwonemeye and Innocent Sagahutu were
arrested at their homes respectively in Montauban, France, and in
Ringkjobing, Denmark, according to a statement by Carla Del Ponte,
prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
(ICTR) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two arrests were made on the basis of arrest warrants
issued by ICTR, which is based in the northern Tanzanian town of
Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Nzuwonemeye is the second genocide suspect arrested in France
in less than three months following the arrest of former Minister
Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda on November 26, 1999 in the central French
town of Bourges.
</P>
<P>
The accused will be transferred to the United Nations Detention
Facility in Arusha as soon as the practical details of their
transfer are arranged, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Del Ponte welcomed these two new arrests and thanked the French
and Danish authorities for their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation demonstrated the commitment of the
international community not to allow crimes against international
humanitarian law to go unpunished, he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government to Accept Referendum Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government
accepts the results of the constitutional referendum and respects
the will of the people as expressed through them, said President
Robert Mugabe on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the nation on the results of the referendum on the
draft constitution, Mugabe said the rejection of the constitution
meant in legal and practical terms that the government business
and national processes would continue to be conducted under the
1979 Lancaster House constitution as amended, local media reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This would go on until such a time the country has an
acceptable, home- grown constitutional framework, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the draft constitution was a sum of ideas that demanded
 painstaking efforts.
</P>
<P>
"It is indeed a rare assemblage of thoughts and views of our
generation seeking and searching for a basic law for the
development of our nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 697,754 people said "no" as compared with 578,210
who said "yes" to the draft constitution in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
"The government took great care to accommodate all interests
and colours in order to make the whole process both truly
democratic and representative of the diversity of our nation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that the referendum was conducted in a
peaceful and orderly manner was a significant step in the
direction of national building and the overall consolidation of a
democratic ethos.
</P>
<P>
He said he had every confidence that the forthcoming general
elections would be just as orderly, peaceful and dignified as the
conduct on the referendum.
</P>
<P>
"Let us all winners and losers accept the referendum verdict
and start planning our way forward," he said.

LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Barcelona Olympic Games men's
100m champion Linford Christie has been banned from using state-

The New South Wales government made the decision following the

LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer
club Arsenal player Marc Overmars threatened that he may leave the
club if the Gunners fail to qualify for next season's Champions
League.
</P>
<P>
Arsene Wenger's side dropped out of the top three after a 1-0
defeat at home to Liverpool on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
And Dutch winger Overmars reacted by saying: "I may not be an
Arsenal player next season. That will be decided by what happens
on the pitch.
</P>
<P>
"I am used to winning something every season. I want to win the
Champions League.
</P>
<P>
"I want to play well in the best period of my career. I'm 26
and probably have four good years left," he said.
</P>
<P>
Team-mate Dennis Bergkamp is happier to remain in North London,
but has called on the club to offer him an extension to his
contract.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old has 18 months left to run on his current deal
and is aware of rumours linking him with a swap deal for PSV
Eindhoven striker Ruud Van Nistelrooy.
</P>
<P>
Bergkamp said: "I don't want to leave but it is up to the club
to prove that they want to keep me for longer than my present
contract.
</P>
<P>
"It's up to them to offer me a new one if they want me to stay.
</P>
<P>
"I have heard the rumours about me supposedly leaving Arsenal,

</P>
<P>
"People are putting two and two together and saying that it
will be the end of me at this club. But that's not true. I don't
listen to that kind of talk," he added.

<HEADLINE> 125,000 More Residents in Three Gorges Area to Be Relocated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Another 125,000 farmers living
in the Three Gorges area will be relocated to 11 provinces along
the Yangtze River and the coast in east China, an official with
the Three Gorges Project Relocation and Development Bureau
announced today.
</P>
<P>
Qi Lin, director of the bureau, said at a meeting that the
people who must move now live in central China's Hubei Province
and Chongqing, China's largest municipality on the upper reaches
of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
He added that the number is about 42,000 more than planned.
</P>
<P>
From 1993 to the end of 1999, 220,000 people were resettled to
higher elevations in the Three Gorges area, said the official, and
preparations were also made for the resettlement of another 110,
000 migrants.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, cultural relics and endangered animals have been
removed from the area to be submerged by the reservoir created by
the Three Gorges Dam, the largest water conservancy project in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Qi said that the Chinese government will spend about 40 billion
yuan (4.8 billion U.S. dollars) on the resettlement plan between
1993 and 2009.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, the funds have been well-managed, although
some problems still remain," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Qi pledged that the authorities will keep close tabs on the
relocation effort to make sure it runs smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Located in Hubei Province, the Three Gorges Dam is the world's
largest hydroelectric project and is scheduled for completion in
2009. It is designed to contribute to flood prevention,
electricity generation, transportation, and water supply.
</P>
<P>
According to the construction plan, about 1.13 million people
in Hubei and Chongqing will leave their home in the Three Gorges
Area. The resettlement list also includes two cities, ten counties,
more than 100 towns, 1,599 enterprises and other large ports and
wharves.
</P>
<P>
The mammoth Three Gorges project means an opportunity for
investors from both at home and abroad, said Qi, adding that the
government will give firm support to investors to this area.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Fund Investors Get Prolonged Windfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese investors in
securities investment funds received a 1.5 billion yuan windfall
recently with the Chinese government's 12-month extension of the
stamp tax exemption.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Taxation (SAT) said today that the
move is aimed to beef up the country's fledging market of
securities investment funds.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government announced it would exempt stamp taxes
for individual and institutional investors from January 1998 to
the end of 1999. And the temporary exemption was supposed to
resume at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Hoping to jump-start the lackluster investment and consumption
demand, the Chinese government decided to continue the exemption
for another year.
</P>
<P>
The SAT said in a press release that the impact of the
Southeast Asia financial crisis and other factors have sent China'
s securities market in a downward spiral since late 1997,
crippling the performance of the newly-launched securities
investment funds.
</P>
<P>
Stamp taxes on the securities market account for about one-
fifth of the country's total tax revenue. Experts estimate that
the exemption of stamp tax on securities investment funds will cut
the tax revenue by 1-1.5 billion yuan every year.
</P>
<P>
China launched its first securities investment funds in 1998.
By the end of November, 1999, the country had set up 20 such funds,
with a total capital of 44.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The securities investment funds issue bonds to investors on the
open market and use the money collected to invest in the
securities market.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the Chinese government have adopted a
number of favorable policies to encourage investors to buy such
funds, including exemption of operation, income and stamp taxes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientist Joins U.S. Space Shuttle Mapping Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist with the
country's highest scientific research body has joined the ongoing
project of the U.S. space shuttle Endeavor to make a global-image
map of the world.
</P>
<P>
Forty-two scientists are involved in the shuttle radar
topographic mapping (SRTM) program. Guo Huadong, with the
Institute of Remote Sensing Application of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS), is the only principal scientist from China and the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The space shuttle Endeavor thundered into the sky on February
11, on a mission to launch the world's first radar-based, three-
dimensional imaging of the earth's surface from space.
</P>
<P>
The shuttle's 11-day flight is expected to cover at least 80
percent of the earth's land masses where over 90 percent of the
world's population reside. One hundred percent of China's
territory will be covered by the mapping.
</P>
<P>
One year ago, the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) solicited SRTM research programs from
scientists worldwide and received 250 applications.
</P>
<P>
Only 42 scientists were chosen to join the SRTM program after
appraisal by U.S. experts.
</P>
<P>
Guo's proposed program dealt with SRTM's application in the
topographical mapping of China and monitoring changes of the earth
's surface.
</P>
<P>
Guo was a member of Endeavor's radar science workshop held
between 1991 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
He can share the data obtained by the current flight of the
space shuttle with the other 41 SRTM principal scientists.
</P>
<P>
Guo said that the most advanced data will benefit China in
fields such as national topographical mapping, monitoring of the
earth's crust, flood prevention, environmental protection, and
development of the central and western parts of China.

<HEADLINE> Resigning U.N. Official Criticises U.N. Resolution on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Jutta Burghard, the head of the
World Food Program (WFP) in Iraq, said on Wednesday that she
resigned because she does not see the U.N. Resolution 1284 on Iraq
can be implemented for its humanitarian target in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The German handed in her resignation on Monday. She denied that
her resignation was intended to show solidarity with Hans von
Sponeck, former top U.N. humanitarian official in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sponeck resigned last weekend in protest against what he
called "a human tragedy" caused by the sanctions on Iraq and amid
intensive pressure from the United States and Britain to get rid of
him for his criticism of the crippling United Nations sanctions on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I resigned now for some internal reasons in my immediate
environment. It might look like a coincidence that I am making a
sort of solidarity with Mr. Sponeck," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I came to this conclusion that I have to resign on my own and
within my own range of activities," Burghard said in an interview
with CNN (Cable News Network).
</P>
<P>
However, she said she fully supports what Sponeck said that it
was a true human tragedy that is happening in Iraq, "and I believe
any human being who looks at the fact and the impacts of the
sanctions on the population will not deny that he is right."
</P>
<P>
Burghard, who took the post in January 1999, had been in charge
of the distribution of food bought by Iraq under the oil-for-food
program. The humanitarian deal introduced by the U.N. in 1996
allows Iraq to sell limited amount of oil in every six months to
buy humanitarian goods under U.N. supervision for its 22 million
people.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1284 on Iraq last
December which calls for the return of U.N. arms inspectors to Iraq
in exchange for possible suspension of sanctions imposed on Iraq
since 1990 following its invasion of Kuwait. Iraq has rejected the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
"I found it increasingly difficult to be legally bound as we are
told by (U.N. headquarters in) New York to implement Resolution
1284, this new resolution replacing Resolution 986 under which we
are cooperating here within the humanitarian program," said
Burghard.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 1284 contains three elements on the Kuwait
compensation and prisoners, on the humanitarian activities and on
the return of weapons inspectors, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Resolution 1284 requires that the WFP procure food locally, it
is a very good thing because under Resolution 986 there were sort
of distortions implying that the (Iraqi) government has to import
from abroad food that is produced locally. Normally, this is
destroying the agriculture base in the country," Burghard said.
</P>
<P>
"Now would I be purchasing food in a centralized state without
the government being a party of it? I cannot foresee such
activities to be undertaken by WFP," she added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Telecom to Sell Internet Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Telekom Multimedia, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Telekom Malaysia, is in talks with
several internet service providers (ISPs), that are interested in
buying its internet infrastructure, the company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There are many regional ISPs keen in the infrastructure and
apart from the ISPs, some multinational companies are also
interested in it, the company's Acting Chief Executive Officer
Majid Abdullah told reporters at a media launch of an e-commerce
roadshow here.
</P>
<P>
The official said the internet infrastructure up for sale
includes Telekom's multimedia international connectivity called
EastGate which would be launched on March 31 to allow the local
ISPs internet link from Malaysia to any part of the world.
</P>
<P>
Telekom Multimedia does not see other ISPs in the country as
its business rivals but instead as partners since all ISPs are
rolling out internet service as a national duty, he said, adding
for Telekom Multimedia, investment incurred to provide internet
service was high although the rates charged were low.
</P>
<P>
According to Majid Abdullah, Telekom Multimedia has invested
over 100 million ringgit (about 26.315 million U.S. dollars) to
raise its capability to cater for 1.5 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
The company has also invested around 15 million ringgit (about
3.947 million dollars) to allow its on-line service provider (OSP)
capacity to cope with one million clients.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Currency to Remain Weak: Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Until certain missing economic
fundamentals are restored in Nigeria, the naira will continue to
be weak against world major currencies, said Nigeria's Central
Bank Governor Joseph Sanusi Tuesday in Abuja, the country's
capital.
</P>
<P>
Justifying the current exchange rate of about 99.9 naira to a
dollar at the Inter-bank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM) in Lagos,
the bank's boss said the development was a fallout of the
country's prostate economy, reported the Guardian, a leading
Nigerian newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fundamentals, according to him, include increased
productivity, strong external sector, building up of external
reserves to cover imports for some months, as well as monitoring
of demand and supply for foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Others are greater in-flow of foreign investments into the
economy, reduction of imports and increasing exports.
</P>
<P>
He said that on average naira depreciated by 8.5 percent
against the U.S. dollar during the first 10 months of 1999,
compared with 1.5 percent in the corresponding period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The governor was however optimistic that with the current
positive moves by the government, the economy would soon begin to
witness a fluency of foreign investments.

<HEADLINE> Prospects for Poverty Reduction Not Bright: WB Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The prospects for future
reduction in the numbers of those living in poverty do not look
bright,President of the World Bank James Wolfensohn said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty remains intractable despite economic growth in many
countries," Wolfensohn said in a keynote speech at the 10th
Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD X).
</P>
<P>
Citing recent World Bank estimates, Wolfensohn said by 2008 the
same number of people, about 1.2 billion world-wide, may still be
living on under one U.S. dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
Even under a brighter alternative scenario of smoother and more
rapid growth, neither Latin America and the Caribbean nor Sub-
Saharan Africa would see much improvement in the numbers of those
living in deep poverty.
</P>
<P>
Using the higher two dollars a day yardstick, even under the
brighter scenario, the number of poor in Sub-Saharan Africa would
grow by over 90 million by 2008.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation reflects the problem of income inequality,
which in turn reflects inequality of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the relationship between poverty and growth,
Wolfensohn said rapid growth is a necessary if not a sufficient
condition for poverty reduction, but persistent poverty and
inequality can reduce growth rates.
</P>
<P>
He called for equitable and inclusive investment in human
capital and for wider access to the infrastructure and capital
needed to broaden the basis of opportunity.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian GDP Grows 0.23 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Based on constant price,
Indonesian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1999 reached 376.9
trillion rupiah (53.84 billion U.S. dollars) or increased by 0.23
percent compared to the previous year's figure of 376.1 trillion
rupiah (53.71 billion dollars), an official said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the National Bureau of Statistics Sugito Suwito said
that the country's GDP per capita increased to 5.38 million rupiah
(768 dollars) or 8.84 higher than the 1998 figure which was 4.94
million rupiah (705 dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The increase of the GDP was contributed by the improvement in
almost all sectors during the fourth quarter of 1999, so that
Indonesia's economy in the whole year has been able to arrest
negative economic growth as experienced in 1998," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the industrial sector experienced a positive growth of
2.19 percent, services 2.82 percent, while the agricultural and
development sectors reached 1.15 and 0.67 percent, respectively,
Suwito said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the industrial sector was recorded as the
greatest contributor for the increasing of 1999 GDP (25.78 percent)
, followed by agricultural (19.41 percent), trade (16.51 percent),
mine (9.9 percent), services (8.89 percent) and financial
institutions (6.98 percent).
</P>
<P>
According to Suwito, the national economy during 1999 was moved
by domestic consumption activities.
</P>
<P>
"Household consumption expenditures reached 271.87 trillion
rupiah (38.8 billion dollars) or up 1.48 percent compared to the
previous year's figure, while government consumption expenditures
reached 27.01 trillion rupiah (3.8 billion dollars) or increased
by 0.68 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rate of investment growth dropped in 1999 to 71.
35 trillion rupiah (10.1 billion dollars) or down by 20.78 percent
compared to the previous year's figure.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the export of goods and services also slowed down to
91.52 trillion rupiah (13 billion dollars) or 32.06 percent lower
than the previous year's figure, Suwito added.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish government
has committed an additional contribution of 200,000 U.S. dollars
to the Burundi peace negotiations, the Guardian newspaper reported
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The assistance came under a new agreement reached recently
between the Embassy of Sweden in Dar es Salaam and the Mwalimu

<P>
Swedish Ambassador Sten Rylander and Joseph Butiku, who is on

Foundation and commended the dynamic action being taken by the new
facilitator, former South African president Nelson Mandela, to
speed up the negotiations and bring them to a successful
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
Since he was appointed the new mediator for Burundi peace talks
last December, Mandela has been urging western donors to continue
funding the talks.
</P>
<P>
At least eight million U.S. dollars have been consumed since
the talks were launched in June 1998.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Airways to Introduce Boeings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Airways has signed a
letter of intent to take delivery of three Boeing 767-300 ER to
replace its Airbus A310-300 fleet, effective summer 2001, on the
European operations.
</P>
<P>
A news release from the airline available here Wednesday said
that in addition, at least four Boeing 737-700 will join the
Kenya Airways fleet between June 2001 and February 2003.
</P>
<P>
The investment decision was made recently by the airline's
board in line with its fleet expansion plan. The decision on
further wide body aircraft will be made later for deliveries in
2004 onward with consideration of Airbus A330-200 and Boeing
767-400 ERX.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, the Kenya Airways took delivery of one Boeing
767-300 on a wet lease arrangement with its strategic partner
KLM, a Dutch airline, to replace the Airbus A310-300 which was
lost in the recent accident in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the Boeing 767-300 will provide for early
cockpit and cabin crew training toward the change into Boeing 767
operations, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Airways has also announced its December 1999 results
reflecting an increase of 20 percent increase in passengers

<HEADLINE> International Aid to Angola to Hit 258 Million U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- International humanitarian aid
to Angola in the year of 2000 is expected to reach 258 million
U.S. dollars, according to a report by the official newspaper
Jornal de Angola on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Francesco Stripolli, out-going director of the World Food
Program (WFP) and director of the U.N. Humanitarian Assistance
Coordination Unit (UCAH) in Angola, was quoted as saying that the
humanitarian situation in the war- torn African country is
deteriorating as the number of the displaced people grows day
after day.
</P>
<P>
At present, the number of potential beneficiaries of the
humanitarian aid program is estimated at some two million since
UCAH now can reach some areas previously unaccessible, he said.
</P>
<P>
WFP has enough food to continue the assistance until July or
August, he said, adding that donors have given a positive answer
to the application for a fund of 258 million U.S.dollars.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations originally appealed to the international
community in 1999 for 51 million U.S. dollars for Angola in 2000,
but the plan was revised four to five months later as the
humanitarian crisis deteriorated in Angola as a result of the
rampant civil conflicts.
</P>
<P>
According to stripolli, three million people are now directly
affected by the war in Angola. Two million of them are getting aid
from WFP, he said.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Surge in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed sharply
higher in Tokyo Wednesday on bargain-hunting following their
recent sharp decline.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 231.35 points, or 1.19
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 19,599.18.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
issues on the First Section, added 0.98 point or 0.06 percent to 1,
691.12.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to 805.18 million
shares from Tuesday's 815.48 million shares.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index plunged in early trading on the lingering
negative effects of the bankruptcies of supermarket chain operator
Nagasakiya and L Kakuei, a developer of large-scale suburban
housing complexes.
</P>
<P>
However, bargain-hunting stirred in afternoon trading pushed
the key index up, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Nagasakiya was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Banks rebounded following their recent sharp decline due to the
Tokyo government's proposal to collect more prefectural tax from
large banks operating in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Information and technology issues remained weak, despite
Tuesday's gain on the Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers outnumbered
gainers 656 to 599, with 106 issues unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Computerized Counting for Parliamentary Poll Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran's powerful conservative
Guardians Council has rejected computerized counting of votes in
the crucial parliamentary poll Friday, allegedly to avoid possible
violations.
</P>
<P>
"The Guardians Council has decided that counting of ballots
should be done by hands," the council's secretary Ayatollah Ahmad
Janati announced Tuesday in a letter to Interior Minister
Abdolvahed Musavi Lari, Tehran radio reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Janati said there is not sufficient time to train people how to
use computers for counting votes and so far only a few people know
how to vote in coded system.
</P>
<P>
The council is authorized to screen qualifications of candidates
and supervise elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
Lari announced on Sunday that his ministry had decided to use
computers to count votes so that the result can be announced within
24 hours after the elections, the first time since the 1979 Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
He called on voters to put both the names and codes of their
favorite candidates in ballots in order to speed up the counting.
</P>
<P>
Conservative newspapers have voiced doubts on the accuracy of
the computer programs, and expressed concern of possible collapse
of the computer system and possible contradiction between
candidates' names and codes in ballots.
</P>
<P>
However, Lari underlined that names of the hopefuls would be the
criterion for counting in case of any problems.
</P>
<P>
Janati, however, said that using computers in counting votes is
acceptable for his council and he promised to use the computerized
counting system in future elections as there will be enough time to
train all people how to use it.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6,083 candidates will run for the crucial
parliamentary polling on February 18, the first contest among rival
political parties since the 1979 Islamic revolution. It is expected
to create a new power balance in the country.
</P>
<P>
Iranian reformers have vowed to take over the powerful
legislative body currently controlled by the conservatives, so as
to push forward the reformist programs of President Mohammad
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, who suffered setbacks since Khatami came to
power, threw their weight behind the centralists headed by former
President Hashemi Rafsanjani to elbow the reformers out of the
parliament.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fighting Erupts in Sri Lanka Amid Norwegian Peace Push </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 16 (Xinhua) -- At least 21 combatants were
killed Wednesday in the fierce fighting in northern Sri Lanka
while the island nation expects a boost for peace by the visit of
Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek.
</P>
<P>
Government troops recovered 14 bodies of separatist Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels Wednesday morning after
repulsing the rebels' attack at Paranthan in the Jaffna region,
said Military Spokesman J.D.A. Gunasekara.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said he expected more rebels casualties as they
fled southwards in face of government troops' counterattack to
recapture the lost seven bunkers.
</P>
<P>
Troops suffered seven killed and 12 wounded in the surprise
rebels' attack, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The fresh fighting between government troops and the LTTE came
as Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek is due to arrive in
Sri Lanka Wednesday on a one-day official visit to act as
facilitator to bring about a peaceful resolution to the country's
17-year-old ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
He is due to have talks with President Chandrika Kumaratunga
and Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar centered on the ethnic
issue.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian foreign minister is also scheduled to have
discussions with Opposition Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe before his
departure Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek had talks with Anton Balasingham the political
advisor and theoretician of the LTTE in London, last week on the
possibility of Norway assisting in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The website TamilNet news of the LTTE has quoted Balasingham as

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Praises Indonesian Role in World Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United Nations (U.N.)
Secretary General Kofi Annan Wednesday applauded Indonesia's role
in the world political and economical affairs through the U.N.,the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the South-South
cooperation forum.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.N. would also see the beginnings of closer
cooperation with ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
"You have opted for a foreign policy built not on competition
with your neighbors, not on confrontations with the rest of the
world, but on cooperation and friendship. You have championed non-
alignment and South-South cooperation. You have set an example to
other developing countries," Annan said when giving an address to
the Indonesian Council on World Affairs here.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that Indonesia is capable of (playing a role) in the
field of regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We have witnessed it in the indispensable strength and
direction you have given to ASEAN since its inception -- something
indeed that made ASEAN possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Saying that ASEAN is not only a well-functioning, indispensable
reality in the region, Annan said, "it is a real force to be
reckoned with far beyond the region. It is also a trusted partner
of the United Nations in the field of development."
</P>
<P>
Annan also welcomed the changes toward better direction which
is now taking place in Indonesia, saying that the challenge now
for the country is to build on the democratic institutions that
have so gloriously emerged so that they grow stronger tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> WTO Works Towards More Flexibility: WTO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (
WTO)is working toward more flexibility to build confidence among
members in order to kickstart a new round of trade talks, the
world trade body's chief Michael Moore said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after his keynote speech on the fifth day
of the 10th Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD X), he said people in the WTO began to listen
to what other people want to say.
</P>
<P>
"There isn't enough flexibility to launch (a new round of trade
talks) at this moment," Moore said noting that the WTO is building
confidence among members that the organization can handle more new
obligations, despite the current enormous problems for them to
digest.
</P>
<P>
As for the electronic commerce issue, Moore said that to
develop e-commerce is in the interest of every country, large or
small. "We must make sure that it is not slowed down by unilateral
actions anywhere on tax or tariff," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Refusing or denying the opportunities provided by e-commerce
will be destructive," he added.
</P>
<P>
As for the time to start the new round of trade talks, Moore
said a new round of talks will start when there is "enough
cohesion and enough unity" in WTO.
</P>
<P>
He said the WTO is making steady progress and he is confident
that a breakthrough meeting will be held in the near future.

<HEADLINE> WB Chief Calls For Improving "Rules of Game" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 16 (Xinhua) -- James D. Wolfensohn, President
of the World Bank (WB), called here Wednesday on the world
community to improve the rules of game in international trade.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a general debate during the 10th Session of the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X), the
WK chief said that in order to have a balanced and inclusive world
trade system, special attention should be paid to developing
countries' current problems with the design and implementation of
the rules of the game in international trade.
</P>
<P>
"Developing country membership in the World Trade Organization
(WTO) has risen rapidly in recent years, but membership does not
equate with influence," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that many developing countries lack technical capacity
to negotiate meaningfully. Meanwhile, the rules of the game are
set by the rich and the better-prepared developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"The rules have already been set, for example in the case of
customs valuation procedure, based on developed country models
which can be inappropriate and prohibitively expensive for poor
countries," Wolfensohn said.
</P>
<P>
"if we are to have a balanced and inclusive world trading
system that attracts the adherence of developing countries, much
needs to be done to enhance this capacity to participate in the
rule making process," the WK chief added.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Promises Security for Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has assured both local and foreign investors that the
government will continue to provide security for them to do
business in the country.
</P>
<P>
He made the promise when addressing some investors at Mweya
Safari Lodge in the western district of Kasese, according to a
press release from the President's Office on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Being on a week-long inspection tour in the western region to
assess the security situation there, the president said "the
Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) will defend all the
investments in the war-affected districts. "
</P>
<P>
He assured investors that the rebellion of the Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF) is a small problem that would be resolved
very soon. "Investors in this region should not worry about the
ADF problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president criticized the press for blowing the rebel
problem out of proportion and reaffirmed government's commitment
to improvement in infrastructure and regional development.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the Lusaka agreement in July 1999, the
ADF rebels have been cut off from external support and most of
their camps in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and
western Uganda have been overrun by the UPDF soldiers.
</P>
<P>
ADF rebels entered western Ugandan late last year to launch
publicity attacks, killing dozens of people and displacing tens of
thousands of others.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Records Growth in Agriculture Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's agriculture sector
recorded positive growth last year in real value added from 149
million U.S. dollars in 1998 to 168 million dollars due to
increased output of cash crops, Times of Zambia newspaper reported
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a 1999 economic report released by the Ministry of
Finance, the recovery of the agriculture sector from the
devastating effects of El Nino provided the main thrust for
growth.
</P>
<P>
The increase in production of most crops including cash crops
and good access to inputs during the production period accounted
for the good performance of the sector, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the report read that the livestock production, on the
other hand, was unsatisfactory with most parts of the country
experiencing animal loses.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, poor quality stock feeds and
infrastructure coupled with ineffective marketing strategies also
impacted negatively on poultry production.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected that with the establishment of 3,000
cooperatives countryside, the supply of inputs would improve
coupled with the availability of credit for small-scale farmers.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Says To Resume Delivery Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Delivery of Boeing Co.
aircraft, halted by a week-long strike of engineering and
technical workers, could restart in the coming days, even if the
strike does not end, according to Boeing spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Among the 17,000 employees on strike since February 9, are many
of those certified by the Federal Aviation Administration to clear
aircraft ready for delivery. But, about 5,000 of the employees
have been reporting to work during the strike, and the company
says it hopes it will soon be able to use those employees and
managers to start deliveries.
</P>
<P>
"The process, while moving slower, is continuing," said Peter
Conte, spokesman for Boeing. "We are striving to make some
deliveries in the coming days."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Society of Professional Engineering
Employees in Aerospace, the union representing the strikers,
doubted the company could make good on its prediction.
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe that's possible," said Bill Dugovich,
spokesman for the union. "There are too many checks that need to
be made. They are critical checks. You have to be experienced in
the particular airplane and in the particular part of the airplane
you're checking. The people who are experienced are on strike."
</P>
<P>
Conte said that no talks have taken place since the start of
the strike and none are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Boeing Co.'s commercial airplane unit is
concerned that the nearly week-old strike could hurt a financial
recovery at the airplane unit, the Wall Street Journal reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The aerospace giant planned to deliver 490 jets this year.

The removal of trade barriers makes sense not only for
developing countries but also from the point of view of the richer
countries, he said at the ongoing 10th Session of the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X). To ensure that
trade works in favor of the poor, a framework of rules must be
established to provide stability and predictability to the

<HEADLINE> China Strict on Entry-Exit Inspection, Quarantine in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- China has effectively checked
the flow of viruses and diseases across its borders, because of
its tough hands-on entry-exit inspection and quarantine procedures.
</P>
<P>
The quarantine for hygienic reasons of 2.335 million people
either entering or exiting the country last year revealed 27,000
infected with various epidemic diseases.
</P>
<P>
Some 7,940 groups of harmful organisms were detected last year
as a result of the thorough-going examination of animals and
plants, conducted at a total cost of 22.3 billion yuan (2.7
billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Moreover, approximately 3.4 billion yuan-worth (410 million US
dollars) of imported goods and 290 million yuan-worth (35 million
US dollars) of exported goods were reported as unqualified last
year.
</P>
<P>
After analyzing reports of epidemic situations abroad, China's
inspection and quarantine departments took prompt measures and
properly handled such major incidents caused by chicken flu in
Hong Kong and dioxin in chicken from Belgium and three other
nations of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
These departments also produced a set of monitoring methods,
using newly-applied quarantine regulations by the United States
and Canada, to check China's wooden crates that contain exported
goods.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China adopted emergency quarantine measures against
wooden shipping crates from the U.S. and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country succeeded in treating imported wheat with
the TCK virus, etc.

for cloning and other experiments," said Zhang Xianfeng, an expert
with the Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology under the Chinese Academy
of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
The white-flag dolphin is a large mammal which can only be
found in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, Zhang
said. The species has existed for 20 to 30 million years, and
receives top-level state protection, just like the giant panda.
</P>
<P>
Owing to its weak reproductive ability and the worsening
biological environment of the Yangtze River, the number of the
dolphins has dwindled to an alarming less than 100.
</P>
<P>
Qiqi, who is two meters long and weighs 125 kilograms, is the
only white-flag dolphin alive raised by human beings, and will
soon enter old age. Researchers at the institute have found two
female dolphins suitable as mates for him, but both died before
they could be mated.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that in addition to the genetic information from
Qiqi, they will try to obtain similar material from injured or
stranded wild dolphins, and build a database of cells of white-
flag dolphins to be used for research and experiments in cloning
and reproduction.
</P>
<P>
Cloning is only one way of protecting rare animal species such
as the white-flag dolphin and giant panda, according to animal
protection experts. They hold that endangered animals are best
protected when their natural habitats are improved and they are
better able to multiply in the wild.
</P>
<P>
China has already invested 9.4 million yuan (about 1.2 million
US dollars) in a nature reserve for white-flag dolphins, black-
finless porpoises, and other rare species living in the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that his institute is looking for other domestic
organizations to co-operate in the cloning of the white-flag
dolphin, and will start the experiment as soon as they secure the
start-up costs of 1.5 million yuan (about 180,000 US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Philippine Congress Approves Retail Trade Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine House of
Representatives ratified Tuesday night the bicameral conference
committee report on the Retail Trade Liberation Law, which opens
the country's retail trade industry to foreigners, local newspaper
Today reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The approved measure was a modified version of the original
bicameral conference committee report, which both the House and
the Senate had ratified last month.
</P>
<P>
Under the new version, foreign retailers must now put up a
minimum 7.5-million-U.S. dollar capitalization to own retail
outlets 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
The previous amount approved by Congress was only 2.5 million
dollars. It was the House, which pushed for the higher capital
requirement.
</P>
<P>
As a compromise, the congressmen agreed to delete the 60-
percent foreign ownership limit during the first two years of the
law's effectivity as long as the foreign investor can put up the
required 7.5-million-dollar capital.
</P>
<P>
Foreign retailers who can only afford the 2.5-million-dollar
capital requirement can still do business, but they would be
subject to the 60-percent foreign equity limit.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners with lower capitalization may fully own retail
stores but subject to the following condition:
</P>
<P>
First, each retail branch must have a paid-up capital of at
least 830,000 dollars
</P>
<P>
Second, foreign ownership of a store exceeds 80 percent of
total equity, a minimum of 30 percent must be offered to the
public through the stock exchange within eight years from the
start of operation.
</P>
<P>
Third, foreign retailers acquiring shares of an existing retail
store with a net worth of more than 2.5 million dollars can do so
but subject to the 60-percent maximum in the first two years.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Confident Over Human Right Trial in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- United Nations (U.N.)
Secretary-General Kofi Annan believed that the Indonesian
government could proceed a trial against those allegedly
responsible for human right abuse in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. chief said Wednesday after meeting with
President Abdurrahman Wahid and Vice President Megawati
Soekarnoputri at the presidential palace that if the Indonesian
government fails to meet international aspirations, the U.N. will
see what measures it may take.
</P>
<P>
Feeling sure that the Indonesian government will be serious in
handling such a case, Annan said that the United Nations and the
whole international community are closely watching how the legal
process would proceed. He added that there is no need now for an
international tribunal to be established to bring to justice those
accused of human right violations in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of Defense Juwono Sudarsono said after
meeting with Annan that his ministry and the Indonesian Military (
TNI) would support legal process against human right abusers in
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, Indonesian foreign minister Alwi Shihab
also said that there is no need to establish an international
tribunal to try those allegedly involved in human right abuse in
the breakaway province of East Timor in 1999.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that an international tribunal probably will be
established if the legal process which will be held by the
Indonesian government fails to show general credibility and
international standard.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Wahid, Annan also discussed on East
Timorese refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government expected that the international
community would give their hands to relocate refugees and create
job opportunities for them, Shihab added.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived here Tuesday for a two-day visit to Indonesia. He
met with chairman of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR)
Amien Rais and Speaker of the House of Representatives (DPR) Akbar
Tanjung.
</P>
<P>
Annan is scheduled to leave here for East Timor Thursday
morning.

KUALA LUMPUR, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A Malaysia-built micro
satellite is scheduled to be launched in April or June this year,
Deputy Technology and Environment Minister Zainal Gahlan said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with the Russian Space Agency, the launch
was scheduled for September last year but had to be postponed
because of damage to the main Russian-owned Meteor 3M satellite
and the closure of Kazakhstan's international airport, he told
Parliament during question time.
</P>
<P>
The micro satellite at a cost of 25.3 million ringgit (about 6.
657 million U.S. dollars) was invented and built by Malaysian
space scientists and ground engineers in Britain.
</P>
<P>
He said the actual date of the launch will only be known six
weeks in advance.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Tea Prices Up at Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Prices at Kenya's Mombasa tea
auction stood firm and rose a bit Monday as fears that supply will
be reduced by bad weather in the country, the East Africa Standard
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tea prices rose by between 0.10 to 0.25 U.S. dollars per
kilogram supported by traditional buyers who are nervous about
the future production,
</P>
<P>
trader said at the auction.
</P>
<P>
Tea production is on the decline as a freak frost had caused
damage in the main growing regions in western Kenya while drought
is affecting the crop in eastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
local media reported that the frost hit the major tea-growing
areas in western Kenya two week ago and destroyed between 26,000
to 49,000 acres of tea plantations and forced the closure of
eight tea factories there.
</P>
<P>
Local traders said the next two auctions would have fairly
large offerings with 6.9 million and 6.1 million kilograms
respectively, but offerings in the coming weeks would be expected
to slide.
</P>
<P>
The tea crop is expected to recover if sustainable rains
started now, the frost-affected tea companies said, adding that
the crop will have to pruned.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's tea output fell in 1999 to 248,000 tons due to drought
from 294, 000 tons in 1998 when production was boosted by El Nino
rains.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Fish Exporters Try to Recapture Lost EU Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian fish exporters
are struggling to regain their loss of the fish market in Europe
after they resumed exports in the first week of this month, media
here reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fish exporters now face a laborious task of reassuring European
consumers that loads of fish, being airlifted daily from
Tanzania's northern region of Mwanza and put on their local
markets, are not only palatable but also safe, the Guardian
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The Lake Victoria Fish Processors Association of Tanzania was
quoted as saying that it will take almost a year to recapture the
lucrative EU fish market, which consumed 70 percent of the fish
and fish products from Lake Victoria before the embargo.
</P>
<P>
Exporters from some other countries have filled the vacuum
while the European Union enforced its ban on fish products from
East Africa last March following reports of rampant poison fishing
on Lake Victoria, the largest in Africa. The EU has lifted the ban
on Tanzania last December.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Tanzania's rivals have settled comfortably
and established a strong hold on the fish market in Belgium,
Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources say fish processors in the region managed to
export only 200 tons of fish product during the first week of
operation early this month. They are expected to export between
250 and 400 tons to the EU market per week.

HONG KONG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- I-Quest, Asia's leading
regional provider of broadband Internet networks for the travel
industry, is planning to raise about 1 billion HK dollars (128
million U.S. dollars) by listing on the Growth Enterprise Market
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The listing, tentatively scheduled for April, will be the GEM's
largest initial public offering (IPO). I-Quest would soon submit
its listing application to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, according
to Anthony Blass, chief executive officer of I-Quest.
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the offering would be used to finance global
expansion and for acquiring on-line travel-content providers,
Blass said.
</P>
<P>
"We have been assessing the merits of a GEM versus a Nasdaq
listing for some time," he said. "We have concluded that the GEM
is coming of age quickly and demonstrating itself to be a very
attractive market."
</P>
<P>
I-Quest is connected to 20 hotels in eight Asian countries,
giving it access to about 10,000 rooms. Pending deals with major
hotel groups will take the company's portfolio to more than 100
hotels and 50,000 rooms by mid-2000.

Annan has said that the U.N. applauded the Indonesian
government actions to investigate right violations in East Timor
and stressed that the world is watching to see if a credible
prosecution of those responsible would occur.

accused of crimes committed in East Timor are brought to trial and
are made accountable," he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Moore Pledges to Build Confidence Among WTO Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Mike Moore, Director General
of the World Trade Organization (WTO) pledged here Wednesday to
make greater efforts for building confidence among the WTO members
.
</P>
<P>
As the keynote speaker at Wednesday's general debate of the
10th Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD X) held here on February 12-19, Moore said
building confidence among the members of WTO is a key immediate
objective.
</P>
<P>
He said there are many contacts going on among ministers and
officials from member countries to advance the work in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"We have already made significant progress towards doing so,
but we must show results to establish a durable basis of
confidence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the demands of growing membership, Moore said now
there are 31 applicants, all developing and transition economies.
These demands are positive as they are for a more active WTO, for
more say in world trade polices and for greater share in the
benefits of a global economy.

<P>
BANGKOK, February 16 (Xinhua) -- China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) will make "a great day" of history, and
it should have happened 20 years ago, the trade body chief Mike
Moore said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I am quiet confident we can make it this year," Moore, WTO's
director-general, told Xinhua when answering questions on China's
bid for the WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, China's final entry still depends on
negotiations with a number of countries, such as the European
Community nations and Mexico, which have not formally agreed yet
on the bid.
</P>
<P>
Since China's entry into the world trade body is a complicated
and important thing, Moore said he and the WTO secretariat will
encourage to facilitate it.
</P>
<P>
Moore will go to China on Wednesday night to consult with the
Chinese government on some technical issues which he believes are
imperative.

<HEADLINE> India's Industry to Grow 6 Percent in 1999-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- India's industry will grow
by 6 to 6.5 percent in the 1999-2000 fiscal year as against 4
percent recorded in the previous fiscal, according to estimates of
the Center for Monitoring of Indian Economy (CMIE).
</P>
<P>
The CMIE said that the hike of industrial growth is mainly due
to better performance of consumer durables, textiles, chemical
products, basic metals, machinery and equipment sectors.
</P>
<P>
The overall growth in the first nine months (April-December
1999) of the 1999-2000 fiscal year rose 6.2 percent as against 3.7
percent in the same period of 1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
However, the CMIE said the growth rate could cross the 6 to 6.5
percent mark if the impressive first half results could be
sustained.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government to Accept Referendum Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government
accepts the results of the constitutional referendum and respects
the will of the people as expressed through them, said President
Robert Mugabe on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the nation on the results of the referendum on the
draft constitution, Mugabe said the rejection of the constitution
meant in legal and practical terms that the government business
and national processes would continue to be conducted under the
1979 Lancaster House constitution as amended, local media reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This would go on until such a time the country has an
acceptable, home- grown constitutional framework, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the draft constitution was a sum of ideas that demanded
 painstaking efforts.
</P>
<P>
"It is indeed a rare assemblage of thoughts and views of our
generation seeking and searching for a basic law for the
development of our nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 697,754 people said "no" as compared with 578,210
who said "yes" to the draft constitution in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
"The government took great care to accommodate all interests
and colours in order to make the whole process both truly
democratic and representative of the diversity of our nation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that the referendum was conducted in a
peaceful and orderly manner was a significant step in the
direction of national building and the overall consolidation of a
democratic ethos.
</P>
<P>
He said he had every confidence that the forthcoming general
elections would be just as orderly, peaceful and dignified as the
conduct on the referendum.
</P>
<P>
"Let us all winners and losers accept the referendum verdict
and start planning our way forward," he said.

<HEADLINE> Intel Unveils New Processor Running At Over 1 Gigahertz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corporation Chairman
Andrew S. Grove Tuesday demonstrated a new generation
microprocessor that will be running at 1.5 gigahertz (GHz), or 1.5
billion clock cycles per second, at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
The new chip, code-named Willamette, is a new generation of the
company's 32-bit chip architecture and is expected to be the
eventual successor to its Pentium III line, Intel said.
</P>
<P>
In a demonstration at a forum in San Francisco, the Willamette
chip reached a clock speed of 1.5 gigahertz, which is almost twice
as fast as Intel's fastest Pentium III chip now running at 800
megahertz.
</P>
<P>
Albert Yu, senior vice president and general manager of Intel's
microprocessor products group, said the company had manufactured
the first versions of the chip just one month ago and the new chip
will be available sometime in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
"We will be shipping hundreds of thousands by the end of the
year and millions next year," Yu said at the Intel Developer Forum,
a conference for developers of hardware and software designed to
run on Intel chips.
</P>
<P>
Intel has been locked in a race with its main rival, Advanced
Micro Devices (AMD) Inc., to produce the fastest chip. Willamette,
running at 1.5 gigahertz, would far outpace the processing power
of AMD's recently announced Athlon chip running at one gigahertz.
</P>
<P>
To address criticisms about high costs of fastest chips to
average consumers, Intel Tuesday also gave a demonstration of a
new Celeron chip code-named "Timna", aimed at the lower-end, sub-1,
000-U.S. dollar PC market.
</P>
<P>
That chip would run at speeds of at least 700 megahertz and
also begin shipping in the second half of the year, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Intel said it also plans to ship later this year a chip for
laptop computers that runs at 850 megahertz when plugged in, and
at a lower frequency when on battery.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Advice Vital to Decision-Making </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Advice on various important
state affairs offered by members of the Ninth National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
China's top advisory body, has played a vital role in the country'
s decision-making process, said CPPCC officials.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the past year, 2,904 proposals, or 93.1
percent of the total put forward by the second annual session of
the Ninth CPPCC National Committee, have been responded to by
China's central government. Some 2,538 suggestions, 87.4 percent
of the total, have been accepted or are being considered.
</P>
<P>
Giving suggestions is a major way for members of the CPPCC
National Committee, non-Communist parties and other people's
groups to participate in China's government and political affairs,
and the practice has been supported by the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
During the second session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee,
held between March 3 and 11, 1999, and again after the session, 3,
341 proposals were issued covering a wide range of issues such as
economic development, revitalization of the nation through science
and technology, and environmental protection. Most of these topics
are already on the government's agenda and some are very serious
but have not yet received attention.
</P>
<P>
All the proposals were submitted to the CPC Central Committee,
the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, the State
Council, the Central Military Commission, the Supreme People's
Court, and the governments at provincial levels.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth CPPCC National Committee will start its third annual
session on March 3 in Beijing. "We're trying to improve the system
of proposals and will bring our role of participating in the
government and political affairs into full play," said the
officials.

<HEADLINE> China Plans Center for Endangered Wildlife in Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- China plans to set up a center
for endangered wildlife in the country's longest river Yangtze in
a bid to save several rare fish species in the river.
</P>
<P>
On the at-risk fish list are the white-flag dolphin, cowfish,
paddlefish, Chinese sturgeon, Yangtze sturgeon, mullet, hils
herring and Songjiang weever.
</P>
<P>
The population of the white-flag dolphin, which is considered
a "living fossil" just like the giant panda, has dwindled to less
than 100, about one-tenth of the total of giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
The number of fertile cowfish in the river, the second most
endangered fish after the white-flag dolphin, is also rapidly
decreasing to around 1,000.

<HEADLINE> Moore Urges Developed Countries to Assist LDCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Mike Moore, director general
of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Wednesday urged developed
countries and international agencies to respond collectively to
the problems of the least developed countries (LDCs).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Tenth Meeting of the U.N. Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD X), held here between February 12 and 19,
Moore said the best response to LDCs' problems should be an
integrated response by all donors and international agencies.
</P>
<P>
"We already have the Integrated Framework for trade-related
technical assistance," he said, adding, "This framework represents
an opportunity to do something really valuable for the developing
countries."
</P>
<P>
LDCs account for only 0.5 percent of world trade and are the
most marginalized group of countries in world trade.
</P>
<P>
"They need both free access to markets -- both developed and
among their other developing partners -- and even more importantly,
assistance to build up their institutional and human capacity, and
their infrastructure," Moore said. "This is a moral and an
economic imperative."
</P>
<P>
Moore called for greater efforts to achieve well-designed
programs in and for the LDCs and greater coherence within and
among the international agencies involved in assisting the LDCs.

<HEADLINE> WTO Chief Urges Cooperation Between WTO, UNCTAD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The chief of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) urged here Wednesday a new and more-focused
cooperation between the WTO and the U.N. Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD).
</P>
<P>
Delivering a keynote speech at the 10th Session of the UNCTAD,
Michael Moore, WTO director-general, said the relationship between
the UNCTAD and the WTO is "central to the trade and development
question."
</P>
<P>
The relationship should be a model and a basis for wider and
more productive cooperation among all international economic
institutions, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Developing applied research where the joint expertise of
UNCTAD and WTO -- possibly with other agencies and researches --
could be targeted on issues of trade and development," Moore said.
</P>
<P>
He cited services trade, commodities, manufacturing and
training as potential fields for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He also urged closer cooperation with the UNCTAD and other
organizations on policy development and advice to ensure that "we
are all walking down the same road, with a really positive agenda
that can help developing countries and their peoples become fully
integrated in the world economy."
</P>
<P>
Calling for the best use of the common resources of the
international agencies to build a coherent and integrated approach
to the mutual cooperation with developing countries, Moore said he
is committed to breaking the Berlin Wall between international
institutions.

KUALA LUMPUR, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Corporate Debt
Restructuring Committee has settled 19 cases of corporate debts
amounting to 14 billion ringgit (3.684 billion U.S. dollars) by
February 10, Deputy Finance Minister Chan Kong Choy said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The committee, since its formation in August 1998 following the

restructuring of debts totaling 36.6 billion ringgit (9.631
billion dollars), he told the House of Representatives during
question time.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen cases settled involved companies listed on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE), he said, adding that with their debt
restructured, the companies concerned have been able to plan their
operations more effectively and help expedite the economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said 13 applications deemed not viable were
rejected while the committee is still studying the remaining cases
pending settlement.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Millions at Risk From Rising Seas: Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Huge tracts of Earth's
surface could disappear under rising oceans, creating millions of"
environmental refugees," British climate scientist John Houghton
told a meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
</P>
<P>
The panel, which was set up by the United Nations in 1988 to
investigate the pace of climate change and advise governments on
potential risks, is meeting in Auckland, the biggest city of New
Zealand, with 120 experts participating.
</P>
<P>
Houghton said at the panel Tuesday that one estimate suggests
up to 150 million people may be made homeless as oceans swell with
warmer temperature caused by the greenhouse effect.
</P>
<P>
A rise in sea levels of up to one meter could happen by next
century, affecting areas of Egypt, southern China and Bangladesh,
he said, adding that a rise of one meter would wipe out the homes
of up to 6 million people in Bangladesh alone.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Environment Minister Marian Hobbs gave an opening
speech at the meeting, pledging that her country would honor its
international greenhouse gas control targets and take steps to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions linked to global warming.
</P>
<P>
She said New Zealand will introduce public education programs
on climate change, greater investment in public transport and
stronger energy efficiency measures.
</P>
<P>
At the top of the agenda of the three-day conference, which
will end Thursday, is its next report on climate change, due to be
presented to the United Nations in 2001, according to the New
Zealand Press Association (NZPA).
</P>
<P>
The report will contain an assessment of the pace of climate
change and strategies for governments to deal with it. Two such
reports were already submitted by the panel in 1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
NZPA reported that scientists estimate that greenhouse gas
concentrations in the atmosphere have increased by about 30
percent since pre-industrial times. If the present rate of
emission continues,the amount of carbon dioxide will be double its
pre-industrial level by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Evidence is mounting that emissions of greenhouse gases from
burning fossil fuels, agriculture and deforestation are affecting
climate, it added.
</P>
<P>
There are 160 signatories to the U.N. Climate Convention, an
agreement designed to stabilize greenhouse gases at levels that
would avoid catastrophic climate change.

<HEADLINE> China to Strictly Control Steel Output in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- China will strictly control
its steel output this year to improve the economic performance of
the metallurgical industry, a senior official with the State
Administration of Metallurgical Industry (SAMI) said here today.
</P>
<P>
SAMI plans to produce no more than 110 million tons of steel
this year, and the output of steel products will be restricted
within 100 million tons.
</P>
<P>
In January, SAMI sent seven research teams along with about 50
officials to iron and steel companies nationwide to check up on
the output-control policy. They found that the monthly production
plans of the large and medium-sized companies met SAMI
requirements.
</P>
<P>
China's 46 major iron and steel companies turned out 8.54
million tons of steel in January this year, 226,400 tons more than
planned.
</P>
<P>
The output-control policy has taken effect as steel price in
domestic market stopped dropping and even regained 31 yuan per ton
this January from last year's level. Moreover, the production-to-
sales ratio reached nearly 100 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures from the National Bureau of Statistics show that
China produced 124.26 million tons of steel last year, a 7.5
percent increase over 1998.

<HEADLINE> WTO Chief Calls for Removal of Trade Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 16 (Xinhua) -- More work must be done in
removing barriers to the exports of developing countries, Michael
Moore,director-general of the World Trade Organization, said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The removal of trade barriers makes sense not only for
developing countries but also from the point of view of the richer
countries, he said at the ongoing 10th Session of the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X).
</P>
<P>
To ensure that trade works in favor of the poor, a framework of
rules must be established to provide stability and predictability
to the environment within which trading relationships exist, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Moore said the WTO needs to cooperate with other international
agencies and bilateral donors in providing development assistance
or direct investment.
</P>
<P>
"Trade-related technical assistance must also be brought into
the mainstream of development cooperation and practice," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the World Bank has now firmly implanted trade
development as a priority in its country assistance strategies and
the WTO looks forward to working with it.
</P>
<P>
Moore also said the challenge of globalization is not to accept
or reject it, but "to approach it with realism to see that it has
positive and negative aspects and work to extend the positive
aspects as widely as possible."

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Some of Dhaka's school children
have three times more lead in their blood than the acceptable
level in the United States, a research report released by the
Bangladesh Institute of Child Health said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Institute of Child Health and the Center for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the United States,
tested children between the age of six and 10 in five city schools
to determine the extent of lead poisoning in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Of the 35 children tested on the first day, some blood samples
contained up to 30 micrograms of lead per deciliter while the
acceptable level of lead has been lowered to 10 micrograms per
deciliter in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Children and pregnant women are most vulnerable to lead
poisoning. It can hamper a child's mental and physical growth and
lead to serious blood, kidney, brain and reproductive disorders.
</P>
<P>
Leaded gasoline is the principal source of lead in the
atmosphere. Other sources of lead poisoning include paint, tin
cans,old water taps, folk medicine and cosmetics.

<HEADLINE> WTO Chief Urges Cut in Subsidies for Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Mike Moore, director general
of the World Trade Organization (WTO), called here Wednesday on
the developed countries to reduce subsidies for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Tenth Meeting of the U.N. Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD X), Moore said improved market access and
reduced competition from richer countries' subsidies in
agriculture are crucial for most developing countries both to
develop their present structure of trade and to diversify into
products with potential for new development.
</P>
<P>
"Increased production possibilities in agriculture are also one
key to resolving the problems of rural poverty which assail so
many developing countries," Moore said.
</P>
<P>
He said the slower pace of liberalization in agriculture than
in manufacturing over the years and the continuing high barriers
and distortions in many markets are a severe handicap to the
expansion of developing countries in the field of trade, even
though the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture has begun to
reduce some of these distortions.
</P>
<P>
Members of the WTO are now going ahead with negotiations to
open up new opportunities in agriculture, Moore said, adding that
these new opportunities, if seized to the full, will benefit the
rural poor in the poorest countries throughout the world.

<HEADLINE> WTO Back on Track: WTO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (
WTO)is back on track with regained support and solidarity,WTO
Director-General Mike Moore said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I am here to tell you that the sensationalists and the
merchants of doom have been proved wrong," Moore said in his
keynote speech at the 10th Meeting of the U.N. Conference on Trade
and Development.
</P>
<P>
He said the first WTO General Council meeting on February 7 and
8 produced important positive decisions because participants
showed a renewed determination to work together to make the rules-
based trading system work for all its members, large and small,
rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the new division in the world, he said that in this
complex and paradoxical world the division shows in the form of
distinction between inclusion and marginalization and between
those who are inside and those who are outside the modern, global
economy.
</P>
<P>
He described freedom of trade, economic diversification,
investment and development of human resource as the key elements
that distinguish truly "developing" countries from"underdeveloped"
or even "underdeveloping" countries.
</P>
<P>
He urged international agencies to help create a more favorable
environment to promote infrastructure and investment in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Trade and trade policy must play its role in this process, as
part of a wider scenario. It is no good having just a Geneva-
driven process responding to short-term tactical and negotiating
considerations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that trade policy should not be superimposed on
development policy but should reflect development objectives in a
realistic and coherent way.

<HEADLINE> Drug Material Seized in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities seized
a total of 205 kilograms of ephedrine powder, a kind of raw
material used in producing amphetamine stimulant drugs, in the
country's second capital of Mandalay last month, official
newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The seizure was made by a combined team of the local
intelligence unit and police force when they searched the houses
of five local people in Mandalay's Chanmyathazi township on
January 21 and 25.
</P>
<P>
Action is being taken against the five under Myanmar's Narcotic
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Law, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar seized 6,336
kilograms of ephedrine along with 28.75 million tablets of
stimulant drugs in the country in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Stimulant drugs were first found trafficked in Myanmar in 1996.
In the past four years, the authorities have confiscated a total

<HEADLINE> Indian Army, Air Force Begin Exercises in Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Army and Air
Force have begun a major joint exercise in the Thar desert, about
100 kilometers inside the international border, local media
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, code-named "Operation Vijay Chakra," is being
held in the Suratgarh area in the tri-junction of Punjab, Haryana
and Rajasthan, with the army's strike corps, elite paratroopers
and frontline combat jets participating, India's major English
newspaper The Hindu reported.
</P>
<P>
Though the exercise was described by an Indian Army spokesman
as a "routine" one conducted by command and corps formations every
year, it has evoked strong reaction from Pakistan, whose military
labeled it as an "unannounced Indian exercise near the Punjab
border."
</P>
<P>
However, The Hindu quoted Indian Army sources as saying the
exercise is only being held at the command-level, which does not
entail providing advance information on the hotline between the
director generals of military operations of both armies.
</P>
<P>
Another major English newspaper in New Delhi, The Indian
Express, reported that the Indian Army forces participating in the
exercise include an infantry division and an armored brigade with
about 20,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
Equipped with T-72 main battle tanks and supported by
mechanized infantry, the army strike corps is practicing lightning
deep-penetration tactics in "almost real battle conditions," The
Hindu reported, adding that the army is also testing its latest
telecommunication equipment and battlefield computers.
</P>
<P>
Aircraft to be used by the Indian Air Force in the exercise
include frontline MiG-29s, Mirage-2000s and ground support MiG-27s
and MiG-23 jet fighters, medium-lift Il-76s and An-32s and some
attack helicopters, both newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 22 countries, including the United States,
Britain, Italy, Egypt, Iran, Nepal and North Korea, are witnessing
the exercise, according to The Indian Express.

<HEADLINE> Manila Rejects Rebel Group's Cease-fire Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
rejected the demand of the country's rebel group the New People's
Army (NPA) for a cease-fire to pave the way for the release of an
army major and a policeman, Business World said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the National Peace Forum (NPF) Tuesday, Presidential
Adviser on the Peace Process Manuel Yan and NPF Chairman Haydee
Yorac both noted that there is a need to define the conditions for
the declaration of a suspension of military operations.
</P>
<P>
They said the government is not likely to give in to the demand
of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), the
NPA's political wing, for an "unconditional" suspension of
military operations.
</P>
<P>
NPA rebels are now holding captive Army Major Noel Buan and
local police Chief Inspector Abelardo Martin. Both were abducted
in Quezon, Metro Manila, late last year.
</P>
<P>
NDFP consultant Jose Ma Sison said earlier that the two
captives would be released only if the military would stop its
offenses.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sorsongon Bishop Jesus Varela resigned Tuesday as a
government peace negotiator, apparently disappointed by the
military's refusal to halt offenses against the NPA.
</P>
<P>
The NPA is one of the two major rebel groups in Mindanao. It
suspended its peace talks with the government after Manila
approved the Philippine-U.S. Visiting Force Agreement in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
The other rebel group on the southern Philippine island is the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), whose peace negotiation with
the government is also stalled by their continuous military
clashes.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen will pay a goodwill visit to Myanmar soon, according to an
official announcement here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It will be Hun Sen's first visit to the country after Cambodia
was admitted into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (
ASEAN) in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar resumed diplomatic relations with Cambodia in August
1994 and since then the two countries have striven for all-round
development of their bilateral ties of friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In January 1996, the then Cambodian First Prime Minister Prince
Norodom Ranariddh came to Myanmar and an agreement was signed on
establishment of a joint commission for cooperation between the
two governments.
</P>
<P>
Later in October that year, Than Shwe visited Cambodia, during
which three agreements were inked on tourism cooperation, air
services and establishment of sister cities between Bagan (Myanmar)
and Siemreap (Cambodia).
</P>
<P>
In January 1997, Hun Sen, then Cambodia's second prime minister,
toured Myanmar, during which one more agreement was concluded
between the two countries on cooperation in the field of culture.
</P>
<P>
In March 1999, Myanmar opened its embassy in Phnom Penh, one
month before Cambodia joined the ASEAN.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia: Suspension of Flight Ban Result of Public Pressures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia said in a
statement on Tuesday that the suspension of the flight ban by the
European Union is a result of pressures exerted by the European
public, which Belgrade hopes will eventually force the U.S. and
the European Union to lift all sanctions imposed on it.
</P>
<P>
EU foreign ministers decided on Monday to suspend in the next
six months a ban on commercial flights to Yugoslavia imposed
during the Kosovo crisis, while tightening restrictions on
Yugoslav leaders to travel to other European countries.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry said in the statement that the
flight ban had caused heavy economic losses to all major European
airlines, and therefore the European Parliament and other
international organizations have made louder calls for an end to
the flight ban against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The EU council of ministers attributed the lifting of the ban
to its concern for ordinary citizens in Yugoslavia, which
indicated the EU has come to realize that the Yugoslav people are
the victims of the sanctions imposed by the West, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the public opinions in Europe have seen more
clearly that the U.S.-led NATO invasion against Yugoslavia is an
anti-Europe act and that the U.S. policy of sanctions is "damaging,
illegal and inhumane."

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Requests Honduras to Withdraw Army Camp From South Islet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan Vice Foreign
Minister Jose Adon Guerra Tuesday requested Honduras to fulfill
its promise to dismantle the army camp on the South Islet in the
Caribbean zone.
</P>
<P>
"We hope Honduras honor the commitment which Nicaragua is
honoring," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Ministers of Nicaragua and Honduras agreed last week to
withdraw all military forces from the conflicting Caribbean zone.
The forces were established after September 1, 1999, to decrease
tension between them.
</P>
<P>
Honduras ratified in November a maritime limits treaty with
Colombia and Nicaragua, and assured that the treaty cuts 130,000
square kilometers off its continental shelf in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, on Sunday, Nicaraguan military chief, general Joaquin
Cuadra, appealed in the newspaper "La Prensa" to Honduras to
withdraw its military force from the islet.
</P>
<P>
"They have 30 days to withdraw from the South Islet to return
to the position they were before the ratification of the Ramirez-
Lopez by the Honduran Congress," Cuadra said.
</P>
<P>
 The general also said that his country's armed forces know
how to fight and they have the modern technology to do so.
</P>
<P>
 The Honduran government strongly reacted to the appeal by
Cuadra, considering it "hostile and warlike."

<HEADLINE> Trees Relocated For Urban Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese people have expressed environmental concerns when
they see construction workers relentlessly pulling down big trees,
some of which are hundreds of years old.
</P>
<P>
East China's Jiangsu Province has, however, resolved the
problem with new gardening techniques. Gardeners said that roots
of old trees should be protected when they are uprooted.
</P>
<P>
For trees like pine and gingko which can live for hundreds of
years, relocation is not such a problem. However, trees such as
the Chinese parasol with a life span of only several decades are
vulnerable to resettlement.
</P>
<P>
Gardeners have discovered that the best season for trees to be
resettled is in late winter and early spring.
</P>
<P>
In Xuzhou, another city in the province, the government
recently announced that it will move one million trees with a
diameter of more than 10 cm from the countryside to urban areas.
Only few years ago, authorities in the city were reprimanded for
cutting down a number of trees to make way for urban construction.
</P>
<P>
In Yangzhou, city planners built an "island" for protecting two
ancient gingko trees along a street that was to be widened.
Although Yangzhou residents have applauded the efforts of the
government to protect the two trees, the "island" has affected the
flow of transportation along the street.
</P>
<P>
Last year, when Yangzhou widened another old street, it did not
build an island. Rather it used gardening techniques to
successfully relocate the old trees.
</P>
<P>
Government officials in the province said that China's tree
resettlement techniques will be important for urban planners in
other countries, especially as urban expansion continues to
increase rapidly.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Oil, Gas Production Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar produced a total of 2.
805  million barrels of crude oil and 1.4 billion cubic-meters of
natural gas in the first 10 months of 1999, showing a drop of 2
percent and 4.37 percent respectively compared with the same
period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar opened to foreign investment in late 1988,
foreign investment in the oil and gas sector from Australia,
Britain,France, Indonesia, Japan, Thailand and the United States
has reached 2.3 billion U.S. dollars in 46 projects, accounting
for 32.39 percent of the total foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
So far, Myanmar's petroleum and its products are still
insufficient to meet its own demand and it still has to import
from abroad. The country annually buys in 280,000 to 300,000 tons
of crude oil and 100,000 to 150,000 tons of diesel oil, according
to official statistics.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Makes Progress in Drug Fight in 1999  by Duan Tingchang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar made progress in
fighting against narcotic drugs in 1999 based on achievements made
in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official figures issued by the country'
s Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC), during 1999,
the Myanmar authorities seized 272.94 kilograms of heroin, 1,447.
55 kilograms of opium, 274.48 kilograms of marijuana, 278.97
liters of phensedyl and 28.75 million tablets of stimulant drugs
and destroyed 12 heroin refineries.
</P>
<P>
In the 1999 opium cultivation season, the authorities destroyed
a total of 3,979 hectares of poppy plantations scattered in the
country's Shan, Kayah and Kachin states and Mandalay division.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar also burned up in the year a total of 5,116 kilograms
of narcotic drugs seized in the past.
</P>
<P>
As a follow-up of the successful transformation of the Mongla
region, eastern Shan state of the country, into a drug-free zone
in April 1997, Myanmar started in 1999 implementing a plan aimed
at total elimination of cultivation, production and abuse of
narcotics in the whole country in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which includes poppy eradication and crop
substitution, is being carried out in three five-year phases.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar authorities claimed that there were 41,336 hectares
of opium poppy cultivation in the country in 1999, declining by 31
percent, while narcotics production dropped by 38 percent compared
with the previous year due to expanded cultivation of substitute
crops.
</P>
<P>
To show its achievements in drug control in the country,
particularly in Shan state, and to educate its people on the
danger of narcotic drugs, Myanmar started building another drug
abuse control museum in Kokang's Laukkai area in 1999 next to the
one being built since July 1998.
</P>
<P>
Besides cooperating with its neighbors and countries in the
region in drug abuse control, Myanmar also cooperates with the
United States, carrying out joint poppy field surveys in 1999 for
the fifth time in the country's Shan state under the two countries
' anti-drug program.
</P>
<P>
Although Myanmar has made achievements to some extent in drug
eradication, it still has a long way to go in this aspect.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar CCDAC recently admitted that success in drug fight
was not achieved as anticipated due to insurgency and security
problems.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar believes that the goal of total elimination of poppy
production in 15 years will be achieved sooner rather than later
if there is assistance from the international community.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A group of U.S. agricultural
producers, on a week-long visit here starting last Saturday,
expressed on Tuesday their rejection to the holding of Cuban child
Elian Gonzalez in Miami.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Gladys Williams, from the state of
Georgia, expressed his disapproval of Elian's relatives in
Miami for giving only gifts, not love, to the boy.
</P>
<P>
James Harris, also from Georgia, regarded the policy of his
country as "hypocritical", which "takes a child away from his
father when at least 32,000 American children are abandoned."
</P>
<P>
Anna Marie Cordario, who lives in New Jersey, is also in favor
of the returning of the child. According to her, 72 percent of
Americans are holding the same opinion.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued off the coast of Florida on November 25 last
year after a boating accident that took the lives of his mother
and nine other Cubans. He has been kept in Miami by his relatives
ever since. However, Elian's father and four grandparents, who
live in Cuba, want him back.

JAKARTA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) is approaching three big companies to arrange
sponsorship funds to prepare Indonesian athletes for the 2000
Olympic Games in Sydney in September.
</P>
<P>
KONI official in charge of planning and budgeting Togi Mangara
Hutagaol said KONI has yet to sign memorandums of understanding

KONI's expenses for the Olympic training programs.
</P>
<P>
"Up to today (Tuesday), I still can't say anything. We will

saying.
</P>
<P>
KONI needs about 6.9 billion rupiah (958,000 U.S. dollars) to

<HEADLINE> China to Build Three More Ecological Museums </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- China will build three more
ecological museums in southwest China's Guizhou province in the
next two years, following the success of the first "museum without
walls" set up there in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to provincial officials, construction of the three
museums is a major part of a Sino-Norwagian cultural cooperation
program.
</P>
<P>
The ecological emphasis is a new concept in museums which aims
to protect the natural and cultural legacy of communities.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 300 ecological museums worldwide, most
of them located in Europe and North America. The first was built
in France in 1971.
</P>
<P>
China's first ecological museum, the Suoga Miao Ethnic Group
Ecological Museum, opened in October 1998 to protect the folk
culture of the Changjiao Miao ethnic group, a branch of the Miao
nationality.
</P>
<P>
The three museums under construction in this underdeveloped
province feature unique cultural styles and customs of different
ethnic groups living there.
</P>
<P>
The first is the Buyi Ethnic Group Ecological Museum. The
village, with a history of over 400 years, was a fortress during
the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
The second is the Ancient Longli City Ecological Museum.
Because of its isolated position, the 600-year-old city was well
preserved and villagers have preserved their unique traditions.
</P>
<P>
The last is the Anzhai Dong Ethnic Ecological Museum, where
Miao people's peculiar huts and bridges are well cared for and
their folk songs are tourist attractions.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
found carbonized rice from Neolithic ruins in Ziyuan County of
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The discovery is the first of its kind in Guangxi. Previously,
carbonized rice from ancient times was only reported to have been
found in Hunan and Guangdong provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Neolithic ruins were first discovered by local villagers in
1996. Archaeologists from Guangxi conducted two large-scale
excavations of the ruins in 1998 and in 1999 and found a large
number of valuable cultural relics including stone implements,
potsherd and ceramic pots, cylindrical holes, fishing net pendants
and stone arrows.
</P>
<P>
The carbonized rice was found inside a broken ceramic pot. The
blackened rice grains are oblong and similar to present-day non-
glutinous rice. The exact date of origin of the rice is yet to be
determined.
</P>
<P>
Cylindrical holes are different in size and in depth, but are
lined up according to a certain rule. The largest hole has a
diameter of 20 cm.
</P>
<P>
Yan Wenming, a professor of archaeology with the prestigious
Beijing University, said that people living near the ruins should
have mainly relied on farming and hunting for survival.

BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC) announced Tuesday that all its
airplanes made by McDonnell Douglas (MD) have passed examinations
into potential mechanical problems, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The CAAC said all reports from its subordinate airlines which
own MD airplanes suggested that all 50 of their MD produced
airplanes are in good mechanical condition.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, following a report that an US Alaska Airline
registered MD-80 crashed into the Pacific Ocean due to mechanical
problems, CAAC ordered all its subordinate companies to conduct
urgent examinations on all MD planes, said the English language
daily.
</P>
<P>
All the domestic MD airplanes are now operated by China Eastern
Airlines and China Northern Airlines, based in Shanghai and
Shenyang respectively.
</P>
<P>
The stress of this examination is the balance systems or
horizontal stabilizer of MD made airplanes.
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, the crash of Alaska's MD-80, which killed more than
80 people, was caused by its balance system.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from Boeing China Inc indicate that there are no MD-
80 airplanes operating in China.

<HEADLINE> Former Indonesian Leader Still Too Ill: Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Former Indonesian President
Soeharto was too sick to face a corruption investigation, Soeharto
's medical team said.
</P>
<P>
Head of Soeharto's team of defense lawyers Juan Felix
Tampubolon handed over to the Attorney General's Office a medical
statement signed by neurologist and head of the Soeharto medical
team Teguh A.S.Ranakusuma on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Physically and mentally, Soeharto cannot undergo further
investigation," Tampubolon quoted from the medical statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not give details of the ailments.
</P>
<P>
Tampubolon said the medical team, comprising 23 specialists,
could not say if and when the ailing Soeharto would be fit enough
to be questioned.
</P>
<P>
"It's the medical team's authority to decide. In my opinion,
although my client can walk and write, he would not be able to
understand the substance of the questions," he was quoted by the
Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was last week named a suspect in a widening corruption
probe and summoned for questioning on Monday. However, he failed
to show up for questioning, with his lawyers contending that he
was too ill to answer the summons.
</P>
<P>
The Attorney General's Office immediately demanded a formal
medical diagnosis explaining Soeharto's illness.
</P>
<P>
The office also considered seeking a second opinion from
independent doctors, or alternatively conducting the investigation
at Soeharto's residence.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who was forced down in May 1998 after 32 years in
power,is accused of massive corruption and power abuse. However,
he has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

LOME, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Burkina Faso sacked their Belgian
coach Rene Taelman on Tuesday after the national soccer team's
poor performance in this month's African Nations Cup, according to
reports reaching here from Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
Burkina Faso Football Federation spokesman Abdoulkarim Traore
told state television that the team's results under Taelman were "
unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
Burkina Faso were knocked out in the preliminary round of the
tournament. However, the country reached the semifinals when they
hosted the previous Nations Cup finals in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Burkina Faso, who played against Egypt, Zambia and Senegal in
group C, managed only one point in the tournament from a 1-1 draw
with Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia To Turn 41,300 ha of Farmlands Into Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
in northwest China plans to invest 8.74 billion yuan (1.05 billion
US dollars) to turn 41,300 ha of farmlands into grasslands and
forests in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
According to regional officials, the initial stage of the
project will turn 21,500 ha of farmlands into grasslands and
forests from 2000 to 2004. The second stage will turn another 19.
800 ha of farmlands into grasslands and forests from 2004 to 2009.
</P>
<P>
The government will compensate farmers who give up their
farmland.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia's soil erosion accounts for 80 percent of the country's
total. Each year, over 100 million tons of sand is washed into the
Yellow River, China's second longest river.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating environment caused by soil erosion and
desertification has led to regular natural disasters, causing huge
economic losses.
</P>
<P>
If the 10-year project is completed by 2009, Ningxia's
grasslands will increase by 45,100 ha and forest coverage will
increase by 43,000 ha.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that grasslands and forests will help prevent
some 50 million tons of sand from being washed into the Yellow
River.

CHENGDU, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Scenic spots Dujiangyan and
Qingcheng Mountain in southwest China's Sichuan Province deserve
permanent protection, experts with the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) announced after a
recent tour of the two places.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, the State Council approved the application of
Dujiangyan and Qingcheng Mountain for both the natural and
cultural world heritage lists.
</P>
<P>
The 2,256-year-old Dujiangyan Dam, 40 kilometers northwest of
Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province, is the world's oldest water
control project still operating, irrigating 667,000 hectares of
farmland. Qingcheng Mountain is one of the country's four famous
Taoist mountains.
</P>
<P>
To protect the spot from human destruction, the central and
local governments have invested 180 million yuan to move 1,200
families living in the two areas and to tear down dilapidated
buildings.
</P>
<P>
"It is the utmost desire of China to make the Dujiangyan-
Qingcheng scenic spot better known throughout the world and place
it on the world heritage list," said a Chinese cultural relics
expert.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The per-capita disposable
income for urban residents in south China's Guangdong Province
reached 9,125.92 yuan (about 1,100 U.S. dollars) in 1999, up 4.9
percent from 1998, when adjusting for inflation.
</P>
<P>
The per-capita consumer spending was 7,517.81 yuan last year, a
rise of 8.3 percent from 1998, said a bulletin released by the
Urban Areas Investigation Team of the Guangdong Provincial
Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Though food consumption took the lion's share of the per-capita
spending of urban residents in Guangdong last year, spending on
transportation, telecommunications, education, tourism, health
care products and purchase of homes and construction of houses
also went up drastically, said the bulletin.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the per-capita spending for home-buying or
construction of houses was 595.69 yuan in 1999, up 35.6 percent
from 1998, while that for transportation and telecommunications
climbed by 30.4 percent to hit 811.88 yuan.
</P>
<P>
By late 1999, urban residents in Guangdong had more motorcycles,
personal computers, video compact disk players, microwave ovens
and cars than they had at the end of 1998, said the bulletin.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Province is a forerunner of China's reform and

SHANGHAI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- China has ended its unified
purchase and sale of silver and opened the silver market for the
first time since 1949.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-based Huatong Nonferrous Metal Trading Center has
been designated as the first market to operate silver trade in the
country since January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Silver had long been considered a special commodity in China,
and the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, had
been in charge of its unified purchase and sale.
</P>
<P>
As silver supply exceeded demand in the past decade, the
central government announced its decision to allow silver to be
traded on the open market at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
After the opening of the market, the country will encourage the
export of silver and limit the import.
</P>
<P>
China produces about 1,300 tons of silver annually and consumes
some 800 tons a year.

SHANGHAI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese doctor who has
helped at least two men without penises to resume normal sexual
activity and even become fathers was recently awarded the Shanghai
Science and Technology Prize, a top prize by the Shanghai
Municipal People's Government.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Kaixiang, 45 and associate professor of the No. 9 People'

malignant tumor was found on the other man from east China's
Shandong province.
</P>
<P>
Cheng uses skin and muscles from the patients' forearms, thighs
and stomachs to reconstruct the penises. According to Cheng, the
procedure not only will increase the diameter and length of the
newly-constructed organ, but repair all sexual nerves.
</P>
<P>
The new technique has been formally named after Cheng, whose

an incident involving George Boateng during Middlesbrough's home
game against Aston Villa," read an FA statement.

Paul sustained a serious injury himself from the incident.
Everyone within the game will wish him a speedy recovery.

LONDON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer
club Newcastle United manager Bobby Robson has begun his St James
Park clear-out by placing 13 players on the transfer list.
</P>
<P>
They include Scottish winger Stephen Glass, who requested to be
transfered last week, and Croatian striker Silvio Maric.
</P>
<P>
Former Magpies boss Kenny Dalglish signed Glass for 650,000
pounds, but injuries had limited the midfielder to just two starts
this season.
</P>
<P>
Glass felt that he had not been getting many first-team
opportunities under the management of Robson.
</P>
<P>
Maric was signed by Ruud Gullit for 3.5 million pounds, but has
failed to live up to fulfill his promise.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian has made few starts since making his debut last
February, appearing only once for the club since December.
</P>
<P>
The other players who have been tranfer-listed are goalkeepers
John Karelse and Lionel Perez, defender Carl Serrant, striker Gary
Brady, who signed from Spurs, and midfielder Des Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the list is made up of reserve-team players, Ian
Martin, James Coppinger, Steven Caldwell, Paul Talbot, Paul

<HEADLINE> NBA's New Stars Open a New Chapter (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- With new stars emerging in
nearly every event, NBA All-Star Weekend was one of the better
ones in recent memory. It also drew some powerful parallels to the
one six years ago in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
Both followed the retirements of Michael Jordan and featured
large contingents of new faces. But while the 1994 midseason
showcase did nothing to establish a new league icon, this one did
in Vince Carter.
</P>
<P>
The league trudged through its post-Jordan apocalypse of
flagging excitement and sagging ratings in the mid-1990s but seems
better equipped for revival on the second try, simply because it
has more young stars than it did six years ago.
</P>
<P>
"This is -- like it or not -- a sort of a post-lockout, post-
Michael coming out All-Star Weekend," said NBA commissioner David
Stern.
</P>
<P>
For better or worse, Jordan's departure has allowed the
spotlight to fall on a number of younger players, from Carter to
Tim Duncan to Allen Iverson to Kevin Garnett. Perhaps more
important, it has given plenty of teams the belief they can win in
a league that for so long had been dominated by the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
"If Michael Jordan's in the league, it's hard to pay attention
to anybody else," said Iverson, whose first All-Star Game was a
smashing success.
</P>
<P>
"He's the greatest player to ever play the game. So it would be
hard for anybody to get attention. With him one and not being in
the league, we get a chance to step up and try and make some
things happen for ourselves. It kind of puts a new identity out
for people to recognize."
</P>
<P>
"I think it's good," added Jerry Stackhouse, another first-time
All-Star. "I think a lot of teams packed it in sometimes, thinking
that it was just the Bulls and no other teams could compete with
the Bulls. I think that's no longer the case. I think it makes it
interesting for the players and the teams and for you guys, too."
</P>
<P>
Following Jordan's first retirement, the 1994 All-Star Game
featured a record 10 first-time All-Stars. Among them were future
stars Gary Payton, Alonzo Mourning and Latrell Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
Also in that group were one-time wonders such as Kenny Anderson,
B.J. Armstrong, Mookie Blaylock, Derrick Coleman and Horace Grant.
There was less focus on Jordan and the Bulls and these players and
their teams clearly benefited.
</P>
<P>
However, none have returned to the All-Star Game and all have
been traded at least once since. Their inability to sustain that
level of play showed how important Jordan's magnetism was to the
league.
</P>
<P>
"When he left the game it probably opened up opportunities for
the younger players to get more recognition," said Glenn Robinson,
yet another first-time All-Star. "But I don't know if that's a
good thing or a bad thing."
</P>
<P>
In Jordan's absence, the game suffered. Remaining stars such as
Scottie Pippen, Hakeem Olajuwon, Patrick Ewing and David Robinson
did not have Jordan's charisma, and ones who did, such as
Shaquille O'Neal and Charles Barkley, did not have his
championship pedigree.
</P>
<P>
Coupled with the emergence of smashmouth basketball, interest
in the NBA waned until Jordan returned in 1995. Iverson was a
freshman in college at the time but learned a valuable lesson.
</P>
<P>
"People talk about us being Generation X and we're the guys who
are going to fill Michael Jordan's shoes and Magic (Johnson) and (
Larry) Bird. It will never happen," he said. "There will never be
another Magic Johnson, there will never be another Bird, there
will never be another Michael Jordan. Those shoes cannot be filled.
"
</P>
<P>
Iverson may not be giving himself and his fellow new-jack
swingers enough credit. Aside from Jeff Hornacek, just about
everybody who made an imprint on All-Star Weekend was a member of
the 25-and-under set.
</P>
<P>
This All-Star Weekend was the first since Jordan's second
sendoff, which again created an infusion of new blood. There were
nine first-time All-Stars in Sunday's game, matching the second-
most in history.
</P>
<P>
Among the nine, only Dale Davis and Rasheed Wallace may turn
out to be one-year wonders. Carter, Iverson and the rest figure to
be making return engagements for quite some time. Stackhouse
believes he has benefited most from Jordan's retirement.

<P>
"With him being gone, that might be my spot (on the team)," he
said. "At the 2 guard, Michael Jordan or Jerry Stackhouse, I don't
think I'm gonna win that one. With him being gone, it's opened the
doors for guys like myself to come in and showcase myself and
hopefully take this next millennium to some new heights.
</P>
<P>
Carter did plenty of that himself with his performance in the
Slam Dunk Contest that probably was the best in the 15-year
history of the event.
</P>
<P>
"It's helping me as far as popularity is concerned," he said.
</P>
<P>
For substance with style, Carter has drawn frequent -- and
unfair -- comparisons to Jordan. However, it is Duncan who assumed
Jordan's throne as a winner after leading the San Antonio Spurs to
the NBA title last season.
</P>
<P>
Duncan and the Spurs may be the defending champions but they
are by no means a dynasty in the making. They won their title
following a 50-game sprint of a season, and injuries and
inconsistency have brought them back to the pack.
</P>
<P>
There are about eight or nine teams that have a chance to reach
the NBA Finals, which ultimately is good for the overall health of
the league and could not be said when Jordan was around.
</P>
<P>
"It sets the table for somebody else to come in and take on
that role of being the dominant team in the league," Stackhouse
said. "Right now there's no dominant team, but you win a couple
championships and then you're the team to beat. That should be the
drive that keeps everybody hungry."
</P>
<P>
If the 1990s proved anything, it was that fans were perfectly
content following one player as a way to follow the NBA. The TV
ratings for Sunday's game were down over 30 percent from 1998,
many of Jordan's contemporary stars are aging and fallout from the
lockout has been a major obstacle.
</P>
<P>
"Every eight or nine years it gets like that, where the game
changes and all the great players who played for 11 or 12 years
finally retire," Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
It's time for the NBA to commit the Jordan era to the video
archives and move on, with players such as Carter, Iverson and
Duncan leading the way.

<HEADLINE> NBA All-Star Game Ratings Hit Lowest Ever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The television rating for
the NBA All-Star game was the lowest ever, according to a report
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
NBC's coverage of the Sunday night's game between the West and
East got only 6.9 rating and 12 share, Nielsen Media Research said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
That was down 35 percent from the last All-Star game, two years
ago, which had a 10.6 rating and 17 share. The All-Star game
arranged for last year was canceled due to the lockout.
</P>
<P>
The rating also was down 35 percent from the previous All-Star
game without Michael Jordan in 1995. When Jordan returned, the
ratings jumped to 11.7/20 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the low rating for an NBA All-Star game was a 7.8,
for CBS in 1979 and for NBC in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The rating is the percentage of television households in the
United States tuned to a program, and each point represents 1,008,
000 homes. The share is the percentage watching a broadcast among
those televisions on at the time.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Centralists Urges Support for Moderate Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran's biggest centralist party
on Tuesday urged the nation, particularly the youth, to support the
moderate policy of former President Hashemi Rafsanjani by rejecting
both the radicals and the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
"Political developments should be carried out in a healthy
condition without sabotaging, insulting and defaming each other,"
Faezeh Hashemi, a senior member of the centralist Party of
Constructive Executives of Iran (PCEI) said at a grand rally of
over 6,000 teenagers.
</P>
<P>
Hashemi, Rafsanjani's feminist daughter, strongly criticized
both the leftist reformers and the rightist conservatives for
their "extremist" stances.
</P>
<P>
However, her speech was interrupted by slogans and whistles of
supporters of the Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF) headed by
Mohammad Reza Khatami, the reformist brother of President Mohammad
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
"With Hashemi (Rafsanjani), political developments impossible,"
the IIPF supporters shouted.
</P>
<P>
Hashemi rejected the suggestion that Rafsanjani's re-entry to
the Iranian parliament will be a hindrance to the reformist process
initiated by President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the rally, she said that despite of the
difference between her party and the reformers, the moderate
coalition of reformers and centralists will win the Friday polling.
</P>
<P>
She expressed belief that her father will be able to win the
post of the Majlis speaker, which Rafsanjani had held for 10 years
after the 1979 Islamic revolution till he was elected president in
1989.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, Rafsanjani will be the speaker," an Iranian electric
student told Xinhua at the rally, "even if he will not be the top
winner in Friday's elections."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the difference between the PCEI and the IIPF, she
said the PCEI holds moderate policies while the IIPF has adopted
radical stance.
</P>
<P>
The student voiced confidence that Rafsanjani, if elected Majlis
speaker, can cooperate with Khatami in a favorable way.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian reformers refused to put Rafsanjani in their lists
of candidates and urged Rafsanjani to give way to newcomers to push
forward Khatami's reforms.
</P>
<P>
However, the powerful conservatives, who still control the
country's most important organs but have suffered serious setbacks
in recent years, put their strength behind Rafsanjani in their
election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives have lost their strength and will become
minority in the parliament, Faezeh Hashemi said, adding that they
support Rafsanjani only because of his mild stance.

<HEADLINE> Africa to Set Sub-regional Institutions to Promote Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- African countries will set up
two private sub-regional financial institutions, the Africa
Renaissance Bank and Africa Technical Co-operation Fund, to unite
the West African countries.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Minister of African Co-operation and Integration
Jerry Gana said on Tuesday, "the bank is intended to be
essentially a private sector institution, with the African private
sector playing the central role, while African governments will
only be facilitators and supporters."
</P>
<P>
The minister told a press conference in the Nigerian capital
Abuja that this is based on the premise that "African integration
must be private- sector driven if it is to succeed."
</P>
<P>
The Technical Co-operation Fund "will provide the necessary
financial resources to promote and encourage an effective science
and technology exchange between Nigeria and other African
countries".
</P>
<P>
This would also help to reverse the brain-drain by attracting
back home thousands of African scientists and technology experts
from the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Gana also revealed that a proposed private sub-regional
airline, the Ecoair, is expected to take off in the mid year,
coinciding with the 25th anniversary of the 16-nation Economic
Community of West African States.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the need for greater African integration, Gana
said " if we fail to integrate now, we will be the greatest loser"
 when other big powers are getting closer.
</P>
<P>
Gana noted that for these efforts to yield the desired goal,
African countries must stem their inter-state conflicts and
respect the people's rights through good governance and sticking
to democratic principles.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Calls for Massive Turnout in Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Tuesday called on all eligible voters in the country to
cast their ballots in the coming 6th parliamentary elections slated
for Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech, Khatami said Friday is a decisive day for
the Iranian people to express their strong interest in independence
and freedom.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian people, through casting their ballots, will not only
contribute to safeguarding the sovereignty of the country but will
also offer the greatest help to their president and government in
realizing the nation's lofty objectives, Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
He added Friday will mark a great epic if people from all walks
of life, including women, men and youngsters, massively took part
in the elections.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the 6th Majlis through elections will be a
historical event for the Iranian people, said Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Majlis supervises all organs and institutions on behalf of the
people and it is a symbol of democracy and it is "our need of today
and tomorrow," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The stronger the presence of people on the scene of the
elections, the better the Majlis, which will represent the national
will and interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami added that besides Muslims, all other compatriots,
including Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians, should attend the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports said 6,083 eligible candidates are to contend for
the 290 seats in the new Majlis.
</P>
<P>
If pro-reform parties win the majority in the currently
conservative-dominant Majlis, it will be viewed as a great push for
President Khatami's democratic movement.

ATHENS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday expressed its
concern over developments in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo,
which has seen rising violence between NATO-led peacekeepers,
ethnic Albanians and Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Parliament, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis

"I'm going to push this as hard as I can. I want to get the

<HEADLINE> Britain Backs Tanzania to Benefit from IMF Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Wednesday
assured Tanzania of benefiting from the debt relief initiatives
supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The British Director for Development Mark Lowcock made the
assurance in meeting with Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa in
Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has fulfilled all conditions for Highly Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) debt relief packages set by the IMF and the World
Bank, the British official said.
</P>
<P>
Lowcock said that Britain has been impressed by Tanzania's
achievements in economic reform and poverty reduction, and
renewed its support for funding development projects in the
country.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa said that his country has embarked on the
liberalization and privatization of some public sectors. But
without additional resources, such as debt relief from HIPC
initiatives, nothing can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and the World Bank qualified Tanzania for HIPC
initiatives last year.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's external debt now stands at around 8 billion U.S.
dollars. It spends more on debt servicing than education and
health combined.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Condemns Extremism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo Tuesday condemned any kind of extremism, as
characterized by the activities of the Oodua People's Congress
(OPC), the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) or states
adopting Sharia legal system.
</P>
<P>
He made the blame in Abuja, the country's capital, when meeting
visiting Norwegian Prime Minister, Kjeli Magne Bondewith who
arrived in the country Tuesday on a two-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
But, according to the Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper
published on Wednesday, the president told his guests that the
OPC, which is believed to be behind the recent bloody ethnic
clashes in Lagos, was originated as a bulwark against the
inordinate self-succession bid by the late General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Although OPC was established for that purpose, the body had
grown militant and had become uncontrollable by its founders, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"How did OPC originate? To my mind, I believe it originated as
an adjunct of what they call NADECO to fight Abacha if he
insisted his bid to succeed himself.
</P>
<P>
"Those who created the body (OPC) can no longer control it; and
now the police are helping them to control it."
</P>
<P>
"We have greater problem than the problem of ethnicity. What
people are concerned about is extremism. It could take any form -
Sharia, nationalism, tribalism, any form and it cannot be in
accordance with the aspiration of this country," said the
president.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Senate Passes Long-Delayed Anti-Corruption Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Senate has passed an
anti- corruption bill submitted more than half year ago by
president Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking governmental official Wednesday confirmed to
Xinhua that the bill was passed on Tuesday in Abuja after making
some key amendments.
</P>
<P>
According to the first bill sent to the National Assembly, the
country's top legislature, by Obasanjo after taking power, a
special commission is to be set up to root out and punish
corruption.
</P>
<P>
The Senate amendments include a provision for appointing a
special prosecutor to investigate allegations against a president
or vice-president, and a requirement that appointments to the
commission be reviewed by the senate.
</P>
<P>
The bill had already been passed by the lower house and an
agreed version will now have to be worked out before it is

<HEADLINE> S. African Business Hails Trade Deal with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- South African business
community Wednesday welcomed the removal of the final hurdle in
the implementation of a free trade agreement between South Africa
and the European Union (EU), which they believe will boost South
African export.
</P>
<P>
South African Chamber of Business chief executive Kevin
Wakeford described it as a victory of "pragmatism."
</P>
<P>
However, he said South Africa should draw lessons from the
dispute with EU and be more vigilant in all future dealings on
trading regimes.
</P>
<P>
The South Africa Foundation's economist Philip Black said the
deal will boost South Africa's trade with the EU, which will also
counteract the weakening euro.
</P>
<P>
The free trade agreement signed last October in Pretoria should
have come into effect on January 1.
</P>
<P>
However, Italy and Greece rejected to ratify the accord if
South Africa continued to use the two spirit trademarks of
"grappa" (a brand used by Italian liquor producers) and "ouzo" (a
brand used by Greek liquor producers).
</P>
<P>
The EU Monday submitted a compromise proposal to South Africa,
saying the trade deal could not be implemented unless South Africa
agreed to phase out using of "grappa" and "ouzo" in five years.
The South African cabinet Wednesday has accepted EU's proposal.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Plane Hijack Costs Britain 3.6 Million Pounds:Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- British police said on
Wednesday that the cost of dealing with last week's Afghan plane
hijack at London's Stansted airport was about 3.6 million pounds(
some 5.8 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The police in Essex county, near the Stansted airport, north of
London, the force that helped bring the four-day hijack to a
peaceful end last Thursday, said it had asked for confirmation
that the cost would be met by a special Home Office contingency
fund.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Home Office said on Wednesday it expected more
than 70 of the freed hostages to request political asylum in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Among the 164 people on board the Ariana Airlines Boeing 727
plane, 73 have flown back to Afghanistan and 91 are still in
Britain, 14 of them charged with hijacking offenses.
</P>
<P>
The plane was hijacked shortly after take-off from Kabul and
arrived at Stansted on the early morning of February 7, after
stops at two central Asian airports and Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Most Public Schools in U.S. Have Internet Connections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1999, on average there were nine students for every one
instructional computer with Internet access nationwide. The
previous year, on average, the ratio was 12 students for each such
computer, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Classroom computer hookups have increased 20-fold since 1994,
from 3 percent to 63 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said schools provide Internet access to their pupils
in varying ways. For example, some schools have large computer
labs that give students individual time on the Internet during
their school day.
</P>
<P>
Public schools also upgraded their network connections and the
speed at which they are able to connect. By 1999, schools were six
times as likely to use faster dedicated-line networks (63 percent)
or other high-speed technologies (23 percent) than simply dial-up
connections (14 percent).
</P>
<P>
"Technology can improve student performance and provide the
competitive skills necessary for future success," said Education
Secretary Richard Riley. "It is critical that we provide a link
for those in the smallest towns to the largest cities."
</P>
<P>
"We need to continue our efforts to ensure that all schools and
students have equal access to the vast network of information on
the Internet," Riley said.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, who has set a goal of connecting all
Americans to the Internet, not just classrooms and libraries, has
proposed for the fiscal 2001 budget a 2-billion-U.S.-dollar tax
incentive package over 10 years, as well as 380 million dollars in
expanded federal grants, to encourage the private sector to donate
computers, sponsor community technology centers and train workers.

<HEADLINE> Barshefsky Says China's WTO Membership Helps World Peace, Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barshefsky, testifying before the U.S. House Ways and Means
Committee, said the U.S. must "recognize how important a stable
and peaceful relationship with China is -- for the world, the
Chinese, and ourselves."
</P>
<P>
"And thus we have a fundamental responsibility to find and act
upon areas of shared interest and benefit," she told the panel.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States signed a landmark agreement on
China's entry into WTO last November in Beijing and the deal needs
to be approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
"China is the world's largest country, and over the past decade
the world's fastest-growing major economy. The future course of
our relationship will have great bearing on American security and
strategy in the 21st century, and in this regard WTO accession
offers us a great deal," Barshefsky told the congressmen.
</P>
<P>
"It will create a new and fundamentally reformed trade
relationship with the world's fastest-growing major economy, which
offers practical, concrete benefits to cities and rural areas
throughout America," she added.
</P>
<P>
China's WTO membership will also help the country's economic
growth, she said. "It will promote deeper and swifter reform
within China, strengthening the rule of law and offering new
opportunities and hope for a better life to hundreds of millions
of Chinese."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the hearing, several other congressmen also
expressed their support for the U.S.-China deal and a permanent
Normal Trade Relationship (NTR) status for China, saying that it
will help the United States to gain more access to the Chinese
markets and help maintain a stable relationship between the two
big countries.
</P>
<P>
"It's a great opportunity," said Jim Moran, a Democrat
representative of Virginia. He affirmed that the U.S. should not
try to isolate China by refusing to allow the country to enter WTO.
</P>
<P>
Representative Earl Blumenauer said the agreement on China's
WTO membership "advances United States economic interests with
little or no risk to us" and offers "tremendous up-side benefits"
by expanding new markets for the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Congress will end its annual debate on resumption of normal
trade relations status with China when the WTO deal is approved.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congressmen Urge end to Economic Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Members of the U.S.
Congress joined Arab American groups Wednesday in calling for an
end to the economic sanction against Iraq, as it was another kind
of weapons of mass destruction that kill children.
</P>
<P>
A parade of Congressmen, flanked by Muslim and Arab activists
at a rally outside of the Capitol, condemned the sanctions against
Iraq as a filed policy that had caused soaring infant mortality
and killed hundreds of thousands of ordinary Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
"This embargo hasn't hurt Saddam Hussein... but has been
devastating for millions of Iraqi people," Democratic
Representative David Bonior said at the rally.
</P>
<P>
"Our message is simple. We're saying millions of children are
suffering and we refuse to close our eyes to the slaughter of
innocents," he added.
</P>
<P>
The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) applauded
the moral leadership of these members of Congress in support for
the end of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"We applaud the moral position taken by these members of
Congress, and are gratified by the growing support for the lifting
of sanction," ADC President Hala Maksoud said. "This sensitive
response to the plight of the Iraqi people will be the yeast for a
future of understanding between the American and Iraqi peoples.
Such courageous leadership will constitute the grounds on which
reconciliation can be built."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed sanctions against Iraq in 1991 right
after the Gulf War. The sanctions have lasted for nine years and
there is no sign to be lifted because of the U.S. refusal of doing
so.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations itself estimates that more than a million
Iraqis have died, directly or indirectly, because of the economic
sanction. Among them, several thousand children were reported to
die daily from malnutrition and lack of adequate medicines.
</P>
<P>
Pressure in Congress for a review of U.S. support for the
embargo against Iraq has intensified in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
In January, 70 members of Congress, led by Representative Tom
Campbell, sent a letter to President Bill Clinton urging him to de-
link economic sanction from the military embargo against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come to turn a new page in our dealings with Iraq,
" the letter said. "The people of Iraq should be allowed to
restore their economic system."

<HEADLINE> Bank of Canada Warns of 3 Percent Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Canada expects the
country's inflation to rise to 3 percent in the first quarter of
the year, as an effect of the on-going economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
In a winter update to its annual monetary conditions report,
the bank said Wednesday that rising oil prices will help boost
inflation to three percent, with core inflation expected to run
about two percent.
</P>
<P>
The country saw its inflation rate at 2.6 percent in December,
with a core rate at 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The red-hot U.S. economy and strong domestic demand are major
contributors to the Canadian economic expansion, which may trigger
inflation up to the top of the bank's target band of one to three
percent, indicated the update report.
</P>
<P>
The bank, which raised interest rate by a quarter of one
percentage point to 5.25 percent two weeks ago, does not rule out
further act as a pre-emptive step to keep a lid on consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
The bank forecasts a 3.7 percent growth in the country's
economy for the year 2000, following the third-quarter expansion
of 4.7 percent and a well-expected 4 percent increase in the last
quarter of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Blue Chip Stocks Fall While Tech Shares Rise Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Blue chip stocks fell on fear
of higher interest rate Wednesday while tech shares continued to
advance on the Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 156.68 at 10,561.
41. The blue chip index got strong rallies in the past two
tradings.
</P>
<P>
But the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 6.88 at 4.
427.65. Broader stock indicators were mixed and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 14.38 at 1,387.67.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index fell as the Commerce Department reported that
housing construction surged in January despite a rise in mortgage
rates. The surge, together with the high oil price which has
hovered around 30 U.S. dollars per barrel since Monday, added to
worries about inflation and higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised rates four times since last June
in efforts to keep inflation under control. Analysts believed the
rise in housing construction and the hike in oil price would
prompt the Federal Reserve to raise rate again this year.
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola, Procter &AMP; Gamble and Home Depot all led the Dow
lower.
</P>
<P>
A earnings report from Applied Materials sent the Nasdaq into
positive territory. The index rose as mush as 56 points before
trailing off in late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Applied Materials, a leading maker of chip-manufacturing
equipment, said it earned 80 cents per share in the final quarter
of 1999, topping the expectation of three cents per share.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 5.91 at 604.97. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 7.93 at 902.25 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 7.52 at 547,76.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,728 down, 1,322 up and 463
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 1.01 billion shares from 1.09 billion
in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Electoral Race Reaches Climax in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- With only two days left before
Friday's parliamentary elections, candidates from Iran's two rival
factions on Wednesday raced against time in garnering more support.
</P>
<P>
With a looming deadline for election campaign at 0900 local time
(0530 GMT)on Thursday, reformist and conservative hopefuls
intensified their campaign efforts by shuttling between rallies and
gatherings with leaflets pouring into houses.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6,083 candidates are to run for seats in the expanded
290-seat Majlis, or parliament. For the first time since the 1979
Islamic revolution, political parties and groups with different
tendencies are actively involved in the elections.
</P>
<P>
The capital city Tehran and other major cities have undergone
face lift for the coming elections. Big signs and pictures of
candidates are seen all along the streets, with most of the walls
covered by election posters carrying mottoes and political views of
different parties.
</P>
<P>
University and high school students are busy with distributing
leaflets and brochures on the streets. Rival hopefuls are wasting
no time in making speeches at public gatherings and arranging
meetings with the press.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, the Shiroudi sports complex located near the
former U.S. embassy in downtown Tehran has become a center for
large-scale student gatherings. Thousands of students from colleges
and high schools convened almost daily in the stadium to show
support for their favorite candidates.
</P>
<P>
Singing, dancing and whistling, the fervent students chanted
slogans, waved colorful flags when their invited candidates gave
inspiring speeches. Even music bands and singers are invited to add
to the feverish atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
In some provincial cities, candidates even lease gliders to
distribute their campaign brochures, photos and tracts, an act
unprecedented in past elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers with different political backgrounds published lists
and photos of their favorite candidates, fueling a hot debate about
which parties or political groups could win a majority in the
Majlis and who could be the next parliament speaker.
</P>
<P>
Ten newspapers of the moderate coalition "May 23 Front" even
announced their own list of candidates, urging the people to vote
for reformers in order to push forward the reform programs
initiated by President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The "May 23 Front," formed by 18 leftist and centralist groups
to mark Khatami's victory in 1997, vowed to win the crucial polling
to speed up the pace of Khatami's political reforms.
</P>
<P>
"Iran for all Iranians," reformist groups quoted Khatami's
speech as their motto in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, who still dominate the country's most
important organs but suffered serious setbacks in the past two
years, warned the people against dangers threatening the Islamic
revolution and Islamic values.
</P>
<P>
Despite the ban on being involved in election campaigns, the
state-run radio and television spared no efforts in broadcasting
speeches of late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini
and the current leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, reminding the people
of the Islamic principles.
</P>
<P>
Even relatives of martyrs of the Islamic revolution and the
eight-year Iran-Iraq war (1980-88) were invited to make speeches
defending the values of the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The centralists, following a dispute with the reformers over the
candidacy of former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, announced their
priority on economic reforms instead of "the radical call" of the
reformers for political developments.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the dispute, local and foreign analysts believed the
coalition of the reformers and centralists will defeat the
currently dominant conservatives, which enjoy support from the
supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, the current chairman of the powerful arbitral and
advisory State Expediency Council, is believed to take over the
post of Majlis speaker, which he had held for almost 10 years
before he was elected president in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Reports say over 38 million of the country's 63 million people
will be eligible to cast their votes at 36,000 polling stations in
28 provinces across the nation on Friday.
</P>
<P>
No matter what the result is, the Friday voting will leave
important impact on the political course of the country, observers
said.

"I'm going to push this as hard as I can. I want to get the
earliest possible vote I can. And I cannot tell you how important
I think it is," Clinton told a press conference at the White House.
</P>
<P>
After years of negotiations, the United States and China signed
an agreement that set a stage for China's accession to WTO last
November. The agreement needs to be approved by the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
Urging Congress to approve the legislation, Clinton said the
issue is "a huge national security issue," citing reasons that it
will help reduce U.S. trade deficits with China; China will
cooperate more in other international forums.
</P>
<P>
"I think that if we -- if we didn't do this, we would be
regretting it for 20 years," Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"And I think 10 years from now we'll look back, and no matter

is what we did, and what we did was the right, the honorable and
the smart thing to do for America over the long run," he added.

during a meeting with Venezuela's Vice President, Isaias Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez told the press on Wednesday that it was but a
suggestion, not a concrete proposal.
</P>
<P>
United States has failed on occasions in its attempts for
Venezuela to allow it to perform antinarcotic overflights.
</P>
<P>
"For Venzuela, the concept of sovereignty is of great
importance, and from this viewpoint we'd be ready to cooperate, to
look for a way out of the drug problem, always when it doesn't
harm our sovereignty", said Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
Pickering also met with President of the Law Commission, Luis
Maquilena and Foreign Minister Vicente Rangel.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: N.Irish Parties Fail to Make Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Northern Ireland peace
process remains deadlocked despite the efforts of the British and
Irish prime ministers to regain political momentum at a series of
meetings with the province's political leaders.
</P>
<P>
But after discussing how to move forward following the
suspension of the assembly last Friday, both British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, said
all the parties have recommitted to the principles of the Good
Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
They were speaking at a joint press conference after three
hours of separate meetings at Downing Street with the Ulster
Unionists, Sinn Fein and the Social Democratic and Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
Blair said last Friday's second report by the international
arms decommissioning body, indicating movement from the IRA on
disarmament, was a "big advance."
</P>
<P>
Blair said there had been a "setback" but devolution had been
working in Northern Ireland, and it could work again "because the
people wanted it to work."
</P>
<P>
He said the parties had been discussing the "perimeters of what
the problem is and how we can resolve it."
</P>
<P>
The Irish prime minister said all the parties had expressed
their wish to see the current problems arising out of the impasse
over the arms issue and the assembly suspension overcome as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister (Blair) and I are both convinced there is
no other reasonable alternative other than the implementation of
the Good Friday Agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from Downing Street, Northern Ireland's former first
minister and leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, David Trimble,
insisted the peace process could only progress forward if the IRA
moves on decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said, "The ball is still firmly in their court -- we
have done all that we can do."
</P>
<P>
After his meeting, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams offered little
hope of any progress.
</P>
<P>
Adams re-stated his call for the reinstatement of the assembly
and insisted there was no basis for putting the peace process into
review.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I see no basis for their being a review -- the way to
sort this out is to make politics work."
</P>
<P>
"The institutions have been torn down and the Good Friday
Agreement has been torn up," Adams added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking earlier, Adams said he would do everything possible to
prevent a return to violence in Northern Ireland after the
statement by the IRA that it was no longer prepared to work with
General John de Chastelain's international disarmament body.
</P>
<P>
He added, "It is a huge crisis that we are in because a
government has unilaterally and illegally broken a commitment."
</P>
<P>
But Downing Street has said Blair has no intention of restoring
the suspended power-sharing institutions until the IRA indicates
how and when it will begin handing over its weapons.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's official spokesman denied a claim by
former Irish Prime Minister John Bruton that the meeting between
Blair and Ahern Wednesday had been originally set up for Blair to
announce a timetable for the resumption of devolution for Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The IRA announced Tuesday it was breaking off contact with the
body supervising arms decommissioning and withdrawing offers it
had made on the weapons issue.
</P>
<P>
It said it made the decision because of the suspension of
Northern Ireland's short-lived power-sharing institutions last
Friday over the decommissioning impasse.
</P>
<P>
The decision, although adding to the current gloom surrounding
the political deadlock in Northern Ireland, is not viewed as an
immediate threat to the IRA ceasefire.

<HEADLINE> Cuba, South Africa Sign Work Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Labor Minister Alfredo
Moraya Cartaya and his South African counterpart, Mbathesi
Mladiana, signed Wednesday in Havana a labor cooperation accord.
</P>
<P>
According to the accord, Cuba will bring to South Africa
experience on work security, social help and employment.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, 50 percent of the labor mass lacks employment
due to the segregational structure imposed by the disappeared
apartheid regime, according to local authorities.
</P>
<P>
Mladiana described the accord as a considerable step toward the
strengthening of ties between both nations in labor issues and
South Africa's yearning for its workforce's professional and
technical improvement.
</P>
<P>
Mladiana and his delegation arrived here last Sunday and plan
to go back to their country Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Stable Oil Prices in U.S. Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Wednesday that stable oil prices were needed to help keep
the U.S. economy strong, adding he would not rule out using the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve toward that end.
</P>
<P>
"I think what is in our interest are stable prices that are not
too high, but don't drop real low," Clinton said at a news
conference at the White House. "I have not ruled out any action
which I think is in the interests of the American people."
</P>
<P>
Moderate oil prices are "also in the interest of producing
countries," he said. "I think the OPEC (Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries) members understand that, and there is an
interest in stable prices."
</P>
<P>
OPEC members are banking big profits now but also realize they
could feel the impact if the world economy slows as a result of
oil prices that are too high, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"If the economy goes down, that would lower the price and they
would end up with the worst of both worlds," he said.
</P>
<P>
The oil prices at the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped to
more than 30 U.S. dollars a barrel on Monday for the first time
since the 1991 Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has released some 175 million dollars to
help low-income families to pay their heating bills.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced Wednesday that he has directed the immediate
release of about 125 million U.S. dollars more to help poor
families pay their heating oil bills, and would ask the U.S.
congress for 600 million dollars more to help families with
moderate incomes.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration will dispatch Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson on a fresh round of oil diplomacy this weekend to try
and persuade major producers to increase their output.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tobacco Farmers Sue Big Cigarette Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. tobacco farmers filed
a 69-billion-U.S.-dollar lawsuit against major cigarette makers on
Wednesday, claiming the industry conspired to undo a U.S.
government-administered quota system designed to prop up prices
for tobacco leaf.
</P>
<P>
The suit, which names Philip Morris Cos. Inc.; R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Holdings Corp.; Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., a unit
of British American Tobacco Plc; and Loews Corp.'s Lorillard
Tobacco Co., marks yet another battle waged in the courts against
an industry already facing the specter of potentially paying out
billions of dollars in damages.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit charges, among other things, that the tobacco
companies have "conspired, contracted and combined to eliminate
the federal statutory scheme regulating the quantity of tobacco,
called 'quota,' that may be grown annually and cheated the farmers
and quota holders out of fair settlement under the Growers Trust,"
plaintiffs' attorneys said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Cigarette companies have manipulated the U.S. tobacco
regulatory system in a private, subterranean effort to control the
purchase of domestic cigarette tobacco in violation of the
antitrust laws," according to the plaintiff's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
"They used their combined power to eliminate the long-standing
quota system by themselves, without any involvement by Congress to
ensure that such a drastic restructuring occur only in tandem with
appropriate compensation for growers and quota holders," the
attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris, rejected the claims as "entirely hollow."

<HEADLINE> McCain Wins Endorsement of Former Rival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican
presidential candidate John McCain Wednesday won endorsement of
Gary Bauer, a former rival who withdrew from the presidential race
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
McCain is "the best shot" to win the White House, Bauer said at
a rally at Furman University in South Carolina. "With great pride
and without any hesitation I am proud to be here to endorse John
McCain."
</P>
<P>
Bauer also praised the Arizona senator for promoting a
political system "built on civility and decency and honor."
</P>
<P>
McCain hoped Bauer's endorsement would help him win the support
of some conservative voters in the February 10 Republican
presidential primary in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
Recent polls showed that McCain, who is running an insurgent
campaign, was running neck-in-neck with Republican presidential
front-runner George Bush in the closing days before Saturday's
crucial primary.
</P>
<P>
Bauer, who was an official in the Reagan administration before
becoming an activist in anti-abortion and conservative causes,
quit the Republican race after finishing last in the New Hampshire
primary with about 1 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, Bush's campaign revealed it had spent a record
50 million dollars in the Republican nomination fight so far,
almost twice as much as McCain.
</P>
<P>
McCain and Bush held their final debate before the primary
Tuesday night, accusing each other of negative campaigning.
