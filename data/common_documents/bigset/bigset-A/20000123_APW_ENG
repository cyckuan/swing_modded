<HEADLINE> GOP Candidates Squabble Over Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Hitting every corner of this sprawling state,
Republicans squabbled over abortion and taxes in a fight for their conservative
base Saturday, as presidential candidates in both major parties braved nasty
weather to rally supporters to Iowa's caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every vote matters!'' said GOP front-runner George W. Bush, who attempted
to burnish his anti-abortion credentials for a third consecutive day. The Texas
governor pledged to keep the abortion plank in a staunchly conservative GOP
platform.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday night, about 10 percent of the state's 1.8 million registered
voters are expected to gather in living rooms, schools, church basements and
fire stations to announce their support of candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Few convention delegates are at stake, but the real reward in Iowa and the
Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary is momentum: Campaigns can take flight or lose
altitude in the first two contests of the presidential year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to make a good showing maybe and surprise a lot of people,''
said former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, the sole rival to Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president holds a wide lead over Bradley in Iowa polls and has
broken out of a long-running tie in New Hampshire surveys. ``I'm not quitting,''
Bradley told supporters in Maquoketa. ``We're going forward. We have another
day.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley and Bush received a boost when The Des Moines Register, Iowa's
largest newspaper, gave them its editorial endorsement in Sunday editions.
</P>
<P>
	   Regarding Bradley, the Register said it was a close call, but ``there is a
fundamental decency about (Bradley) that would bode well for healing the
festering partisian wounds that have produced virtual stalemate in our national
government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, it said, ``speaks with conviction of not wanting to leave anyone
behind in America. He expresses more concern for low- and moderate-income
Americans than do most of his Republican rivals.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president played an expectations game of his own design. ``What are
the expectations if Senator Bradley scored a victory? Expectations in the event
that occurred would be that he would do exactly what he said he would do and
take as his model for leadership style ... Ronald Reagan,'' the vice president
said at a Fort Dodge rally.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's irregular heartbeat, a minor condition that dominated his campaign
for the better part of two days, did not come up in a question-and-answer
session in Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was more of a problem.
</P>
<P>
	   A wintry mix of wind and snow made Bradley's motorcade ride through eastern
Iowa a perilous one. The plane carrying Steve Forbes, one of five Republican
candidates stumping the state, made two false approaches to the Mason City
runway and pulled up quickly each time as his pilot had trouble in the murky
weather.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane landed on the third attempt. Forbes emerged safe but shaken.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The weather couldn't stop us, and the political establishment is not going
to stop us,'' he said
</P>
<P>
	   In one of the day's more colorful events, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah gave a
foreign policy address in a barroom full of reporters and set the lowest of
expectations for a six-man field: ``I'm going to have to do better than sixth
here, it seems to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion is a major issue for many caucus-goers, who tend to be more
conservative than voters as a whole. That may be why the topic came up often at
GOP campaign events Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer, who needs a strong third place to bolster his sagging campaign,
suggested that Forbes is a recent convert to the anti-abortion movement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not a Steve-come-lately that believed something three years ago and
believed something different today,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Turning his sights on the front-runner, the Washington activist said,
``Governor Bush is completely out of step with the party he wants to lead.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everytime you get into a discussion about this issue and someone tries to
pretend that this pro-abortion regime is compatible with our constitution, you
ask them this question,'' Alan Keyes, who is making a surprisingly strong bid in
Iowa, said in a separate appearance. ``How does it secure the blessings of
liberty to unborn children in the womb and in our future that we kill them in
that place of birth?''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, like most Republican voters, is opposed to abortion but he does not
stress it on the campaign trail. He is looking ahead to the general election,
when the issue tends to alienate swing voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Pressed by reporters, the Texan said he was in favor of a party platform
that recommends a constitutional amendment banning abortion. ``I think that the
Republican Party ought to keep its pro-life plank,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes accused Bush of pandering. ``I think it's too little, too late. It's
almost typical for an establishment candidate to suddenly realize he has to say
something so he does something like this,'' Forbes said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's anti-abortion position does not extend to cases of rape, incest and
when the mother's life if in danger. Those exceptions are not in the plank, but
Bush said the details of the amendment could be worked out later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first step is to convince Americans that we ought to value life,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides say the governor has made his support of the plank clear in the past,
but questions arose after Bush ducked a question about the platform in a recent
debate.
</P>
<P>
	   A memo sent to hundreds of supporters by his campaign says: ``While Governor
Bush respects those with differing views, he believes the current Republican
Party platform plank on abortion is an important statement of pro-life ideals,
and he does not believe it should be changed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign picked a long-distance fight over taxes, suggesting that
Arizona Sen. John McCain's tax-cutting package would undermine charitable
giving. McCain is the only GOP candidate not competing in Iowa, choosing instead
to focus his campaign on New Hampshire. He is, however, on the Iowa ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is a provision that would close what McCain calls a ``loophole''
that allows people who give contributions in forms of stock, real estate, bonds
or art work to get tax deductions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it is important to encourage an outpouring of giving in America,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain wants to use money from closing the loophole to cut taxes for
middle-class Americans, while Bush is worried about ``a few wealthy Americans
who can get a tax cut when they're done looking at an old painting,'' McCain
spokesman Howard Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a satellite address to the 27th annual Conservative Political Action
Conference in Washington, Bush said McCain sounds like a Democrat. A straw poll
conducted by the group gave Bush 42 percent, Keyes 23 percent, Forbes 14
percent, McCain 11 percent, Bauer 3 percent and Hatch 1 percent.

Elian's Grandmothers Appeal to Reno for Help
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers told Attorney General Janet
Reno "how much they are suffering" over the 6-year-old's continued stay in the
United States and appealed for help Saturday in reuniting the youngster with his
father in Cuba. Reno, who has supported Elian's return, said in a written
statement the grandmothers "made a very compassionate and heartfelt plea" but
that the matter now is in federal court. The grandmothers returned to New York
City later Saturday night. In Cuba, meanwhile, authorities estimated that
150,000 people rallied Saturday night to demand the boy's return.

Italian Military Holds Fashion Show
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ROME (AP) -- Twirling their capes on the Spanish Steps on Saturday, models
showed off the carabinieri military police's first uniform redesign since 1814
-- a high-heeled makeover for women's entry to Italy's armed forces. Italian
designer Rocco Barocco handled the changes for the 186-year-old military police.
He included such alterations for women as holsters that skim the hips. The
differences "are details that you can't explain but you notice," Barocco said.
Italy in September became one of the last countries in Western Europe to accept
female volunteers in the military. Women remain exempt from conscription.

Ecuador Names New President

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador's vice president
assumed the presidency of this small Andean nation Saturday -- ending, at least
for now, a political crisis that exploded when Indian protesters aided by a
cadre of junior military officers seized power and ousted a highly unpopular
president. Vice President Gustavo Noboa's sudden ascension came after Ecuador's
military chief, buckling to U.S. pressure, dissolved a three-man junta that had
claimed power just a few hours earlier. Noboa becomes the sixth president since
1996 in this troubled nation, which has suffered years of political and economic
turmoil.

Chileans Demand Trial of Pinochet
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Several hundred people marched through downtown
Santiago on Saturday to oppose the release of Gen. Augusto Pinochet from
detention in Britain and demand that he be tried for human rights abuses. The
peaceful demonstration was called by human rights groups and relatives of
victims of repression under Pinochet's 1973-90 dictatorship. Pinochet was
arrested in London 15 month ago on a warrant by judge Baltasar Garzon. The
demonstration came as the British government sought more information from the
parties in the case before deciding whether to free the 84-year-old former
dictator for health reasons or send him to Spain.

Judge Bars DVD Copier From Websites

	   SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- A judge has ordered Web site operators to stop
disseminating a program that makes it easy to copy DVD movies and audio discs, a
victory for the digital video and film industries. The software, called DeCSS,
allows users to unlock the security code on DVDs and copy movies to personal
computers. A DVD trade group sued the Web site operators, alleging theft of
trade secrets. Internet activists said the decision abridged the Web site
operators' free speech rights, but the judge disagreed.

their undefeated streak to seven with a 5-5 tie with the Toronto Maple Leafs on
Saturday night. Simon, who scored only three goals last season when he was
limited to 23 games by injuries, has 13 this season. His NHL-career best is 16

three-point play with 64 seconds left, as the Philadelphia 76ers beat the
Indiana Pacers 103-97 Saturday night. In a rematch of Indiana's four-game
playoff sweep in last year's second round, the Sixers held Reggie Miller
scoreless for the final six minutes and finished with a 7-2 run for their fifth
victory in six games.

Clinton: Legal Abortion Depends on 2000 Race
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The future of legalized abortion depends on the outcome
of the 2000 presidential race, President Clinton told Democratic Party donors
Saturday. And he said Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush, by
endorsing a constitutional amendment banning abortion, laid out clearly for
American voters the choice facing them in November. The next president will
likely name more than two justices to the Supreme Court, Clinton said. That
could tip the balance in favor of overturning the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court
decision that made abortion legal in the United States.

quarter to lead the Portland Trail Blazers to a 95-91 victory over the Los
Angeles Lakers on Saturday night. The loss was the third in five games for the
Lakers since their 16-game winning streak ended, but they reached the halfway
point of the season with a 33-8 record -- best in the league.

<HEADLINE> Time Warner-EMI Merge Plan Reported  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Time Warner, fresh from a merger announcement with
America Online, will consolidate with London-based EMI Records in a $20 billion
merger, the Los Angeles Times reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Times, citing unidentified sources, said Time Warner's music division
would gain control of EMI, home to the Beatles and Rolling Stones, to form one
of the industry's largest music conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Times said the deal -- which has not yet been signed -- would likely be
announced on Monday in London.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed merger follows Time Warner's Jan. 10 announcement that is was
seeking a roughly $145 billion merger with America Online.
</P>
<P>
	   The new company would have Time Warner's Atlantic, Elektra and Warner
Brothers records labels that include such performers as Metallica, Jewel and
REM.
</P>
<P>
	   EMI brings the Virgin, Priority and Capitol record labels, which includes
the Beastie Boys, Van Morrison and Frank Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner has been driving consolidation in the entertainment industry the
past decade. The latest deal could quicken access to online music, an arena
where record companies hope to increase profits by delivering products directly
to consumers via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Both companies declined comment on the deal, which has been a tightly kept
secret during months of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Unidentified sources told the Times that the proposed merger was conceived
by new Warner Music Group Chairman Roger Ames.
</P>
<P>
	   Ames first approached longtime friend Ken Berry, the head of EMI's music
division in August, well before merger talks between Time Warner and AOL, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal quickly gained the favor of Time Warner President Richard Parsons
and Chairman Gerald Levin. AOL Chief Executive Steve Case also endorsed the deal
for its possibility to expand the music choices available to consumers online.
</P>
<P>
	   A new company called Warner EMI Music would be led by Ames, 50, as chief
executive officer and Berry, 47, as chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger, which still needs the approval of regulators, is expected to
take about a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- A man and his two-year-old daughter remained missing
after they disappeared while snowmobiling on Saturday, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   The pair reportedly left the Shrine Mountain Inn in Summit County at about
noon on Saturday for an excursion near Vail Pass, about 100 miles west of
Denver.
</P>
<P>
	   Rescue teams had failed to locate them by late Saturday as snow continued to
fall in the area, the Summit County sheriff's office said. Search efforts were
to continue.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Troops in Kosovo Investigated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UROSEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.S. soldiers serving with the NATO-led
peacekeeping force in Kosovo may be guilty of treating men in Kosovo too roughly
and of having ``inappropriate physical contact'' with local women, U.S. army
headquarters in Kosovo said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO is investigating allegations the soldiers acted inappropriately while
doing crowd control in Vitina, about 25 miles south of Kosovo, said a statement
from Cap Bondsteel, the main U.S. base.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Preliminary findings ... indicate several soldiers may have been involved
in misconduct including improper use of physical force and threats against
Kosovo males, and inappropriate physical contact with Kosovar females,'' said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
	   No charges have been filed and investigations into the alleged incidents
Jan. 9 and 10 are continuing, said the statement. It did not offer further
details.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no indication that the alleged wrongdoing was related to the
killing of an 11-year-old Kosovo girl, also in Vitina. A U.S. soldier serving
with the international peacekeeping force in eastern Kosovo was charged last
weekend with sexually assaulting and killing the girl.

<HEADLINE> Israel President Won't Resign  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- President Ezer Weizman said Sunday he is determined not to
resign from office, despite the launching of a criminal investigation into
allegations he did not properly report cash gifts from a former business
associate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do not intend to resign,'' he said in a live telecast. ``I repeat, I do
not intend to resign.''
</P>
<P>
	   In his statement, which lasted just over a minute, Weizman rejected calls
that he take a leave of absence while the investigation is underway. That move,
a step short of resigning, had been proposed as a compromise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no difference between a president in office and one on leave,''
Weizman said. He repeated his declaration of innocence, adding only that if he
made a mistake, ``it was a human mistake ... with the best of intentions.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli media had been rife with predictions of what Weizman, a war hero who
has a reputation as an outspoken straight-shooter, would say in his address at 8
p.m., the prime newscast hour. Most had at least expected an explanation of the
cash gifts he has acknowledged receiving from French millionaire Edouard
Sarousi.
</P>
<P>
	   Legislators -- even those who had once steadfastly supported Weizman -- were
stunned by the speech.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's so arrogant!'' said Zehava Galon, the faction head of the dovish
Meretz party, which shares Weizman's views on the peace process. ``The president
has embarrassed us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hawkish opposition legislators had criticized Weizman before the scandal
broke last month for his active involvement in the peace process, saying he was
damaging the integrity of the presidency, a position that was supposed to be
above politics. Now, they say, his personal integrity is at stake as well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The real question is whether during the time when he was defending his
name as a citizen, if he can be in a position to influence those who are
responsible for the investigation,'' said Ruby Rivlin of the Likud party.
</P>
<P>
	   Among his other duties, Weizman swears in judges.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman, 75, delivered his message from his Jerusalem office, his desk
framed with the Israeli and presidential flags. He said he would save
explanations of the cash gifts for his police interrogators -- but keeping mum
was hard for Israel's most voluble public figure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I did not comment before the press and that was hard for me,'' he said,
</P>
<P>
	   Police formally launched their criminal investigation into the case Sunday
-- the first time in Israel's history that police have begun such a probe
against a president.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman has confirmed receiving money from French millionaire Edouard
Sarousi, although he says it is less than the $453,000 alleged by Yoav Yitzhak,
the journalist who broke the story last month. Weizman will not say how much it
is.
</P>
<P>
	   The president has said he reported the money to the extent required by the
law. He was a Cabinet minister and then a legislator during the period he
acknowledges the gifts were given, 1988-93.
</P>
<P>
	   Police conducted an initial check into whether Weizman had properly reported
the gifts. The check was ordered broadened into a criminal investigation on
Thursday, when police discovered that Weizman and Sarousi had not disclosed an
earlier business relationship.
</P>
<P>
	   Police told Israel radio on Sunday that Weizman and Sarousi would be
questioned in the case, probably no sooner than next week. They have not said
what direction the criminal investigation would take, but the daily Yediot
Ahronot reported they were investigating possible charges of bribery and fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   Police may interrogate Weizman ``under caution,'' meaning that his answers
could be used in a possible indictment against him, Yediot reported. The
investigation will take about a month, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
	   It is against the law to try a sitting president. A removal of the president
from office would require the support of 90 out of 120 members of parliament. It
would appear that the numbers for such a vote do not exist at this point.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Canvas in Iowa  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- On the eve of the Iowa caucuses, Republican and
Democratic presidential candidates canvassed churches and national talk shows
Sunday, scouring this snow-crusted state for last-minute support even as they
began looking ahead to contests in New Hampshire and beyond.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the first step in several steps of the journey,'' Bill Bradley,
the former New Jersey senator who trails Vice President Al Gore in Democratic
polls, said on CBS.
</P>
<P>
	   Entering the first election contest of Campaign 2000, Republican George W.
Bush and Gore held wide leads in polls of voters who planned to visit schools,
civic clubs, fire stations and other sites Monday to support one of eight major
contestants.
</P>
<P>
	   The underdog candidates, all resigned to losing, were still shooting for
face-saving finishes and Iowa's true reward: Momentum for New Hampshire's Feb. 1
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a marathon, not a sprint,'' said Republican Steve Forbes on NBC's
``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
	   The footrace in Iowa, a test of political organization, favors the national
front-runners. A Des Moines Sunday Register poll of 1,200 likely caucus-goers
showed Gore leading Bradley among Democrats 56 percent to 28 percent. Bush led
Forbes 43 percent to 20 percent in the Jan. 16-21 survey, which had an error
margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is in danger of finishing worse than expected in a contest that
traditionally punishes candidates who fail to meet expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   His latest poll rating was beneath the intentionally-low threshold his
advisers set as a measure of accomplishment: The 31 percent showing by Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., in a second-place finish behind then-President Jimmy
Carter in the 1980 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   With the rest of the GOP field in single digits, Forbes has long said he is
the conservative alternative to Bush. The argument would carry greater weight
if, after pouring millions of dollars into Iowa since his failed 1996 bid,
Forbes fares better than the new poll suggests -- 23 points behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The polls show that about one in 10 voters are undecided, giving the
candidates incentive to campaign hard Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't want my voters to take anything for granted,'' Bush told reporters
after appearing on ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the lengthy TV interview, Bush struggled with his explanation for
supporting a sales tax increase in Texas after making a no-tax pledge. The
second-term governor said he had qualified the promise by also pledging to
reform education funding in the state, an effort that presumably led to the tax
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Dismissing the issue, Bush said ``There's pledges all the time'' and
reviewed a record as governor that included two major tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   He also continued to flesh out his views abortion, a critical issue to many
GOP caucus-goers. Asked about the topic for the fourth day, he predicted that
Texas would outlaw first-trimester abortions if the Supreme Court reversed
itself and let states impose strict anti-abortion laws -- a position Bush says
the court should take.
</P>
<P>
	   Maintaining a caucus tradition, several campaigns had supporters papering
churches and their parking lots with leaflets. Religious conservatives represent
a third of likely caucus-goers and are more likely than most voters to attend
the sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Forbes is expected to get a lion's share of the conservative vote,
former ambassador Alan Keyes, Washington activist Gary Bauer and Sen. Orrin
Hatch of Utah are carving up the religious base. Keyes, Bauer and Hatch are
likely competing for third place; finishing lower could doom their candidacies.
</P>
<P>
	   Addressing a congregation on the city's industrial north side, Bauer said
Christians should vote more on principle than on ``selfish'' issues such as
taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Do what you think God would have you do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking to New Hampshire, Bush pressed his case against Sen. John McCain's
tax-cutting package. The Arizona senator, who did not campaign in Iowa, is in a
tight race with Bush in the New England state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fundamental debate is do we leave money in Washington or do we give it
back to taxpayers?'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain would cut fewer taxes than Bush, saving some projected government
surpluses to bolster Social Security, Medicare and pay down the national debt.
While Bush was in Iowa, McCain was campaigning Sunday in New Hampshire where he
picked up endorsements from two of the state's biggest newspapers.
</P>
<P>
	   Public and campaign polls show Gore gaining steam in New Hampshire, opening
up a slight lead over Bradley while, on the Republican side, McCain is managing
to maintain a lead in the high single digits over the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa, Forbes courted social conservatives by questioning Bush's
commitment to abortion and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Candidates at this time of the year -- the conservative establishment in
the Republican Party -- always say `Oh, we are conservative' and then after the
election, they forget about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes and Bradley accused their party front-runners of being too political.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked whether Gore's attacks hurt his campaign, Bradley, on ``Face the
Nation,'' said, ``I'm a big boy. I know how politics as usual are practiced and
what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Davenport, Gore said his ``honorable opponent'' has focused on health
care reform while treating education ``as kind of an afterthought.''
</P>
<P>
	   As the candidates stumped, aides fine-tuned plans to get supporters to the
caucus sites. Last-minute mailings criticized opponents and offered incentives
to vote. A Bush flier included two ``W'' stickers for supporters to show unity
at caucus sites.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters sized up the field for the last time.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Steenhoek, 32, of Ankeny, said he was leaning toward Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's more of him being such an underdog and trying so hard and keeping at
it that makes me like him so much,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Golden Globes To Be Awarded  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- "American Beauty" was the leading movie
contender going into Sunday night's 57th Golden Globe awards, which can serve as
a signpost to what will come at the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
	   The dark suburban fable gained six Golden Globe nominations, including best
dramatic picture, dramatic actress for Annette Bening, and dramatic actor for
Kevin Spacey.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Talented Mr. Ripley," a tale of social envy that turns to murder, was
close behind with five bids, as was "The Insider," based on the story of
tobacco-industry whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand.
</P>
<P>
	   The leading television nominees were the mob drama "The Sopranos" and the
risque comedy "Sex and the City," with five bids each.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC was to air this year's awards, selected by reporters from the Hollywood
Foreign Press Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Other top nominees included the films "The End of the Affair" and "Being
John Malkovich," which held four nominations each. Films with three bids
included "The Hurricane" and "Notting Hill."
</P>
<P>
	   "Boys Don't Cry," "The Straight Story," "Man on the Moon," "Analyze This,"
"Toy Story 2," "An Ideal Husband," "Sweet and Lowdown," "The Cider House Rules,"
"Magnolia," "Anna and the King" and "The Sixth Sense" had two bids each.
</P>
<P>
	   Barbra Streisand, winner of more Golden Globe trophies than any other
entertainer, including best actress for "Funny Girl" and "A Star is Born," was
to receive the Cecil B. DeMille Award for "outstanding contribution to the
entertainment field."
</P>
<P>
	   Some movies that received awards buzz were largely ignored. They included
"The Green Mile" starring Tom Hanks, "Anna and the King" with Jodie Foster, and
"Angela's Ashes" starring Emily Watson. Stanley Kubrick's final film, "Eyes Wide
Shut," received just one nomination, for best score.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden Globe shows have come to be known for bordering on the giddy.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, Jack Nicholson delivered a salty acceptance speech, Ving
Rhames bestowed his statue on Jack Lemmon and Christine Lahti took the stage
with toilet paper on her shoe, a reference to the year she was in the ladies'
room when her trophy was announced.
</P>
<P>
	   The awards have gained in prestige, overlapping to an extent with the
Academy Award bids to be announced next month.
</P>
<P>
	   But they once were viewed with suspicion because of allegations of corrupt
voting and questionable professionalism.
</P>
<P>
	   The low point came in 1981, when Pia Zadora was given a statue for the bomb
"Butterfly" and networks refused to show the program. After an effort to regain
respectability, the ceremony was welcomed back by television in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, association members quickly returned pricey watches sent to them
by the company that released the Sharon Stone comedy "The Muse."
</P>
<P>
	   "We are not stupid," said association president Helmut Voss. The awards
bring the group $2 million in income and members wouldn't endanger that by
casting doubt on their integrity, he said.

<HEADLINE> Sabrin, former libertarian, now campaigns as only true Republican  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CRYSTAL CITY, Va. (AP) - In the armchair, looking for true believers, is
Tammy Lyles, president of a conservative political action committee. On the
couch, looking for campaign cash, is Murray Sabrin, candidate for New Jersey
senator.
<P>
	   Lyles bolts upright when Sabrin describes his plan for the International
Monetary Fund: Kill it.
</P>
<P>
	   "Completely? Oh, that's marvelous," she says.
</P>
<P>
	   Sabrin, who teaches business at Ramapo College, brought his background in
economics and his uncompromising brand of politics to a receptive audience last
week at the 27th annual Conservative Political Action Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   For someone who has been many things over the years - liberal Democrat in
the 1960s, Republican in the early 1970s, Libertarian Party candidate for New
Jersey governor in 1997 - Sabrin seems quite at home as a candidate for the
Republican nomination for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   He swears that New Jersey voters, traditionally drawn to middle-of-the-road
politicians, are ready for someone firmly rooted in the political right.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've always said that I'm the only bona fide conservative in the race -
someone who is pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, (and favors) deregulation and
reducing the size of government," Sabrin said Friday while attending the
conservative gathering here. The Second Amendment guarantees the right to bear
arms.
</P>
<P>
	   Of late, Sabrin has returned to a favorite theme from 1997 - his staunch
opposition to the unpopular enhanced auto emissions tests that the state
implemented last month.
</P>
<P>
	   But there is no shortage of other opinions:
</P>
<P>
	   Eliminate the federal departments of housing, education and commerce. End
affirmative action. Stop sending U.S. soldiers to join foreign conflicts.
</P>
<P>
	   Remove caps on campaign contributions. End federal funding of the arts.
Offer merit pay to good teachers, pink slips to bad ones.
</P>
<P>
	   Declaring his candidacy last August, Sabrin, 53, said he is "running for
Senate because America is being sacrificed on the altar of political
correctness."
</P>
<P>
	   "PC" he is not.
</P>
<P>
	   He has likened U.S. gun control efforts to those by Hitler to disarm the
German population. He blasted a community college's plan to name a new institute
after New Jersey native Paul Robeson, a black athlete and entertainer who
praised communism and the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
	   For now, more than four months before the June 6 primary, the state
Republican organization seems mostly to be ignoring Sabrin.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman recently said the Republican field "includes three
individuals" who are knowledgeable and electable. She was referring to U.S. Rep.
Bob Franks of Berkeley Heights, Essex County Executive James Treffinger and
state Sen. William Gormley of Atlantic County.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Sabrin, they are seeking the Republican nod to run for the Senate seat
being vacated by Democrat Frank Lautenberg.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman tried ignoring Sabrin in her own 1997 re-election campaign, but her
allies eventually began using words like "nutty" and "dangerous" to describe him
and his campaign. They highlighted some of the unusual positions of
libertarians, such as support for the decriminalization of prostitution and
drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Even now, Sabrin says individual communities should decide whether
activities such as prostitution are legal or illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   "Murray Sabrin, in my estimation, is not a Republican, he's a libertarian,"
said Garabed "Chuck" Haytaian, the Republican state chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Sabrin was born in West Germany a year after World War II ended. His Jewish
parents were the only ones in their respective families to survive the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
	   Sabrin, his older brother and his parents arrived in the United States in
1949.
</P>
<P>
	   He has hosted radio and television shows and wrote a 1995 book, "Tax Free
2000: The Rebirth of American Liberty." But he was largely unknown when he
jumped into the 1997 race for governor as the first third-party candidate in
state history to qualify for matching funds and a spot in televised debates.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman narrowly beat Democrat Jim McGreevey for a second term; Sabrin got
114,000 votes, or 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Sabrin's return to the Republican fold began in December 1998, when he spoke
in Las Vegas at a meeting of the Republican Liberty Caucus.
</P>
<P>
	   "People were very optimistic about me rejoining the GOP," he recalls.
</P>
<P>
	   That's no accident. A core mission of the Republican Liberty Caucus is to
attract libertarians to the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have a lot of sympathy for people in the Libertarian Party," said caucus
chairman Clifford Thies, a former national treasurer of the Libertarian Party.
"Some of them are decent people, but they're just weird."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the caucus "skims the top" of the Libertarian Party, drawing talent
like Sabrin to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
	   Sabrin the Republican has not chosen which of his party's presidential
candidates to endorse. He says he admires Alan Keyes' passion, Steve Forbes'
intelligence, George W. Bush's executive ability.
</P>
<P>
	   Combine the best qualities of each, Sabrin says, and "you've got me."

<HEADLINE> Candidates Positions on Cuba  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Three days a week, The Associated Press asks the presidential candidates a
question on the issues. Today's question and the responses:
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba: What conditions would Cuba have to meet for you to favor dropping the
embargo?
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley: ``We should end the embargo when there is a government in Cuba
that allows democratic participation in the political process, grants economic
freedom, and ends its absolute control over civic institutions, religious
practice and expression of opinion. I look forward to the day that is
possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore: ``My policy is clear: We will not normalize relations with Cuba
until it is democratic. I support the people of Cuba and their desire to be free
of the oppressive Castro dictatorship. As President, I will maintain pressure on
the Cuban Government while supporting the Cuban people to forge a multinational
effort to press for democratic change in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reform:
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan: ``I would isolate and ostracize Fidel Castro as long as he is
in power. But I would try to aid the Cuban people who are our friends, whose
freedom Castro denies, and whose lives could be improved by access to U.S. food,
medicine, and civilian goods.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Bauer: ``Fidel Castro should resign and his successors should schedule
free and internationally supervised elections. When that process is complete,
all sanctions can be removed.''
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush: ``I believe there should be no changes in United States
policy toward Cuba until three conditions are met: free elections, free speech,
and freedom for political prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes: ``Until Castro falls and the people of Cuba hold free and fair
elections, we should not lift the trade embargo. We should do nothing that could
prop up and strengthen Castro's evil, oppressive regime. The Castro regime is
the only beneficiary of economic and political activities in the island. If
lifting the embargo would help promote economic development and popular
dissatisfaction against the current regime, why hasn't it happened with European
and Canadian investments? Simply because the people of Cuba do not currently
benefit from international economic activity. Only the Castro regime does. This
helps strengthen their oppressive grip on the good people of Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   Orrin Hatch: ``I would support the incremental easing of the embargo if
there were demonstrable progress toward internal reforms in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes: No response.
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain: ``Cuban foreign policy has been unremittingly hostile to United
States interests since the revolution in 1959. Combined with continuing human
rights problems there, the groundwork has not been established for the lifting
of sanctions. Cuban dictator Fidel Castro remains adamantly opposed to political
liberalization, and his posture toward the U.S. remains as hostile today as it
was 40 years ago. In order for sanctions against Cuba to be lifted, the Cuban
government would have to make demonstrable steps toward democratization and free
market reforms; vastly improve its human rights record; and cease its policy of
seeking to undermine U.S. interests abroad.''

<HEADLINE> Putin Plays Down Parliament Problem  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN IAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's acting President Vladimir Putin insisted Sunday that
he played no role in a deal that has frozen the parliament for a week and
prompted questions about the Kremlin's commitment to reform.
</P>
<P>
	   In his first public comment on the standoff, Putin played down the dispute:
``I do not think it is a crisis,'' he said on Russia's RTR television. ``There
is nothing dramatic in this.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 100 lawmakers stalked out of parliament's opening session Tuesday over
a deal between the two largest parties -- the pro-Kremlin Unity and the
Communists -- to install Communist Gennady Seleznyov as speaker. The boycotting
parties say the deal shuts out all other parties and liberals say it compromises
the Kremlin's promises to pursue market reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin tried to distance himself from the dispute, saying he had not
influenced Unity or other lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   As head of the executive branch, he said, ``I shouldn't interfere with
legislative organs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Putin called for reviving the weakened Russian state and improving the
investment climate by cleaning up Russia's judicial system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The state has weakened. It should be strong,'' he said. ``If the state
cannot guarantee the rules of the game we cannot establish a good investment
climate.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also suggested Russia was ready to improve long chilly relations with
NATO, but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian lawmakers worked over the weekend to resolve the parliamentary
standoff. Speaker Seleznyov met Sunday with the leaders of three boycotting
parties, who said the crisis can only be settled by a meeting of all the feuding
faction leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Seleznyov met with Yevgeny Primakov, leader of the centrist Fatherland-All
Russia; Sergei Kiriyenko, head of the reformist Union of Right Forces; and
Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the liberal Yabloko party.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Kiriyenko's press secretary, the parties did not reach any
agreement, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yavlinsky, after the meeting with Seleznyov, said the speaker was appointed
``by force'' and committee posts were distributed ``without due account taken of
the interests of all factions,'' Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the most alarming thing about the new Duma is ``when the majority
absolutely suppresses and disregards the opinion of the minority.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yavlinsky said that the three parties had no intention of lifting the
boycott, and were not planning to attend a Duma Council meeting on Tuesday and a
plenary session on Wednesday, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
	   Seleznyov said the leaders of all factions and groups will meet on Monday to
discuss the crisis, which has stalled the work of the new Duma, elected in
December.

<HEADLINE> Russia Claims It's Making Progress  </HEADLINE>
   By YURI BAGROV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STARAYA SUNZHA, Russia (AP) -- Despite a surprise rebel ambush Sunday
against Russian troops advancing on the Chechen capital, Grozny, the Russian
military insisted it was gaining ground in its building-by-building drive to
seize the heart of the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Fighting was fierce Sunday, with Russian troops facing heavy sniper fire
during nearly every effort to advance. The military command press center said
federal forces ``liberated'' residential areas, a railway depot, a hospital and
a factory near central Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The federal troops are fighting their way through the streets to the
center of the city, rebuffing the rebels' strong resistance,'' the military
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   In Staraya Sunzha, a village just east of Grozny, a group of rebels attacked
Russian troops early Sunday in a surprise ambush that killed eight soldiers and
wounded eight others. The attack caught the Russians off guard because they
believed they had control of the village and had mined all the rebel tunnels
connecting the village to Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a puzzle for me where they came from,'' said Lt. Oleg Kotov. ``We
have been here for a month already, and thought we had learned all of their
underground routes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Grozny, the war's biggest prize, has been under Russian air and artillery
fire for months, and troops have been advancing on the area for several weeks.
But government forces have yet to wrest control of the city's center from the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   In Moscow, acting President Vladimir Putin said Sunday he would consider the
war over when all ``terrorist bands'' have been eliminated, at which point the
Russian troops will pull out and a permanent Russian force will be deployed.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin, speaking on Russia's RTR television, also said he had ``no
complaints'' about the military's actions in Chechnya. Putin replaced the head
of the Interior Ministry troops on Saturday. No explanation for the move was
given, but observers suggested it reflected government frustration with the
failure to seize Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   In another battle Sunday, federal troops backed by three Mi-26 helicopters
drove into central Grozny and dislodged rebels from a five-story building they
had been using as a hideout, according to an officer who took part in the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Russians, targeted by snipers in nearby buildings, lost at least
five men in the assault, and the officer conceded that the Chechens could retake
the building overnight, when the rebels are more mobile because of their
familiarity with the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Sunday, the body of a general who disappeared last week, Mikhail
Malofeyev, was discovered in Grozny at the site of the battle where he was
killed, presidential aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   Malofeyev, the highest-level Russian commander to be killed in the
4-month-old offensive, was found in a trench, the military said. Street fighting
frustrated efforts to retrieve his body, the military said, and rebels almost
grabbed it first but were thwarted by Russian artillery.
</P>
<P>
	   Chechen commander Mumadi Saidayev, meanwhile, denied Russian reports that
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov had been wounded. Saidayev said he talked with
Maskhadov Sunday and that he was fine, though under steady Russian air and
artillery fire wherever he travels, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian Emergencies Ministry said 500 civilians escaped Grozny safely on
Saturday, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. Some 8,000 to 25,000 civilians
are believed to remain in the city, most old or infirm. Fleeing has become
increasingly dangerous for them as fighting has intensified.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops entered breakaway Chechnya in September after Chechen-based
militants stormed villages in the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan. The
rebels also were blamed for a series of deadly apartment house bombings in
Moscow and two other cities in September.

<HEADLINE> Storm Knocks Out Power to Thousands  </HEADLINE>
   By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Rain and freezing temperatures spread a coat of ice across
parts of Georgia on Sunday, knocking out electrical service to more than a
half-million customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those households and businesses could be without power until at
least Tuesday as crews struggle over slippery roads to reach downed lines and
ice-coated tree limbs continue to snap, pulling down more.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the worst storm since Hurricane Opal came through in 1996, and it
took six days to get power fully restored for that one,'' said Georgia Power
spokeswoman Becky Blaylock. ``If it keeps raining and it freezes again ... we
could be looking at more people without power. We're in for a long haul.''
</P>
<P>
	   Snow and freezing rain also fell in parts of the southern Appalachians, and
locally heavy rain fell across coastal areas of Georgia and the Carolinas as the
storm pushed eastward and out to sea.
</P>
<P>
	   The rain had been forecast to end late Saturday in Georgia but was still
falling Sunday afternoon. Temperatures in the Atlanta area didn't warm above
freezing until the middle of the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Ice accumulated a half-inch thick on trees in parts of northern Georgia, and
the weight of the ice on power lines pulled down utility poles.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 340,000 home and business customers of Georgia Power lost service
statewide, 290,000 of them in the metropolitan Atlanta area, Ms. Blaylock said.
At least 175,000 customers of electric membership corporations also were blacked
out.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of utility repair crews were put to work.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's just the sheer volume and massive nature of the problem that makes us
go from one spot to the next to the next. We fix one, and another tree breaks,
and causes another outage,'' said Pat Kerley of the Jackson Electric Membership
Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Fallen branches and power lines closed about 20 roads in northern Georgia,
State Department of Transportation spokeswoman Vicki Gavalas said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If my neighborhood is any indication, they're snapping like matchsticks,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport remained open, but many flights
were delayed or canceled as crews tried to de-ice the planes.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Saturday, a U.S. Airways jet that had landed at North Carolina's
Charlotte-Douglas International Airport slid onto a grassy area as it turned
onto a taxiway. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   In central Tennessee, where 3.5 inches of snow fell Saturday, a de-icing
truck nicked the wing of a Northwest Airlines DC-9 at Nashville International
Airport. No one was injured, said Northwest spokeswoman Mary Beth Schubert.
</P>
<P>
	   Parts of South Carolina got up to 6 inches of snow late Saturday, and
traffic on parts of Interstate 85 came to a standstill in several spots because
of slippery pavement and accidents.

<HEADLINE> Israel President Won't Resign  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- President Ezer Weizman said Sunday he is determined not to
resign from office, despite the launching of a criminal investigation into
allegations he did not properly report cash gifts from a former business
associate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do not intend to resign,'' he said in a live telecast. ``I repeat, I do
not intend to resign.''
</P>
<P>
	   In his statement, which lasted just over a minute, Weizman rejected calls
that he take a leave of absence while the investigation is underway. That move,
a step short of resigning, had been proposed as a compromise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no difference between a president in office and one on leave,''
Weizman said. He repeated his declaration of innocence, adding only that if he
made a mistake, ``it was a human mistake ... with the best of intentions.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli media had been rife with predictions of what Weizman, a war hero who
has a reputation as an outspoken straight-shooter, would say in his address at 8
p.m., the prime newscast hour. Most had at least expected an explanation of the
cash gifts he has acknowledged receiving from French millionaire Edouard
Sarousi.
</P>
<P>
	   Legislators -- even those who had once steadfastly supported Weizman -- were
stunned by the speech.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's so arrogant!'' said Zehava Galon, the faction head of the dovish
Meretz party, which shares Weizman's views on the peace process. ``The president
has embarrassed us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Galon said Weizman should cancel his attendance at a ceremonial session of
the parliament on Monday, warning that he might be booed when he enters.
</P>
<P>
	   Hawkish opposition legislators had criticized Weizman before the scandal
broke last month for his active involvement in the peace process, saying he was
damaging the integrity of the presidency, a position that was supposed to be
above politics. Now, they say, his personal integrity is at stake as well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It must be the norm in Israel that a person in such a position cannot
continue to be in charge when an investigation is held against him,'' said Shaul
Yahalom of the National Religious Party, the party representing Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said Weizman should refrain from swearing in
judges, one of his duties, until the investigation is concluded.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman, 75, delivered his message from his Jerusalem office, his desk
framed with the Israeli and presidential flags. He said he would save
explanations of the cash gifts for his police interrogators -- but keeping mum
was hard for Israel's most voluble public figure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I did not comment before the press and that was hard for me,'' he said,
</P>
<P>
	   Police formally launched their criminal investigation into the case Sunday
-- the first time in Israel's history that police have begun such a probe
against a president.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman has confirmed receiving money from French millionaire Edouard
Sarousi, although he says it is less than the $453,000 alleged by Yoav Yitzhak,
the journalist who broke the story last month. Weizman will not say how much it
is.
</P>
<P>
	   The president has said he reported the money to the extent required by the
law. He was a Cabinet minister and then a legislator during the period he
acknowledges the gifts were given, 1988-93.
</P>
<P>
	   Police conducted an initial check into whether Weizman had properly reported
the gifts. The check was ordered broadened into a criminal investigation on
Thursday, when police discovered that Weizman and Sarousi had not disclosed an
earlier business relationship.
</P>
<P>
	   Police told Israel radio on Sunday that Weizman and Sarousi would be
questioned in the case, probably no sooner than next week. They have not said
what direction the criminal investigation would take, but the daily Yediot
Ahronot reported they were investigating possible charges of bribery and fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   Police may interrogate Weizman ``under caution,'' meaning that his answers
could be used in a possible indictment against him, Yediot reported. The
investigation will take about a month, the daily said.	   It is against the law
to try a sitting president. A removal of the president from office would require
the support of 90 out of 120 members of parliament. It would appear that the
numbers for such a vote do not exist at this point.

<HEADLINE> Indian Corpses Still Being Found  </HEADLINE>
   By NEELESH MISRA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Three months after a cyclone slammed into eastern
India, killing at least 10,000 people, visitors and residents say rotting
corpses still lay in farm fields.
</P>
<P>
	   Millions of people were left homeless by the twister that devastated
southeastern India in October, flooding much of eastern Orissa.
</P>
<P>
	   The corpse issue came into the public eye this week when popular Hindi movie
director Mahesh Bhatt traveled to the region. After his visit, he told the media
he had seen the bodies of a woman and child sprawled near a cyclone protection
center in the Ersama region, one of the hardest-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The local people were quite amused by my alarm on seeing the bodies, and
it indicated there were many more lying around,'' Bhatt said.
</P>
<P>
	   His remarks appeared in local newspapers Sunday, and officials said they
were investigating.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have asked the district magistrate to check this and give me a report,''
Orissa's Revenue Secretary Jugal Mahapatra said.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking by phone from Orissa's Jagatsinghpur town, local resident Bhav
Kumar Panda said there were a few corpses still lying unattended in some areas,
their skin parched. He said there were also a few hundred animal carcasses
strewn across the farm fields and by village streams, and bleaching powder had
been sprinkled on them to stop the stench.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people have got used to the stench. They keep working in the fields,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 200,000 animals were estimated to have died in the cyclone. For several
weeks, local residents refused to burn the bloating, disfigured carcasses even
after the government offered people money to dispose them.
</P>
<P>
	   Bhatt said some residents still will not return to villages in Orissa that
were wiped out in the cyclone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I went to this graveyard village to which people are not willing to
return,'' he said. ``They think it is haunted.''
</P>
<P>
	   India's eastern coastline is repeatedly battered by cyclones that brew in
the Bay of Bengal. A cyclone in 1977 killed 10,000, and one in 1971 killed
almost as many. An earthquake in 1993 also claimed about 10,000 lives and a heat
wave in 1998 killed roughly 3,400.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials say repeated disasters push back development in the state by years
and are one of the reasons why millions of people there live in extreme poverty.
Many live below starvation levels even in normal times.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have to be blind not to see it,'' Bhatt said. ``The people of Orissa
are living in medieval times.''

<HEADLINE> President Bush Watches Nervously  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Having experienced both victory and defeat here,
George W. Bush's dad, understandably, is anxious about the outcome for his son
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's so nervous about the caucuses, he called me last night,'' the GOP
presidential front-runner told a voter Saturday in Cedar Rapids about the former
president.
</P>
<P>
	   After a Sunday talk-show appearance, Bush explained that former President
Bush had called from his home in Houston, where he has lived since losing to
Bill Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He wished me all the best,'' George W. said. ``He knows exactly what I'm
going through. Anybody who's ever run for office understands full well the
anticipation of the vote. I explained to him that I feel we had good intensity
in the state of Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush recalled being in Iowa in 1980, when his father first ran for president
and won the caucuses with 32 percent of the vote. He ultimately lost the
nomination to Ronald Reagan, under whom Bush would later serve as vice president
for two terms.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1988, the elder Bush placed third in the caucuses, behind former Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole and evangelist Pat Robertson. Nonetheless, he went on
to win the nomination and later the general election over Democrat Michael S.
Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was here in 1980, when George Bush surged out of nowhere to win first
place. I was here in 1988, when I got to explain to the country why coming in
third place was good,'' George W., the Texas governor, said with a chuckle. ``I
think there was a palpable difference in enthusiasm and intensity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he told his father that ``our team is fired up.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There seems to be intensity at our rallies,'' George W. said. ``But I put
out the cautionary note to him like I am to you all, that nothing really matters
until the actual vote is taken.''

<HEADLINE> Source: Time Warner, EMI To Merge  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner, which only two weeks ago announced a stunning
$145 billion merger with America Online, plans to shake up the music industry
through a $20 billion merger with EMI Records, home of the Beatles and the
Rolling Stones, a source familiar with the deal said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The two companies will formally announce the deal in London on Monday, the
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   London-based EMI confirmed Sunday that it is in the final stages of
negotiations and said an announcement is forthcoming. Time Warner in New York
also acknowledged the talks, but spokesman Edward Adler said, "No deal has been
signed."
</P>
<P>
	   The deal, if it is approved by regulators, would likely be a boost for music
sales over the Internet. Both Warner and EMI have been testing ways to let
customers digitally download music via their computers. The new company would
have a very captive audience with America Online's 20 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
	   The merged company, to be called Warner EMI Music, would be the
second-largest music company with more than $8 billion in annual sales. Only
Seagram's Universal Music would be bigger.
</P>
<P>
	   EMI brings to the deal the Virgin, Priority and Capitol record labels --
including names like the Spice Girls, Van Morrison and Frank Sinatra. Time
Warner contributes its Atlantic, Elektra and Warner Brothers labels that include
Cher, Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, Madonna, Metallica and REM.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the source, the negotiations between Warner and EMI started
before powerbrokers discussed Time Warner's deal with America Online. Roger
Ames, chairman of Warner Music Group, approached his longtime friend Ken Berry,
head of EMI's music division, in the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   The two structured a deal in which Warner will pay EMI shareholders about $1
billion, or about $1.65 a share, in exchange for 50 percent ownership in the
combined company, the source said. Warner also will have six seats on the new
board of directors, and EMI will have five.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger is expected to close in about a year.
</P>
<P>
	   This "represents an opportunity to establish the world's premier music group
and to create very considerable value for shareholders of both companies," EMI
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Ames will be the chief executive officer and Berry will be chief operating
officer. Time Warner President Richard Parsons and EMI Group's Chairman Eric
Nicoli, will be co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement could draw fire from critics who worry that lack of
competition will diminish diversity and put too much control in the hands of the
four industry titans: Universal Music, EMI-Warner, Sony and Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the merger comes at a crucial time for Warner and EMI.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner Music's earnings fell from $288 million in the first nine months of
1998 to $279 million for the same period in 1999. EMI has been recovering from
difficulties of its own, but in the six months ending in September last year,
profits were up by 61 percent to $108 million compared to the same period the
year before.
</P>
<P>
	   By linking their operations, Warner EMI will shave $400 million in costs
over three years, the source said.

<HEADLINE> McCall: I'd like to run for governor; and Lundine is backing me  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY. N.Y. (AP) - State Comptroller H. Carl McCall said Sunday he
would like to run for governor in 2002 and "if we can put things in place over
the next several months, then that will decide it."
<P>
	   "It all seems to be lining up that way," McCall said.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Democrat, the only black ever elected to statewide office in
New York, also said his possible bid for governor has picked up the backing of
the man who was Mario Cuomo's lieutenant governor, Stan Lundine.
</P>
<P>
	   "He really wants to sign on and work very actively to help me get elected,"
McCall said. "I'm delighted to have him. I think given his experience in state
government, given his contacts, particularly in upstate New York, I think he
would be a valuable ally."
</P>
<P>
	   While McCall is from New York City, Lundine is a former congressman from
Jamestown in western New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Lundine could not be reached for comment Sunday. His backing for McCall has
special significance given that federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, the
eldest son of Mario Cuomo, is also considering running for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Told about the McCall-Lundine alliance, a top political adviser to the
younger Cuomo, former state Democratic Chairman John Marino, said, "We only have
good things to say about Carl."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about Andrew Cuomo's own plans, Marino said, "Right now, the
secretary's focus is on his job and making sure we have a Democratic president
in Al Gore and a Democratic senator in Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's really what we will be focused on for the next eight or nine months
and after that, at that point, he has other decisions to make," Marino said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, Andrew Cuomo was on a hunting excursion in central New York with
one of the state Legislature's top Democrats, Assembly Majority Leader Michael
Bragman. Interestingly, Bragman is one of four co-chairmen of the McCall for
Governor Advisory Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to announcing Lundine's support, McCall on Sunday made public a
letter from his advisory committee seeking support for the comptroller's
possible run for governor.
</P>
<P>
	   "For more than five years, New Yorkers have suffered under a Republican
administration that is more concerned about patronage and politics than people
and policy," the letter from Bragman, U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, state
Assemblyman and Bronx Democratic Chairman Roberto Ramirez and North Hempsted
Town Supervisor May Newburger said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Carl McCall has seen the problems and he's ready to solve them ... Now, we
need his leadership in the governor's office," the four said in the letter that
went to about 700 party activists and other who might be helpful to McCall.
</P>
<P>
	   The four asked those who may want to support McCall to join them, and the
comptroller, at meetings to be held in Albany on March 14, New York City on
March 16, Syracuse on March 22 and Buffalo on March 23.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we want to celebrate the inauguration of Governor Carl McCall on January
1, 2003, it will take an extraordinary commitment from him and an equally strong
commitment from all of us," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Gov. George Pataki, who thwarted the elder Cuomo's bid for a
fourth term in 1992, has said he may want to run for a third term himself in
2002.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall said Sunday that he has been encouraged by early indications of
possible support and said that running for governor was "a very doable thing."
</P>
<P>
	   The comptroller was considered a possible candidate for governor in 1998 and
again this year for the Senate seat now being sought by Mrs. Clinton. He backed
away from both races. McCall said Sunday that people shouldn't read anything
into his earlier hesitancy to run.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to look at every situation in terms of the timing and whether it's
the right thing to do. In the past, it wasn't," McCall said.
</P>
<P>
	   The comptroller said his decision not to run for Senate was an easy one.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't want to go to Washington and start at the bottom," he said, adding
that he would have only had about a year "to raise a lot of money."
</P>
<P>
	   McCall has already hired a veteran Democratic fund-raiser to begin putting
together his campaign warchest, something that appears badly in need of help.
Earlier this month, Pataki reported to the state Board of Elections that his
campaign committee had 2.32 million in the bank. McCall reported that his
campaign committee had less than $73,000.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall, an ordained minister, is a former Citibank vice president who has
also served as New York City's Board of Education president, as a deputy U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations and as a state senator.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall said he would probably wait until after this year's November
elections to announce his decision about running for governor.

<HEADLINE> Indian Police Find, Defuse Bomb  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Police on Sunday found and defused a hidden bomb
that was timed to explode during a rehearsal for India's Republic Day parade, a
domestic news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Police spotted loose earth and some flashing light along the barricade near
India Gate, a massive arch where the flamboyant annual parade is scheduled to
occur on Wednesday. The area was cordoned off and a bomb disposal squad defused
the explosive, the United News of India said.
</P>
<P>
	   The device, a hand grenade connected to a detonator and a timer, was
concealed in a plastic jar and timed to go off when a rehearsal for the parade
would have been in full swing, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Republic Day marks the anniversary of the day India's constitution was
adopted in 1950.
</P>
<P>
	   In the northern state of Kashmir, meanwhile, police killed two members of a
banned separatist organization and recovered large quantities of arms and
ammunition allegedly meant to disrupt Republic Day celebrations in the state,
the Press Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of separatist groups are fighting to separate Kashmir from India.
More than 26,000 people have died since the fighting in Kashmir began in 1989.
Militants sympathetic to the insurgency there have been blamed for terrorist
attacks across India.

<HEADLINE> Source: Time Warner to merge with EMI in $20 billion deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Time Warner, which only two weeks ago announced a
stunning $145 billion merger with America Online, plans to shake up the music
industry through a $20 billion merger with EMI Records, home of the Beatles and
the Rolling Stones, a source familiar with the deal said Sunday.
<P>
	   The two companies will formally announce the deal in London on Monday, the
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   London-based EMI confirmed Sunday that it is in the final stages of
negotiations and said an announcement is forthcoming. Time Warner in New York
also acknowledged the talks, but spokesman Edward Adler said, "No deal has been
signed."
</P>
<P>
	   The deal, if it is approved by regulators, would likely be a boost for music
sales over the Internet. Both Warner and EMI have been testing ways to let
customers digitally download music via their computers. The new company would
have a very captive audience with America Online's 20 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
	   The merged company, to be called Warner EMI Music, would be the
second-largest music company with more than $8 billion in annual sales. Only
Seagram's Universal Music would be bigger.
</P>
<P>
	   EMI brings to the deal the Virgin, Priority and Capitol record labels -
including names like the Spice Girls, Van Morrison and Frank Sinatra. Time
Warner contributes its Atlantic, Elektra and Warner Brothers labels that include
Cher, Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, Madonna, Metallica and REM.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the source, the negotiations between Warner and EMI started
before powerbrokers discussed Time Warner's deal with America Online. Roger
Ames, chairman of Warner Music Group, approached his longtime friend Ken Berry,
head of EMI's music division, in the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   The two structured a deal in which Warner will pay EMI shareholders about $1
billion, or about $1.65 a share, in exchange for 50 percent ownership in the
combined company, the source said. Warner also will have six seats on the new
board of directors, and EMI will have five.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger is expected to close in about a year.
</P>
<P>
	   This "represents an opportunity to establish the world's premier music group
and to create very considerable value for shareholders of both companies," EMI
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Ames will be the chief executive officer and Berry will be chief operating
officer. Time Warner President Richard Parsons and EMI Group's Chairman Eric
Nicoli, will be co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement could draw fire from critics who worry that lack of
competition will diminish diversity and put too much control in the hands of the
four industry titans: Universal Music, EMI-Warner, Sony and Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the merger comes at a crucial time for Warner and EMI.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner Music's earnings fell from $288 million in the first nine months of
1998 to $279 million for the same period in 1999. EMI has been recovering from
difficulties of its own, but in the six months ending in September last year,
profits were up by 61 percent to $108 million compared to the same period the
year before.
</P>
<P>
	   By linking their operations, Warner EMI will shave $400 million in costs
over three years, the source said.

<HEADLINE> SEPTA Makes Deal With Euro Tabloid  </HEADLINE>
    By BILL BERGSTROM AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A new European import will greet commuters Monday in
the nation's fifth-largest city as a free tabloid attempts to grab a piece of a
crowded newspaper market and provide riders an abbreviated morning news
alternative.
</P>
<P>
	   Already, though, competitors are challenging Metro's ties to the
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, the government agency that
runs the region's trains, buses and subway for 350 million riders a year.
</P>
<P>
	   "The first big crisis with SEPTA will tell what the reporters are allowed to
do, what the editors are allowed to do," said Robert J. Rosenthal, editor and
executive vice president of The Philadelphia Inquirer. "Are they going to have
it on the front and cover it well?"
</P>
<P>
	   As the first issue hits bus and train stops Monday, attorneys will be back
in federal court resuming aguments over a lawsuit three news organizations filed
late Friday against SEPTA to challenge its partnership with the tabloid.
</P>
<P>
	   The publication is Metro International's first attempt to take a successful
European concept and bring it to the United States. Launched six years ago in
Stockholm, Sweden, the company now publishes free daily transit system
newspapers in 13 European cities, including Budapest, Hungary; Prague, Czech
Republic; and Helsinki, Finland.
</P>
<P>
	   Relying solely on selling advertising space to make money, Metro holds costs
down by keeping staffs small and outsourcing high-cost operations like printing.
Distribution costs are kept low in many cities by just dropping bundles at
subway stops and bus stations.
</P>
<P>
	   In Philadelphia, the tabloid will be distributed in green boxes labeled
"Metro, Free Daily" at 852 locations in and near train stations and bus stops in
SEPTA's five-county coverage area. Eventually, racks for the paper may be
installed on the doors of SEPTA's 1,200 buses, though that issue will be decided
in the court battle.
</P>
<P>
	   The publishers of the Inquirer, the Philadelphia Daily News, USA Today and
The New York Times contend Metro's deal with SEPTA is unconstitutional and
creates an unfair advantage by distributing the paper free where other
publications cannot be sold.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Robert Kelly refused to grant a temporary restraining
order on Friday pending Monday's hearing, and Metro agreed that for now, its
newspaper would not be distributed in areas barred to other papers.
</P>
<P>
	   Metro is a color-splashed tabloid filled with graphics and photos and dozens
of brief stories designed to be read in a 25-minute commute. The papers offer no
editorials and contain mostly stories from other news organizations, including
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are very news-oriented and oriented to small, bite-sized news articles,"
said Jack Roberts, managing director and publisher of Metro's Philadelphia
edition. "We also tend to get people who have never read newspapers. Riders of
buses and subways tend to be younger and non-newspaper readers. This is a way to
get them introduced to newspapers."
</P>
<P>
	   Metro International, which also is eyeing the New York, Boston, Chicago and
San Francisco markets, chose Philadelphia, in part, because SEPTA was looking
for a publication that could help it recover from public relations setbacks.
</P>
<P>
	   The transit agency has run extensive advertising campaigns to rebuild
ridership after a 40-day strike in 1998. Most recently, it was hit with a $50
million judgment for a serious 1996 escalator accident involving a 4-year-old
boy and a contempt citation for withholding key documents during the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Troubling to Rosenthal and Zack Stalberg, editor of the Philadelphia Daily
News, is Metro's five-year contract with SEPTA, which states that commuters will
receive "an objective and nonpartisan newspaper" and that "each issue should
provide SEPTA with significant editorial coverage and must conform to SEPTA's
editorial standards for content."
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts and SEPTA officials maintain the editorial requirement will be met
by providing the agency with its own full page for announcements and news items
in each issue.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll pick the contents of our page; they'll pick the contents of the rest
of the paper," said SEPTA spokesman Jim Whitaker. "We will have no control over
anything else that is published in the paper."
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts, a former city editor at the Daily News, agreed and said SEPTA would
be covered objectively by the editorial staff of 16.
</P>
<P>
	   "We would have reported that in the same manner we would report anything,"
Roberts said of the recent trial and the subsequent $7.4 million settlement. "We
are a legitimate newspaper in that sense, and those items would be of interest
to our readers."
</P>
<P>
	   But Stalberg likened the arrangement to a controversial deal last year
between the Los Angeles Times and the Staples Center to split profits from a
Sunday magazine issue devoted to the sports arena and said it raised the same
ethical questions.
</P>
<P>
	   "SEPTA is one of the more troubled agencies in town," Stalberg said. "I
think they see it as an effort to get their story out there."
</P>
<P>
	   Keith Woods, a member of the ethics faculty at The Poynter Institute for
Media Studies in St. Petersburg, Fla., agreed SEPTA's contract to publish Metro
raised ethical questions and suggested the Inquirer and Daily News keep a close
eye on what is not published.
</P>
<P>
	   "They will have to be diligent in monitoring what the public is consuming in
this public document and telling them when they are not being told something of
significant import in this newspaper," Woods said. "That's the best they can do.
</P>
<P>
	   "Complaining about this is just short of asking for a level of media
regulation, and that's dangerous," Woods said.
</P>
<P>
	   Not that the competition hasn't had some fun. Outside a Metro reception for
media and advertisers last week, the Daily News passed out free copies of its
newspaper wrapped in a new front cover depicting a SEPTA bus piled high with
discarded Metro tabloids and carrying headlines like "Philly's best paper
welcomes SEPTA's Scandinavian pals" and "Love that Lutefisk!"
</P>
<P>
	   No taxpayer dollars will be spent on the Monday through Friday publication,
but the contract guarantees SEPTA at least $15,000 a month for cleanup costs and
an initial $30,000-a-month share of advertising revenues, projecting that
SEPTA's share may approach $300,000 a month in five years.
</P>
<P>
	   That could be a tall order, however, in a market that has seen circulation
drop dramatically in recent years. The 50-cent-a-day Inquirer had a weekday
circulation of 399,339 and the 60-cent Daily News 162,434 for the six months
ended Sept. 30, both down nearly 7 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Metro, which is expected to print 150,000 copies initially, also will face
competition from eight suburban daily newspapers, the twice-weekly Philadelphia
Tribune and two free, popular weekly alternative tabloids.
</P>
<P>
	   Stalberg acknowledged that the free tabloid has other newspaper executives
watching closely, especially when "virtually every newspaper in the country is
having some circulation problems."
</P>
<P>
	   "My own gut instinct is that people like newspapers that are meaty, that
have something to them," Stalberg said. "I don't want to think a headline
service is going to do it."
</P>
<P>
	   Sal Natale of Philadelphia expressed the same view as he clutched a Daily
News on a downtown platform recently.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would read (Metro) because it's free but not over an accomplished
newspaper that I know has good reporters," Natale said.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Probes Human Rights Abuses  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GUTKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez promised on Sunday to
investigate allegations of human rights abuses during last month's deadly
floods.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Sunday, Chavez appointed a soft-spoken lawyer named Isaias Rodriguez as
vice president. That position was created in a new constitution approved by
voters on Dec. 15, the same day avalanches of mud and water buried much of
Venezuela's coastline north of Caracas.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodriguez had served as vice president of the assembly that rewrote the
country's 1961 constitution, and has a been a key Chavez ally since the
president took office a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez addressed the human rights abuse allegations during his weekly radio
program ``Alo Presidente.'' He said he was willing to ``give my life'' to
protect Venezuelans against the kinds of abuses alleged to have taken place in
December.
</P>
<P>
	   Several rights groups have accused security forces of killing and beating
people during apparent efforts to control widespread looting after massive
flooding and landslides that officials estimate killed between 5,000 and 30,000
Venezuelans. An Associated Press reporter witnessed National Guardsmen beating
people with the sides of swords during attempts to control crowds after the
flooding.
</P>
<P>
	   The president traveled to the disaster zone on Venezuela's northern coast
late Saturday to personally hear from residents who said their rights were
violated. One man took the president and his entourage to the site of an alleged
mass grave where he said soldiers lined people up and shot them, Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
	   The site will be exhumed by the proper authorities, Chavez said. He insisted
his government is the first to take human rights seriously but said the
situation will take some time to improve.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a terrible culture here and that is not going to change
overnight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez pointed to his government's quick action in evacuating tens of
thousands of people after the floods. During the radio program, he read aloud
letters from citizens thanking the armed forces for their kind treatment during
the disaster.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez was elected 13 months ago and has since overhauled Venezuela's
government -- winning approval for a new constitution, increasing the power of
the presidency and ousting the old Congress and Supreme Court. Critics say
Chavez, a former army paratrooper who came onto the national scene eight years
ago by staging a failed military coup, has concentrated power in his own hands
and moved Venezuela dangerously close to dictatorship.

<HEADLINE> Whitman to put meat on the state budget bones with scheduled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman always likes to have a
surprise or two up her sleeve when she gives her big speeches.
<P>
	   So when some details of her proposed $21.3 billion proposed state budget
were released on Saturday, her budget team danced more than Fred Astaire to make
sure she's the one who delivers some news. They tried their best to keep mum
when asked about how she proposes to pay for the billions needed for school
repair, and how New Jersey will spend the billions it is owed over the next few
decades from a national tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   Some tobacco dollars for school construction, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
	   "Wait until Monday," spokesman Peter McDonough grinned.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget shows $174 million slated to come from the tobacco settlement.
But New Jersey actually expects to get another $297 million from this funding
pot.
</P>
<P>
	   What's with that? Wait until Monday, the budget team said.
</P>
<P>
	   When reporters persisted, one staffer threatened to sing "Monday, Monday."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman will formally reveal those plans, and perhaps a small tax cut, in
that Monday state budget address, slated for mid-afternoon in the Assembly
Chambers.
</P>
<P>
	   The spending plan she will propose is the biggest ever, crashing through the
$20 billion mark and fueled by a hot economy that is sending gobs of tax cash to
Trenton.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman is expected to propose a plan to use $250 million in state money to
help keep the Transportation Trust Fund afloat without raising the gas tax. That
plan also is expected to be tied into tobacco money and school construction.
</P>
<P>
	   The good-news budget also pays for higher property tax relief checks, about
$482 million more for public schools, and a total capital construction program
exceeding $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor proposes to spend about 8.9 percent more than the budget she
signed last June. The hot economy makes it another good-news budget: No major
tax increases, no state worker layoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   And with Whitman embroiled in a controversy over the disaster at motor
vehicle inspection stations that followed her decision to job the operation out
to a private company, this budget includes no new privatization.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman will deliver her annual address to a joint session of the state
Legislature. Lawmakers then will have their go at the budget in a series of
hearings that generally begin in March. Last year, lawmakers added about $353
million to Whitman's proposed budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The state is required by its constitution to have a budget signed before
July 1.

<HEADLINE> Famous Japanese Centenarian Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Kin Narita, who became a beloved symbol of graceful aging as
one of Japan's oldest and best-known twins, died Sunday morning of heart
failure, a representative for her family said. She was 107.
</P>
<P>
	   Kin and her twin sister Gin Kanie became celebrities in a country that
reveres the elderly, frequently appearing on television talk shows seated
side-by-side in kimonos. They charmed the public with their sharp wit and
positive outlook on life.
</P>
<P>
	   Kin, whose name means ``Gold,'' lived 20 minutes away from her sister Gin,
``Silver,'' in the central Japanese city of Nagoya, 190 miles west of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   Kin remained active into her final days.
</P>
<P>
	   The sisters celebrated their 107th birthday on Aug. 1 while traveling in
northern Japan, where they were guests of honor at a tree-planting ceremony. Kin
made the trip even though she had just been released from the hospital after
suffering from a stomach ulcer.
</P>
<P>
	   Gin contracted pneumonia two years ago, but has since made a strong
recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   The family has not yet finalized funeral plans, said Minoru Fujii, who spoke
to the media on behalf of the family.
</P>
<P>
	   Kin, who lived with her youngest son and his family, is survived by five
children, 11 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Canvas in Iowa  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- On the eve of Iowa's caucuses, Republican and
Democratic presidential candidates canvassed churches and national talk shows
Sunday, scouring this snow-crusted state for last-minute support even as they
began looking ahead to contests in New Hampshire and beyond.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the first step in several steps of the journey,'' Bill Bradley,
the former New Jersey senator who trails Vice President Al Gore in Democratic
polls, said on CBS.
</P>
<P>
	   Entering the first election contest of Campaign 2000, Republican George W.
Bush and Gore held wide leads in polls of voters who planned to visit schools,
civic clubs, fire stations and other sites Monday to support one of eight major
contestants.
</P>
<P>
	   The underdog candidates, all resigned to losing, were shooting for
face-saving finishes and Iowa's true reward: Momentum for New Hampshire's Feb. 1
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a marathon, not a sprint,'' said Republican Steve Forbes on NBC's
``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
	   The footrace in Iowa, a test of political organization, favors the national
front-runners. A Des Moines Sunday Register poll of 1,200 likely caucus-goers
showed Gore leading Bradley among Democrats 56 percent to 28 percent. Bush led
Forbes 43 percent to 20 percent in the Jan. 16-21 survey, which had an error
margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is in danger of finishing worse than expected in a contest that
traditionally punishes candidates who fail to meet expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   His latest poll rating was beneath the intentionally-low threshold his
advisers set as a measure of accomplishment: The 31 percent showing by Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., in a second-place finish behind then-President Jimmy
Carter in the 1980 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   With the rest of the GOP field in single digits, Forbes has long said he is
the conservative alternative to Bush. The argument would carry greater weight
if, after pouring millions of dollars into Iowa since his failed 1996 bid,
Forbes fares better than the new poll suggests -- 23 points behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The polls show that about one in 10 voters are undecided, giving the
candidates incentive to campaign hard Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only thing I know to do is to encourage our folks to get out and vote.
We need as big a vote as possible,'' Bush told reporters between campaign stops.
</P>
<P>
	   In a lengthy interview with ABC, Bush struggled with his explanation for
supporting a sales tax increase in Texas after making a no-tax pledge. The
second-term governor said he had qualified the promise by also pledging to
reform education funding in the state, an effort that presumably led to the tax
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Dismissing the issue, Bush said ``There's pledges all the time'' and
reviewed a record as governor that included two major tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   He also continued to flesh out his views abortion, a critical issue to many
GOP caucus-goers. Asked about the topic for the fourth day, he predicted that
Texas would outlaw first-trimester abortions if the Supreme Court reversed
itself and let states impose strict anti-abortion laws -- a position Bush says
the court should take.
</P>
<P>
	   Maintaining a caucus tradition, several campaigns had supporters papering
churches and their parking lots with leaflets. Religious conservatives represent
a third of likely caucus-goers and are more likely than most voters to attend
the sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Forbes is expected to get a lion's share of the conservative vote,
former ambassador Alan Keyes, Washington activist Gary Bauer and Sen. Orrin
Hatch of Utah are carving up the religious base. Keyes, Bauer and Hatch are
likely competing for third place; finishing lower could doom their candidacies.
</P>
<P>
	   Addressing a congregation on the city's industrial north side, Bauer said
Christians should vote more on principle than on ``selfish'' issues such as
taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Do what you think God would have you do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking to New Hampshire, Bush pressed his case against Sen. John McCain's
tax-cutting package. The Arizona senator, who did not campaign in Iowa, is in a
tight race with Bush in the New England state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fundamental debate is do we leave money in Washington or do we give it
back to taxpayers?'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain would cut fewer taxes than Bush, saving some projected government
surpluses to bolster Social Security, Medicare and pay down the national debt.
While Bush was in Iowa, McCain was campaigning Sunday in New Hampshire where he
picked up endorsements from two of the state's biggest newspapers.
</P>
<P>
	   Public polls suggest that Gore has opened a slight lead over Bradley in New
Hampshire, though the vice president's own polls still show the race in a
statistical dead heat. Bradley aides also consider the race tied. On the
Republican side, McCain is managing to maintain a lead in the high single digits
over the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa, Forbes courted social conservatives by questioning Bush's
commitment to abortion and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Candidates at this time of the year -- the conservative establishment in
the Republican Party -- always say `Oh, we are conservative' and then after the
election, they forget about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley urged supporters to vote. ``We could surprise a few people,'' he
said at Cornell College.
</P>
<P>
	   In Davenport, Gore said his ``honorable opponent'' has focused on health
care reform while treating education ``as kind of an afterthought.''
</P>
<P>
	   As the candidates stumped, aides fine-tuned plans to get supporters to the
caucus sites. Last-minute mailings criticized opponents and offered incentives
to vote. A Bush flier included two ``W'' stickers for supporters to show unity
at caucus sites.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters sized up the field for the last time.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Steenhoek, 32, of Ankeny, said he was leaning toward Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's more of him being such an underdog and trying so hard and keeping at
it that makes me like him so much,'' he said.

The clock next to his bed read 3:20 a.m.

<P>

<P>
	   The episode this month is a success story for Scarborough's ``Reverse 911,''
an automated telephoning system that allows police to quickly alert whole
neighborhoods about potential problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The public loved it,'' said Joe Giacomantonio, community resources officer
for the Scarborough Police Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Scarborough is the only community in Maine that provides the service but the
technology is catching on across the country. Scores of agencies have put
similar systems to use over the past five years, and police are using the tool
in novel ways.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, police in Arlington, Va., alerted residents to be on the lookout
for a man with Alzheimer's who wandered away from an adult day care program.
Based on a caller's tip, the search was expanded and the man was found seven
hours later in the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
	   In Bowling Green, Ky., police sent an automated message to banks in
September after learning of a counterfeit check-cashing scam. Seconds after
getting the notice, a teller dialed 911 when a woman tried to pass a $14,000
check, resulting in an arrest on the spot.
</P>
<P>
	   In Maine, the episode unfolded after a violent burglary attempt in Portland
in which a family was terrorized by five bandits. It ended when the father was
shot while being forced to lie on the floor.
</P>
<P>
	   The incident moved from Maine's largest city into this bedroom community of
15,000 after a getaway car wrecked a half-mile from Peterson's house and three
suspects fled into the woods.
</P>
<P>
	   That's when Giacomantonio went to work, grabbing his mouse and firing up his
``Reverse 911'' computer program.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking at a map on his computer screen, he used the mouse to outline a
four-square-mile area were the suspects were loose. Then he recorded the
message, and the computer did the rest.
</P>
<P>
	   The phone calls started going out to 400 homes at 3 a.m., even as police
prepared to go door-to-door.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the suspects were found hiding in a hunting trailer, but a third
remained on the lam at daybreak.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a couple of hours later when Peterson saw a teen-ager fitting the
message's description dart from the woods wearing only boxer shorts and a
sweatshirt on a cold morning.
</P>
<P>
	   He dialed 911.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Before I was off the phone with the dispatcher, they had him,'' Peterson
said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a happy ending. The shooting victim survived and the suspects were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   When it was over, Giacomantonio sent another message saying the suspects
were in custody.
</P>
<P>
	   Although sometimes referred to as ``Reverse 911,'' the notification system
has nothing to do with the 911 system that people in the United States rely on
for emergencies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Reverse 911'' is a registered trademark of Sygma Micro Corp., which
installed Scarborough's system for $23,000. It is sophisticated enough to
indicate whether a call was received or whether a message was left on an
answering machine. It also can be programmed to keep trying.
</P>
<P>
	   It has other tricks, as well.
</P>
<P>
	   During a hurricane, for example, police could send an evacuation notice to
coastal residents, asking recipients of the message to press ''1'' if they
intend to comply, ''2'' if they need help, or ''3'' if they intend to ride out
the storm.
</P>
<P>
	   Using a printout, police and firefighters would know whom to check on when
going door-to-door.
</P>
<P>
	   There are three major companies marketing the systems. Sygma Micro Corp. and
Avtex, based in Edina, Minn., have targeted law enforcement agencies. Sygma says
it has about 100 systems in the field, and Avtex says it has installed 280.
</P>
<P>
	   Dialogic Corp. of Franklin, Tenn., targets emergency agencies and operators
of chemical and nuclear plants and has installed roughly 1,100 systems, said
David Krikac, the company's marketing director.

<HEADLINE> Iran Probes Judge for Pigeon Deaths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- A disciplinary court will investigate the Iranian judge
who ordered 170 pigeons to be slaughtered after two neighbors fought over who
owned one of the birds, a judicial official was quoted Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The head of the judiciary expressed sorrow upon hearing the verdict and
ordered a probe into the case,'' Abdolreza Izadpanah, an adviser to judiciary
chief Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, told Entekhab newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge, who was not been named, ordered the pigeons be slaughtered last
week, after hearing a case in which two neighbors were accused of fighting over
one of the birds. The neighbors were also accused of illegally breeding the
birds, and the judge fined them $167 each.
</P>
<P>
	   The pigeons were slaughtered the same day the verdict was announced,
prompting condemnations from animal protection groups and ordinary Iranians.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation will be carried out by the Judges Disciplinary Court, the
newspaper said, but did not specify what charges the judge might face.

<HEADLINE> 'Subway' Called Key to Weight Loss  </HEADLINE>
    By JAMES PRICHARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Jared Fogle stands at the counter of a Subway shop
near the campus of Indiana University, watching an employee assemble a foot-long
vegetable sub that he has ordered.
</P>
<P>
	   The two exchange some small talk and share a laugh. They have gotten to know
each other pretty well, what with Fogle eating almost nothing but low-calorie,
low-fat sandwiches from the shop for nearly a year -- and shedding 245 pounds
from his 6-foot-2 frame in the process.
</P>
<P>
	   Fogle went from a colossal 425 pounds to a much slimmer 180 pounds on his
unusual diet. When Subway executives got word of his remarkable weight-loss
story, they put him in a commercial now being aired around the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The 30-second spot was filmed on a sunny December day in Pasadena, Calif. It
begins with a picture of the old Jared Fogle, then cuts to images of the new
Jared Fogle cheerfully ordering a Subway sandwich and eating it on a park bench.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not saying that his diet is right for you. You should talk to your
doctor first," the announcer says. "But it is food for thought."
</P>
<P>
	   A year of veggie subs is not the dream diet for everyone.
</P>
<P>
	   Michele Klotzer, a spokeswoman for Milford, Conn.-based Subway, concurs.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're very proud of Jared's accomplishment, and we're pleased that our
low-fat sandwiches could fit into his meal plan, but it's not a diet that we
endorse by any means," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nelda Mercer, a registered dietitian with Health Media Inc. in Ann Arbor,
Mich., and a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association, said Fogle ate
"relatively healthy" during his diet because several food groups are represented
in the sandwiches. She said he probably should have included skim milk or yogurt
to ensure he was getting enough calcium.
</P>
<P>
	   She added that most people probably would become bored quickly by Fogle's
repetitive mealtime regimen and gone off the diet. Instead of quick-fix diets,
the ADA recommends lifestyle changes: eating the right foods, consuming fewer
calories and exercising.
</P>
<P>
	   Fogle, 22, a senior in business management at Indiana University, started
steadily gaining weight when he was in the third or fourth grade and continued
to do so throughout high school, despite frequent warnings from his father,
Indianapolis physician Norman Fogle.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never listened, you know," the younger Fogle said in an interview. "It
went in one ear and out the other. It didn't cause me to change my ways. It had
to be me who wanted to do that."
</P>
<P>
	   At IU, Fogle's weight skyrocketed and he became dangerously obese. He wore
size XXXXXXL shirts -- the largest sold by big-and-tall men's stores -- and
pants with 60-inch waists. He often fell asleep in class and found himself short
of breath after walking one or two blocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Worried about his health and unhappy about his appearance, he found
salvation at the Subway shop next door to his off-campus apartment. One evening
in mid-March 1998, he suddenly decided to live on a steady diet of the
franchise's low-fat subs.
</P>
<P>
	   From then until late February 1999, he followed virtually the same mealtime
routine every day. He skipped breakfast. He had a 6-inch turkey breast sub,
small bag of baked Lays potato chips and Diet Coke for lunch. He downed a
foot-long veggie sub and a Diet Coke for dinner.
</P>
<P>
	   Total daily dietary intake: about 1,000 calories.
</P>
<P>
	   "The biggest question people would ask me was, 'Did you ever get sick of
it?' and I never did," Fogle said. "Every time I would come in here, I would
sort of be excited about it, knowing I was going to get to eat this sandwich. I
don't know why."
</P>
<P>
	   Only a few meals, usually during holidays or other special occasions, didn't
include a Subway sandwich. At those times, he always was careful to eat small
portions of low-fat foods.
</P>
<P>
	   Fogle weighed 180 pounds when he ended the diet but decided that he had
become too thin, so he gained a few pounds. He has maintained his current weight
for nearly a year by taking in about 2,200 well-balanced calories each day and
walking daily.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm about 186 or 187 right now, which is where I want to be," Fogle said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fogle said while the offbeat diet worked for him, others desiring to lose
weight may have to try something else and, regardless of the diet they choose,
should first consult a physician.

<HEADLINE> Western Countries Eye Libyan Market  </HEADLINE>
    By VIJAY JOSHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) -- It's difficult these days to find a seat on flights
to Libya. Chances are, they are taken up by European business executives
searching for deals in the Arab world's newest market.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the United Nations lifted its economic sanctions last year, Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi has been wooing foreigners to invest in an economy that
remains vastly underdeveloped except for its rich oil sector.
</P>
<P>
	   He has begun loosening three decades of socialist economic controls and has
tried to put his past reputation as a supporter of terrorism behind him.
</P>
<P>
	   But Libya's pledges that investments will be protected remain untested.
</P>
<P>
	   "Libya may need privatization but I don't think its government is serious,"
said Bahgat Moussa, who teaches Middle Eastern economics and business at the
American University in Cairo and often visits Libya.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody knows their real intentions. They are not credible and nobody can
predict what the Libyans would do beyond one month," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Potential investors are also uneasy over the government's attempts to push
them toward joint ventures with local partners who have little business
expertise.
</P>
<P>
	   Libya's banking system is so primitive it takes weeks to get checks cashed.
Customs procedures are arbitrary. The government doesn't release trade
statistics, making projections and analyses impossible.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are really in the dark as foreign investors," said Marcus Courage, whose
London-based Strategic Profile International represents the British Libyan
Business Group, comprising 25 British companies.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added, "One would be foolish to neglect the opportunities that are
there."
</P>
<P>
	   European investors are betting that Libya will eventually present tremendous
opportunities, and that the first to take the risk will be the first to benefit.
American investors are still hampered by the United States' own sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   Libya needs to diversify its oil-based economy and reduce 10 percent
inflation and unemployment estimated at 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Libya "can't afford not to be part of this globalized world," Courage said.
</P>
<P>
	   The government enacted a 28-point law in 1997 aimed at encouraging foreign
capital investment. But it began pursuing foreign money seriously only after the
United Nations suspended on April 5 a seven-year embargo on international
airline flights and oil industry spare parts.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspension resulted from Libya's handing over two intelligence agents
for trial in the Netherlands in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner, a turning
point in Libya's increasingly fruitful efforts to cast off its notoriety as a
pariah state that sponsored terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspension of sanctions opened a floodgate of European interest.
</P>
<P>
	   Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema came to Tripoli in November to meet
with Gadhafi, and left with a Libyan pledge to fight terrorism. The European
Union lifted its sanctions on Sept. 13, as did Switzerland, Germany and Russia.
Britain restored full diplomatic relations Nov. 24 after a high-level business
delegation visited in July. Swissair, British Airways and Alitalia have started
flights to Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
	   "You are welcome to invest in Libya. ... We are not pirates or rebels or
terrorists," Gadhafi declared at a business conference in September attended by
hundreds of executives.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same conference, Economy Minister Abdel Hafidh Zlitni said Libya
needs to invest $35 billion over the next five years, mostly in non-oil sectors,
and expects $14 billion to come from private sources.
</P>
<P>
	   Moussa, the Cairo professor, said that kind of money will be hard to
attract.
</P>
<P>
	   He and others point to Libya's lack of an independent judiciary, pivotal in
cases of business disputes and its currency restrictions and dual exchange rates
-- banks buy one dollar for 0.45 dinar, but sell one dollar for nearly two
dinars.
</P>
<P>
	   Libya has also said often that it will not completely abandon socialism and
will focus on investments in what it deems critical areas.
</P>
<P>
	   The government is looking at projects such as housing, hospital
refurbishment, water treatment, power and transmission lines. It also wants to
upgrade the Tripoli airport, run a railway line to Egypt and Tunisia and build
luxury hotels.
</P>
<P>
	   Moussa said Libyan economists agree financial, administrative and even
political reforms should accompany privatization, but nobody is willing to say
it openly under an authoritarian rule where the final word rests with Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
	   Libya has yet to sign a major deal outside the oil and gas sector, which
earned the country $6.5 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Many suspect Libya may be courting Europeans as political leverage to
pressure Washington to lift U.S. sanctions, allowing Libya's full return to the
international community. Libya's oil industry is almost entirely based on
American technology, forcing it to buy replacements in the black market at
exorbitant prices.

<HEADLINE> Australian Light Planes May Fly Soon  </HEADLINE>
    By ROHAN SULLIVAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A fuel contamination scare that has crippled
Australia's light aircraft industry may end soon thanks to a new test to tell if
a plane is safe to fly, aviation officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 5,000 small aircraft in Australia's eastern states have been grounded
for 13 days over concern that batches of airplane fuel made by Mobil Oil
Australia Ltd. could clog engines.
</P>
<P>
	   In response, Mobil has developed a test to determine if a plane's fuel
system has been contaminated, said Mick Toller of the Civil Aviation Safety
Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Until now, operators had no way of knowing if their plane's engine had been
damaged.
</P>
<P>
	   Mobil has begun distributing the test to small aircraft operators across
southeastern Australia, and some planes could be flying as soon as Monday,
Toller said.
</P>
<P>
	   If the test detects contaminated fuel, the fuel system will have be cleaned,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Jan. 10, CASA ordered all aircraft running on fuel made at Mobil's
Melbourne plant between Nov. 21 and Dec. 23 not to fly, throwing an industry
worth $330 million a year into crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Small regional airlines, charter services and flight schools were affected.
Crops were left undusted, and some medical and wildfire fighting services scaled
back.
</P>
<P>
	   Turboprop planes, such as jet airliners, are not affected.
</P>
<P>
	   Mobil Oil Australia, a subsidiary of U.S.-based Mobil Exxon Corp., says the
contamination was a result of a mistake in the production process, but it has
not admitted liability for losses. It has offered operators a $10 million
assistance package.
</P>
<P>
	   The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association has launched a class action suit
on behalf of operators against Mobil, seeking an unspecified amount of damages
for financial losses since the planes have been grounded.

<HEADLINE> Man Who Kept Animals Eaten by Lion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- A man who kept wild animals in his home in southern Italy was
found dead -- eaten by a lion, Italian news reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the man, who lived in a town near the city of Lecce, kept a
lion, tigers and a panther in the basement of his house, as well as many dogs
and cats.
</P>
<P>
	   Neighbors hadn't seen the man in a week and called police, who found his
remains in the lion's cage, his body mauled and his clothes torn, RAI state TV
and other Italian news reports said.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said they were investigating if the 50-year-old man was alive
when attacked by the lion or if he had died a natural death a few days earlier
while in the cage and the animal, with no one to feed it, then ate the body.
</P>
<P>
	   RAI said the man was a lawyer who moved from his hometown of Naples to the
countryside in southeastern Italy five years ago after neighbors there
complained that he kept wild animals.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports said the man apparently didn't have the permits necessary to
keep exotic animals as house pets.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Major May Be Jailed  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER THORNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ELLENDALE, Del. (AP) -- Maj. Sonnie Bates is so cautious about following
military rules that he won't talk to a reporter in his home without first
changing out of his uniform.
</P>
<P>
	   But the decorated pilot has not followed all his orders. Bates, 35, is
believed to be the highest-ranking officer in the Air Force to face a
court-martial for refusing to be vaccinated against anthrax.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I fully expect to be in a court-martial inside of six weeks,'' he said.
``And I'll lose the court-martial. I don't have any doubt.''
</P>
<P>
	   An investigating officer is to hold a hearing next week at Dover Air Force
Base where Bates will be able to argue against the charge. He doesn't expect to
win, and he believes the Pentagon intends to make an example of him.
</P>
<P>
	   Lower-ranking soldiers concerned about getting sick from the anthrax vaccine
won't be as likely to resist the shots after a major has been court-martialed
and sent to Fort Leavenworth, Kan., Bates said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm doing what I've always been trained to do and taught to do,'' he said.
``If you know it's right, you stand up for it. And likewise, if you know it's
wrong, you have to challenge it. No matter what the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
	   The military has ordered all of its 2.4 million reserve and active-duty
soldiers, sailors and airmen to be inoculated as a defense against biological
warfare.
</P>
<P>
	   Several military personnel have been prosecuted for refusing the shots, and
some reservists have quit to avoid taking them. The military says they are safe.
</P>
<P>
	   The consequences of Bates' decision are severe. He could lose his rank and
pension. He could lose his house. And he could face up to five years in prison,
away from his wife and three children.
</P>
<P>
	   That is a thought that terrifies Roxane Bates. She doesn't know what it will
mean for Seth, their 7-year-old autistic son.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Seth can't accept change easily. I don't know how he's going to handle
it,'' she said. ``He'll ask every day where his dad is.''
</P>
<P>
	   Maj. Frank Smolinsky, chief of public affairs at Dover Air Force Base, said
the proceedings don't have to lead to a court-martial. There are several steps
in the process that could lead to the charge being dismissed, Smolinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   But in the Bates home, the family is convinced that it will end badly. It
has meant weeks of anxiety, sleepless nights, crying jags.
</P>
<P>
	   The night before Bates heard the charge read against him, his wife's
grandfather died. In her kitchen, Roxane Bates recounted how the death added to
her stress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Pop-Paw died?'' Candy, their 14-year-old daughter, interrupted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Oh my God, Candy, I didn't tell you,'' her mother said. She clasped her
hands to her face and Candy twisted into tears.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can see what this has done to us, done to my family,'' she said. ``I'm
so worked up about things I forgot to tell my daughter her great-grandfather
died.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bates is tall, with a long stride. He grew up poor and put himself through
Northern Kentucky University. He joined the Air Force in 1986, the year he
graduated with a bachelor's degree in math.
</P>
<P>
	   His study is littered with plaques for commendations and medals, including
one for landing a plane in October 1998 after a storm knocked out its
instruments.
</P>
<P>
	   His concerns over the anthrax virus grew after he was assigned to Dover Air
Force Base in August. He said 12 to 15 members of his 250-member squadron were
out sick with serious illnesses: thyroid damage, infected cysts and lesions. The
only common thread was their illnesses followed anthrax injections, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Never in my time in the Air Force have I seen such a sick unit,'' Bates
said.
</P>
<P>
	   During a visit to the base last month, Defense Secretary William Cohen said
he had halted production of the vaccine at a Michigan factory that failed an
inspection by the Food and Drug Administration. But Cohen said the inoculations
would continue with stockpiled vaccine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have enough safe, reliable vaccine stockpiled to continue this for
another year,'' Cohen said, adding that he had begun taking the series of six
shots that make up the inoculation himself.
</P>
<P>
	   That isn't enough to convince Bates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thank God every day of my life for my health,'' Bates said. ``And I'll
be dadgummed if I'm going to give it up for anybody. If I give up my health, not
only can I not defend this country, but I can't protect and provide for my
family.''

<HEADLINE> Candidates round up votes in Iowa, look ahead to New Hampshire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - On the eve of the Iowa caucuses, Republican and
Democratic presidential candidates canvassed churches and national talk shows
Sunday, scouring this snow-crusted state for last-minute support even as they
began looking ahead to contests in New Hampshire and beyond.
<P>
	   "This is the first step in several steps of the journey," Bill Bradley, the
former New Jersey senator who trails Vice President Al Gore in Democratic polls,
said on CBS.
</P>
<P>
	   Entering the first election contest of Campaign 2000, Republican George W.
Bush and Gore held wide leads in polls of voters who planned to visit schools,
civic clubs, fire stations and other sites Monday to support one of eight major
contestants.
</P>
<P>
	   The underdog candidates, all resigned to losing, were still shooting for
face-saving finishes and Iowa's true reward: Momentum for New Hampshire's Feb. 1
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a marathon, not a sprint," Republican Steve Forbes, the wealthy
Bedminster, N.J., publisher, said on NBC's "Meet the Press."
</P>
<P>
	   The footrace in Iowa, a test of political organization, favors the national
front-runners. A Des Moines Sunday Register poll of 1,200 likely caucus-goers
showed Gore leading Bradley among Democrats, 56 percent to 28 percent. Bush led
Forbes 43 percent to 20 percent in the Jan. 16-21 survey, which had an error
margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is in danger of finishing worse than expected in a contest that
traditionally punishes candidates who fail to meet expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   His latest poll rating was beneath the intentionally low threshold his
advisers set as a measure of accomplishment: The 31 percent showing by Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., in a second-place finish behind then-President Jimmy
Carter in the 1980 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   With the rest of the GOP field in single digits, Forbes has long said he is
the conservative alternative to Bush. The argument would carry greater weight
if, after pouring millions of dollars into Iowa since his failed 1996 bid,
Forbes fares better than the new poll suggests - 23 points behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The polls show that about one in 10 voters are undecided, giving the
candidates incentive to campaign hard Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't want my voters to take anything for granted," Bush told reporters
after appearing on ABC's "This Week."
</P>
<P>
	   In the lengthy TV interview, Bush struggled with his explanation for
supporting a sales tax increase in Texas after making a no-tax pledge. The
second-term governor said he had qualified the promise by also pledging to
reform education funding in the state, an effort that presumably led to the tax
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Dismissing the issue, Bush said, "There's pledges all the time" and reviewed
a record as governor that included two major tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   He also continued to flesh out his views on abortion, a critical issue to
many GOP caucus-goers. Asked about the topic for the fourth day, he predicted
that Texas would outlaw first-trimester abortions if the Supreme Court reversed
itself and let states impose strict anti-abortion laws - a position Bush says
the court should take.
</P>
<P>
	   Maintaining a caucus tradition, several campaigns had supporters papering
churches and their parking lots with leaflets. Religious conservatives represent
a third of likely caucus-goers and are more likely than most voters to attend
the sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Forbes is expected to get a lion's share of the conservative vote,
former ambassador Alan Keyes, Washington activist Gary Bauer and Sen. Orrin
Hatch of Utah are carving up the religious base. Keyes, Bauer and Hatch are
likely competing for third place; finishing lower could doom their candidacies.
</P>
<P>
	   Addressing a congregation on the city's industrial north side, Bauer said
Christians should vote more on principle than on "selfish" issues such as taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   "Do what you think God would have you do," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking to New Hampshire, Bush pressed his case against Sen. John McCain's
tax-cutting package. The Arizona senator, who did not campaign in Iowa, is in a
tight race with Bush in the New England state.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fundamental debate is, do we leave money in Washington or do we give it
back to taxpayers?" Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain would cut fewer taxes than Bush, saving some projected government
surpluses to bolster Social Security, Medicare and pay down the national debt.
While Bush was in Iowa, McCain was campaigning Sunday in New Hampshire, where he
picked up endorsements from two of the state's biggest newspapers.
</P>
<P>
	   Public and campaign polls show Gore gaining steam in New Hampshire, opening
up a slight lead over Bradley while, on the Republican side, McCain is managing
to maintain a lead in the high single digits over the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa, Forbes courted social conservatives by questioning Bush's
commitment to abortion and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   "Candidates at this time of the year - the conservative establishment in the
Republican Party - always say 'Oh, we are conservative' and then after the
election, they forget about it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes and Bradley accused their party front-runners of being too political.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked whether Gore's attacks hurt his campaign, Bradley, on "Face the
Nation," said, "I'm a big boy. I know how politics as usual are practiced and
what's going on."
</P>
<P>
	   In Davenport, Gore said his "honorable opponent" has focused on health care
reform while treating education "as kind of an afterthought."
</P>
<P>
	   As the candidates stumped, aides fine-tuned plans to get supporters to the
caucus sites. Last-minute mailings criticized opponents and offered incentives
to vote. A Bush flier included two "W" stickers for supporters to show unity at
caucus sites.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters sized up the field for the last time.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Steenhoek, 32, of Ankeny, said he was leaning toward Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's more of him being such an underdog and trying so hard and keeping at
it that makes me like him so much," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Backs Away From Gadhafi Visit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union has backed away from plans to
invite Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to its headquarters in Brussels, saying
conditions are not right for a "prompt and constructive" visit.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement released Saturday night, the EU's executive commission said
Gadhafi had not fully accepted the principles of the EU's "Euro-Mediterranean
Partnership" before a visit.
</P>
<P>
	   Libya has demanded that Israel and the Palestinian Authority be excluded
from a partnership between the EU and 11 Mediterranean nations until Israel and
the Palestinians reach a peace settlement, EU officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   To join the partnership, nations must sign a declaration committing all
members to work towards democracy, human rights and free trade, respect each
other's territorial integrity and seek peaceful solutions to disputes.
</P>
<P>
	   While Libya expressed acceptance of the declaration earlier this month, it
expressed reservations about including Israel and the Palestinians -- who are
included in the partnership program -- until they had a peace deal, EU officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Libyan demand was "completely unacceptable," said EU spokesman Gunnar
Wiegand.
</P>
<P>
	   EU Commission President Romano Prodi spoke to Gadhafi by telephone Friday to
spell out the conditions for a visit, and the Libyan authorities replied
Saturday that they were "at present unable to give any formal commitment on the
full acceptance," the EU statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The prospect of a visit was raised during a call Gadhafi made to Prodi over
the New Year's holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   Prodi, who worked to improve Europe's relations with Iran during his stint
as Italian prime minister in the late 1990s, is seeking to bring Libya into the
partnership program.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday's EU statement said contacts with Libya would continue to
"ascertain whether the conditions for a constructive visit could be met" some
other time.

<HEADLINE> Grandmothers blow kisses, wipe tears, as NY church prays  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez blew kisses and wiped
away tears as they stood before 2,000 people praying in a Manhattan church
Sunday for the child's return to Cuba.
<P>
	   The two women, Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela Quintana, did not speak as
worshippers at the interdenominational Riverside Church gave them a standing
ovation.
</P>
<P>
	   "Raquel and Mariela are grateful for your love," said the Rev. Bob Edgar, a
former Democratic congressman and head of the National Council of Churches of
Christ in the U.S.A., which sponsored the grandmothers' trip from Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   Edgar thanked the church "for helping us this morning to pray for the quick
and safe return of Elian Gonzalez. ... We think that a miracle can happen if we
pray together."
</P>
<P>
	   Randy Naylor, a spokesman for the church group, said the two women would
leave New York on Monday. He said they were "exhausted" and had no immediate
plans for other appearances. The two women arrived in New York on Friday and met
Saturday with U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview published in Sunday's New York Times, Mrs. Quintana, the
paternal grandmother, said: "We're not politicians. What we want is the
well-being of the child."
</P>
<P>
	   Referring to the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, and other relatives
whom the boy is staying with in Miami, she added: "I don't know why they want
the child to stay here after the trauma he's been through. They are not close
relatives."
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was rescued from an inner tube on Thanksgiving Day after the boat in
which he had left Cuba capsized. His mother, her boyfriend and nine others
perished.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered the boy returned
to Cuba. His great-uncle has filed suit to stop the INS. And lawmakers in
Congress plan an attempt this week to declare Elian a U.S. citizen. If such
legislation becomes law, the boy no longer would be an immigrant under INS
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush, speaking on ABC's "This
Week," said granting Elian citizenship "would be a wonderful gesture."
</P>
<P>
	   He added that the boy's father should come to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   "A couple of weeks I would think would be reasonable so that the man could
get a taste of freedom, so the man could understand the same emotions and the
same sentiment that evidently the boy's mother felt," Bush said. "I mean, the
mother was trying to escape to freedom."
</P>
<P>
	   But Ms. Rodriguez, Elian's maternal grandmother, scoffed at those who say
Elian's mother would have wanted him to stay here.
</P>
<P>
	   "None of them knew her," Ms. Rodriguez told the Times. "How can they know
what she thought?" She added that her daughter had been coerced into going to
Miami by her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers told the Times that the boy was extremely close to them and
to his father, and that he spent part of each week with his dad, who had
divorced Elian's mother and remarried.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have all raised him and spoiled him," Mrs. Quintana said, adding: "Why
stay in the United States if all his family is in Cuba? In Cuba he doesn't lack
for anything."
</P>
<P>
	   So far the grandmothers have announced no plans to go to Miami. But the
Cuban American National Foundation, a group opposed to the Cuban Communist
regime of Fidel Castro, offered to fly there if they want to go.
</P>
<P>
	   Jorge Mas Santos, the Miami-based group's chairman, said the grandmothers
are being manipulated by Castro and his supporters and would have come to Miami
to see Elian if not for "the fact that their loved ones remain as virtual
hostages back in Cuba."
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," called
Elian "a pawn in a much bigger battle. I think a father has got a right to his
child, in my view, but this is a battle ... over what should our policy be to
Cuba and I think it's time for us to get over this embargo and end the sanctions
and try to establish a new pathway to normal relations with Cuba."

<HEADLINE> Discontent among workers heats up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - It was stupid. Irresponsible. Definitely not
condoned by the higher ups.
<P>
	   So, and vigorously so, stated leaders of the state's largest union of public
workers as word of a so-called wildcat sick-out by state snowplow operators on
Long Island last week began to eclipse news of downstate New York's first Year
2000 snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
	   However, it happened that more than 300 Department of Transportation workers
called in sick Thursday morning, potentially leaving snow to pile up on busy
roadways. Most went to work on their own accord after being urged to do so by
their shop stewards, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the job action brought to the surface the hard feelings that have
accumulated over the past nine months in which the unionized workers have failed
to reach a new contract with the administration of Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
	   A fuming Pataki declared a state of emergency, called in the National Guard
and sent dozens of investigators to Long Island, where they have been pulling
workers' files and conducting individual interviews to prove they, in fact,
engaged in an illegal job action.
</P>
<P>
	   And when word reached the governor that DOT workers in Westchester and
Putnam counties were considering a copycat strike over the weekend, Pataki
obtained a court order mandating that workers in both counties be notified of
$1,000-a-day fines and other penalties for not showing up to work.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will not tolerate this outrageous and cowardly strike by workers whose
first obligation is to protect public safety," Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Civil Service Employees Association (CSEA) bristled, characterizing the
administration's reaction as tyrannical.
</P>
<P>
	   "CSEA is standing up to the governor in a state contract fight and the
governor's now trying to slap us around," CSEA President Danny Donohue said.
"The governor needs to consider how seriously he is alienating the people who
work for him."
</P>
<P>
	   Cornell University Professor Kate Bronfen-Brenner, who studies labor
relations, said she wasn't surprised by the Pataki-CSEA conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   "Workers in this country are fired up," she said. "The sense is there's an
economic boom and they're not benefitting."
</P>
<P>
	   What makes the situation in New York particularly acute, she said, is a 1967
statute known as the Taylor Law, which allows public-sector employees to bargain
collectively but precludes them from striking.
</P>
<P>
	   The recourse for the leaders of all the unions who have not yet reached a
new contract with the state has been to protest.
</P>
<P>
	   For the governor's Jan. 6 State of the State address, several thousand union
members demonstrated outside the Capitol. There have also been several smaller
protests, including one by hundreds of workers at the State Fair in Syracuse
last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the sick-out is the only action by state employees
</P>
<P>
	   to actually threaten services.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think those guys down there figured it's up to them to do it themselves,"
said Patrick Ellis, who along with Bill Walsh is challenging Donohue for the
presidency of the CSEA.
</P>
<P>
	   Ballots have gone out to CSEA's 265,000 members, including 77,000 state
workers, in the race for the union's presidency. The votes will be counted
starting early next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Ellis said the snow-plowers' action is a symptom of a rift between union
leadership and the rank-and-file that has been widening since April, when
members, pointing to a 38 percent raise for legislators and the governor and a
state budget surplus of at least $2 billion, voted down a tentative four-year
contract worked out by CSEA negotiators calling for an overall 11 percent pay
increase.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, there has been more rhetoric than negotiating. The Public
Employees Federation, with 54,000 the second-largest state employee union, has
also been without a contract since April 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki, who was elected governor on a platform of controlling the cost of
government, has made it a point of pride to say he has saved taxpayers $700
million a year by reducing the state workforce by 21,000 positions, mostly by
attrition. Allowing private companies to bid on contracts to perform some public
services is another part of his efforts to rein in government spending.
</P>
<P>
	   In general, taxpayers expect state government to run as leanly as a
private-sector corporation, Cornell's Bronfen-Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we have here are public-sector employers acting like the private
sector and yet workers in the public sector don't have the right to take this (a
strike) on," Bronfen-Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Wesolowski, owner of RBR Snow Contractors and Melville Snow, two of Long
Island's largest commercial snow removal companies, said he had no doubt a
private company could keep the roads cleared more cheaply than the state in the
wake of last week's job action.
</P>
<P>
	   Wesolowski hires freelancers, who can make $50 an hour. But there are none
of the medical benefits, pensions, and job security offered by the state to
CSEA-represented plowers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Here a guy may work straight through 30 or 40 hours and make nice money,"
Wesolowski said, "but we still can't compete."

<HEADLINE> Barak: No Written Promises on Golan  </HEADLINE>
   By JACK KATZENELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak told his Cabinet on
Sunday that he would not make any written promises to withdraw from the entire
Golan Heights in order to resume peace negotiations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Sunday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak arrived in Jordan after
visiting Syria -- a trip aimed at getting Arabs to cooperate among themselves as
peace talks with Israel evolve.
</P>
<P>
	   The Syrian state-owned newspaper Al-Thawra said Saturday that Barak should
promise in writing to withdraw to the border that existed before Israel captured
the strategic plateau from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak's office said the premier told his Cabinet that he had not been asked
to make such a promise in writing, but that if a request was made, he would say
no.
</P>
<P>
	   Al-Thawra said ``a document indicating withdrawal to the June 4, 1967,
border would open a new and real chance'' prior to the start of the next round
of peace negotiations between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak said Israel will make a decision on a withdrawal after it receives
satisfactory answers from Syria on security arrangements, on the degree of
normalization that Syria is prepared to accept and on water resources which
Israel does not want to lose as a result of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Syria wants to start with the issue of borders, but that's not going to
happen,'' Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
	   Levy added that he was disappointed by what he described as Syria's change
in tone since the talks opened. ``It pains me that after the meetings in the
United States, Syria is acting in such a harsh way, not suited to the type of
talks we had begun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel is demanding a much larger demilitarized zone on the Syrian side of
the border than on the Israeli side. Israel also wants to retain a presence at
an early warning station in the Golan and insists on normal relations, with an
exchange of embassies and open borders.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria is wary of making such commitments before obtaining a written promise
of total withdrawal from the entire Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel has hinted unofficially that it is willing to withdraw from the
heights and to the 1923 international border, which lies a short distance to the
east of the 1967 line.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa were to
have resumed last week in Washington. But Syria postponed them, reportedly out
of anger over the leaking to an Israeli newspaper of a U.S. document outlining
the position of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak told the Cabinet it is in the interest of both sides to resume the
talks. He believed they would restart soon, although it was not clear precisely
when, Israel radio said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk, presenting his diplomatic
credentials to the Foreign Ministry on Sunday, expressed confidence the talks
would get off the ground again.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The groundwork has been laid and (with) the commitment of all parties and
of course the involvement of President Clinton and Secretary (Madeleine)
Albright, I think we will find a way to get it done,'' Indyk told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Two Barak aides, Uri Saguy and Moshe Kochanovsky, are leaving for Washington
on Tuesday for talks with the Clinton administration, Barak's office said. Saguy
is coordinator for the negotiations with Syria, and Kochanovsky is the chief
Israeli representative on the Israeli-Syrian committee on the issue of borders.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Egyptian president's trip, Mubarak met with Syrian President Hafez
Assad to familiarize himself with developments on the Syrian-Israeli peace
talks. Mubarak met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat last week in Cairo and
also toured Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates last
month.
</P>
<P>
	   Egypt has tried to carve itself a role as a regional peacemaker, and Arab
diplomats say Mubarak is seeking to convene an Arab summit. Such an event must
be ``well prepared for,'' said Hani Riyad, Mubarak's envoy to Jordan. He
declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   A similar proposal for a summit six months ago failed when Syria said it had
no common ground with the Egyptians, Jordanians, Lebanese and Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Report: Jihad Leader Overthrown  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- A close confidant of Osama bin Laden and a leader of the
Muslim militant group Jihad has been overthrown by his followers, the
London-based Al-Hayat newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of Jihad, which is responsible for the 1981 assassination of
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, forced Ayman al-Zawahri to give up his
leadership post, Al-Hayat said. He was head of the group in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper report, which was credited to sources close to Jihad, could
not be independently confirmed. Jihad members in Saudi Arabia denied the report
in a telephone call to The Associated Press, saying that without al-Zawahri the
group could crumble. They asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
	   Al-Zawahri is considered Egypt's most wanted militant. An Egyptian court
sentenced him to death in absentia in 1999 for charges including subversion and
membership in an outlawed group. He is believed to be living in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Al-Zawahri is believed to be a close confidant of Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi
millionaire blamed for the 1998 U.S. embassy attacks in Kenya and Tanzania that
killed more than 250 people.
</P>
<P>
	   In its report, Al-Hayat said Jihad members were angered over the 1998
alliance between al-Zawahri and bin Laden in a coalition of extremist groups
called the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders.
</P>
<P>
	   The alliance, whose founding principle is to attack Americans and their
interests, ``plunged Jihad members into battles with the United States that are
unnecessary at this time,'' the newspaper quoted the sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   In the wake of the embassy attacks, countries including Azerbaijan, Albania
and the United Arab Emirates arrested Muslim militants and extradited them to
Egypt for trial. Several militants have since been sentenced to death, some in
absentia.

<HEADLINE> Mannesmann May Buy Brit Telecom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- If Mannesmann AG, the German telecommunications company, is
able to fend off a hostile bid by Vodafone AirTouch PLC, it plans to buy the
British telecommunications group Energis, The Sunday Times reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper said the deal would be worth 12 billion British pounds, or $19.7
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The Times said Mannesmann was believed to have expressed its interest to
Energis management and its major shareholder, National Grid Company.
</P>
<P>
	   But an Energis spokesman denied the company had been approached, saying
"This is news to us."
</P>
<P>
	   In Germany, Mannesmann spokesman Manfred Soehnlein said he had no comment on
the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a deal would add the Energis fixed-line British service to Mannesmann's
recently acquired Orange mobile phone operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Energis' Planet OnLine Internet division is thought to be attractive to
Mannesmann chairman Klaus Esser, and the takeover would fit with his stated aim
of creating an integrated fixed and mobile European telecommunications network.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone chief executive Chris Gent sees the strength of a merged
Vodafone-Mannesmann in mobile-only communications.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann, meanwhile, has spurned Vodafone's suggested offer of 49 percent
control in a combined company. Mannesmann has rejected the British company's
offer as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been growing speculation that Mannesmann was close to a deal with
French conglomerate Vivendi that could help it fend off Vodafone's bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Vivendi, the world's largest water company, would not comment on the talks,
but analysts believed the two sides could be negotiating for Vivendi to sell
Mannesmann part of its 44 percent stake in Cegetel, France's No. 2 mobile phone
operator.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Baldness, Heart Problem  </HEADLINE>
    By KATE N. GROSSMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Men who are losing the hair on the crowns of their heads
have up to a 36 percent greater risk of experiencing heart problems, including
heart attacks and bypass surgery, a study found.
</P>
<P>
	   Men with a receding hairline are not at increased risk, but those going bald
at the crown should pay special attention to their blood pressure and
cholesterol levels and lead a healthy lifestyle, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's similar to having a family history for a disease. You can't alter your
family history or your baldness, but there are many ways to modify your risk
factors," said Dr. JoAnn Manson, one of the study's authors and chief of
preventative medicine at Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   Manson's study, published in Monday's edition of the Archives of Internal
Medicine, found that the greater the hair loss on the top of a man's head, the
greater the risk.
</P>
<P>
	   Balding men with high cholesterol levels had almost three times the risk for
heart disease when compared with men with a full head of hair who also had high
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
	   Past studies have confirmed a link between hair loss and heart problems, but
this study is among the largest. It also is one of the first to include detailed
information about different patterns of baldness and to identify the risk
pattern in men of all ages.
</P>
<P>
	   The study, co-authored by several doctors in Boston, analyzed baldness
patterns of 22,000 male doctors who were 40 to 84 years old when enrolled in the
Physician's Health Study. Eleven years into the study, the researchers asked the
doctors to describe their patterns of baldness at age 45.
</P>
<P>
	   Out of the total pool sampled, about 1,500 men reported a coronary event.
Balding men accounted for 62 percent of that total.
</P>
<P>
	   The authors suggest one possible biological explanation for the increased
risk: The bald men had elevated levels of testosterone and a hormone it converts
into, dihydrotestosterone. Previous studies have suggested elevated testosterone
levels may contribute to increased risk for hypertension and abnormal
cholesterol levels. Manson said it is a hypothesis that merits further study.
</P>
<P>
	   But Dr. Philip Greenland, a cardiologist at Northwestern University, does
not support more studies focusing on baldness as a marker for heart disease.
</P>
<P>
	   "Papers like this actually divert attention from the primary message,"
Greenland said. "About 80 to 90 percent of what we need to prevent heart disease
is already known. The problem is that addressing those behaviors is something a
lot of Americans don't want to do, so they are looking for other excuses."
</P>
<P>
	   Established risk factors for heart disease include hypertension, high blood
pressure and cholesterol, and a sedentary lifestyle.

<HEADLINE> UAW, Delphi Reach Tentative Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAGINAW, Mich. (AP) -- Hourly workers at a Delphi Automotive Systems brake
plant are to vote Tuesday on whether to ratify a proposed four-year contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Bargainers for the former General Motors Corp. parts-making division and
United Auto Workers Local 467 reached agreement on the tentative deal Thursday
night, four months after the old, three-year contract expired.
</P>
<P>
	   The contract covers work at the Delphi Energy &AMP; Chassis Systems' Saginaw
Operations. The plant makes anti-lock brakes.
</P>
<P>
	   The union had filed grievances over outsourcing of skilled work and
expressed concern about Delphi sending production work out of the plant. Under
the deal, Delphi would pay $1,000 to each of Local 467's approximately 1,525
members if it violates provisions against outsourcing, union bargaining chairman
Bob Lauria said.
</P>
<P>
	   The tentative contract also calls for adding 100 production workers and 40
to 50 skilled workers over the next four years, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lauria said the UAW made no concessions, but Delphi will benefit from
improved working conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   "By making the relationship better, I think everybody wins," he told The
Saginaw News.
</P>
<P>
	   Delphi spokesman James M. Hagedon confirmed that a tentative agreement had
been reached, but declined further comment.

<HEADLINE> France To Check for Mad Cow Disease  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- The French government plans to begin screening the country's
cattle herds for mad cow disease in February, Health Secretary Dominique Gillot
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That will give us an indication of how widespread the epidemic has become
among our herds,'' Gillot said in an interview with France Inter radio.
</P>
<P>
	   Gillot said the tests would involve taking brain and bone samples of the
cows destined for human consumption, and that ``tens of thousands'' of cattle
would be tested.
</P>
<P>
	   She said France had called on its European Union partners, especially
Britain, to adopt similar practices.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, there were 28 cases of mad cow disease in France. In January, the
first case of the year was detected in the northwestern Finistere region.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities say they expect new cases in France until 2001, five years after
stringent prevention measures were taken to prevent outbreaks. The disease has
an average incubation period of five years.
</P>
<P>
	   France has provoked a diplomatic spat by keeping in place a ban on beef from
Britain, where mad cow disease -- or bovine spongiform encephalopathy --
originated in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   In August, the European Union declared that beef from Britain was again safe
for import, but France angered its cross-channel neighbor by continuing its ban.
</P>
<P>
	   The executive arm of the European Union has started a legal case against
France at the European Court of Justice.

<HEADLINE> Think Backwards To Interpret Caucus  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- To decode the outcome of Iowa's opening chapter in
the 2000 presidential campaign, think backwards.
</P>
<P>
	   The winners have been anointed, their rivals have effectively conceded,
saying they ought to be credited with some success, even in defeats by landslide
margins.
</P>
<P>
	   And Monday night, voters fill in the numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   It's not quite that simple, of course.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters don't always follow the script. But the reverse sequence -- presumed
results, then the vote -- is part of the gamesmanship of the Iowa campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa's precinct caucuses, the first contest of 2000, the challengers,
politicians, pollsters and news media pronounce judgments based on margins of
victory and defeat, saying what they think should be counted as a boost or a
blow to the candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Since there is no objective standard by which to measure that, it is a
matter of debate, before and after the votes are counted.
</P>
<P>
	   Nobody -- including the candidates opposing the front-runners -- suggests
that Texas Gov. George W. Bush will finish anyplace but a comfortable first
among Republicans, or that Vice President Al Gore will not beat Bill Bradley in
the Democratic caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   So, short of an unforeseen upheaval among Iowans, the leading men will lead,
and the competition will turn into a numbers game about expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   For a challenger to even hint at hope of an upset would be to raise
expectations, and all the campaigners, top to bottom, are trying to talk them
down, not up.
</P>
<P>
	   All, that is, but Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, for whom they can't get any
lower. ``I'm going to have to do better than sixth here, it seems to me,'' the
Republican said. Hatch said if he does run last, he'll have to look at his
situation and decide whether to go on.
</P>
<P>
	   That, at least, is a clear test. Nothing else is.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley and Republican Steve Forbes, Bush's most aggressive and, in the
polls, closest challenger, each talk of springing a surprise on the leader,
defining that as losing no more badly than the polls forecast.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said he's going to make ``a good showing, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
	   But whatever the count against Gore, he said, ``I'm not quitting, we're
going forward. We have another day.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said he is an insurgent, and judged as one, he's doing very well. He
said the best an insurgent Democrat ever did in Iowa was the 31 percent Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy got against President Jimmy Carter in 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said Bradley has ``bet everything on this and New Hampshire,'' which
holds the first presidential primary on Feb. 1, and where the polls are too
close to call either man a clear leader, although Gore now has the edge Bradley
held in earlier surveys.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has campaigned in Iowa more intensively than Gore, and has spent an
estimated $1.3 million on television ads. He did cut Gore's initial lead in the
polls, but still lags by 20-plus percentage points. The final Des Moines Sunday
Register survey showed him with 28 percent support -- short of his benchmark of
31 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's Republican lead has been averaging 20 and more points over Forbes,
with the other four GOP candidates trailing them. Sen. John McCain of Arizona is
closely contesting Bush in New Hampshire, but skipped the Iowa campaign, to save
money and spare himself the kind of problems Bradley is having.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush says that with a six-name ballot, he ought to be credited with a clear
victory should he gain at least 37 percent of the vote, the GOP record, set by
Sen. Bob Dole in 1988 -- when Bush's father limped in third. The elder Bush
recovered to win the presidency that year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Forbes campaign wants the Texas governor measured against his standing
in the polls, calculating that at 46 percent. Ken Blackwell, Forbes' national
campaign chairman, says anything short of 44 percent would be a blow to Bush,
and anything ``north of 22 percent'' a boost for Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   After all, managers want the bar set as low as possible, the better for
their candidates to clear it.
</P>
<P>
	   But Forbes is heavily invested in Iowa, too, boasting of 12,000 campaign bus
miles, advertising aggressively, and declining to disclose how much of his
fortune he is spending on the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My goal is to emerge as the true conservative candidate,'' Forbes said. To
claim that standing, Forbes will need to put some room between his share of the
vote and that of his rivals on the right, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   Then the campaigns, and the maneuvering, will be transported to New
Hampshire.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Grandmothers Pray in NYC  </HEADLINE>
   By BETH J. HARPAZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez blew kisses and wiped
away tears as they stood before 2,000 people praying in a Manhattan church
Sunday for the 6-year-old boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The two women, Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela Quintana, did not speak as
worshippers at the interdenominational Riverside Church gave them a standing
ovation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Raquel and Mariela are grateful for your love,'' said the Rev. Bob Edgar,
a former Democratic congressman and head of the National Council of Churches of
Christ in the U.S.A., which sponsored the grandmothers' trip from Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   Randy Naylor, a spokesman for the church group, said the two women would
leave New York on Monday. The two women arrived in New York on Friday and met
Saturday with U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview published in Sunday's New York Times, Mrs. Quintana, the
paternal grandmother, said: ``We're not politicians. What we want is the
well-being of the child.''
</P>
<P>
	   Referring to the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, and other relatives
whom the boy is staying with in Miami, she added: ``I don't know why they want
the child to stay here after the trauma he's been through. They are not close
relatives.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was rescued from an inner tube on Thanksgiving Day after the boat in
which he had left Cuba capsized. His mother, her boyfriend and nine others
perished.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered the boy returned
to Cuba. His great-uncle has filed suit to stop the INS. And lawmakers in
Congress plan an attempt this week to declare Elian a U.S. citizen. If such
legislation becomes law, the boy no longer would be an immigrant under INS
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush, speaking on ABC's ``This
Week,'' said granting Elian citizenship ``would be a wonderful gesture.''
</P>
<P>
	   He added that the boy's father should come to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A couple of weeks I would think would be reasonable so that the man could
get a taste of freedom, so the man could understand the same emotions and the
same sentiment that evidently the boy's mother felt,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Ms. Rodriguez, Elian's maternal grandmother, scoffed at those who say
Elian's mother would have wanted him to stay here.
</P>
<P>
	   ``None of them knew her,'' Ms. Rodriguez told the Times. ``How can they know
what she thought?''
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers told the Times that the boy was extremely close to them and
to his father, and that he spent part of each week with his dad, who had
divorced Elian's mother and remarried.
</P>
<P>
	   So far the grandmothers have announced no plans to go to Miami. But the
Cuban American National Foundation, a group opposed to the Cuban Communist
regime of Fidel Castro, offered to fly them there.
</P>
<P>
	   Jorge Mas Santos, the Miami-based group's chairman, said the grandmothers
are being manipulated by Castro and his supporters and would have come to Miami
to see Elian if not for ``the fact that their loved ones remain as virtual
hostages back in Cuba.''

<HEADLINE> Test May Return Light Planes to Air  </HEADLINE>
   By ROHAN SULLIVAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A fuel contamination scare that has crippled
Australia's light aircraft industry may end soon, thanks to a new test to tell
if a plane is safe to fly, aviation officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 5,000 small aircraft in Australia's eastern states have been grounded
for 13 days over concern that batches of airplane fuel made by Mobil Oil
Australia Ltd. could clog engines.
</P>
<P>
	   In response, Mobil has developed a test to determine if a plane's fuel
system has been contaminated, said Mick Toller of the Civil Aviation Safety
Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Until now, operators had no way of knowing if their plane's engine had been
damaged.
</P>
<P>
	   Mobil has begun distributing the test to small aircraft operators across
southeastern Australia, and some planes could be flying as soon as Monday,
Toller said.
</P>
<P>
	   If the test detects contaminated fuel, the fuel system will have be cleaned,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Jan. 10, CASA grounded all aircraft running on fuel made at Mobil's
Melbourne plant between Nov. 21 and Dec. 23, throwing an industry worth $330
million a year into crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Small regional airlines, charter services and flight schools were affected.
Crops were left undusted, and some medical and wildfire fighting services scaled
back.
</P>
<P>
	   Turboprop planes, such as jet airliners, are not affected.
</P>
<P>
	   Mobil Oil Australia, a subsidiary of U.S.-based Mobil Exxon Corp., says the
contamination was a result of a mistake in the production process, but it has
not admitted liability for losses. It has offered operators a $10 million
assistance package.
</P>
<P>
	   The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association has launched a class action suit
on behalf of operators against Mobil, seeking an unspecified amount of damages
for financial losses since the planes have been grounded.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Scandal Reaches France  </HEADLINE>
   By BURT HERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- The web of secret money transfers trapping Germany's
conservatives in a financing scandal widened Sunday with allegations that the
French government of Francois Mitterrand funneled millions of dollars to support
former Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 1994 re-election.
</P>
<P>
	   The scandal -- which has involved money trading hands in suitcases, arms
deals stretching from Canada to Saudi Arabia, and the suicide of a party
accountant -- took a further bizarre twist Sunday after a fake statement was
faxed to news media saying Kohl was ready to name anonymous donors to the
Christian Democratic party.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that the fax was a
forgery and reiterated that he would not identify the donors from whom he has
admitted soliciting $1 million that was kept off party books.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't have the intention to make such a statement,'' Kohl was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
	   His refusal to name names has become the key issue in the scandal.
Parliament has launched an inquiry to examine whether bribes or kickbacks
influenced government decisions under Kohl, who was chancellor from 1982-98, and
he also is the subject of a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl stepped down as honorary chairman of the Christian Democratic party
last week under pressure from party leaders who demanded he identify the donors.
Some party officials have even hinted of possible legal action against Kohl to
compel him to reveal the donors.
</P>
<P>
	   Angela Merkel, party secretary-general, was meeting with senior party
leaders Sunday evening to review an audit of the party's finances. She told
reporters that accountants were unable to clarify where $5.7 million in party
money had come from, although $1 million were believed to be from Kohl's
anonymous donors.
</P>
<P>
	   The audit was to be made public Monday, but Merkel said it revealed nothing
new about the part of the scandal disclosed over the weekend involving
Mitterand, who died in 1996, and the French oil company Elf-Aquitaine.
</P>
<P>
	   ARD television reported Saturday that Mitterrand arranged payment of $15.7
million to the Christian Democrats and that the money was transferred as part of
alleged bribes totaling $44 million paid by Elf-Aquitaine for its 1992 purchase
of the former East German Leuna refinery.
</P>
<P>
	   The alleged bribes have long been the subject of investigation by Swiss and
French prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials in the German chancellor's office also have been searching for
missing government files on the privatization deal sought by parliament as part
of its inquiry into the scandal. This week, the government said it would appoint
a special investigator to track down what happened to the files.
</P>
<P>
	   ARD said there was no evidence Kohl was aware of the $15.7 million transfer,
and Roik called the allegation a character assassination of the former
chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   In a joint report with French Television 2, ARD cited sources close to
Mitterrand as saying the money was not bribes but was intended to serve ``state
interests for Europe.''
</P>
<P>
	   The report said the French and German secret services met regularly with
middlemen in a Geneva hotel to make the payments.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile Sunday, the leader of Germany's Jewish community said he had
received an apology from Christian Democrat leaders for a false comment by
Prince Casimir Sayn-Wittgenstein, a former state party treasurer in Hesse, that
some of the money in the scandal came from Jewish estates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It came late, but not too late,'' Paul Spiegel, president of the Central
Council of Jews in Germany, told Hessischen Rundfunk radio.

<HEADLINE> Source: Time Warner, EMI To Merge  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner, which only two weeks ago announced a stunning
$145 billion merger with America Online, plans to shake up the music industry
through a $20 billion merger with EMI Records, home of the Beatles and the
Rolling Stones, a source familiar with the deal said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The two companies will formally announce the deal in London on Monday, the
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   London-based EMI confirmed Sunday that it is in the final stages of
negotiations and said an announcement is forthcoming. Time Warner in New York
also acknowledged the talks, but spokesman Edward Adler said, "No deal has been
signed."
</P>
<P>
	   The deal, if it is approved by regulators and shareholders, would unite Time
Warner's music division with EMI's music division. It would likely be a boost
for music sales over the Internet. Both Warner and EMI have been testing ways to
let customers digitally download music via their computers. The new company
would have a very captive audience with America Online's 20 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
	   The merged company, to be called Warner EMI Music, would be the
second-largest music company with more than $8 billion in annual sales. Only
Seagram's Universal Music would be bigger.
</P>
<P>
	   EMI brings to the deal the Virgin, Priority and Capitol record labels --
including names like the Spice Girls, Van Morrison and Frank Sinatra. Time
Warner contributes its Atlantic, Elektra and Warner Brothers labels that include
Cher, Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, Madonna, Metallica and REM.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the source, the negotiations between Warner and EMI started
before powerbrokers discussed Time Warner's deal with America Online. Roger
Ames, chairman of Warner Music Group, approached his longtime friend Ken Berry,
head of EMI's music division, in the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   The two structured a deal in which Warner will pay EMI shareholders about $1
billion, or about $1.65 a share, in exchange for 50 percent ownership in the
combined company, the source said. Warner also will have six seats on the new
board of directors, and EMI will have five.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger is expected to close in about a year.
</P>
<P>
	   This "represents an opportunity to establish the world's premier music group
and to create very considerable value for shareholders of both companies," EMI
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Ames will be the chief executive officer and Berry will be chief operating
officer. Time Warner President Richard Parsons and EMI Group's Chairman Eric
Nicoli, will be co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement could draw fire from critics who worry that lack of
competition will diminish diversity and put too much control in the hands of the
four industry titans: Universal Music, EMI-Warner, Sony and Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the merger comes at a crucial time for Warner and EMI.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner Music's earnings fell from $288 million in the first nine months of
1998 to $279 million for the same period in 1999. EMI has been recovering from
difficulties of its own, but in the six months ending in September last year,
profits were up by 61 percent to $108 million compared to the same period the
year before.
</P>
<P>
	   By linking their operations, Warner EMI will shave $400 million in costs
over three years, the source said.

<HEADLINE> 7 Die in Dominican Republic Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Aviation officials on Sunday were
investigating the crash of a small airplane that killed six tourists and their
pilot in the northeastern Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cessna 207 crashed Saturday near the Portillo Beach Resort in the
Caribbean country's Samana region, said Eugenio de Marchena, operations director
of the Samana airport.
</P>
<P>
	   On board were two German and four French tourists. The pilot was Dominican.

<HEADLINE> Seton Hall's public relations concerned over school's image after  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Seton Hall officials wasted no time trying to repair
the school's image after a dormitory fire last week killed three students and
injured dozens more.
<P>
	   The school's public relations team held strategy meetings to plan how to
rebuild the Catholic university's reputation within hours of the deadly fire,
according to a published report.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one public relations firm was contacted within 24 hours of the fire
to prepare a plan to deflect charges that the university had been negligent in
taking insufficient fire safety measures, the Star-Ledger of Newark reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators were still interviewing students and others as they attempted
to determine the cause of the blaze at Boland Hall, a six-story dormitory that
housed 640 freshmen. Fire broke out on the building's third floor around 4:30
a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Essex County Prosecutor Donald Campolo has said that investigators have not
ruled out arson, careless smoking or electrical problems as possible causes.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have no comment on the investigation," Charlotte Smith, a spokeswoman for
Campolo, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Killed in the fire were 18-year-old freshmen Frank S. Caltabilota of West
Long Branch, John N. Giunta of Vineland and Aaron C. Karol of Green Brook.
</P>
<P>
	   A wake for Karol was held Saturday evening at a Watchung funeral home.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our great faith in God has been carrying us through," said Aaron's father,
Joe Karol.
</P>
<P>
	   The three students killed will be buried on Monday. A public memorial
service will be held at the school on Tuesday at 10 a.m. in Walsh Gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
	   Five students remained hospitalized Sunday, including four in critical
condition with serious burns.
</P>
<P>
	   Dana Christmas, a 21-year-old resident adviser from Paterson, remained in
critical condition Sunday at University Hospital in Newark, according to a
hospital spokeswoman. Christmas suffered burns on more than half her body in the
fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Nick Donato, 19, and Thomas Pugilese, Alvaro Llanos and Ken Simons, all 18,
were being treated at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston. Donato was
reported in guarded condition and the others in critical condition Saturday, and
a nursing supervisor on Sunday would only say that conditions of the four had
not changed.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the quick effort at spin control, Seton Hall officials publicly
insist that it's too soon to worry about the school's image when students remain
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's too early for us to be thinking about that," university spokeswoman
Lisa E. Grider told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   In a news release, Seton Hall officials said they hired Lipman Hearne Inc.,
a marketing communications firm, one day after the fire to poll facilities
managers across the country about how many colleges and universities had
sprinkler systems in their dormitories. The poll, which surveyed 37 facilities
administrators at random from colleges in seven states, showed 45 percent of
campus dormitories were not equipped with sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
	   Boland Hall and a second of the six dormitories at Seton Hall lack
sprinklers. Grider has said the university is considering installing sprinklers
in Boland Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   The fatal fire prompted Gov. Christie Whitman to say she would consider
legislation requiring sprinklers in all New Jersey college dormitories.
</P>
<P>
	   Students will be able to return to Boland Hall on Monday between 2 p.m. and
8 p.m. Temporary housing for students who live on the third, fourth and fifth
floors is being arranged, said school officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes were scheduled to resume Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, friends and relatives of those who remain hospitalized gathered
over the weekend in the hallways of Saint Barnabas Medical Center to give
support to one another.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're all the same family now," Nicole Simons, 27, told the newspaper
Saturday. Her brother, Ken Simons, is being treated at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   "Whenever they see me crying, they come hug me, and whenever I see them
crying, I go over and hug them," said Angela Gutierrez, 18, the girlfriend of
Alvaro Llanos, who also remains at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   Relatives say doctors have told them that infections and pneumonia posed a
more immediate threat than the burns.
</P>
<P>
	   Ben Chibnik, 19, of Red Bank was released from Saint Barnabas Medical Center
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was just like one of our own children going home," said Nicole Simons.

<HEADLINE> Reagan Daughter: Dad 'Not So Good'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former President Reagan's daughter Maureen says her father
cannot speak coherently and, because his motor skills are failing, no longer can
join her in working simple jigsaw puzzles.
</P>
<P>
	   Maureen Reagan said friends sometimes ask the condition of her father, who
has Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My response is, `Not so good.' But it is hard to say that, because he
makes it so easy for us,'' she wrote in an essay in Newsweek magazine. ``In
other words, it's still him. But his motor skills are going.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Reagan she and her father began doing the puzzles -- first 300-piece
projects, then 100 pieces -- shortly after the diagnosis more than five years
ago that he had incurable brain disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The puzzles mainly were of animal scenes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unfortunately, he can't do that anymore,'' Ms. Reagan wrote. ``It was
great fun, and he had a tremendous sense of accomplishment'' in completing them.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the same with an art book. He looked at it, enjoyed the pictures and
read the words out loud.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He could recognize the words even after aphasia had robbed him of his
ability to put his thoughts into words,'' she wrote. Aphasia is the loss of the
ability to use or understand words.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Reagan recounted an incident she described as her ``click of awareness''
about her father's illness. It came six months before he complained to his
doctor of feeling disoriented in unfamiliar surroundings and a year before he
was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
	   It was late 1993, and Ms. Reagan was talking with the former president about
a movie he made in the 1950s, ``Prisoner of War.'' They had talked about it
often.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Finally he looked at me and said, `Mermie, I have no recollection of
making that movie.' That was my `click of awareness,''' which she said relatives
of every Alzheimer's patient experiences at that first realization.
</P>
<P>
	   She wrote that Nancy Reagan, the president's second wife and Maureen
Reagan's stepmother, gives her father ``wonderful care.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Mrs. Reagan said in a television interview that Reagan no longer
is capable of having a conversation that makes sense.
</P>
<P>
	   She said friends were no longer invited to the Reagans' California home
because he does not recognize them. He also no longer swims or takes walks, she
said.

<HEADLINE> Think backwards to interpret Iowa caucus results  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) - To decode the outcome of Iowa's opening chapter
in the 2000 presidential campaign, think backwards.
<P>
	   The winners have been anointed, and their rivals have effectively conceded,
saying they ought to be credited with some success, even in defeats by landslide
margins.
</P>
<P>
	   And Monday night, voters fill in the numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   It's not quite that simple, of course.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters don't always follow the script. But the reverse sequence - presumed
results, then the vote - is part of the gamesmanship of the Iowa campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa's precinct caucuses, the first contest of 2000, the challengers,
politicians, pollsters and news media pronounce judgments based on margins of
victory and defeat, saying what they think should be counted as a boost or a
blow to the candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Since there is no objective standard by which to measure that, it is a
matter of debate, before and after the votes are counted.
</P>
<P>
	   Nobody - including the candidates opposing the front-runners - suggests that
Texas Gov. George W. Bush will finish any place but a comfortable first among
Republicans, or that Vice President Al Gore will not beat Bill Bradley in the
Democratic caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   So, short of an unforeseen upheaval among Iowans, the leading men will lead,
and the competition will turn into a numbers game about expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   For a challenger to even hint at hope of an upset would be to raise
expectations, and all the campaigners, top to bottom, are trying to talk them
down, not up.
</P>
<P>
	   All, that is, but Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, for whom they can't get any
lower. "I'm going to have to do better than sixth here, it seems to me," the
Republican said. Hatch said if he does run last, he'll have to look at his
situation and decide whether to go on.
</P>
<P>
	   That, at least, is a clear test. Nothing else is.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley and Republican Steve Forbes, Bush's most aggressive and, in the
polls, closest challenger, each talk of springing a surprise on the leader,
defining that as losing no more badly than the polls forecast.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said he's going to make "a good showing, maybe."
</P>
<P>
	   But whatever the count against Gore, he said, "I'm not quitting, we're going
forward. We have another day."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said he is an insurgent, and judged as one, he's doing very well. He
said the best an insurgent Democrat ever did in Iowa was the 31 percent Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy got against President Jimmy Carter in 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said Bradley has "bet everything on this and New Hampshire," which
holds the first presidential primary on Feb. 1, and where the polls are too
close to call either man a clear leader, although Gore now has the edge Bradley
held in earlier surveys.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has campaigned in Iowa more intensively than Gore, and has spent an
estimated $1.3 million on television ads. He did cut Gore's initial lead in the
polls, but still lags by 20-plus percentage points. The final Des Moines Sunday
Register survey showed him with 28 percent support - short of his benchmark of
31 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's Republican lead has been averaging 20 and more points over Forbes,
with the other four GOP candidates trailing them. Sen. John McCain of Arizona is
closely contesting Bush in New Hampshire, but skipped the Iowa campaign, to save
money and spare himself the kind of problems Bradley is having.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush says that with a six-name ballot, he ought to be credited with a clear
victory should he gain at least 37 percent of the vote, the GOP record, set by
Sen. Bob Dole in 1988 - when Bush's father limped in third. The elder Bush
recovered to win the presidency that year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Forbes campaign wants the Texas governor measured against his standing
in the polls, calculating that at 46 percent. Ken Blackwell, Forbes' national
campaign chairman, says anything short of 44 percent would be a blow to Bush,
and anything "north of 22 percent" a boost for Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   After all, managers want the bar set as low as possible, the better for
their candidates to clear it.
</P>
<P>
	   But Forbes is heavily invested in Iowa, too, boasting of 12,000 campaign bus
miles, advertising aggressively, and declining to disclose how much of his
fortune he is spending on the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   "My goal is to emerge as the true conservative candidate," Forbes said. To
claim that standing, Forbes will need to put some room between his share of the
vote and that of his rivals on the right, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   Then the campaigns, and the maneuvering, will be transported to New
Hampshire.

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Two oxygen tanks exploded during an electrical fire at a
construction site in north-central Moscow on Sunday night, and two people were
hospitalized, emergency officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire at the construction site for an Armenian church was caused by
faulty electrical wiring, the head of the fire brigade leading the cleanup said.

	   Several windows in a building 100 yards from the site were blown out by the
blast. Two people who live in the building were hospitalized with injuries from
shards of metal or glass, said the brigade chief, who did not want to be

</P>
<P>
	   Residents of Moscow and other Russian cities are still on edge after a
string of apartment building bombings last September that killed about 300

<HEADLINE> Report: Mannesmann May Buy Energis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- If Mannesmann AG, the German telecommunications company, is
able to fend off a hostile bid by Vodafone AirTouch PLC, it plans to buy the
British telecommunications group Energis in a $19.7 billion deal, The Sunday
Times reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The Times said Mannesmann was believed to have expressed its interest to
Energis management and its major shareholder, National Grid Company.
</P>
<P>
	   But an Energis spokesman denied the company had been approached, saying
"This is news to us."
</P>
<P>
	   In Germany, Mannesmann spokesman Manfred Soehnlein said he had no comment on
the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a deal would add the Energis landline British service to Mannesmann's
recently acquired Orange mobile phone operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Energis' Planet OnLine Internet division is thought to be attractive to
Mannesmann chairman Klaus Esser, and the takeover would fit with his stated aim
of creating an integrated land and mobile European telecommunications network.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone chief executive Chris Gent sees the strength of a merged
Vodafone-Mannesmann in mobile-only communications.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann, meanwhile, has spurned Vodafone's suggested offer of 49 percent
control in a combined company. Mannesmann has rejected the British company's
offer as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been growing speculation that Mannesmann was close to a deal with
French conglomerate Vivendi that could help it fend off Vodafone's bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Vivendi, the world's largest water company, would not comment on the talks,
but analysts believed the two sides could be negotiating for Vivendi to sell
Mannesmann part of its 44 percent stake in Cegetel, France's No. 2 mobile phone
operator.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Sunday, the Observer weekly in London said that Mannesmann was
discussing an alliance with America Online, the Internet service provider that
announced a merger with Time Warner just two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper quoted an unidentified source close to Mannesmann as saying
AOL is an interesting potential partner and that he wouldn't rule out building a
relationship in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
	   The most likely link would be an alliance between Mannesmann and AOL Europe,
which is jointly owned by AOL and Germany's Bertelsmann media company, the paper
said.

<HEADLINE> Storm Knocks Out Power to Thousands  </HEADLINE>
   By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Rain and freezing temperatures spread a coat of ice across
parts of Georgia on Sunday, knocking out electrical service to more than a
half-million customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those households and businesses could be without power until at
least Tuesday as crews struggle over slippery roads to reach downed lines and
ice-coated tree limbs continue to snap, pulling down more.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the worst storm since Hurricane Opal came through in 1996, and it
took six days to get power fully restored for that one,'' said Georgia Power
spokeswoman Becky Blaylock. ``If it keeps raining and it freezes again ... we
could be looking at more people without power. We're in for a long haul.''
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes declared a state of emergency Sunday for six
northern counties, and the Red Cross opened eight shelters around the state for
people who had no heat.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow and freezing rain also fell in other parts of the southern
Appalachians, and locally heavy rain fell across coastal areas of Georgia and
the Carolinas as the storm pushed eastward and out to sea. Up to 3 inches of
snow fell in some areas of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The rain had been forecast to end late Saturday in Georgia but was still
falling Sunday afternoon. Temperatures in the Atlanta area didn't warm above
freezing until the middle of the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Ice accumulated a half-inch thick on trees in parts of northern Georgia, and
the weight of the ice on power lines pulled down utility poles.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 340,000 home and business customers of Georgia Power lost service
statewide, 290,000 of them in the metropolitan Atlanta area, Ms. Blaylock said.
At least 175,000 customers of electric membership corporations also were blacked
out.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of utility repair crews were put to work in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's just the sheer volume and massive nature of the problem that makes us
go from one spot to the next to the next. We fix one, and another tree breaks,
and causes another outage,'' said Pat Kerley of the Jackson Electric Membership
Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   North Carolina's major utilities reported approximately 20,000 customers
without electricity Sunday after parts of that state got a mixture of sleet,
rain and snow. However, Carolina Power &AMP; Light spokeswoman Sally Ramey said not
all of the outages could be blamed on the weather.
</P>
<P>
	   Fallen branches and power lines closed about 20 roads in northern Georgia,
State Department of Transportation spokeswoman Vicki Gavalas said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If my neighborhood is any indication, they're snapping like matchsticks,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport remained open, but many flights
were delayed or canceled as crews tried to de-ice the planes.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Saturday, a U.S. Airways jet that had landed at North Carolina's
Charlotte-Douglas International Airport slid onto a grassy area as it turned
onto a taxiway. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   In central Tennessee, where 3.5 inches of snow fell Saturday, a de-icing
truck nicked the wing of a Northwest Airlines DC-9 at Nashville International
Airport. No one was injured, said Northwest spokeswoman Mary Beth Schubert.
</P>
<P>
	   Parts of South Carolina got up to 6 inches of snow late Saturday, and
traffic on parts of Interstate 85 came to a standstill in several spots because
of slippery pavement and accidents.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Releases Upbeat News  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- One day before the release of an independent report on
its finances, Amtrak on Sunday trumpeted strong quarterly revenues and announced
a start date for its long-anticipated enhanced service between Boston and New
York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak said its new Acela Regional service will begin Jan. 31 with a
celebration at Boston's South Station. The Boston-New York City trip, now about
five hours, will drop to just under four.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak reported that its revenue in the quarter ending Dec. 31, 1999 was 8
percent higher than in the same quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   It also boasted of significant growth in ridership on its Chicago-to-Los
Angeles ``Texas Eagle'' route and its Oakland-to-Sacramento ``Capitols'' route.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak officials announced the financial results the day before the first
annual report on its finances is to be released by the Amtrak Reform Council, an
independent oversight commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak supporters and critics expect the report to be skeptical about the
railway's chances of becoming financially self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has given Amtrak until the end of the 2003 fiscal year to wean
itself from government operating subsidies. It created the reform council to
keep close track of Amtrak's efforts toward that goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak has been at odds with the council over how to measure its progress,
and that disagreement will likely be reflected in the council's report.
</P>
<P>
	   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, applied a
standard corporate measurement -- overall revenue minus overall expenses -- to
come up with a $907 million operating loss in 1999 for Amtrak.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak officials say standard accounting rules do not apply in this case
because Congress does not require the railway to cover the cost of equipment
depreciation. Excluding depreciation, Amtrak concluded it was $484 million short
of self-sufficiency in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Reform council Chairman Gil Carmichael said Jan. 10 that the council's first
report ``is not intended to reach conclusions or make recommendations about
Amtrak's long-term future,'' but that it ``raises questions, concerns and issues
that the council believes should be addressed in its future efforts and,
ultimately, by Congress.''

<HEADLINE> Candidates round up votes in Iowa, look ahead to New Hampshire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - On the eve of Iowa's caucuses, Republican and
Democratic presidential candidates canvassed churches and national talk shows
Sunday, scouring this snow-crusted state for last-minute support even as they
began looking ahead to contests in New Hampshire and beyond.
<P>
	   "This is the first step in several steps of the journey," Bill Bradley, the
former New Jersey senator who trails Vice President Al Gore in Democratic polls,
said on CBS.
</P>
<P>
	   Entering the first election contest of Campaign 2000, Republican George W.
Bush and Gore held wide leads in polls of voters who planned to visit schools,
civic clubs, fire stations and other sites Monday to support one of eight major
contestants.
</P>
<P>
	   The underdog candidates, all resigned to losing, were shooting for
face-saving finishes and Iowa's true reward: Momentum for New Hampshire's Feb. 1
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a marathon, not a sprint," Republican Steve Forbes, the wealthy
Bedminster, N.J., publisher, said on NBC's "Meet the Press."
</P>
<P>
	   The footrace in Iowa, a test of political organization, favors the national
front-runners. A Des Moines Sunday Register poll of 1,200 likely caucus-goers
showed Gore leading Bradley among Democrats, 56 percent to 28 percent. Bush led
Forbes 43 percent to 20 percent in the Jan. 16-21 survey, which had an error
margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is in danger of finishing worse than expected in a contest that
traditionally punishes candidates who fail to meet expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   His latest poll rating was beneath the intentionally low threshold his
advisers set as a measure of accomplishment: The 31 percent showing by Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., in a second-place finish behind then-President Jimmy
Carter in the 1980 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   With the rest of the GOP field in single digits, Forbes has long said he is
the conservative alternative to Bush. The argument would carry greater weight
if, after pouring millions of dollars into Iowa since his failed 1996 bid,
Forbes fares better than the new poll suggests - 23 points behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The polls show that about one in 10 voters are undecided, giving the
candidates incentive to campaign hard Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only thing I know to do is to encourage our folks to get out and vote.
We need as big a vote as possible," Bush told reporters between campaign stops.
</P>
<P>
	   In a lengthy interview with ABC, Bush struggled with his explanation for
supporting a sales tax increase in Texas after making a no-tax pledge. The
second-term governor said he had qualified the promise by also pledging to
reform education funding in the state, an effort that presumably led to the tax
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Dismissing the issue, Bush said, "There's pledges all the time" and reviewed
a record as governor that included two major tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   He also continued to flesh out his views abortion, a critical issue to many
GOP caucus-goers. Asked about the topic for the fourth day, he predicted that
Texas would outlaw first-trimester abortions if the Supreme Court reversed
itself and let states impose strict anti-abortion laws - a position Bush says
the court should take.
</P>
<P>
	   Maintaining a caucus tradition, several campaigns had supporters papering
churches and their parking lots with leaflets. Religious conservatives represent
a third of likely caucus-goers and are more likely than most voters to attend
the sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Forbes is expected to get a lion's share of the conservative vote,
former ambassador Alan Keyes, Washington activist Gary Bauer and Sen. Orrin
Hatch of Utah are carving up the religious base. Keyes, Bauer and Hatch are
likely competing for third place; finishing lower could doom their candidacies.
</P>
<P>
	   Addressing a congregation on the city's industrial north side, Bauer said
Christians should vote more on principle than on "selfish" issues such as taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   "Do what you think God would have you do," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking to New Hampshire, Bush pressed his case against Sen. John McCain's
tax-cutting package. The Arizona senator, who did not campaign in Iowa, is in a
tight race with Bush in the New England state.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fundamental debate is do we leave money in Washington or do we give it
back to taxpayers?" Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain would cut fewer taxes than Bush, saving some projected government
surpluses to bolster Social Security, Medicare and pay down the national debt.
While Bush was in Iowa, McCain was campaigning Sunday in New Hampshire where he
picked up endorsements from two of the state's biggest newspapers.
</P>
<P>
	   Public polls suggest that Gore has opened a slight lead over Bradley in New
Hampshire, though the vice president's own polls still show the race in a
statistical dead heat. Bradley aides also consider the race tied. On the
Republican side, McCain is managing to maintain a lead in the high single digits
over the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa, Forbes courted social conservatives by questioning Bush's
commitment to abortion and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   "Candidates at this time of the year - the conservative establishment in the
Republican Party - always say 'Oh, we are conservative' and then after the
election, they forget about it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley urged supporters to vote. "We could surprise a few people," he said
at Cornell College.
</P>
<P>
	   In Davenport, Gore said his "honorable opponent" has focused on health care
reform while treating education "as kind of an afterthought."
</P>
<P>
	   As the candidates stumped, aides fine-tuned plans to get supporters to the
caucus sites. Last-minute mailings criticized opponents and offered incentives
to vote. A Bush flier included two "W" stickers for supporters to show unity at
caucus sites.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters sized up the field for the last time.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Steenhoek, 32, of Ankeny, said he was leaning toward Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's more of him being such an underdog and trying so hard and keeping at
it that makes me like him so much," he said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Beaches Threatened by Spill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Petrobras, the government-owned oil company,
will lay down additional floating barriers to prevent the massive oil spill
polluting Rio's Guanabara Bay from spreading to world-famous beaches like
Copacabana and Ipanema, the company's president said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Petrobras' president Henri Phillipe Reichstul said workers on Monday will
begin installing an additional 66,000 feet of barriers to be formed by buoys
ordered from the United States and England.
</P>
<P>
	   Barriers totaling 10,000 feet already are in place.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't believe the oil will leave the bay,'' Reichstul told Globo TV
network. ``But for the population's peace of mind, we decided to build
additional barriers.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, a pipeline at the Reduc refinery leaked and spewed 338,000
gallons of crude oil into the bay.
</P>
<P>
	   The oil slick spread through the Guapimirim and Jequia mangrove swamps,
which are protected areas and important spawning grounds for fish, birds and
crustaceans. Biologists with the Rio de Janeiro state Environmental Affairs
Department said it would take decades for nature to undo the damage.
</P>
<P>
	   Winds and tides carried the oil toward the mouth of the bay, and some feared
for the fate of famous beaches.
</P>
<P>
	   Reichstul said 109,000 gallons of oil already has been removed from the bay
and the stain should be cleared in the next three or four days.

<HEADLINE> AP Correspondent Harry Nash Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, Va. (AP) -- Harry C. Nash Jr., an Associated Press correspondent
who covered the devastation of U.S. merchant shipping off the Atlantic coast
during World War II, has died. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
	   Nash died Saturday at his home. No cause of death was given.
</P>
<P>
	   During the war, packs of German submarines lay in wait outside Virginia's
port of Hampton Roads for freighters and tankers to emerge into the Atlantic. As
the convoys entered the open sea, the subs attacked, with flashes of gunfire and
explosions often visible on land.
</P>
<P>
	   Nash recruited coastal residents to call him at such times, and then he
tracked down and interviewed survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We used to carry his coverage,'' said Robert H. Mason, former editor of
The Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk. ``He was thorough, accurate and concise in his
writing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Born in Portsmouth, Nash began working part time for The Virginian-Pilot
while he was attending Georgetown University. He later went to work for The
Associated Press, initially in Richmond and then in Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
	   When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Nash said his bosses knew that the
concentration of merchant and military ships and shipbuilding along the Virginia
coast would make the area critical to the war effort.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They gave me 24 hours to pack and get down to Norfolk,'' Nash told The
Virginian-Pilot in a 1986 interview.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As we had at least five correspondents covering Richmond, I naturally
asked how much help I was to get and who was leaving with me,'' Nash said. But
only Nash was sent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was no use standing around talking about it, so I grabbed my
typewriter and hurried home -- where the war was,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nash is survived by his wife, Helen Davis Nash; a daughter, Susan Nash
Wingate of Madison; and a son, Harry Nash III of Buena Vista; and by 13
grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
	   A funeral service will be conducted Monday at 2 p.m. at St. Paul's Catholic
Church in Portsmouth.

<HEADLINE> Still Not Much Hope in Ecuador  </HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BAJAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Political tempests like the bloodless, oddball coup
that overthrew President Jamil Mahuad only to see his vice president take over
neither faze Ecuadoreans nor give them much hope.
</P>
<P>
	   People are accustomed to tumultuous leadership changes that have done
nothing to halt Ecuador's precipitous economic slide. The nation is suffering
its worst depression since the 1930s, and more than half its 12 million people
live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   Thus, the naming of Vice President Gustavo Noboa as Ecuador's sixth
president in five years -- he was constitutionally next in line-- was greeted
Sunday with great skepticism.
</P>
<P>
	   Ecuador is the sick man of South America and only bold leadership and
well-conceived policy, as absent recently as mismanagement and corruption have
been prevalent, can reverse the country's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, there is little confidence Noboa can accomplish that.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nothing happened at all and the corrupt are still in charge. Now we're
even worse off,'' said Soyla Laiza, a 50-year-old street vendor at Ipiales
market just up the street from Quito's presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everyone, everyone is poor,'' said Laiza, who sells music CDs. Like many
Ecuadoreans, she isn't sure from day to day whether she'll earn enough to feed
her two children.
</P>
<P>
	   Few people made purchases at the market. Most simply strolled idly, ignoring
vendors like the wizened Indian woman sitting on a curb staring vacantly ahead,
colorful plastic-handled strainers in her hands.
</P>
<P>
	   Ecuadoreans have seen their purchasing power plummet by more than 300
percent in the past year.
</P>
<P>
	   The country has $13 billion in foreign debt -- and after defaulting on
interest payments last year, prospects for getting more loans are dim. When the
nation's currency, the sucre, lost 30 percent of its value in early January,
negotiations with the International Monetary fund on securing new credit
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
	   Noboa, an untainted 62-year-old former university president with little
political experience, said on his first full day in office Sunday that he would
attack corruption, a key source of Ecuador's ills.
</P>
<P>
	   But the seven ministers he named Sunday -- half the Cabinet -- were all from
the discredited traditional political class.
</P>
<P>
	   The social discontent that exploded Friday when disgruntled junior military
officers joined Indian protesters in seizing the Congress, Supreme Court and
presidential palace, still looms large.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The ruling class has destroyed the country,'' said Rigoberto Villareal, a
34-year-old taxi driver. ``We've got to kill the entire political class and
begin anew.''
</P>
<P>
	   Columnist Simon Espinosa of the newspaper Hoy saw ``some faint hope'' Noboa
might improve things. ``The problems are the same, but the new president's
advantage is that he's seen as honest,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Ecuador never recovered from devastating El Nino flooding and depressed
prices in 1998 of oil, its major export. Rather than impose economic austerity
to diminish a huge deficit, the government simply printed more money.
</P>
<P>
	   Corruption remains a way of life in Ecuador, where politics has
traditionally been a vehicle for personal enrichment.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad was widely condemned for bailing out 18 failed banks last year at a
cost of $1.2 billion after the bankers stole the funds and fled abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   In what many considered a last-ditch rescue attempt, Mahuad announced Jan. 9
that Ecuador would abandon the sucre and become the first South American nation
to embrace the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   Noboa vows to proceed with the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   But some fear the medicine could be more dangerous than the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The 5,000 Indians who marched on the capital last week demanding Mahaud's
ouster worried the plan would wipe out the sucre-based savings of many
Ecuadoreans.
</P>
<P>
	   The government already froze bank deposits in March and doesn't plan to free
them for at least five years.
</P>
<P>
	   The sucre has plunged from 7,000 to 25,000 per dollar over the past year and
inflation, which rose 60 percent last year, has soared 53 percent since
November, economist Walter Spurrier said.
</P>
<P>
	   Noboa's immediate challenge will be to restore people's purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
	   One insurgent military officer, interviewed at the presidential palace
during Friday's short-lived coup, said his salary in dollar terms dropped in one
year from as much as $1,000 a month to $160.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The country is in ruins,'' said the officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity for fear of retribution. ``We can't go on living like this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Noboa made no policy announcements Sunday, but his interior minister said
the estimated 150 officers who mounted the aborted coup would face military
justice.
</P>
<P>
	   That could well mean a slap on the wrist -- and the possibility they could
one day rise again.

<HEADLINE> Goat Throw Raises Tempers in Spain  </HEADLINE>
   By KERNAN TURNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANGANESES DE LA POLVOROSA, Spain (AP) -- In the annual tug-of-war between
townspeople and animal rights activists, the goat won.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time in years, this village 150 miles northwest of Madrid held
its festival of St. Vincent, the town's patron saint, Sunday without tossing a
live goat from the church bell tower.
</P>
<P>
	   The animal is traditionally dropped 50 feet and then safely caught in a
tarp. But the town council said the event would not take place this year and
threatened fines of $1,500 to $15,000 for anyone who helped throw the goat.
</P>
<P>
	   That didn't keep several hundred people from gathering below the bell tower
Sunday in the tiny square in front of the stone church. A band played and
several dozen people dressed in carnival-like masks and colorful costumes danced
and chanted.
</P>
<P>
	   As the afternoon wore on and darkness began to fall, people started
chanting, ``Toss the goat! Toss the goat!''
</P>
<P>
	   Cheers broke out when several young men arrived with the animal, but they
said they would toss it from the tower only if the crowd accompanied them. No
one volunteered.
</P>
<P>
	   The goat was led away, safe for the day.
</P>
<P>
	   A few toughs jostled some TV cameramen, blaming them for drawing attention
to the custom, but no one was hurt. The crowd drifted away, some to party in the
dark streets.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1992, protests persuaded the local governor to ban the toss. Villagers
used ropes to lower the goat, but a year later the ropes were abandoned and the
tradition was resumed.
</P>
<P>
	   The regional government fined the town about $150 last year after the
National Association of Animal Welfare and Protection filed a complaint.
</P>
<P>
	   The origins of the ritual are unclear. One legend says a priest's goat --
whose milk fed the poor -- accidentally fell from the bell tower and was saved
by villagers holding a blanket.
</P>
<P>
	   The goat thrown last year survived unhurt.

<HEADLINE> N.J. patient applauds his hand transplant one year later  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ABSECON, N.J. (AP) - The New Jersey man who became the first American to
receive a hand transplant will celebrate the one-year anniversary of the
operation on Tuesday.
<P>
	   Absecon resident Matthew Scott said the transplant was one of the greatest
things he has ever done for himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott, who lost his left hand in a firecracker accident 14 years ago, was
expected to lose the new hand within a year. But the 38-year-old paramedic can
now turn a doorknob and pick up his two sons at the same time. He recently has
been able to sense cold, heat and pain.
</P>
<P>
	   "I suppose taken individually they seem like nothing, but taken collectively
... they make me happier than I ever thought," Scott told The Philadelphia
Inquirer for Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors had said there was a 30 percent to 50 percent chance Scott's body
would reject the new hand and he would lose it within a year. That's still
possible, but Scott has already achieved many of the medical goals of the
operation - for example, the ability to carry bags of groceries and sense heat
and cold.
</P>
<P>
	   The hand replacement surgery helps Scott make amends to himself for the
firecracker accident.
</P>
<P>
	   "Whatever anger I was harboring toward myself for getting myself into the
situation just seems to have dissipated," Scott told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott said his wife has told him she also noticed a difference in his
attitude.
</P>
<P>
	   "She can look into my eyes and see the clouds that used to be there are not
there anymore," Scott said.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott isn't shy about showing off his new hand: Surgical cars circle his
forearm, and the knuckles on his left hand are puffier than the those on his
right. The skin color is more olive.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said he is more comfortable at work. Scott oversees clinical
training for paramedics in the Virtua Health system in South Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   "By all means, come and see and touch, because it is something wonderful,"
Scott told colleagues when he returned to work last June.
</P>
<P>
	   The operation was completed at Jewish Hospital in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
	   "We feel for the first attempt, it is remarkable, encouraging, and a clear
indication to keep pushing the frontiers forward," said Warren Briedenbach, who
headed the team that performed the operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Only about a half-dozen hand operations have been attempted around the
world. The most recent was last week, when a French housepainter received two
hands in surgery conducted by an international team in Lyons.
</P>
<P>
	   Many members of the medical community have criticized hand transplants
because the procedure weakens a healthy person who must take potent medications.
Among the risks are serious infections and cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott says he underwent the transplant knowing about the risks, among them
that there's no guarantee the hand will be fully functional or won't be rejected
by his body.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott said he has had three minor episodes of his body rejecting the hand
and that the medication he's been taking sometimes makes him feel lethargic. He
avoids people who are coughing to avoid germs that could threaten his weakened
immune system.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the trade-off, Scott said he has made progress with the hand. Sandra
Feranda, Scott's hand therapist, said recent tests indicated he was recovering
the use of muscles that may enable him to perform fine motor skills. Scott said
he wants to be able to write his name with the hand one day.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think (Scott's recovery) might have exceeded the expectations of the
results that many people had expected," said John Taras, clinical assistant
professor of hand surgery at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   Taras said people who practice hand surgery are waiting to see what will
happen with Scott's hand, as well as other upcoming cases.
</P>
<P>
	   "No matter where it goes from here, it has been one of the greatest things I
have ever done with myself," Scott said. "I am happy we did it, no matter what."

   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- The United States supports a Turkish proposal to begin
military contacts with rival Greece, a senior U.S. official was quoted as saying
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey made the proposal Thursday as a way to continue easing long-standing

<HEADLINE> Kohl Scandal Reaches France  </HEADLINE>
   By BURT HERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- The web of secret money transfers trapping Germany's
conservatives in a financing scandal widened Sunday with allegations that the
French government of Francois Mitterrand funneled millions of dollars to support
former Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 1994 re-election.
</P>
<P>
	   The scandal -- which has involved money trading hands in suitcases, arms
deals stretching from Canada to Saudi Arabia, and the suicide of a party
accountant -- took a further bizarre twist Sunday after a fake statement was
faxed to news media saying Kohl was ready to name anonymous donors to the
Christian Democratic party.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that the fax was a
forgery and reiterated that he would not identify the donors from whom he has
admitted soliciting $1 million that was kept off party books.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't have the intention to make such a statement,'' Kohl was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
	   His refusal to name names has become the key issue in the scandal.
Parliament has launched an inquiry to examine whether bribes or kickbacks
influenced government decisions under Kohl, who was chancellor from 1982-98, and
he also is the subject of a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl stepped down as honorary chairman of the Christian Democratic party
last week under pressure from party leaders who demanded he identify the donors.
Some party officials have even hinted of possible legal action against Kohl to
compel him to reveal the donors.
</P>
<P>
	   Angela Merkel, party secretary-general, was meeting with senior party
leaders Sunday evening to review an audit of the party's finances. She told
reporters that accountants were unable to clarify where $5.7 million in party
money had come from, although $1 million were believed to be from Kohl's
anonymous donors.
</P>
<P>
	   The audit was to be made public Monday, but Merkel said it revealed nothing
new about the part of the scandal disclosed over the weekend involving
Mitterand, who died in 1996, and the French oil company Elf-Aquitaine.
</P>
<P>
	   ARD television reported Saturday that Mitterrand arranged payment of $15.7
million to the Christian Democrats and that the money was transferred as part of
alleged bribes totaling $44 million paid by Elf-Aquitaine for its 1992 purchase
of the former East German Leuna refinery.
</P>
<P>
	   The alleged bribes have long been the subject of investigation by Swiss and
French prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials in the German chancellor's office also have been searching for
missing government files on the privatization deal sought by parliament as part
of its inquiry into the scandal. This week, the government said it would appoint
a special investigator to track down what happened to the files.
</P>
<P>
	   ARD said there was no evidence Kohl was aware of the $15.7 million transfer,
and Michael Roik, Kohl's spokesman, called the allegation a character
assassination of the former chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   In a joint report with French Television 2, ARD cited sources close to
Mitterrand as saying the money was not bribes but was intended to serve ``state
interests for Europe.''
</P>
<P>
	   The report said the French and German secret services met regularly with
middlemen in a Geneva hotel to make the payments.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile Sunday, the leader of Germany's Jewish community said he had
received an apology from Christian Democrat leaders for a false comment by
Prince Casimir Sayn-Wittgenstein, a former state party treasurer in Hesse, that
some of the money in the scandal came from Jewish estates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It came late, but not too late,'' Paul Spiegel, president of the Central
Council of Jews in Germany, told Hessischen Rundfunk radio.

<HEADLINE> Quebec Author Anne Hebert Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Anne Hebert, a novelist, poet and playwright who was a key
figure in French-Canadian literature for more than half a century, has died. She
was 83.
</P>
<P>
	   Hebert died Saturday in a hospital in Quebec City after a fight with cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   She wrote what many consider her greatest novel, ``Kamouraska,'' in 1970.
The book was later made into a film by director Claude Jutra, and -- like much
of her work -- was translated into English.
</P>
<P>
	   The recipient of many national and international prizes, Hebert has been
praised for her vivid imagination and literary artistry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She was a reserved and unassuming woman, but in her work there was an
extreme violence,'' said Denise Boucher, president of the Quebec Writers' Union.
``It was writing that rebelled against conformism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hebert often described writing as ``playing with fire.'' In 1982, she won
France's prestigious Femina prize for her work ``Les Fous de Bassan.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hebert's ``Am I Disturbing You'' was a finalist for the 1999 Giller prize
for Canadian fiction. Her last book, ``Un Habit d'Lumiere,'' was published in
French six months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She used words like jewels, like gemstones that were sharp, clear and
fine,'' said Sheila Fischman, who translated ``Am I Disturbing You'' into
English.
</P>
<P>
	   Her other books translated into English over the years included: ``Day Has
No Equal but the Night,'' ``Anne Hebert: Selected Poems,'' ``The Torrent,''
``The Silent Rooms,'' ``The First Garden'' and ``In the Shadow of the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
	   Born Aug. 1, 1916, near Quebec City, Hebert spent much of her adolescent
years isolated in sick rooms, coping with bouts of scarlet fever, pleurisy and
appendicitis. She later lived in Paris for many years.
</P>
<P>
	   She made her professional mark as a poet, publishing her first book in 1942.
</P>
<P>
	   But it wasn't until 1954 that she took Paris by surprise with her book of
poetry, ``Le Tombeau des Rois,'' a cold-blooded dissection of the human psyche.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact that I write is a sign that I am alive, because if one is truly
desperate, one does not do anything at all,'' Hebert once said. ``There have
been moments when I have been discouraged but I never stopped writing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jacques Folch-Ribas, a Quebec author and critic, said the Quebec Writers'
Academy has suggested for several years that Hebert be considered for the Nobel
Prize in literature.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Her poetry is a poetry of hope. It is not abstract,'' said Folch-Ribas.
</P>
<P>
	   After her mother died in 1977, Hebert moved to Paris permanently, saying,
``Montreal is too American, Quebec City is too small, and Paris is very, very
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hebert, who never married and has no children, returned to Canada three
years ago after learning she was terminally ill.
</P>
<P>
	   Funeral arrangements have not yet been announced.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Mull Framework Deadline  </HEADLINE>
   By DINA KRAFT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP ) -- It will be impossible to meet a February deadline for an
outline of a final Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement, Palestinians said
Sunday, signaling another setback for peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   By Feb. 13, the sides had wanted to outline a framework for the resolution
of sensitive disputes over borders, Jewish settlements, Palestinian refugees and
the future of Jerusalem. But neither side is optimistic that goal can be met.
</P>
<P>
	   A delay in the outline would likely push back the Sept. 13 target date for a
final settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The gaps are still wide and I don't see a possibility to reach an
agreement by this date,'' said Palestinian parliament speaker Ahmed Qureia,
better known as Abu Ala.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate response from Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
office. But Israeli officials recently cautioned that despite a decision to pick
up the pace of talks, the framework agreement may be delayed by up to two
months.
</P>
<P>
	   Hussein Abdel Rahman, the Palestine Liberation Organization's representative
in Washington, said the Palestinians have agreed with the United States to move
peace talks to Washington in a bid to accelerate them. Abdel Rahman said the
United States and the Palestinians are waiting to hear if Israel would agree to
relocating the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians blame Israel for the stalled pace of peace talks, faulting
them for focusing on renewed talks with the Syrians. The Syrian talks also
stalled this month, apparently over border issues.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Students Want To Resume Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Radical students who rejected a plan to end a
nine-month-strike at Mexico's National Autonomous University say they want to
resume talks with the administration.
</P>
<P>
	   In a school-sponsored plebiscite held Thursday, administrators, faculty
members and students at the 268,000-student university voted overwhelmingly in
favor of ending the strike, which began April 20.
</P>
<P>
	   But the small group of radical students rejected those results Saturday,
saying the only way to proceed was through direct talks with administrators
regarding their original list of demands, the newspaper Reforma reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Strikers at the university -- Latin America's largest -- initially protested
a plan to raise tuition. But even after administrators withdrew the proposal, a
small group of radical students increased their demands to include automatic
admission for the university's prep school graduates and relaxation of academic
standards.
</P>
<P>
	   The university's rector, Juan Ramon de la Fuente, already has released a
response to the radical students' list of demands. It was not clear whether he
or other administrators would agree to resume negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Fuente's ``Proposal for a Consensus,'' the plan which won Thursday's
vote, offers to scrap plans to raise tuition to the equivalent of $140, and
instead keep entry fees at a few cents. It also envisions the creation of a
university-wide congress to work on reforms.

<HEADLINE> Church Plans Salvador Intervention  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- The Roman Catholic Church in El Salvador
announced on Sunday that it would intervene on behalf of two Salvadorans
sentenced to death for planting bombs in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   San Salvador Archbishop Monsignor Fernando Saenz said that church officials
in El Salvador and Cuba had sent letters asking Cuban President Fidel Castro to
spare the lives of Ernesto Cruz Leon and Rene Rodriguez Llerena.
</P>
<P>
	   The two were sentenced to death last March by a Havana court for attempting
to place bombs at tourist spots.
</P>
<P>
	   Cruz Leon, 29, was convicted of planting bombs in five hotels and one
restaurant, causing one blast that killed an Italian tourist in 1997. Rodriguez
Llerena, 41, was convicted of planting a bomb in one hotel and of plotting
similar bombings at sites sacred to Cuban communists, including the tomb of
revolutionary icon Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara in the central city of Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
	   Cruz Leon's mother, Esther, said she sent a letter to Castro in January 1999
asking clemency for her son, but received no response.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Medical Records Sought  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The release of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's medical report would be
in the best interests of all sides, Amnesty International said Sunday as it
pressed its campaign for the former Chilean dictator's extradition to Spain on
torture charges.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If Pinochet is as ill as claimed, it would speed the process up
considerably if the prosecution was able to see the records and agree,'' Richard
Bunting, spokesman for the human rights organization, told The Associated Press.
``There is nothing really to be gained by maintaining secrecy.''
</P>
<P>
	   British Home Secretary Jack Straw, who ultimately will decide whether
Pinochet is extradited or released, announced Jan. 11 that an independent
medical team had decided unanimously that Pinochet was unfit to stand trial. He
said the doctors' findings made him inclined to decide against extraditing the
general, who is accused of human rights abuses throughout his 17-year regime.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet is said to suffer from diabetes, depression and the effects of two
minor strokes last fall. But he opposed release of his medical report and Straw
said he could not release it because of patient confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
	   But Straw gave all the parties in the case an opportunity to make further
arguments about the extradition. He said he would make his decision as soon as
possible after he received the new information.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if he thought Straw had already made up his mind, Bunting said, ``We
hope this is not some sort of cosmetic exercise. We would hope he takes our
submission very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
	   Britain's Home Office had no immediate response to Bunting's remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet is fighting a Spanish judge's efforts to extradite him to face
charges of the systematic torture of political opponents. An official Chilean
report says 3,197 people died or disappeared during his 1973-1990 dictatorship.

<HEADLINE> College Sought PR Help After Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Within hours of last week's dormitory fire that killed
three students and injured 62, Seton Hall's public relations team was holding
strategy meetings to discuss preserving the university's reputation, according
to a published report.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one public relations firm was contacted within 24 hours of the fire
to prepare a plan to deflect charges that the university had been negligent in
its fire safety training, the Star-Ledger of Newark reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Seton Hall officials said in a news release that they hired a marketing
communications firm one day after the fire to poll colleges and universities
about dorm sprinkler systems. The poll, which surveyed 37 colleges in seven
states at random, showed 45 percent of campus dormitories were not equipped with
sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the public relations firm's hiring, Seton Hall spokeswoman Lisa E.
Grider told the newspaper it's too soon to worry about the school's image when
five students remain hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's too early for us to be thinking about that,'' Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   The dorm where Wednesday's fire started was built before laws required
sprinklers in new campus dorms. Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said
Sunday she plans to introduce legislation to require sprinklers be installed in
all campus dorms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have to protect them where they are. ``We can't count on them
evacuating,'' said Dan Jones, fire chief in Chapel Hill, N.C., who has led a
national campaign to install sprinklers in campus housing since a 1996
fraternity fire killed five people at the University of North Carolina-Chapel
Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   While most university handbooks detail fire procedures and most dormitory
staff hold fire safety talks, few students pay attention, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Experience tells me that 18- to 24-year-olds have a sense of
immortality,'' Jones said. ``You're just not going to get them to pay close
attention to safety lessons.''
</P>
<P>
	   At Seton Hall, many students said they didn't leave when the alarm sounded
early Wednesday because they thought it was another false alarm -- there have
been 17 this school year.
</P>
<P>
	   At Princeton University, undergraduates get fire education booklets, two
seminars a year, four inspections and two fire drills, said spokesman Justin
Harmon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They get it handed it to them,'' Harmon said. ``But you know, ... an alarm
goes off and some kid is in the middle of writing a paper and he doesn't want to
be bothered because he's sure it's somebody's toaster.''
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators at Seton Hall were still trying to determine the cause of the
blaze that broke out in a third-floor lounge of the freshman dorm.
</P>
<P>
	   Essex County Prosecutor Donald Campolo has said investigators have not ruled
out arson, careless smoking or electrical problems as possible causes. His staff
wouldn't comment on the investigation Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Students will be able to return to the dorm on Monday, and classes, canceled
after the fire, were to resume Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Burial services were planned for the three 18-year-old victims Monday.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Angered By Negative Phoning  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT LINDLAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Republican presidential contender Steve Forbes said
Sunday that a Republican group with ties to rival George W. Bush is coordinating
a negative telephone campaign against him. The effort proves he is ``a real
threat to the political establishment,'' Forbes said on the eve of Iowa's
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   The group, the Republican Leadership Council, acknowledged it called
supporters for eight days, ending Friday, to remind them that ``Steve Forbes has
a history of negative attack ads and negative campaigning.'' Forbes said his
campaign has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Callers who responded favorably to the RLC's warning were patched straight
through to Forbes' Iowa headquarters or were urged to call the campaign
directly, said RLC communications director Matt Well. The RLC conducted a
similar effort in New Hampshire, Well said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to remind Steve Forbes that (negative) ads only tear down the
Republican Party,'' Well said. ``We asked them if they would like to voice in
their own words to the Forbes campaign how they felt about his negative ads, to
ask the Forbes campaign to run a clean campaign on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes was criticized in 1996 for a series of hard-hitting ads that
Republicans said undermined the campaign of eventual nominee Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes said after a rally at Iowa State University that the weeklong
campaign was really the work of the Bush campaign, and characterized the RLC as
a ``pro-abortion, liberal organization.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sadly, it's a typical procedure of the Republican establishment,'' Forbes
told reporters. ``I think that underscores that we're a very real threat to the
political establishment, that we are gaining real strength here. ... I'm sad to
see that it's happening again, but I'm not surprised at all.''
</P>
<P>
	   Well said about 70 percent of the RLC's advisory board supports Bush, but
said the group decided to conduct the phone effort without conferring with
Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Mindy Tucker, a Bush spokeswoman, did not immediately return a phone call
Sunday seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes said his campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, has filed a complaint with
the FEC accusing the Bush campaign and the RLC of improper coordination.
</P>
<P>
	   The Forbes campaign received about 200 such calls directed to it from the
RLC, Dal Col said. He said the calls -- about 20 a day -- did not hamper the
campaign, but were a nuisance.

<HEADLINE> Researchers seek better weather technology for pilots  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   EGG HARBOR TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Better technology will be available
soon to airports to help pilots negotiate the weather, making flights safer and
faster, say researchers at a Federal Aviation Administration technical center
near Atlantic City.
<P>
	   FAA has begun to re-emphasize the importance of weather technology despite a
decade of spending cuts for weather research, said Bill Benner, manager of the
William J. Hughes Technical Center. FAA data indicate bad weather is a factor in
75 percent of commercial flight delays and in 30 percent of aircraft accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   "Pilots really want to know where the heavy storm cells are. They don't want
to fly through that type of weather," Benner told The Press of Atlantic City for
Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   Benner said FAA funding for weather technology fallen, from about $50
million annually in the early 1990s to $16.7 million for the fiscal year 2000.
In the meantime, the National Transportation Safety Board has been urging the
FAA to upgrade weather systems in air-traffic control facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   After last June's crash of American Airlines Flight 1420 in an Arkansas
thunderstorm, NTSB member George Black complained many airports don't have
access to Doppler weather data. Television stations use such data in producing
weather forecasts.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators suspect a powerful, downward wind shear caused the twin-engine
McDonnell Douglas MD-80 to crash, killing eleven people and injuring more than
80 others.
</P>
<P>
	   The new technology could detect such bursts and other severe weather. One
such system is called the Integrated Terminal Weather System, or ITWS. The
system is to be installed at air-traffic control facilities at 45 major
airports, Benner said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ITWS involves real-time computer displays that will warn operators of
threatening weather more quickly and accurately than the technology currently
found in airports, said Tom Weiss, an FAA electronic engineer.
</P>
<P>
	   Another type of weather technology also will be used in 21 air-traffic
control centers across the nation. The system, called Weather and Radar
Processing, or WARP, frequently updates radar displays and satellite displays to
help air-traffic controllers monitor the weather. WARP will be installed in
airports that handle long-distance flights.
</P>
<P>
	   But FAA funding limits smaller airports such as Atlantic City International
to less sophisticated weather equipment because they don't have the traffic to
justify the costs, Benner said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Benner and other FAA officials said flights to Atlantic City and other
airports will continue to be safe. The current technology will still track
inclement weather, although less precisely, Benner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, researchers also are developing technology that would work better
than the ITWS. The enhanced system will be able to track turbulence and icing
conditions at different altitudes. It also will produce more accurate forecasts.

	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore and Texas Governor George
Bush each hold commanding leads in statewide polls on the eve of Iowa's
caucuses. Still, the polls show that about one in 10 voters are undecided,
giving the candidates incentive to campaign hard today. A Des Moines Sunday

among Democrats 56 percent to 28 percent. Bush led Steve Forbes 43 percent to 20
percent in the Jan. 16-21 survey, which had an error margin of plus or minus 4

Sunday. In a village just east of Grozny, a group of rebels attacked Russian

of people marched through downtown Madrid on Sunday to protest a car-bomb attack
seen as a resurgence of Basque separatists' 32-year-old campaign of violence.
Sunday's demonstration brought back memories of anti-ETA rallies across Spain in
1997 that many believed helped persuade the organization to agree to a
cease-fire. ETA ended the 14-month truce on Dec. 3 and warned of more attacks,
although there was no claim of responsibility in the recent bombing.

<HEADLINE> Bauer Renews Challenge on China  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Republican Gary Bauer, aiming to energize social
and religious conservatives, assaulted better-known rivals Sunday for ``naive''
trade policies on China.
</P>
<P>
	   At a frigid outdoor news conference, Bauer said Texas Gov. George W. Bush
and publisher Steve Forbes have essentially copied President Clinton's China
policies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This policy is failing and Governor Bush and Steve Forbes are naive in
continuing to chant trade, trade, trade as the answer,'' said Bauer. Talking
tough on China resonates with those social conservatives, but Bauer also dropped
into a couple of Sunday church services to underscore his efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Most polls have shown Bauer trailing both Bush and Forbes, and he's unable
to match the resources either bring to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   With Monday's leadoff precinct caucuses looming, Bauer was in a battle for
survival with fellow conservatives Alan Keyes and Sen. Orrin Hatch, with all
sporting single-digit poll numbers and only one of them likely to survive the
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Also in single digits is Arizona Sen. John McCain, who has skipped Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer has stumped the state relentlessly and has put in place more than a
dozen field organizers, and his campaign strategists said they were banking on
that organization to pay dividends Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   While crowds for the fiery Keyes have grown in recent days, he can't match
Bauer's turnout operation, said Bauer strategist Marlys Popma.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Keyes has always had good crowds,'' she said. ``I don't see how he can do
it because he doesn't have the organization that we do.''
</P>
<P>
	   While Keyes has focused on only a few cities, Popma argued that Bauer has
developed a statewide network. Most polls show about 10 percent of the
electorate undecided, and there will be Bauer backers at caucuses statewide, she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are not going to be a lot of precincts that don't have Bauer
representation,'' said Popma.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer himself rejected any suggestions that he faces pressure to perform,
saying he's built a solid political base with a direct-mail fund-raising
network.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've got 150,000 people who have donated to the campaign and when they
donate almost overwhelming they write `don't drop out under any
circumstances,''' said Bauer. ``We believe we've got the base that will take us
all the way to the convention in Philadelphia and that's where I intend to go.'

<HEADLINE> New Ecuador President A Novice  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador's new president, Gustavo Noboa, comes into
office with almost no experience in government except for 17 months as vice
president.
</P>
<P>
	   That's a plus for most Ecuadoreans.
</P>
<P>
	   It means that Noboa, an academic and former university rector, has not been
contaminated by the corruption that has stained most public officials since
democracy was restored to this small Andean nation two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Well aware of public outrage over corrupt governments, Noboa stressed in his
first remarks as president that his priority would be to bring dishonest
officials to justice. He said he is prepared to fight to extradite them from
abroad, where many have fled after looting the public coffers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He won't tolerate corruption. That is something that characterizes him. He
has never acquired wealth,'' said Walter Spurrier, a distinguished economist who
has known Noboa for years.
</P>
<P>
	   Noboa took office Saturday after the military forced President Jamil Mahuad
from power. The military said it was taking the step to avoid ``a social
explosion'' after hundreds of Indians and young military officers stormed the
Congress building and announced the formation of a new government to fight
corruption and work on behalf of the poor.
</P>
<P>
	   In his only public statement since assuming the presidency, Noboa sought to
bring a message of hope to Ecuadoreans, who have grown increasingly distrustful
of promises by political leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My profound conviction as a Christian permits me to hope that with God's
help Ecuadoreans today can begin the march toward better days,'' the 62-year-old
president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Noboa, a political independent, spent 10 years as the rector of the
University of Guayaquil on Ecuador's Pacific coast. He also has served as dean
of the university's law school and he taught for more than two decades in
Catholic high schools.
</P>
<P>
	   In his only previous experience in public office prior to being elected vice
president, Noboa served briefly in 1983 as the appointed governor of Guayas
province. He also has experience in business as the former manager of a sugar
refinery.
</P>
<P>
	   Friends and colleagues describe him as a gifted negotiator, a demanding
teacher -- calm, serious, a man of few words.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is an intelligent man,'' said retired army general Jose Gallardo, who
served as Mahuad's defense minister until his resignation a week before the
coup. ``The vice president was loyal to the president. He is a man of
principles. I foresee him being successful on behalf of our country.''
</P>
<P>
	   During his time as vice president, Noboa concentrated on overseeing the
reconstruction of highways and bridges on the heavily populated Pacific coast
that were destroyed by El Nino-generated storms in 1997 and 1998. Officials say
he fought a cash-strapped government to get the funds to properly repair the
road system in a part of the country that is a major source of agricultural
exports.

	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Not even a hectic day of campaigning could keep
Vice President Al Gore from catching the final minutes of Sunday's NFL
championship game between his Tennessee Titans and the Jacksonville Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
	   Stopping at the airport between one of many campaign stops in advance of
Monday night's caucuses, the Democratic presidential candidate stretched out in
a brown, vinyl chair to catch a peek at the game in the company of airport fire
and rescue personnel.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans won, 33-14, earning a spot in the Jan. 30 Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't have any bets on this one,'' said Gore, a former Tennessee
senator. ``I've been out on the campaign trail too much to have any bets.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he hoped to go to the Super Bowl, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, before heading out for door-to-door canvassing of the Beaverdale
neighborhood, he stopped in at Reed's B&AMP;B Cafe, where Jim Carnahan asked the
vice president if he'd seen the Titans win.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You've got two things to celebrate this week,'' he told Gore.
</P>

	   Gore held up a hand a replied, ``Well, we've got one -- we're working on the
other one.''

	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate and Sen. John
McCain picked up endorsements Sunday from two New Hampshire newspapers -- the
Concord Monitor and The Telegraph of Nashua.
</P>
<P>
	   The Concord Monitor praised McCain for ``a candidacy that respects voters,
engages the issues and strikes a tone of righteous indignation.'' The newspaper
said it would announce its choice in the Democratic presidential race on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with McCain, the Telegraph also endorsed Democratic presidential
candidate Bill Bradley. The newspaper's editorial said both men ``promise to
tackle one of the political system's worst features'' -- the influence of money
in politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Eagle Tribune, of Lawrence, Mass., which circulates in

presidential race, saying he has ``what it takes to lead our nation as

	   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Twelve years after winning the New Hampshire
presidential primary, Michael Dukakis was back on the beat on behalf of a former
rival -- Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Banging on doors in Nashua was great fun. The people were terrific,'' said
the former Massachusetts governor and 1988 Democratic presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   Dukakis, who campaigned Saturday in Nashua, Manchester and Concord, said
running into many of his former supporters brought back memories.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There were a lot of hugs and kisses, and reminiscing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dukakis said New Hampshire was a ``very, very important step on the road''
to winning the nomination in 1988, when Gore also ran for president. Gore, the
vice president, is again seeking the Democratic nomination.

<HEADLINE> Study: States Ignore Special Ed Law  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many children with disabilities are getting substandard
schooling because states are not complying with federal rules on special
education, an independent agency reports.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials are not forcing compliance, and as a result, parents often
must sue to enforce the law, according to a review of more than two decades of
enforcement of the federal special education law.
</P>
<P>
	   In too many cases, children with disabilities are taught in separate
classrooms and schools are not following other regulations meant to protect
these students from discrimination, the National Council on Disability said in a
reported to be released Tuesday. The Associated Press obtained an advance copy.
</P>
<P>
	   The problems have persisted for years in many locations, said the council,
which makes recommendation to the president and Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Federal efforts to enforce the law over several administrations have been
inconsistent, ineffective and lacking any real teeth,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the Department of Education, the federal agency responsible for
overseeing compliance with the 1975 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act,
said it has increased monitoring under the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We concur that the responsibility of enforcement of this law should not be
borne on the backs of parents,'' said Judith Heumann, assistant secretary of the
office of special education and rehabilitative service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some states are not where we want them to be and are not implementing the
laws as they need to,'' Heumann said. ``We've been spending significant time
increasing our monitoring, technical assistance and enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 6 million American children receive special education instruction and
services at a cost of almost $40 billion, about $5.7 billion of which is federal
money.
</P>
<P>
	   The special education law was meant to end discrimination against children
with disabilities. Many of these children had been excluded from public schools,
institutionalized or placed in programs that provided little or no learning. The
law was strengthened in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the law, local education authorities that receive federal money answer
to state agencies, which in turn answer to the federal Education Department. The
department's monitoring division has 35 employees and budget of about $2.7
million.
</P>
<P>
	   In its report, the disabilities council said Education Secretary Richard
Riley has been more aggressive in seeking to improve monitoring and enforcement
than the combined efforts of all his predecessors. But the group said serious
problems persist.
</P>
<P>
	   According to compliance reports covering 1994 through 1998:
</P>
<P>
	   --36 states failed to ensure that children with disabilities are not
segregated from regular classrooms.
</P>
<P>
	   --44 states failed to follow rules requiring schools to help students find
jobs or continue their education.
</P>
<P>
	   --45 states failed to ensure that local school authorities adhered to
nondiscrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
	   States long have fought with local schools and the Education Department over
costs, saying they need more federal money for special education.
</P>
<P>
	   Lilliam Rangel-Diaz, a council board member and parent of children with
disabilities, contended that children are not getting the schooling they deserve
because the government is not doing its job.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have created a segregated system of education, where kids are
segregated with other children with disabilities and don't acquire the skills
they need to function in society,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Education Department can withhold money from states that do not follow
the rules but has punished only one state, Virginia. Federal courts reversed
that decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Heumann said the Education Department has begun cracking down on states by
requiring that shortcomings be corrected as a condition for continued federal
payments. If they fail to fix a problem within a year, the department can refer
the case to the Justice Department or withhold funding.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problems that exist in states concern us very dearly,'' said Heumann,
who uses a wheelchair. ``Many have been taking their responsibilities much more
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
	   The council made dozens of recommendations to strengthen federal
enforcement. They include giving the Justice Department independent authority to
investigate cases and take states to court; providing more money for enforcement
and handling of complaints; and creating a process for handling complaints at
the federal level.
</P>
<P>
	   The special education report is part of the council's multiyear study for
the president and Congress on the implementation and enforcement of the
Americans with Disabilities Act and other civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said the most recent Department of Education monitoring surveys
for 50 states showed:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Only Arkansas, Hawaii, Nevada and Oklahoma were ensuring that local
school authorities adhered to nondiscrimination laws, compared to 45 who were
not. No information for Mississippi was given in this category.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota and Vermont were ensuring
that disabled kids are not segregated from regular classrooms. The rest of
states were not.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Georgia, Nebraska, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Wyoming
were the only states following rules requiring schools to help students find
jobs or continue their educations.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Gov't Sells Telecom Stake  </HEADLINE>
    By JAMAL HALABY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Making good on privatization promises, the government
on Sunday sold 40 percent of the lucrative Jordan Telecommunications Co. to an
alliance led by France Telecom.
</P>
<P>
	   The $508 million deal represents the largest single foreign investment to
date in Jordan, where JTC is the sole telecommunications carrier.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal gave France Telecom a victory over Britain's Vodafone and Southern
Bell Corp. of the United States, which had been vying for a stake in the
telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
	   A government statement said the purchase was made through Jordan Investment
Telecommunications Co., a holding company in which France Telecom has an 88
percent stake. The balance belongs to Arab Bank Plc, Jordan's largest financial
institution.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the agreement involves a five-year management contract under which
France Telecom will work to improve JTC's business, develop customer service,
transfer technology and assist in introducing new services, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   JTC's earnings in 1999 were $304 million, according to the company's
chairman, Suleiman Hafeth.
</P>
<P>
	   The French firm is one of the world's leading telecommunications carriers
with consolidated operating revenues of about $25 billion and operations in more
than 50 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The government hesitated for years to sell shares in the telecommunications
company because of public concern that such a move would allow foreign
domination of this strategic sector. But the Cabinet said in August it had
decided to revive plans for a sale.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, the government sold 33 percent of the Jordan Cement Factories
Co. to French giant Lafarge as part of its privatization drive.

</P>
<P>
	   The countries agreed to begin researching concrete marketing measures and

</P>
<P>
	   ASEAN is made up of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
	   Tourism is a major revenue earner for the more-developed countries in the

    BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Higher oil prices and progress in liberalizing

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Rail To Get Syndicated Loan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Some 30 Taiwanese banks have agreed to provide a loan
of $10 billion -- the largest ever in Taiwan -- to build the island's first
high-speed railroad.
</P>
<P>
	   The loan agreement will be signed in two weeks, Yin Chi, chairman of the
Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp., told reporters on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement will remove the last stumbling block to the project, enabling
construction to be in full swing by the end of the year, Yin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Taiwan High-Speed, a consortium of Taiwanese firms, had told the government
it would call off the $13.9 billion project if it failed to obtain the loan by
March.
</P>
<P>
	   The Economic Daily News quoted unidentified bank officials as saying the
banks agreed to the loan after the government guaranteed it would buy back the
railroad's operation rights if Taiwan High-Speed got into trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   The railroad will cover 207 miles and connect the island from north to
south. Taiwan High-Speed will have the right to operate it for 30 years. The
groundbreaking ceremony was held in March.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, the company announced it had chosen the bullet-train technology
provided by a Japanese group led by Mitsui and Co., which will supply the main
hardware and communication systems for the project. A contract is expected to be
signed this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Yin said a court injunction filed by the rival Eurotrain group did not
hamper the company's negotiations with the Japanese group.
</P>
<P>
	   The group, led by Germany's Siemens AG and France's Alsthom, accused Taiwan
High-Speed of violating a 1996 agreement to grant the rail contract to it.

	   The weighted pump price of gasoline, including all grades and taxes,
averaged $1.3676 per gallon on Friday, up 3.32 cents from two weeks earlier,
according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   "Normally, gasoline prices would be weak or falling this time of year due to
reduced driving in the winter months," said analyst Trilby Lundberg.
</P>
<P>
	   But crude oil prices are up about nine cents a gallon because of production
cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. In addition, a
suddenly colder winter in Eastern and Midwestern states has "jump-started"
demand for home heating oil, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ironically, the colder weather that ordinarily would cause gasoline prices
to drop is a cause for them to rise," Lundberg said. "If both OPEC and cold
weather hold, so will gasoline prices."
</P>
<P>
	   The price hikes varied widely by region, however. They were up about a
nickel per gallon in the Northeast, more than nine cents a gallon in the
Midwest, but actually dropped about a penny in the West.
</P>
<P>
	   Western prices soared last year due to shortages caused by accidents and
outages at California refineries, but those shortages now have eased, Lundberg
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices at self-service stations averaged $1.3181 per gallon for regular
unleaded, $1.4158 for mid-grade and $1.5001 for premium. Full-service prices
were $1.6445 for regular unleaded, $1.7309 for mid-grade and $1.8049 for
premium.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Canvas in Iowa  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- On the eve of Iowa's caucuses, Republican and
Democratic presidential candidates canvassed churches and national talk shows
Sunday, scouring this snow-crusted state for last-minute support even as they
began looking ahead to contests in New Hampshire and beyond.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the first step in several steps of the journey,'' Bill Bradley,
the former New Jersey senator who trails Vice President Al Gore in Democratic
polls, said on CBS.
</P>
<P>
	   Entering the first election contest of Campaign 2000, Republican George W.
Bush and Gore held wide leads in polls of voters who planned to visit schools,
civic clubs, fire stations and other sites Monday to support one of eight major
contestants.
</P>
<P>
	   The underdog candidates, all resigned to losing, were shooting for
face-saving finishes and Iowa's true reward: Momentum for New Hampshire's Feb. 1
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a marathon, not a sprint,'' said Republican Steve Forbes on NBC's
``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
	   The footrace in Iowa, a test of political organization, favors the national
front-runners. A Des Moines Sunday Register poll of 1,200 likely caucus-goers
showed Gore leading Bradley among Democrats 56 percent to 28 percent. Bush led
Forbes 43 percent to 20 percent in the Jan. 16-21 survey, which had an error
margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is in danger of finishing worse than expected in a contest that
traditionally punishes candidates who fail to meet expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   His latest poll rating was beneath the intentionally-low threshold his
advisers set as a measure of accomplishment: The 31 percent showing by Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., in a second-place finish behind then-President Jimmy
Carter in the 1980 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   With the rest of the GOP field in single digits, Forbes has long said he is
the conservative alternative to Bush. The argument would carry greater weight
if, after pouring millions of dollars into Iowa since his failed 1996 bid,
Forbes fares better than the new poll suggests -- 23 points behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The polls show that about one in 10 voters are undecided, giving the
candidates incentive to campaign hard Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only thing I know to do is to encourage our folks to get out and vote.
We need as big a vote as possible,'' Bush told reporters between campaign stops.
</P>
<P>
	   In a lengthy interview with ABC, Bush struggled with his explanation for
supporting a sales tax increase in Texas after making a no-tax pledge. The
second-term governor said he had qualified the promise by also pledging to
reform education funding in the state, an effort that presumably led to the tax
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Dismissing the issue, Bush said ``There's pledges all the time'' and
reviewed a record as governor that included two major tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   He also continued to flesh out his views on abortion, a critical issue to
many GOP caucus-goers. Asked about the topic for the fourth day, he predicted
that Texas would outlaw first-trimester abortions if the Supreme Court reversed
itself and let states impose strict anti-abortion laws -- a position Bush says
the court should take.
</P>
<P>
	   Maintaining a caucus tradition, several campaigns had supporters papering
churches and their parking lots with leaflets. Religious conservatives represent
a third of likely caucus-goers and are more likely than most voters to attend
the sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Forbes is expected to get a lion's share of the conservative vote,
former ambassador Alan Keyes, Washington activist Gary Bauer and Sen. Orrin
Hatch of Utah are carving up the religious base. Keyes, Bauer and Hatch are
likely competing for third place; finishing lower could doom their candidacies.
</P>
<P>
	   Addressing a congregation on the city's industrial north side, Bauer said
Christians should vote more on principle than on ``selfish'' issues such as
taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Do what you think God would have you do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking to New Hampshire, Bush pressed his case against Sen. John McCain's
tax-cutting package. The Arizona senator, who did not campaign in Iowa, is in a
tight race with Bush in the New England state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fundamental debate is do we leave money in Washington or do we give it
back to taxpayers?'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain would cut fewer taxes than Bush, saving some projected government
surpluses to bolster Social Security, Medicare and pay down the national debt.
While Bush was in Iowa, McCain was campaigning Sunday in New Hampshire where he
picked up endorsements from two of the state's biggest newspapers.
</P>
<P>
	   Public polls suggest that Gore has opened a slight lead over Bradley in New
Hampshire, though the vice president's own polls still show the race in a
statistical dead heat. Bradley aides also consider the race tied. On the
Republican side, McCain is maintaining a lead in the high single digits over the
Texas governor, although Bush has an edge in at least one poll.
</P>
<P>
	   A CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll Sunday on the New Hampshire contest had McCain
ahead of Bush, 42 percent to 33 percent, among likely Republican primary voters,
with an error margin of plus or minus 5 percentage points. On the Democratic
side, Gore had a lead over Bradley, 43 percent to 52 percent, with an error
margin of plus or minus four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, McCain said he would cancel a campaign commercial
responding to an ad by Bush in which the Texas governor says McCain's tax plan
would result in a $40 billion tax increase for working people. McCain has argued
that Bush's claims are false.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush aides said the ad went off the air last week, but McCain consultant
Mike Murphy disputed that, saying ``people saw it on Friday.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa, Forbes courted social conservatives by questioning Bush's
commitment to abortion and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Candidates at this time of the year -- the conservative establishment in
the Republican Party -- always say `Oh, we are conservative' and then after the
election, they forget about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley urged supporters to vote. ``We could surprise a few people,'' he
said at Cornell College. He also picked up an endorsement from California Rep.
Anna Eshoo.
</P>
<P>
	   In Davenport, Gore said his ``honorable opponent'' has focused on health
care reform while treating education ``as kind of an afterthought.''
</P>
<P>
	   As the candidates stumped, aides fine-tuned plans to get supporters to the
caucus sites. Last-minute mailings criticized opponents and offered incentives
to vote. A Bush flier included two ``W'' stickers for supporters to show unity
at caucus sites.
</P>
<P>
	   Drawing protests from Forbes, the Republican Leadership Council, a moderate
Republican group with ties to Bush, called Iowans for eight straight days to
warn that the conservative publisher ``has a history of negative attacks.''
</P>
<P>
	   Voters sized up the field for the last time.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Steenhoek, 32, of Ankeny, said he was leaning toward Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's more of him being such an underdog and trying so hard and keeping at
it that makes me like him so much,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- One week after the Taliban gave official
recognition to an independent Chechnya, the breakaway Russian republic opened
its embassy in Afghanistan's beleaguered capital of Kabul, Radio Shariat
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chechen ambassador to Afghanistan is likely to be Zelimkhan Banderayev,
the man who headed the Chechen delegation seeking official recognition for the
republic fighting the Russian military.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghanistan's Taliban army, which rules 90 percent of the country, are the
only ones to recognize an independent Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian military has launched a fierce assault on Chechnya to crush the
rebel insurgency.
</P>
<P>
	   The Taliban's supreme leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, has criticized other
Muslim countries as well as the United Nations for failing to help Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia accuses the Taliban of sending manpower and military aid to the
Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   However, earlier, Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil said the Taliban
have nothing to give because of the relentless civil war with their
northern-based opposition.

ETA ended the 14-month truce on Dec. 3 and warned of more attacks, although
there was no claim of responsibility in the recent bombing.

deal said today. London-based EMI confirmed that it is in the final stages of
negotiations and said an announcement is forthcoming. Time Warner in New York
also acknowledged the talks, but a spokesman said no deal has been signed. If
approved by regulators, a merger of EMI and Time Warner would be the

Study Links Baldness, Heart Problem

	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Men who are losing the hair on the crowns of their heads
have up to a 36 percent greater risk of experiencing heart problems, including
heart attacks and bypass surgery, a study found. Balding men with high
cholesterol levels had almost three times the risk for heart disease when
compared with men with a full head of hair who also had high cholesterol.
Researchers say men going bald at the crown should pay special attention to
their blood pressure and cholesterol levels and lead a healthy lifestyle. The
study is published in Monday's edition of the Archives of Internal Medicine.

Fogle, 22, went from a colossal 425 pounds to a much slimmer 180 pounds on his

<TEXT>
<P>
   LEVITTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Fire spread through the first floor of a suburban
Philadelphia home early Sunday, killing a 4-year-old girl, her mother and her
grandparents, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Leibel said he and other neighbors saw smoke and flames in the house
about 7 a.m. They tried to reach the family by breaking windows and shoveling
snow in to stop the fire, but the smoke was too thick to see inside.
</P>
<P>
	   One neighbor was able to pull the 4-year-old girl out, but efforts to revive
her were unsuccessful, said Michael Moretti, county director of emergency
services.
</P>
<P>
	   The two-story house was ablaze when firefighters arrived about 7 a.m. The
bodies of Colleen Connor, 28, Dale Connor, 51, and Donald Connor, 45, were found
inside, police said. Authorities said the little girl's name was either Cassie
or Kasey.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire was concentrated on the first floor and may have been sparked by an
electrical problem, Falls Township police said. An official cause had not been
determined.

<P>
	   Today's Highlight in History:
</P>
<P>
	   On Jan. 24, 1908, the first Boy Scout troop was organized, by Robert
Baden-Powell in England.
</P>
<P>
	   On this date:
</P>
<P>
	   In 1848, James W. Marshall discovered a gold nugget at Sutter's Mill in
northern California, a discovery that led to the gold rush of '49.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1924, the Russian city of St. Petersburg was renamed Leningrad in honor
of the late revolutionary leader. It has since been renamed St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1942, a special court of inquiry into America's lack of preparedness for
the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor placed much of the blame on Rear Adm.
Husband E. Kimmel and Lt. Gen. Walter C. Short, the Navy and Army commanders.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1943, President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill concluded
a wartime conference in Casablanca, Morocco.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1965, Winston Churchill died in London at age 90.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1972, the Supreme Court struck down laws that denied welfare benefits to
people who had lived in a state for less than a year.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1978, a nuclear-powered Soviet satellite plunged through Earth's
atmosphere and disintegrated, scattering radioactive debris over parts of
northern Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1989, confessed serial killer Theodore Bundy was put to death in
Florida's electric chair.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ill. Church Splits Over Gays  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLEVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- A local church -- fed up with what it considers
liberal stands by its parent organization, including accepting homosexuals --
voted Sunday to strike out on its own.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We no longer want the United Church of Christ speaking for us, taking
stands for us that we don't agree with,'' Pastor Darrell Coons said after the
vote at the congregation's annual meeting turned the Hope United Church of
Christ into the Hope Church.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our members say the United Church of Christ is taking stands that aren't
scriptural,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Eighty-one percent of members voted to change the church's charter and split
from the national organization, Coons said. The action required a two-thirds
majority. Coons said the split will not hurt the 527-member congregation.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the vote, the Rev. Ron Eslinger, head of the United Church of
Christ's Illinois South Conference, said Coon and the congregation wanted to
leave because they didn't like the national organization's policy of accepting
homosexuals as members.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week the president of the United Church of Christ, the Rev. John H.
Thomas, was among the group of 850 members of the clergy and other religious
figures who issued a declaration urging all faiths to bless same-sex couples and
allow openly gay ministers.
</P>
<P>
	   Coons called that position ``the last straw.''
</P>
<P>
	   Eslinger said none of the conference's other 90 affiliates have expressed an
interest in leaving over the national organization's policies.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Straw Poll in Iowa's Shadow  </HEADLINE>
   By T.A. BADGER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Alaska's Republicans wanted an opening-day say in
this year's presidential sweepstakes, and on Monday they'll have it.
</P>
<P>
	   But with the nation's political ear tuned to the grange halls and church
basements of Iowa, will anybody outside the Last Frontier be listening?
</P>
<P>
	   State GOP leaders say Alaska won't be drowned out by the bigger, more
established event.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hey, it puts us on the map,'' Tom McKay, chairman of the Alaska Republican
Party, said of the timing. ``And it helps raise the level of awareness in Alaska
issues for many presidential candidates.''
</P>
<P>
	   Other political watchers aren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think anyone is paying any attention,'' said Merle Black, a
prominent political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta. ``Iowa is the
center of the political universe right now. (Alaska is) really in the backwash
of all that.''
</P>
<P>
	   An Alaskan academic had an even harsher assessment, dismissing the straw
poll as ``just another wacky idea.''
</P>
<P>
	   The state party ``hasn't done any work to get onto the national agenda,''
said Jerry McBeath, a political scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
``They've left themselves open to stringer candidates who have no chance at all
to win (the nomination).''
</P>
<P>
	   Registered Republicans will gather at venues across the state Monday to cast
their votes in the nonbinding straw poll. The party's official endorsement comes
this summer at the state convention.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, more than 9,000 Republicans turned out for the straw poll. The
winner was commentator Pat Buchanan with 33 percent, followed closely by
multimillionaire publisher Steve Forbes at 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan gave up his chance for a repeat when he defected to the Reform
Party, but Forbes is back for another go. McKay said he thinks Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, the national front-runner, is the smart money bet, however.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has what I call the establishment Republican community involved in his
campaign,'' he said. ``He's got quite a bit of momentum going nationally and a
big endorsement of (Alaska Rep.) Don Young -- we'll see how much horsepower that
carries.''
</P>
<P>
	   Others are the ballot are Arizona Sen. John McCain, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch,
radio commentator Alan Keyes and pro-family crusader Gary Bauer.

<HEADLINE> College Sought PR Help After Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Within hours of last week's dormitory fire that killed
three students and injured 62, Seton Hall's public relations team was holding
strategy meetings to discuss preserving the university's reputation, according
to a published report.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one public relations firm was contacted within 24 hours of the fire
to prepare a plan to deflect charges that the university had been negligent in
its fire safety training, the Star-Ledger of Newark reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Seton Hall officials said in a news release that they hired a marketing
communications firm one day after the fire to poll colleges and universities
about dorm sprinkler systems. The poll, which surveyed 37 colleges in seven
states at random, showed 45 percent of campus dormitories were not equipped with
sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the public relations firm's hiring, Seton Hall spokeswoman Lisa E.
Grider told the newspaper it's too soon to worry about the school's image when
five students remain hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's too early for us to be thinking about that,'' Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   The dorm where Wednesday's fire started was built before laws required
sprinklers in new campus dorms. Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said
Sunday she plans to introduce legislation to require sprinklers be installed in
all campus dorms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have to protect them where they are. ``We can't count on them
evacuating,'' said Dan Jones, fire chief in Chapel Hill, N.C., who has led a
national campaign to install sprinklers in campus housing since a 1996
fraternity fire killed five people at the University of North Carolina-Chapel
Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   While most university handbooks detail fire procedures and most dormitory
staff hold fire safety talks, few students pay attention, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Experience tells me that 18- to 24-year-olds have a sense of
immortality,'' Jones said. ``You're just not going to get them to pay close
attention to safety lessons.''
</P>
<P>
	   At Seton Hall, many students said they didn't leave when the alarm sounded
early Wednesday because they thought it was another false alarm -- there have
been 17 this school year.
</P>
<P>
	   At Princeton University, undergraduates get fire education booklets, two
seminars a year, four inspections and two fire drills, said spokesman Justin
Harmon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They get it handed it to them,'' Harmon said. ``But you know, ... an alarm
goes off and some kid is in the middle of writing a paper and he doesn't want to
be bothered because he's sure it's somebody's toaster.''
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators at Seton Hall were still trying to determine the cause of the
blaze that broke out in a third-floor lounge of the freshman dorm.
</P>
<P>
	   Essex County Prosecutor Donald Campolo has said investigators have not ruled
out arson, careless smoking or electrical problems as possible causes. His staff
wouldn't comment on the investigation Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Students will be able to return to the dorm on Monday, and classes, canceled
after the fire, were to resume Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Burial services were planned for the three 18-year-old victims Monday.

<HEADLINE> 'Blair Witch' Co. Picks up New Film  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Artisan Entertainment, which picked up a bargain
blockbuster with the "Blair Witch Project" at last year's Sundance Film
Festival, was one of the first distributors to cut a deal for a film at this
year's festival.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, along with Summit Entertainment, bought the comedy "Chuck &AMP;
Buck," Artisan President Amir Malin said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sources who spoke on condition anonymity said the purchase price was $1
million, the same amount Artisan paid a year ago for "Blair Witch Project" which
grossed $140 million after its release last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Malin said "Chuck &AMP; Buck" has commercial appeal, but its potential should
not be compared to the phenomenal success of "Blair Witch."
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it would be unfair to set the bar so high on any film or any
company with the likes of 'Blair Witch,' " Malin said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Chuck &AMP; Buck" tells the story of a 27-year-old slacker who visits a
childhood buddy, now a go-getter in the Los Angeles recording industry. The dark
comedy centers on loser Buck's efforts to rekindle his friendship with Charlie,
who was called Chuck as a boy.
</P>
<P>
	   The movie was directed by Miguel Arteta, a filmmaker originally from Puerto
Rico whose first movie "Star Maps" showed at Sundance in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Artisan representatives first saw the movie Friday and signed the deal with
the filmmakers the next day.
</P>
<P>
	   Also picked up over the weekend was an all-night rave movie called "Groove"
bought by Sony Pictures Classics, according to festival organizers.
</P>
<P>
	   Two short films also were acquired. AtomFilms, which distributes short
features over the Internet, bought the life-after-death comedy "In God We
Trust."
</P>
<P>
	   The movie was directed by Jason Reitman, son of filmmaker Ivan Reitman, who
directed "Ghostbusters."

<TEXT>
<P>
	   SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- Ed Clark, a former Life magazine photographer whose
best-known photo was of a grieving Navy musician playing the accordion in honor
of Franklin Roosevelt's funeral train, died Saturday. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
	   A native Tennessean, Clark dropped out of high school in Nashville at age 17
to join the staff of The Tennessean, where he worked for 13 years before Life
hired him.
</P>
<P>
	   Other famous photos include one of Marilyn Monroe in a stitched-on gold
dress and a picture of then-Sen. John F. Kennedy looking into his daughter's
bassinet as the infant Caroline peeked at him over a blanket corner, as well as
images of post-World War II Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1945, as other photographers in Warm Springs, Ga., scrambled for a shot
of the presidential casket with Roosevelt's body, Clark turned around and
trained his lens on Chief Petty Officer Graham Jackson, who had tears streaming
down his cheeks has he played ``Goin' Home'' on his accordion.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark worked for Life in Hollywood, photographing celebrities like Lauren
Bacall and Humphrey Bogart. After World War II, he served as a correspondent in
post-war Europe and covered the Nuremberg Trials and then worked in Washington.
Anne Hebert
</P>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- Anne Hebert, a novelist, poet and playwright who was a key
figure in French-Canadian literature for more than half a century, died Saturday
after a fight with cancer. She was 83.
</P>
<P>
	   Hebert wrote what many consider her greatest novel, ``Kamouraska,'' in 1970.
The book was later made into a film by director Claude Jutra, and -- like much
of her work -- was translated into English.
</P>
<P>
	   The recipient of many national and international prizes, Hebert has been
praised for her vivid imagination and literary artistry.
</P>
<P>
	   Hebert often described writing as ``playing with fire.'' In 1982, she won
France's prestigious Femina prize for her work ``Les Fous de Bassan.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hebert's ``Am I Disturbing You'' was a finalist for the 1999 Giller prize
for Canadian fiction. Her last book, ``Un Habit d'Lumiere,'' was published in
French six months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She used words like jewels, like gemstones that were sharp, clear and
fine,'' said Sheila Fischman, who translated ``Am I Disturbing You'' into
English.
</P>
<P>
	   Her other books translated into English over the years included: ``Day Has
No Equal but the Night,'' ``Anne Hebert: Selected Poems,'' ``The Torrent,''
``The Silent Rooms,'' ``The First Garden'' and ``In the Shadow of the Wind.''
Gerald Murphy
</P>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Dr. Gerald Murphy, a Seattle oncologist who helped develop a
widely used test for prostate cancer, died Friday while visiting Israel for a
convention of the International Union Against Cancer. He was 65 and had
undergone several heart-bypass operations years.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy published more than 1,000 papers and served as president of the
American Cancer Society in 1983-84.
</P>
<P>
	   He received the Papal Medal for distinguished service to humanity in 1982.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was probably the most brilliant man I've ever known,'' said Alan Davis,
former vice president for public affairs of the National Cancer Institute. ``At
the same time, he was modest and unassuming.''
</P>
<P>
	   From 1970 to 1985, he was director of Roswell Park Memorial Institute for
cancer research and treatment in Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   While there, he worked in the urology-research lab at the State University
of New York Medical School, where his research group determined that
prostate-cancer tumors produce prostate-specific antigens (PSAs).
</P>
<P>
	   This led to development of the PSA test, which indicates prostate cancer's
early presence.
Kin Narita
</P>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- Kin Narita, who became a beloved symbol of graceful aging as
one of Japan's oldest and best-known twins, died Sunday of heart failure. She
was 107.
</P>
<P>
	   Kin and her twin sister, Gin Kanie, became celebrities in a country that
reveres the elderly, frequently appearing on television talk shows seated
side-by-side in kimonos. They charmed the public with their sharp wit and
positive outlook on life.
</P>
<P>
	   Kin, whose name means ``Gold,'' lived 20 minutes away from her sister Gin,
``Silver,'' in the central Japanese city of Nagoya, 190 miles west of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The sisters celebrated their 107th birthday on Aug. 1 while traveling in
northern Japan, where they were guests of honor at a tree-planting ceremony. Kin
made the trip even though she had just been released from the hospital after
suffering from a stomach ulcer.
</P>
<P>
	   Gin contracted pneumonia two years ago, but has since made a strong
recovery.

<P>
	   PORTSMOUTH, Va. (AP) -- Harry C. Nash Jr., an Associated Press correspondent
who covered the devastation of U.S. merchant shipping off the Atlantic coast
during World War II, died Saturday. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
	   During the war, packs of German submarines lay in wait outside Virginia's
port of Hampton Roads for freighters and tankers to emerge into the Atlantic. As
the convoys entered the open sea, the subs attacked, with flashes of gunfire and
explosions often visible on land.
</P>
<P>
	   Nash recruited coastal residents to call him at such times, and then he
tracked down and interviewed survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   Born in Portsmouth, Nash began working part time for The Virginian-Pilot
while he was attending Georgetown University. He later went to work for The
Associated Press, initially in Richmond and then in Norfolk.

<P>
	   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) --Perry T. Rathbone, a former director of Boston's

Saturday after a long illness. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
	   Rathbone was the museum's director from 1955 to 1972. He resigned after a
scandal in which the museum acquired a 16th-century Raphael portrait worth an
estimated $500,000 that had been illegally smuggled out of Italy.
</P>
<P>
	   Museum officials said the resignation had nothing to do with the scandal.
Rathbone said he resigned so that a younger man could take on the ``almost
unmanageable demands'' of his job.
</P>
<P>
	   After stepping down, Rathbone joined Christie's, the London-based auction
house. He retired in 1986, but worked as a Christie's consultant until 1995.

Child Care,'' died Jan. 15 of Lou Gehrig's disease. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was a wonderful man and so helpful to many of us who care so deeply
about children,'' said Fred Rogers by telephone from Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   A professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the University of Washington,
Rothenberg was noted for integrating the two fields at Children's Hospital &AMP;
Regional Medical Center. He pioneered the practice of asking interns to examine
their own feelings about losing a patient, to help them deal more sensitively
with families.
</P>
<P>
	   He also raised early concerns about the effects of TV violence and worked
with lawmakers, schools and entertainers for children's welfare.
</P>
<P>
	   He published scores of articles, and helped Spock organize and update the
1985 and 1992 -- fifth and sixth -- editions of his child-care classic.

<HEADLINE> President Backing Equal Pay Laws  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the support of a women's soccer star, President
Clinton plans to ask Congress on Monday for $27 million to bolster federal laws
requiring that employers pay men and women equal wages for equal work.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to make sure that the employers and employees all understand their
rights and responsibilities on equal pay,'' White House Domestic Policy Adviser
Bruce Reed said Sunday. Officials also want to beef up enforcement of equal pay
laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Women earn an average of 75 cents for every dollar men are paid, a disparity
Clinton has pointed to in the past as evidence of social injustice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When a woman is denied equal pay, it doesn't just hurt her,'' he said in a
radio address last January. ``It hurts her family, and that hurts America.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was being joined at a White House event by Michelle Akers, who with
her teammates has been boycotting training in a compensation dispute that
erupted after the U.S. women's World Cup championship last season.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Millions of women who are working for less than men don't have the whole
country pulling for them the way the World Cup team does,'' Reed said. ``But
they should.''
</P>
<P>
	   As part of his $27 million initiative to close the wage gap, Clinton will
seek $10 million for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Those funds
would train as many as 3,000 employers about equal pay laws and 1,000 EEOC staff
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
	   A similar, $14 million initiative failed in Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
	   It would represent the first time since the EEOC took responsibility for
enforcement of equal pay laws in 1998 that the agency had funding to train
inspectors in the area. The EEOC also would produce public service announcements
on the subject.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Department would receive $17 million to help train women for jobs
where they have been underrepresented, particularly in the high-technology
sector, through the career centers the department supports and through
apprenticeships.
</P>
<P>
	   A portion of the Labor funding would be used to help employers improve their
pay polices and strengthen public-private partnerships.
</P>
<P>
	   Additionally, Clinton was calling on Congress to pass the so-called Paycheck
Fairness Act, sponsored by Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle and Rep. Rosa
DeLauro, D-Conn., which would strengthen laws prohibiting wage discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   The Daschle-DeLauro legislation, which failed in the last legislative
session, would direct federal agencies to collect data about wage disparities
and increase penalties for violating equal pay statutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor Secretary Alexis Herman and Ida Castro, head of the EEOC, are joining
Clinton and Akers for the announcement.
</P>

less than men who play soccer for the United States. A bargaining session is
scheduled for Monday in Los Angeles.

	   Hank Steinbrecher, executive director of the U.S. Soccer Federation, has

more to house, feed and travel.

<HEADLINE> Suspected IRA Dissident Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Police arrested a suspected Irish Republican Army
dissident late Sunday after he tried to run away from a weapons-filled car.
</P>
<P>
	   The 40-year-old man, who was not named, fled on foot when he encountered a
police roadblock near Cahir, County Tipperary, in southwest Ireland. He was
found and arrested minutes later.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said they found equipment used to make bombs, rockets and mortar
shells inside the car. They said the man arrested was suspected of involvement
in the Continuity IRA, a shadowy offshoot of the mainstream IRA that opposes the
outlawed group's 1997 truce.
</P>
<P>
	   Security forces in both parts of Ireland have been keeping leading IRA
dissidents under surveillance ever since another splinter group opposed to the
truce, the Real IRA, killed 29 people with a car bomb in the Northern Ireland
town of Omagh in 1998.

<HEADLINE> McCain Says One Campaign Is Enough  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WOLFEBORO, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain says he's having a great time
campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination, but one presidential run
is enough.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would never do this again. I'm too tired,'' McCain told reporters who
surrounded him on his campaign bus Sunday. ``I think it's fun once. I don't see
how it's fun twice.''
</P>
<P>
	   At that point, his wife Cindy, who had just gotten off a cell phone after
speaking with one of their daughters, piped up and said, ``You've got my vote.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, 63, said the campaign is ``very, very hard on our kids,'' who stay
back in the senator's home state of Arizona while he and his wife travel. McCain
has seven children, including three from a previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't get it, how people keep going back and back and back,'' said
McCain, who is serving his third term in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   A Navy veteran and former prisoner of war in Vietnam, McCain added that he
gets physically tired sometimes, and often drinks between eight and 10 cups of
coffee per day. He sipped coffee while talking with reporters Sunday, and twice
dug his hands into a giant bag of gummy bears candy.
</P>
<P>
	   As an example of the fatigue he says he sometimes suffers, McCain, who is
locked in a tight race here with Texas Gov. George W. Bush, said that when a
fire alarm sounded in his hotel early Sunday morning, he turned to his wife and
said, ``Forget about it. I'd rather burn to death.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner is planning a $20 billion merger with EMI
Records, home of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, a source familiar with the

Noboa comes into office with almost no experience in government except for 17
months as vice president -- a plus for most Ecuadoreans. It means that Noboa, an

corruption that has stained most public officials since democracy was restored

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many children with disabilities are getting substandard
schooling because states are not complying with federal rules on special
education, the National Council on Disability reports. U.S. officials are not
forcing compliance, and as a result, parents often must sue to enforce the law,
according to a review of more than two decades of enforcement of the federal
special education law. In too many cases, children with disabilities are taught
in separate classrooms and schools are not following other regulations meant to
protect these students from discrimination, said a report to be released

France To Check for Mad Cow Disease

said. Gillot said Sunday the tests would involve taking brain and bone samples
of the cows destined for human consumption, and that "tens of thousands" of
cattle would be tested. France has provoked a diplomatic spat by keeping in
place a ban on beef from Britain, where mad cow disease -- or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy -- originated in 1996. In August, the European Union declared
that beef from Britain was again safe for import, but France angered its

<HEADLINE> Open season on coyotes begins Jan. 29.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) - About 800 hunters are expected to take aim at
coyotes when the state begins its fourth annual coyote hunt on Saturday, but
despite a growing coyote population, wildlife officials say the purpose of the
hunt is purely recreational.
<P>
	   From Jan. 29 to Feb. 13, licensed coyote hunters will be able to shoot the
animal.
</P>
<P>
	   "We place the coyote population at 1,500, but they're growing so fast that
the figure might be outdated," Robert Lund told The Record of Hackensack for
Sunday's editions. Lund is a wildlife research scientist for the state Division
of Fish and Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
	   Complaints about coyotes roaming the state have risen from 25 in 1997 to 84
in 1999, but officials say the 16-day hunting season is for recreational
purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   For $2.50, hunters can receive a license, but they must use shotguns,
muzzle-loading rifles or bows and arrows to hunt the animal. And hunters must
remain on state land or private property of they receive the owner's permission.
</P>
<P>
	   If anyone has cause to want coyotes dead, it would be Mildred Rathie of
Boonton, who is an opponent of the hunting season. When a coyote attacked her
neighbor's dog on Sept. 15, Rathie grabbed a stick to chase off the coyote. The
coyote then lunged at the stick, knocking Rathie to the ground. She broke four
bones in her foot.
</P>
<P>
	   "I couldn't get up," Rathie said. "I started to yell, but he kept coming at
me and biting me, and I was beginning to lose my strength."
</P>
<P>
	   A neighbor heard the commotion and chased away the coyote.
</P>
<P>
	   But Rathie won't take part in the 16-day hunt.
</P>
<P>
	   "Coyotes just do what they have to do to survive," she said. "They're not
good for food, so why shoot them?"
</P>
<P>
	   Experts say coyotes are more likely to attack dogs than humans. Rathie's
attack was the second recorded in the state, with the first recorded in 1990 on
a Wayne golf course.
</P>
<P>
	   Several weeks after Rathie's attack, Boonton police killed two coyotes, one
with a broken leg and one with mange.
</P>
<P>
	   "Coyotes normally stay out of sight," said Robert Eriksen, a biologist for
the state Division of Fish and Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
	   The coyote that attacked Rathie, he said, "appeared young, healthy and
unusually aggressive."
</P>
<P>
	   "I know I would have been killed if that coyote had the help of a pack, but
I still love those animals," Rathie said.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Angered By Negative Phoning  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT LINDLAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Republican presidential contender Steve Forbes said
Sunday that a Republican group with ties to rival George W. Bush is coordinating
a negative telephone campaign against him. The effort proves he is ``a real
threat to the political establishment,'' Forbes said on the eve of Iowa's
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   The group, the Republican Leadership Council, acknowledged it called
supporters for eight days, ending Friday, to remind them that ``Steve Forbes has
a history of negative attack ads and negative campaigning.'' Forbes said his
campaign has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Callers who responded favorably to the RLC's warning were patched straight
through to Forbes' Iowa headquarters or were urged to call the campaign
directly, said RLC communications director Matt Well. The RLC conducted a
similar effort in New Hampshire, Well said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to remind Steve Forbes that (negative) ads only tear down the
Republican Party,'' Well said. ``We asked them if they would like to voice in
their own words to the Forbes campaign how they felt about his negative ads, to
ask the Forbes campaign to run a clean campaign on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, the Forbes campaign acknowledged it was calling Bush
supporters in Iowa to try to sway them at the 11th hour. One resident who said
he received such a call, Brad Trow, a Bush precinct leader, said he considered
the appeal ``negative calling.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the caller identified himself as a Forbes campaign representative
and said Bush had broken a pledge not to raise taxes in Texas. ``They are not
pushing their candidate, they are trying to push negative information about
other candidates,'' Trow said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes campaign manager Bill Dal Col confirmed the campaign was calling Bush
supporters Sunday night on four issues: taxes, education, Social Security and
abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not negative phoning,'' Dal Col said, adding that the Forbes campaign
was ``not saying so and so is a jerk like the RLC is. These are respectful and
straightforward.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes was criticized in 1996 for a series of hard-hitting ads that
Republicans said undermined the campaign of eventual nominee Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes said after a rally at Iowa State University that the weeklong
campaign was really the work of the Bush campaign, and characterized the RLC as
a ``pro-abortion, liberal organization.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sadly, it's a typical procedure of the Republican establishment,'' Forbes
told reporters. ``I think that underscores that we're a very real threat to the
political establishment, that we are gaining real strength here. ... I'm sad to
see that it's happening again, but I'm not surprised at all.''
</P>
<P>
	   Well said about 70 percent of the RLC's advisory board supports Bush, but
said the group decided to conduct the phone effort without conferring with
Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the Bush campaign had nothing to do with
the RLC calls and only calls Iowa voters to ask them to support Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes said Dal Col has filed a complaint with the FEC accusing the Bush
campaign and the RLC of improper coordination.
</P>
<P>
	   The Forbes campaign received about 200 such calls directed to it from the
RLC, Dal Col said. He said the calls -- about 20 a day -- did not hamper the
campaign, but were a nuisance.

<HEADLINE> Rams, Titans Head to Suber Bowl  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE GOLDBERG AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The first person Tennessee's Jeff Fisher should call when he begins his
Super Bowl game plan is Tony Dungy.
</P>
<P>
	   For obvious reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   Dungy's Buccaneers were the first team this season to go into St. Louis and
all but shut down the Rams. St. Louis averaged 36 points in the Trans World Dome
during the season. The Rams scored 11 to beat Tampa Bay on Sunday in the NFC
Championship and needed a fabulous catch by journeyman Ricky Proehl, their
least-heralded receiver, to do it.
</P>
<P>
	   If nothing else, Tampa Bay's performance against the Rams gives the Titans a
psychological boost by proving that good defense can bother Kurt Warner and
control Marshall Faulk.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams and Titans have already met, with Tennessee winning 24-21 in
Nashville on Halloween, St. Louis' first loss.
</P>
<P>
	   But it wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans jumped off to a 21-0 first-quarter lead, then stopped, playing
their usual conservative game while sitting on the lead. They got a
third-quarter field goal and that was it -- they avoided overtime only when Jeff
Wilkins missed a 38-yard field-goal attempt that would have tied it in the
waning seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   One factor in the Rams' favor at the Super Bowl in Atlanta: It will be in a
dome, on artificial turf. The Rams were 10-0 at home -- in a dome, on artificial
turf. The Rams even won at the Georgia Dome this season, beating the Falcons
41-13.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, Tennessee matches up well with St. Louis, particularly on
defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Just as the Bucs harried Kurt Warner into three interceptions, the Titans
got two picks off Mark Brunell and six turnovers altogether. They also got their
sixth safety in 19 games, forced when Jevon Kearse occupied two blockers and
allowed Jason Fisk and Josh Evans to sack Brunell in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee also has more offense than Tampa Bay -- Steve McNair has four
years of experience on Shaun King, who tried but couldn't rally the Bucs in the
final minutes. The Titans also have Eddie George, who is more explosive than
Mike Alstott and more powerful than Warrick Dunn, the Bucs' two offensive
weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay's defense is probably tougher than Tennessee's.
</P>
<P>
	   But this is a neutral field, and Tennessee fans travel well, particularly
with Atlanta only four hours from Nashville.
</P>
<P>
	   It probably means a pretty good Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   And the score won't be 2-0, which might happened if the Bucs had won the NFC
title.

<P>
	   KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) -- George Archer won the MasterCard Championship
for the second time in 10 years, closing with a 3-under-par 69 on Sunday for a
two-stroke victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Archer, 60, who began the round three strokes behind leader Graham Marsh,
took the lead with an eagle on the 538-yard seventh hole, and birdied two other
par-5s.
</P>

Marsh shot a 74 to tie for second with Lee Trevino, Hale Irwin and Dana Quigley,
who all had 72s.

<P>
	   Archer earned $199,000 for his 19th senior victory, and first since the 1998
First of America Classic. He won 12 times on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
	   Marsh dropped four strokes on the front nine in windy conditions, and had to
birdie the closing hole to join the group at 209.
</P>
<P>
	   First-round leader John Jacobs (73) and Hubert Green (70) tied for sixth at
211, and Jim Colbert (74) and Vicente Fernandez (71) followed at 212.

back at 10-over 226.

</P>
<P>
	   Dungy's Buccaneers were the first team this season to go into St. Louis and
all but shut down the Rams. St. Louis averaged 36 points in the Trans World Dome
during the season. The Rams scored 11 to beat Tampa Bay on Sunday in the NFC
Championship and needed a fabulous catch by journeyman Ricky Proehl, their
least-heralded receiver, to do it.
</P>
<P>
	   If nothing else, Tampa Bay's performance against the Rams gives the Titans a
psychological boost by proving that good defense can bother Kurt Warner and
control Marshall Faulk.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis opened as an 8-point favorite in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams and Titans have already met, with Tennessee winning 24-21 in
Nashville on Halloween, St. Louis' first loss.
</P>
<P>
	   But it wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans jumped off to a 21-0 first-quarter lead, then stopped, playing
their usual conservative game while sitting on the lead. They got a
third-quarter field goal and that was it -- they avoided overtime only when Jeff
Wilkins missed a 38-yard field-goal attempt that would have tied it in the
waning seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   One factor in the Rams' favor at the Super Bowl in Atlanta: It will be in a
dome, on artificial turf. The Rams were 10-0 at home -- in a dome, on artificial
turf. The Rams even won at the Georgia Dome this season, beating the Falcons
41-13.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, Tennessee matches up well with St. Louis, particularly on
defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Just as the Bucs harried Kurt Warner into three interceptions, the Titans
got two picks off Mark Brunell and six turnovers altogether. They also got their
sixth safety in 19 games, forced when Jevon Kearse occupied two blockers and
allowed Jason Fisk and Josh Evans to sack Brunell in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee also has more offense than Tampa Bay -- Steve McNair has four
years of experience on Shaun King, who tried but couldn't rally the Bucs in the
final minutes. The Titans also have Eddie George, who is more explosive than
Mike Alstott and more powerful than Warrick Dunn, the Bucs' two offensive
weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay's defense is probably tougher than Tennessee's.
</P>
<P>
	   But this is a neutral field, and Tennessee fans travel well, particularly
with Atlanta only four hours from Nashville.
</P>
<P>
	   It probably means a pretty good Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   And the score won't be 2-0, which might happened if the Bucs had won the NFC
title.

<HEADLINE> Rams 11, Buccaneers 6  </HEADLINE>
    By BARRY WILNER AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The Midwest Express offense came alive just in time.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurt Warner threw a 30-yard touchdown pass to Ricky Proehl with 4:44 to go
Sunday, lifting the mistake-prone St. Louis Rams to an 11-6 victory over the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC Championship.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams, who struggled all day on offense, rode their unheralded defense
and Warner's late heroics to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   They will play Tennessee, which won the AFC crown in Jacksonville 33-14. The
Titans beat the Rams in Nashville during the regular season, 24-21, but St.
Louis opens as an 8-point favorite for next Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa's gallant defensive effort wasn't enough against the Rams because
backup cornerback Brian Kelly couldn't stay with Proehl down the left sideline
on the long third-down pass.
</P>
<P>
	   Proehl, the Rams' No. 4 wide receiver, leaped to haul in his first touchdown
of the season. He finished with six catches for 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you are every going to bet on someone coming up with a big play, bet on
Ricky Proehl," Rams coach Dick Vermeil said.
</P>
<P>
	   The winning score was set up when Bucs rookie quarterback Shaun King was
picked off by another rookie, cornerback Dre' Bly, at midfield.
</P>
<P>
	   Bly brought the ball to the Tampa Bay 47 and the league's highest-scoring
offense (526 points during the season, 49 in last week's playoff victory over
Minnesota) finally got into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Rams had to survive a last-ditch march on which they got two of
their five sacks on King, who still managed to lead the Bucs to the St. Louis
22.
</P>
<P>
	   A video review that overturned an 11-yard reception by Bert Emanuel to
offset a sack hurt Tampa Bay with 47 seconds remaining. King then threw two
incompletions, and the sellout crowd reached supersonic noise levels in the
Trans World Dome.
</P>
<P>
	   "We knew we had to patient. They have a tendency to force you to do things
you don't normally do," said running back Marshall Faulk, the NFL Offensive
Player of the Year. "They have a great pass rush and play their safeties deep.
We had to go underneath and grind it out against them."
</P>
<P>
	   It helped that Tampa Bay was more inept on offense than the usually
quick-striking Rams. The Bucs only gained 203 yards; the Rams had 309, 91 below
their regular-season average.
</P>
<P>
	   That brought the battle into the trenches, with the Rams holding the Bucs to
Martin Grammatica's two field goals, while they got one field goal, a safety off
a poor snap, and Warner's dramatic strike to Proehl.
</P>
<P>
	   At the end, as the players gathered around a stage for the trophy
presentation, the cheering never abated.
</P>
<P>
	   Bly waved a victory towel as he raced around the field, while other Rams
simply hugged and reveled in their first trip to the Super Bowl since the 1979
season, when they played in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Yes, the team with the worst record of the 1990s heading into this season
will play for the NFL championship next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   As for the powerhouse offense that dominated the NFC this season, it
sputtered in the face of Tampa's speedy, physical defense.
</P>
<P>
	   League MVP Warner was stymied by the Bucs' zone and heavy pressure. He
finished 26-for-43 for 258 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner often threw behind receivers, including on a critical interception by
Hardy Nickerson at the Tampa 3 in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, Warner was picked off three times as the Bucs tamed an attack that
romped past nearly everyone else.
</P>
<P>
	   Faulk, who set an NFL record with 2,429 yards from scrimmage this season,
was held to 44 yards rushing on 17 carries and three catches for 5 yards. A
combination of All-Pro linebacker Derrick Brooks and Faulk's own hesitancy made
him look ordinary.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucs' offense was ordinary, as expected. But it was enough to build a
late lead as rookie Grammatica kicked field goals on the first series of each
half for Tampa Bay, which brought a 132-246-1 all-time record into its second
conference title game.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one gave us a chance, but we came here to win and thought we were going
to win," Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy said. "They made the plays in the fourth
quarter."
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucs lost to the Rams 9-0 in the 1979 NFC Championship, their only other
trip this far. The Rams then lost to the Steelers in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The staunch defenses turned it into a game of punting and turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay got a takeaway on the first play when defensive end Steve White
tipped and intercepted an attempted screen pass. A drop in the end zone by
Jacquez Green made the Bucs settle for Grammatica's 25-yard field goal and a
surprisingly quick lead.
</P>
<P>
	   But that was all they would get in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   King was sacked and fumbled, losing 12 yards, on one Tampa Bay drive. That
ruined an opportunity for another field goal. And with 11 seconds to go in the
second quarter, his pass from the St. Louis 41 went directly to cornerback Todd
Lyght.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis was more effective moving the ball, but no better at reaching the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
	   After Grammatica's kick, the Rams put together one of their typical drives,
but it yielded only three points. They marched 74 yards in 16 plays and ate up
nearly eight minutes before a fumbled exchange between Warner and Faulk made
them settle for Jeff Wilkins' 24-yarder to tie it.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilkins, kicking with a sore knee, also missed a 44-yarder.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis had a 159-75 yardage edge through 30 minutes. Yet it led only 5-3,
thanks to a high snap by Pro Bowl center Tony Mayberry with King in the shotgun.
</P>
<P>
	   But King, who finished 13-of-29 for 126 yards, scrambled back to knock the
ball out of the end zone for the safety.
</P>
<P>
	   Just as they did to open the game, the Bucs scored on their first possession
of the second half. Grammatica nailed a 23-yarder, set up when Green made a
32-yard reception and Taje Allen was hit with a facemask penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   The 6-5 lead stood far longer than anyone could have expected. In the end,
though, St. Louis found its touch. Just once, but that was enough.

<HEADLINE> Source: Time Warner, EMI To Merge  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner, which just two weeks ago announced a $145
billion merger with America Online, is expected to reveal plans Monday to merge
its music division with EMI Records, which has rights to stars such as the
Beatles and the Rolling Stones.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal would be worth some $20 billion, a source familiar with details
told The Associated Press. The formal announcement will be made in London, said
the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   London-based EMI confirmed Sunday that it is in the final stages of
negotiations and said an announcement is forthcoming. Time Warner in New York
also acknowledged the talks, but spokesman Edward Adler said, "No deal has been
signed."
</P>
<P>
	   The deal, if approved by regulators and shareholders, would likely be a
boost for music sales over the Internet. Both Warner and EMI have been testing
ways to let customers digitally download music via their computers.
</P>
<P>
	   The new company would have a very captive audience with America Online's 20
million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
	   The merged company, to be called Warner EMI Music, would be the
second-largest music company with more than $8 billion in annual sales. Only
Seagram's Universal Music would be bigger.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement could draw fire from critics who worry that lack of
competition will diminish diversity and put too much control in the hands of the
four industry titans: Universal Music, Warner-EMI, Sony and Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
	   EMI brings to the deal the Virgin, Priority and Capitol record labels --
including names like the Spice Girls, Van Morrison and Frank Sinatra. Time
Warner contributes its Atlantic, Elektra and Warner Brothers labels that include
Cher, Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, Madonna, Metallica and REM.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the source, the negotiations between Warner and EMI started
before powerbrokers discussed Time Warner's deal with America Online. Roger
Ames, chairman of Warner Music Group, approached his longtime friend Ken Berry,
head of EMI's music division, in the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   The two structured a deal in which Warner will pay EMI shareholders about $1
billion, or about $1.65 a share, in exchange for 50 percent ownership in the
combined company, the source said. Warner also will have six seats on the new
board of directors, and EMI will have five.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger is expected to close in about a year.
</P>
<P>
	   This "represents an opportunity to establish the world's premier music group
and to create very considerable value for shareholders of both companies," EMI
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Ames will be the chief executive officer and Berry will be chief operating
officer. Time Warner President Richard Parsons and EMI Group's Chairman Eric
Nicoli, will be co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger comes at a crucial time for Warner and EMI.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner Music's earnings fell from $288 million in the first nine months of
1998 to $279 million for the same period in 1999. EMI has been recovering from
difficulties of its own, but in the six months ending in September last year,
profits were up by 61 percent to $108 million compared to the same period the
year before.
</P>
<P>
	   By linking their operations, Warner EMI will shave $400 million in costs
over three years, the source said.

<HEADLINE> Hopkins' House Said Damaged in Fire  </HEADLINE>

<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- A fire damaged the London house of actor Sir Anthony Hopkins
on Sunday, the Sun newspaper reported. No one was in the house at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Flames badly damaged a third-floor bedroom of the four-story brick row house
in the Knightsbridge district of London, the London Fire Brigade said.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the brigade would not confirm who owned the house but said
the photos inside and the presence of an Oscar statuette indicated it was the
home of Hopkins, who won a best actor Academy Award for his portrayal of
Hannibal Lecter in the 1991 film "Silence of the Lambs."
</P>
<P>
	   The Sun reported that it was Hopkins' house.
</P>
<P>
	   No one was home when the fire broke out, but firefighters said the actor's
wife returned as they fought the blaze. It was not immediately known where
Hopkins was.
</P>
<P>
	   A neighbor reported the fire at 1:09 p.m., and firefighters had it
controlled by 1:43 p.m., the fire brigade said.

<HEADLINE> New Auto Technology Worries Feds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- Automakers' plans to stock vehicles with computers,
real-time traffic reports, hands-free cell phones and voice-activated e-mail has
some federal regulators worried that the gadgets could lead to more crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal safety officials say early studies show that any distraction -- let
alone the multimedia electronic extravaganza touted by automakers -- could be
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're trying to understand how these technologies can influence safety. At
this point we don't have many answers," Michael Goodman, a researcher at the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, told The Detroit News for a
story published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Automakers, however, say the high-tech gadgets are simply the next phase of
the communication revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the wired age," Ford Motor Co. design guru J Mays said. "It is
about connecting, linking up, communicating."
</P>
<P>
	   Roughly a quarter of the 7 million crashes that occurred in 1995 involved
some form of inattention, NHTSA estimates. About 143,000 of the collisions were
tied to manipulating the audio system.
</P>
<P>
	   Automakers are moving toward hands-free, voice-activated technology that
will allow drivers to talk on the phone, browse the World Wide Web or use
satellite navigation systems without taking their eyes off the road or their
hands off the wheel.
</P>
<P>
	   But NHTSA officials remain concerned. Regulators worry that the hassle-free
electronics will encourage people to use the devices more often and for longer
periods.
</P>
<P>
	   Auto executives concede that questions remain about the safety of
voice-activated, hands-free devices. But they say -- and regulators agree --
that the technology is safer than punching the key pad of a hand-held phone,
cradling a phone between your face and shoulder or reading stock quotes off a
phone's screen.
</P>
<P>
	   And it's safer to use voice commands to direct the navigation routing device
of a car than to manually enter your destination into the system, they add.
</P>
<P>
	   Lisa Ihde, manager of wireless education programs at the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry, said overcoming the safety hurdles requires common
sense and education, not government mandates.
</P>
<P>
	   "Safety fears are a larger issue than just wireless phones," Ms. Ihde said.
"We scan maps, we eat, we listen to the radio, we tend to kids in the back seat.
We do all sorts of things."

<HEADLINE> Andrew Cuomo says he might be in the hunt for governor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SAVANNAH, N.Y. (AP) - Federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo bagged a
couple of pheasants during a hunting expedition on Sunday, then trained his
sights on the future.
<P>
	   "I want to focus on the presidential (election), then look at all the
options," Cuomo said after an afternoon outing with Assembly Majority Leader
Michael Bragman and Buffalo-area Assemblyman Dick Smith at a 5,000-acre wildlife
preserve owned by mall developer Robert Congel. "An option that I would take a
serious look at is coming back and running for governor. That's whether or not
(Al) Gore wins. I've been in Washington. I've been there for seven years. New
York is home. I want to come back to New York. The only question is when. I've
made no commitments and no promises, so I'll reassess everything after
November."
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo, a staunch proponent of developing the Erie Canal into a tourist
mecca, didn't hesitate in assessing the performance of Republican George Pataki,
who is halfway through his second four-year term as governor and, with more than
$2.3 million on hand, considering another run.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going on six years now, and the upstate New York economy is not doing
well, period," said Cuomo, the eldest son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo. "The
upstate economy is doing better than it was - no kidding - because the whole
national economy is doing better. Every state is up. The question is relative
progress, and when you look at the relative progress of upstate New York, it's
depressing."
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo said that if upstate were analyzed as a state, without including New
York City, it would rank 48th in economic growth. "To the extent that state
numbers are getting better, it's only New York City," he said. "Wall Street."
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo's interest in following his father, who served three terms before
losing to Pataki in 1994, could pit him against state Comptroller Carl McCall,
the only black ever elected to statewide office in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall considered challenging Pataki in 1998 but backed down in the face of
the governor's healthy poll numbers and bulging campaign bank account.
Ironically, Bragman is leading an advisory committee to help promote McCall's
potential candidacy, while Andrew Cuomo has yet to form a state campaign
committee and has not begun raising money for a possible gubernatorial campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is way premature," Cuomo said. "This is three years away. You don't
know who's going to run, you don't know what the circumstances are going to be,
and I don't even think it's productive to engage this race this early. There's a
lot between here and there. I don't think anything that divides the Democratic
Party is a good thing now. We have the luxury of basic unity as a party, which
we don't have often. Let's stay unified."
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo, Bragman, Smith and Congel all were unified in one thing - their
support of the Erie Canal.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have a passion to see the upstate New York economy improve to where it
should be, and I've always admired the Erie Canal," said Congel, whose Pyramid
Cos. have developed more than 20 malls in the Northeast. "We have a
multimillion-dollar infrastructure that functions that just isn't utilized. I
believe it would be a gigantic economic boom for all of upstate New York, and I
have a passion to see it happen. All that needs to be done is to market it
properly."
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo, as HUD secretary, is threatening to sue gun manufacturers unless they
adopt a code of conduct and take other steps to keep guns away from kids and
criminals. But he said he saw no conflict in donning camouflage on this wintry
day and grabbing his 12-gauge Remington shotgun for the hunt near the Montezuma
Wildlife Refuge west of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
	   "I enjoy the outdoors," he said. "I consider myself a sportsman. I enjoy
hunting, I enjoy fishing. It's a very important part of our heritage. I think
it's something that we have to recognize and respect and nurture, and I'm proud
of it. I'm also pro gun safety and pro the intelligent marketing and
distribution of guns. But the two are not inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can be a hunter, a conservationist, and a Democrat. Just because you
are pro gun safety doesn't mean you're anti-gun."

<HEADLINE> Rams a 7-Point Super Bowl Favorite  </HEADLINE>
    By TIM DAHLBERG AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- For a few short weeks before the NFL season began, bettors
could get 200-1 odds on the St. Louis Rams winning the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   What a difference 18 games makes.
</P>
<P>
	   A team that faced long odds before the first game kickoff is now a touchdown
favorite in this city's sports books to win its first Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Rams and Titans? Give me a break," said Jay Kornegay, sports book
manager at the Imperial Palace. "Basically it sums up the entire NFL year.
Everything has been flip-flopped."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams opened as 8-point favorites, but minutes after the their 11-6
come-from-behind win over Tampa Bay 11-6, most books quickly lowered it to 7 1/2
or 7 as money came in on the underdogs. The over/under was 49 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis had been a 14-point favorite over Tampa Bay and failed to cover
the point spread, while Tennessee was a 7-point underdog to Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
	   "The most ideal matchup for bettors would have been St. Louis and
Jacksonville, but at least we got one of them in," Kornegay said. "A Tampa
Bay-Tennessee Super Bowl might have been a disaster."
</P>
<P>
	   Early in the preseason, bettors could get 100-1 odds on the Rams winning the
Super Bowl at most Las Vegas sports books. After quarterback Trent Green was
injured late in the preseason, the odds jumped to 200-1.
</P>
<P>
	   Not many bettors bit, but enough did to make some Las Vegas sports books a
bit uneasy over next Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Imperial Palace, Kornegay said three bettors put money on the Rams
when they were 200-1 in the future book.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd like to be in their shoes right now," Kornegay said. "But we'll end up
all right on it. I know there are some books that are sweating out a win by the
Rams."
</P>
<P>
	   Jason Been, an oddsmaker for Las Vegas Sports Consultants, said he actually
made the Rams an 8-point favorite as the clock ticked down in the final
conference championship game before lowering it.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just early money moving it a bit," Been said.
</P>
<P>
	   The line isn't expected to fluctuate much this week because it is right
around a touchdown, which is one of the magical number lines in oddsmaking.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, gamblers wagered $75,986,520 on the Super Bowl in this state's
legal sports books. Untold millions, or even billions, were wagered illegally
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   Bookies kept $2.9 million of that money last year, a 3.8 percent hold.

<HEADLINE> Longshot Wins Santa Ynez Stakes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Penny Blues, a 15-1 longshot owned by actors Don
Johnson and James Gammon, won Sunday's $106,000 Santa Ynez Stakes by 1 1/4
lengths over Classic Olympio.
</P>
<P>
	Cash Run, the 9-10 favorite, was never a serious factor in finishing fourth.
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye and carrying 118 pounds, Penny Blues covered seven
furlongs in 1:23 1-5 and paid $32.20, $8.40 and $5.20.
</P>
<P>
	The win was the third in six lifetime starts for Penny Blues, the longest shot
in a field of five, and was worth $63,600, raising the career earnings of the
3-year-old Florida-daughter of Pentelicus to $123,600 for Johnson and Gammon,
co-stars of the television series ``Nash Bridges.''
</P>
<P>
	Classic Olympio, the 2-1 second-favorite ridden by Alex Solis and carrying 121
pounds, crossed the finish line eight lengths in front of Mean Imogene and
returned $4 and $4.
</P>
<P>
	Mean Imogene, ridden by Kent Desormeaux and carrying 117 pounds, was 3 1/2
lengths ahead of Cash Run at the wire and paid $3.80 to show.
</P>
<P>
	Gilded Diablo finished last in the 49th running of the race for 3-year-old
fillies. Qui's Fair Lady was scratched.

<HEADLINE> Titans 33, Jaguars 14  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE GOLDBERG AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The once-homeless Tennessee Titans never felt so
cozy on the road. And they're not done traveling yet.
</P>
<P>
	   Next stop: the Super Bowl in Atlanta against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   America's wandering waifs, who have played in four stadiums in three cities
in four seasons, upset the Jacksonville Jaguars 33-14 on Sunday behind the
scrambling of Steve McNair and a defense that forced six turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans trailed 14-10 at the half but scored 16 points in about 4 1/2
minutes in the third quarter to pull away.
</P>
<P>
	   It's the first Super Bowl trip ever for the franchise that began in the old
AFL in 1960. The Rams, who beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 11-6 for the NFC title,
opened as 8-point favorites.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's about time," said Titans owner Bud Adams, who founded the franchise in
Houston then moved it after the 1995 season when he couldn't get money for a new
stadium.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm getting pretty old. I didn't want to go to the Super Bowl in a
wheelchair."
</P>
<P>
	   McNair almost had to use a wheelchair before the game. He spent much of the
week wearing a boot to protect an injured toe and hid the pain as well as he
could.
</P>
<P>
	   "At one point during the week he couldn't even touch his toe without it
killing him," tight end Frank Wycheck said. "For him to go out and have the day
he did is just unbelievable. He's a leader who leads by example and we follow
him."
</P>
<P>
	   There was little pain in McNair's stats -- except to the Jags, who won 15
games this year and lost just three, all to the Titans.
</P>
<P>
	   McNair ran nine times for 91 yards, including a 49-yard scramble to set up
one of his two 1-yard sneaks for touchdowns. He also had a 9-yard touchdown pass
in the first quarter to Yancey Thigpen, who left in the second quarter with a
broken toe. The Titans also lost safety Marcus Robertson with a broken ankle.
</P>
<P>
	   This was the third step in a long, strange trip to the Super Bowl for
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans won their first playoff game on the most improbable of plays -- a
lateral by Wycheck on a kickoff return that Kevin Dyson took 75 yards for the
winning touchdown against Buffalo with three seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Tennessee shut down Peyton Manning and the high-powered Colts and
won 19-16 in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
	   And this week they continued their mastery over the Jags, who had the NFL's
best regular-season record at 14-2 and crushed Miami 62-7 in their first playoff
game last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee won Sunday as it has all season: a little offense, a lot of
defense, and a big contribution from special teams. All of it turned during the
16-point spurt in 4 minutes, 28 seconds in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   It began with a six-play, 76-yard drive that ended on the go-ahead touchdown
on a sneak by McNair.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty-three of the yards came on penalties -- 15 on a roughing the passer
call when McNair somehow ducked out of a 10-yard sack by Kevin Hardy, rolled
left and completed a 15-yard pass to Eddie George.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't play sloppy in a game like this and win," said Jacksonville tight
end Kyle Brady, who caught a touchdown pass but fumbled twice.
</P>
<P>
	   Brady's first fumble came on the next sequence. Jason Fisk recovered at the
Jaguars 35, then Wycheck returned the favor by fumbling back to the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
	   Two plays later, Fisk and Josh Evans sacked Mark Brunell in the end zone for
a safety, and it was 19-14. It was the sixth safety this season for Tennessee
and second in the playoffs, an NFL record.
</P>
<P>
	   It also set up seven more points: On the ensuing free kick, Derrick Mason,
who earlier set up a score with a 44-yard kickoff return, went 80 yards for a TD
to make it 26-14.
</P>
<P>
	   "It seemed like everything clicked and we took over the game then," Evans
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee's trip to the Super Bowl next Sunday follows three straight 8-8
seasons, one in Houston, one in Memphis and the third and Vanderbilt Stadium in
Nashville. This year, in their new home at Adelphia Coliseum, they went 13-3 and
qualified as a wild card, a game behind Jacksonville in the AFC Central even
though they beat the Jaguars twice.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans' success is especially remarkable considering how close they came
to losing in the wild-card game against Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never thought that it would happen -- reaching the Super Bowl," said
Bruce Matthews, the 17-year veteran who has played his entire career with the
Oilers-Titans and holds the record for most games played by an offensive lineman
(264).
</P>
<P>
	   The win was sweet for all the veterans, who have played in empty stadiums
before apathetic crowds and had played mediocre football for most of a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   "I kind of sold myself on the idea that it wasn't that important," Matthews
said. "To watch other teams playing the championships and going to the Super
Bowl every year, you build up a barrier more than anything. But it's nice."
</P>
<P>
	   The defeat was a huge disappointment for Jacksonville. While the Jaguars
have made the playoffs in four straight years -- they missed them only as an
expansion team in 1995 -- they now have lost twice in the AFC title game.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't expect this to happen," said coach Tom Coughlin, who was
especially dismayed about McNair's escape act -- several times the quarterback
seemed hopelessly trapped for a sack before escaping.
</P>
<P>
	   When someone asked Coughlin how this happened, he snapped back:
</P>
<P>
	   "When the quarterback comes out of it when he should be on his back. That's
how it happens."
</P>
<P>
	   Jacksonville started strong, going 62 yards in five plays to score on a
7-yard pass from Brunell to Brady. But the Titans answered right back, going 51
yards in nine plays after Mason's 44-yard kickoff return to tie it on 9-yard
pass to Thigpen.
</P>
<P>
	   Both teams threw interceptions in scoring position -- Fernando Bryant picked
off a McNair pass on his 23 early in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jaguars then drove all the way to the Tennessee 6, but Robertson dived
in front of Damon Jones to pick off a Brunell pass to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacksonville scored on its next possession, another quick drive that
emphasized the 1-2 ground punch. One play after Taylor gained 9 yards to set up
a second-and-1, Stewart raced 33 yards to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
	   Al Del Greco capped the first half scoring with a 34-yard field goal after
Reggie Barlow fumbled a punt and Steve Jackson recovered for the Titans. That
made it 14-10.
</P>
<P>
	   Then came the deluge.
</P>
<P>
	   "They won the game and they deserve all the credit given to them," said
defensive tackle Gary Walker, who joined Jacksonville as a free agent this
season after wandering through Texas and Tennessee with the Titans.
</P>
<P>
	   "To go through what they've gone through -- to finally get a home -- they
just deserve a lot of credit."

<HEADLINE> Cruise, Jolie Win at Golden Globes  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Tom Cruise of "Magnolia" and Angelina Jolie of
"Girl, Interrupted" won motion picture supporting actor honors at Sunday's
Golden Globe awards.
</P>
<P>
	   And a poignant moment came when Michael J. Fox was named best actor for the
TV comedy "Spin City," which he announced he is leaving because of his fight
against Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
	   "Actor out of work -- news at 11," Fox said jokingly.
</P>
<P>
	   "Wow. God, I didn't expect this," Cruise said, then thanked wife Nicole
Kidman, who couldn't attend because of work. "Her generosity, her support, her
sacrifices, her talent -- she inspires me."
</P>
<P>
	   Cruise played a TV guru who pitches a "seduce-and-destroy" program to men in
the ensemble drama "Magnolia."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's great to see the view from up here," said Jolie, who plays a manic
sociopath in "Girl, Interrupted." "The experience of it just being with people
and being together and exposing ourselves to each other."
</P>
<P>
	   Sarah Jessica Parker of "Sex and the City" won best actress in a TV musical
or comedy series.
</P>
<P>
	   American Beauty" was the leading movie contender going into Sunday night's
57th Golden Globes, which can serve as a signpost to what will come at the
Oscars. The dark suburban fable gained six Golden Globe nominations, including
best dramatic picture, dramatic actress for Annette Bening, and dramatic actor
for Kevin Spacey.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Talented Mr. Ripley," a tale of social envy that turns to murder, was
close behind with five bids, as was "The Insider," based on the story of
tobacco-industry whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand.
</P>
<P>
	   The leading television nominees were the mob drama "The Sopranos" and the
risque comedy "Sex and the City," with five bids each.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC broadcast this year's awards, selected by reporters from the Hollywood
Foreign Press Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Other top nominees included the films "The End of the Affair" and "Being
John Malkovich," which held four nominations each. Films with three bids
included "The Hurricane" and "Notting Hill."
</P>
<P>
	   "Boys Don't Cry," "The Straight Story," "Man on the Moon," "Analyze This,"
"Toy Story 2," "An Ideal Husband," "Sweet and Lowdown," "The Cider House Rules,"
"Magnolia," "Anna and the King" and "The Sixth Sense" had two bids each.
</P>
<P>
	   Barbra Streisand, winner of more Golden Globe trophies than any other
entertainer, including best actress for "Funny Girl" and "A Star is Born," was
to receive the Cecil B. DeMille Award for "outstanding contribution to the
entertainment field."
</P>
<P>
	   Some movies that received awards buzz were largely ignored. They included
"The Green Mile" starring Tom Hanks, "Anna and the King" with Jodie Foster, and
"Angela's Ashes" starring Emily Watson. Stanley Kubrick's final film, "Eyes Wide
Shut," received just one nomination, for best score.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden Globe shows have come to be known for bordering on the giddy.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, Jack Nicholson delivered a salty acceptance speech, Ving
Rhames bestowed his statue on Jack Lemmon and Christine Lahti took the stage
with toilet paper on her shoe, a reference to the year she was in the ladies'
room when her trophy was announced.
</P>
<P>
	   The awards have gained in prestige, overlapping to an extent with the
Academy Award bids to be announced next month.
</P>
<P>
	   But they once were viewed with suspicion because of allegations of corrupt
voting and questionable professionalism.
</P>
<P>
	   The low point came in 1981, when Pia Zadora was given a statue for the bomb
"Butterfly" and networks refused to show the program. After an effort to regain
respectability, the ceremony was welcomed back by television in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, association members quickly returned pricey watches sent to them
by the company that released the Sharon Stone comedy "The Muse."
</P>
<P>
	   "We are not stupid," said association president Helmut Voss. The awards
bring the group $2 million in income and members wouldn't endanger that by
casting doubt on their integrity, he said.

<HEADLINE> New Ecuador President A Novice  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador's new president, Gustavo Noboa, comes into
office with almost no experience in government except for 17 months as vice
president.
</P>
<P>
	   That's a plus for most Ecuadoreans.
</P>
<P>
	   It means that Noboa, an academic and former university rector, has not been
contaminated by the corruption that has stained most public officials since
democracy was restored to this small Andean nation two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Well aware of public outrage over corrupt governments, Noboa stressed in his
first remarks as president that his priority would be to bring dishonest
officials to justice. He said he is prepared to fight to extradite them from
abroad, where many have fled after looting the public coffers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He won't tolerate corruption. That is something that characterizes him. He
has never acquired wealth,'' said Walter Spurrier, a distinguished economist who
has known Noboa for years.
</P>
<P>
	   Noboa took office Saturday after the military forced President Jamil Mahuad
from power. The military said it was taking the step to avoid ``a social
explosion'' after hundreds of Indians and young military officers stormed the
Congress building and announced the formation of a new government to fight
corruption and work on behalf of the poor.
</P>
<P>
	   In a television interview Sunday evening, Noboa said he was open to dialogue
with all sectors of society and he expressed sympathy with the Indian
protesters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a people who have suffered much and who are very behind. But in
tactics they erred,'' Noboa said.
</P>
<P>
	   In an earlier statement, the 62-year-old president sought to bring a message
of hope to Ecuadoreans, who have grown increasingly distrustful of promises by
political leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My profound conviction as a Christian permits me to hope that with God's
help Ecuadoreans today can begin the march toward better days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Noboa, a political independent, spent 10 years as the rector of the
University of Guayaquil on Ecuador's Pacific coast. He also has served as dean
of the university's law school and he taught for more than two decades in
Catholic high schools.
</P>
<P>
	   In his only previous experience in public office prior to being elected vice
president, Noboa served briefly in 1983 as the appointed governor of Guayas
province. He also has experience in business as the former manager of a sugar
refinery.
</P>
<P>
	   Friends and colleagues describe him as a gifted negotiator, a demanding
teacher -- calm, serious, a man of few words.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is an intelligent man,'' said retired army general Jose Gallardo, who
served as Mahuad's defense minister until his resignation a week before the
coup. ``The vice president was loyal to the president. He is a man of
principles. I foresee him being successful on behalf of our country.''
</P>
<P>
	   During his time as vice president, Noboa concentrated on overseeing the
reconstruction of highways and bridges on the heavily populated Pacific coast
that were destroyed by El Nino-generated storms in 1997 and 1998. Officials say
he fought a cash-strapped government to get the funds to properly repair the
road system in a part of the country that is a major source of agricultural
exports.

<HEADLINE> President Bush Watches Nervously  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Having experienced both victory and defeat here,
George W. Bush's dad, understandably, is anxious about the outcome for his son
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's so nervous about the caucuses, he called me last night,'' the GOP
presidential front-runner told a voter Saturday in Cedar Rapids about the former
president.
</P>
<P>
	   After a Sunday talk-show appearance, Bush explained that former President
Bush had called from his home in Houston, where he has lived since losing to
Bill Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He wished me all the best,'' George W. said. ``He knows exactly what I'm
going through. Anybody who's ever run for office understands full well the
anticipation of the vote. I explained to him that I feel we had good intensity
in the state of Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush recalled being in Iowa in 1980, when his father first ran for president
and won the caucuses with 32 percent of the vote. He ultimately lost the
nomination to Ronald Reagan, under whom Bush would later serve as vice president
for two terms.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1988, the elder Bush placed third in the caucuses, behind former Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole and evangelist Pat Robertson. Nonetheless, he went on
to win the nomination and later the general election over Democrat Michael S.
Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was here in 1980, when George Bush surged out of nowhere to win first
place. I was here in 1988, when I got to explain to the country why coming in
third place was good,'' George W., the Texas governor, said with a chuckle. ``I
think there was a palpable difference in enthusiasm and intensity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he told his father that ``our team is fired up.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There seems to be intensity at our rallies,'' George W. said. ``But I put
out the cautionary note to him like I am to you all, that nothing really matters
until the actual vote is taken.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later in the day, after an appearance in Mason City, Bush joined in a brief
pickup basketball game with some students from Northern Iowa Area Area Community
College.
</P>
<P>
	   He took off his coat and tucked in his tie, but stayed with the black cowboy
boots.
</P>
<P>
	   After several minutes in which he made one of four shots from the field,
Bush broke away to return to Des Moine for the night. He said he generally no
longer plays such pickup games because ``it turns into full-court karate.''

	   BERLIN (AP) -- The campaign funding scandal surrounding former chancellor
Helmut Kohl widened with allegations that the French government of Francois
Mitterrand paid millions of dollars to support Kohl's 1994 re-election. A

France To Check for Mad Cow Disease
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) -- The French government plans to begin screening the country's
cattle herds for mad cow disease in February, Health Secretary Dominique Gillot
said. Gillot said Sunday the tests would involve taking brain and bone samples
of the cows destined for human consumption, and that "tens of thousands" of
cattle would be tested. France has provoked a diplomatic spat by keeping in
place a ban on beef from Britain, where mad cow disease -- or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy -- originated in 1996. In August, the European Union declared
that beef from Britain was again safe for import, but France angered its
cross-channel neighbor by continuing its ban.

Study Links Songbirds, Exotic Shrubs
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LISLE, Ill. (AP) -- Adding to concerns about how non-native species affect
ecosystems, a new study suggests the proliferation of exotic shrubs may be
contributing to declining populations of some songbirds. Analyzing six years of
data collected from 585 American robin and wood thrush nests in the 1,600-acre
Morton Arboretum near Chicago, researchers from the Illinois Natural History
Survey and the University of Memphis discovered birds that nested in exotic
honeysuckle and buckthorn were almost never able to fledge young before the
nests were destroyed or raided by other animals. The reason? The non-native
bushes simply don't protect nests as well as native shrubs, the pair said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Dr. Gerald Murphy, a Seattle oncologist who helped develop a
widely used test for prostate cancer, died Friday while visiting Israel for a
convention of the International Union Against Cancer. He was 65 and had
undergone several heart-bypass operations over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy published more than 1,000 papers and served as president of the
American Cancer Society in 1983-84.
</P>
<P>
	   He received the Papal Medal for distinguished service to humanity in 1982.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was probably the most brilliant man I've ever known,'' said Alan Davis,
former vice president for public affairs of the National Cancer Institute. ``At
the same time, he was modest and unassuming.''
</P>
<P>
	   From 1970 to 1985, he was director of Roswell Park Memorial Institute for
cancer research and treatment in Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   While there, he worked in the urology-research lab at the State University
of New York Medical School, where his research group determined that
prostate-cancer tumors produce prostate-specific antigens (PSAs).
</P>
<P>
	   This led to development of the PSA test, which indicates prostate cancer's
early presence.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Aims For Surprise in Iowa  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley urged campaign crowds at two campus
rallies on Sunday to ``make that extra effort in the next 24 hours'' and help
him try to spring a surprise in the Iowa Democratic caucuses Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The polls say I'm behind,'' said Bradley, challenging Vice President Al
Gore for the 2000 presidential nomination. ``We've worked hard in Iowa...
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you think in these times of unprecedented prosperity that there are
things that we must do that will set us on the right path for generations to
come, then I hope you will go to caucus for me tomorrow night,'' he told
hundreds of people at the University of Iowa Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, at Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Bradley said the caucuses will
tell ``who wants to be part of the move going forward'' in America.
</P>
<P>
	   Between those appearances in eastern Iowa, he flew to Coon Rapids, to the
west, for a memorial for John Chrystal, 74, a banker, farm expert and political
figure, who died Wednesday. He was a friend and campaign ally.
</P>
<P>
	   At the University of Iowa Memorial Union, across the campus from the field
house where Gore was appearing two hours later, Bradley told a largely student
audience:
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you're tired of special interests dominating the process, if you want
to restore some honor and trust to the system ... then join this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd was a standing one -- about 400 had seats, but were asked to move
them aside so hundreds more would have room to stand in the hall.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We could surprise a few people because you decide to go out and make that
extra effort in the next 24 hours,'' Bradley said at the Cornell student
commons.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Well, it's ... a little more than 24 hours until we see who wants to be
part of the move going forward,'' the former New Jersey senator said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope you make the effort in the next 24 hours, and I hope you do that
not only because it's a competition you want to win, but because you recognize
your future is tied up in it,'' Bradley said. ''... You know you have the energy
to make great things happen.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Des Moines Register, the state's largest newspaper, endorsed Bradley
over Gore in its Sunday editions. But the same editions carried a new poll of
Iowa Democrats that showed the vice president widening his margin over the
challenger to nearly 30 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Ruling Party Starts Campaign  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Ruling-party candidate Francisco Labastida began his
campaign for the Mexican presidency Sunday, renewing a long-standing pledge to
fight corruption and promising to redesign the government.
</P>
<P>
	   Labastida, the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI,
formally opened his campaign in the historic Theater of the Republic, a site in
the central state of Queretaro where his grandfather helped draft the country's
first post-revolutionary constitution in 1917.
</P>
<P>
	   Labastida promised to honor the document's commitment to a country of honest
and fairly applied laws, saying he would ``redesign the government to give all
of its programs and actions the quality, efficiency, and honesty that the people
deserve.''
</P>
<P>
	   Labastida, 57, a former interior secretary and Sinaloa state governor, was
chosen as the party's nominee after the PRI's first open national primary on
Nov. 7. The primary ended a tradition of having Mexico's outgoing president
select the PRI's candidate. The PRI has governed the country without opposition
for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one outside of the law, no one above the law,'' Labastida declared
before a crowd of supporters that included ruling-party governors, legislators,
and his three former opponents in the PRI's primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let's reconstruct in the country a culture of legality and respect for the
laws,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Labastida also promised to become a leader ``future generations will
remember because he kept his word.''
</P>
<P>
	   Criticized as dull and uninspired, Labastida occupies a middle ground in the
Mexican political spectrum between those who stand for free-market principles
and those who favor a heavier state role in the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Labastida's candidacy is buoyed by a strong lead in the polls, the absence
of a strong opposition coalition, and the backing of his former primary
contenders.
</P>
<P>
	   In the elections on July 2, Labastida will face Vicente Fox, a former
Coca-Cola executive and former governor of Guanajuato state, and Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, the former Mexico City mayor who is a pillar of the Mexican left.
Cardenas was defeated in two earlier runs for the presidency, in 1988 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Labastida promised that the elections will be ``the freest, fairest and most
honest in the history of the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   His pledges to fight corruption have provoked disbelief and attacks from
critics such as Fox, who claim that the PRI was responsible for promulgating a
culture of corruption during its seven-decade hold on power.
</P>
<P>
	   But Labastida has defended the platform vigorously, and on Sunday he told
his supporters, ``We are going to combat corruption. We are going to eliminate
impunity.''

<HEADLINE> Rams 11, Buccaneers 6  </HEADLINE>
    By BARRY WILNER AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Their offense imploding, their cover blown, the St. Louis
Rams looked ready to head home.
</P>
<P>
	   Then Kurt Warner played like an MVP, getting the Midwest Express attack the
one touchdown it needed. The unheralded defense did the rest, and the Rams are
heading to the Super Bowl to play the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner hit No. 4 wide receiver Ricky Proehl with a 30-yard touchdown pass
with 4:44 remaining Sunday to lift St. Louis past Tampa Bay 11-6 for the NFC
championship.
</P>
<P>
	   "It didn't matter who did it," the quarterback said. "As long as he was
wearing a Rams jersey, it didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
	   "But when it comes down to making a play, we've made plays all year long.
Ricky came through today."
</P>
<P>
	   Proehl had six catches for 100 yards. None of those -- or the 33 receptions
he made this season, or the 467 of his entire 10-year career -- meant anything
close to his leaping grab over backup cornerback Brian Kelly.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm the guy they're always trying to get rid of," he said. "I'm the guy
they are always trying to replace. You know, there's 100 Ricky Proehls out
there. I beg to differ."
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee, which won the AFC crown in Jacksonville 33-14, handed the Rams
their first loss in their seventh game of the season, but opened as 8-point
underdogs.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know we're in for just as tough a game against the Titans," said Warner,
a former Arena Leaguer who got a chance to play this year only because starter
Trent Green wrecked his knee in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa's gallant defensive effort looked like it would be enough to steal the
victory. But quarterback Shaun King made several critical mistakes down the
stretch, including an interception at midfield by fellow rookie Dre' Bly that
set up the winning drive.
</P>
<P>
	   "We brought them into our zone, we brought them into our misery," said
Warren Sapp, the Defensive Player of the Year, "and we had them down 6-5 and
just kept battling ... and it came down to one play."
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy said: "It's a very tough feeling, difficult to be
that close to a Super Bowl and not get it done."

<HEADLINE> Storm Knocks Out Power to Thousands  </HEADLINE>
   By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Rain and freezing temperatures spread a coat of ice across
parts of Georgia on Sunday, knocking out electrical service to more than a
half-million customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those households and businesses could be without power until at
least Tuesday as crews struggle over slippery roads to reach downed lines and
ice-coated tree limbs continue to snap, pulling down more.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the worst storm since Hurricane Opal came through in 1996, and it
took six days to get power fully restored for that one,'' said Georgia Power
spokeswoman Becky Blaylock. ``If it keeps raining and it freezes again ... we
could be looking at more people without power. We're in for a long haul.''
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes declared a state of emergency Sunday for 20 northern
counties, and the Red Cross opened eight shelters around the state for people
who had no heat.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow and freezing rain also fell in other parts of the southern
Appalachians, and locally heavy rain fell across coastal areas of Georgia and
the Carolinas as the storm pushed eastward and out to sea. Up to 3 inches of
snow fell in some areas of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The rain had been forecast to end late Saturday in Georgia but was still
falling Sunday afternoon. Temperatures in the Atlanta area didn't warm above
freezing until the middle of the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Ice accumulated a half-inch thick on trees in parts of northern Georgia, and
the weight of the ice on power lines pulled down utility poles.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 340,000 home and business customers of Georgia Power lost service
statewide, 290,000 of them in the metropolitan Atlanta area, Ms. Blaylock said.
At least 175,000 customers of electric membership corporations also were blacked
out.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of utility repair crews were put to work in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia Power, which serves 1.8 million customers, restored service to about
140,000 homes and businesses early Sunday evening, said company spokeswoman Lisa
Frederick.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's just the sheer volume and massive nature of the problem that makes us
go from one spot to the next to the next. We fix one, and another tree breaks,
and causes another outage,'' said Pat Kerley of the Jackson Electric Membership
Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   North Carolina's major utilities reported approximately 20,000 customers
without electricity Sunday after parts of that state got a mixture of sleet,
rain and snow. However, Carolina Power &AMP; Light spokeswoman Sally Ramey said not
all of the outages could be blamed on the weather.
</P>
<P>
	   Fallen branches and power lines closed about 20 roads in northern Georgia,
State Department of Transportation spokeswoman Vicki Gavalas said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If my neighborhood is any indication, they're snapping like matchsticks,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport remained open, but many flights
were delayed or canceled as crews tried to de-ice the planes.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Saturday, a U.S. Airways jet that had landed at North Carolina's
Charlotte-Douglas International Airport slid onto a grassy area as it turned
onto a taxiway. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   In central Tennessee, where 3.5 inches of snow fell Saturday, a de-icing
truck nicked the wing of a Northwest Airlines DC-9 at Nashville International
Airport. No one was injured, said Northwest spokeswoman Mary Beth Schubert.
</P>
<P>
	   Parts of South Carolina got up to 6 inches of snow late Saturday, and
traffic on parts of Interstate 85 came to a standstill in several spots because
of slippery pavement and accidents.

<HEADLINE> So Much for Arenaball  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM LITKE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Hold off on the shrine in Canton. Same for the "Arenaball"
instructional videos. What looked just last week like the quarterback and the
offense for the next millennium will be lucky to make it to the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
	   In the NFC Championship game Sunday, the St. Louis Rams scored 11 points.
They usually have that many before the coin toss.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought we could get in the 20s," coach Dick Vermeil said. "I really
did."
</P>
<P>
	   He did not say exactly how, but Vermeil did not have to. Because somehow,
Tampa Bay found a way to score even fewer.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we look at the tapes, we'll both say, 'Jeez, there was a lot of things
that we could have done or should have done,"' Vermeil continued.
</P>
<P>
	   "But I know our destination right now is the Super Bowl in Georgia and to
improve on this week and play a lot better in a much bigger game. And," he said,
"I think we can do that."
</P>
<P>
	   There better be no maybe about it. During the regular season, the Rams
scored more points than all but two teams in NFL history. A week ago, they toyed
with the Minnesota Vikings before shredding them 49-31 as Kurt Warner, the Arena
League-NFL Europe refugee, threw passes to 10 receivers and touchdowns to five
of them.

<HEADLINE> Warner Survives Shakiest Game  </HEADLINE>
    By R.B. FALLSTROM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Kurt Warner looked like an Arena League quarterback and
NFL wannabe again -- until the crucial drive of the NFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
	   The NFL's MVP, who threw 41 touchdown passes in the regular season and added
five more in the St. Louis Rams' playoff victory over Minnesota last week,
survived the shakiest game of his brief NFL career in Sunday's 11-6 victory over
Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought we did a fine job, I just thought we didn't finish drives,"
Warner said. "We had chances to score some more points but we just never
finished it."
</P>
<P>
	   The Buccaneers' zone kept Warner from airing out the ball, had a committee
waiting for Marshall Faulk whenever he touched the ball and bottled up Isaac
Bruce, too.
</P>
<P>
	   "We always felt like we had the capability to shut this offense down," Bucs
defensive tackle Warren Sapp said. "It wasn't a matter of this run-and-gun fun
and Warner Brothers ... they talk about."
</P>
<P>
	   That left lesser lights such as Ricky Proehl and Torry Holt to carry the
load one first down at a time for the league's No. 1 offense.
</P>
<P>
	   "The way they play defense, it's hard to get the big play on them," Warner
said. "They change things up and they've got a great scheme, so you've got to
work it down the field."
</P>
<P>
	   Until Proehl outfought Bucs cornerback Brian Kelly for the winning 30-yard
touchdown pass with 4:44 to go, the Rams were in danger of going without a
touchdown for the first time since Week 10 last year.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first touchdown catch of the season for Proehl, who has perhaps
the surest hands among the Rams' wideouts but is mainly a third-down possession
receiver. He had 33 catches in the regular season, but led Rams receivers in
yardage and had six receptions for 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   Holt, the Rams' first-round pick, had seven catches for 68 yards despite
physical problems during the game. He left with bruised ribs in the first
quarter, and was spitting up blood in the locker room during the third quarter
with a bruised right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
	   Faulk, who set the NFL record with 2,429 total yards this season, was held
to 44 yards on 17 carries and three catches for 5 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   "They always make it tough on me," Faulk said. "They're smart and they have
a great defensive coordinator."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce had three catches for 22 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   "You couldn't go deep against them," Bruce said. "It was totally
impossible."
</P>
<P>
	   Offensive coordinator Mike Martz, who inherits Dick Vermeil's head coaching
job in 2002, at times appeared flummoxed by the Bucs' defense. The Rams wasted
three timeouts because Warner couldn't get the snap off in time.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know the plays were kind of coming in a little bit late," offensive
tackle Fred Miller said. "That's really between the coaches and Kurt.
</P>
<P>
	   "All I try to do is block them after they call them."
</P>
<P>
	   While they were eventually able to get that problem out of the way, the
offense remained out of sync most of the day. Warner frequently threw behind
receivers and some balls floated to their intended target. He finished 26-for-43
for 258 yards with three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
	   The result was the Rams' lowest scoring total, by far, of the season, in the
the biggest game for the franchise since moving to the Midwest in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   The previous low was 21 points in a three-point loss in Week 7 at Tennessee,
the Rams' first setback of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, the Rams get a rematch with those Titans. It will be the franchise's
first Super Bowl appearance since the 1979 season.

<HEADLINE> Authorities still investigating fire that killed two  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WATERTOWN, N.Y. (AP) - A boarding house fire that killed two adults is
believed to have been started by a coffeemaker in the kitchen, officials said
late Sunday.
<P>
	   Watertown Fire Department Battalion Chief Craig Powell said frozen fire
hydrants may have let the fire spread from one house to a second early Saturday
morning as firefighters looked for a water supply.
</P>
<P>
	   There may have been as much as a 30-minute delay, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was brought under control - with the help of a half-dozen other agencies
- about noon, Powell said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two victims were Brenda Peck, 27, and Kenneth Fields, 58. Both died of
smoke inhalation.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not supposed to be a rooming house, but there were quite a few people
were staying there," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   There were about 10 people living in both buildings, he said. "I think
everybody else has been accounted for, but it's such a hodgepodge of people that
if someone who didn't really belong was staying the night, other people might
not know."
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators had not determined a cause late Sunday. Powell said
firefighters had difficulty making their way through the houses because of
safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be a while before we get through all the layers," he said. "The
roof collapsed into the second floor, the floor collapsed into the first floor.
There's still no structure that they can enter."

<HEADLINE> Eight Killed in Icy Mo. Interstate  </HEADLINE>
   By JASON STRAIT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PLATTE CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A truck jackknifed on an icy stretch of interstate
north of Kansas City on Sunday, causing a fiery, multicar accident that killed
eight people, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two others were missing in the accident that involved 19 cars and five
trucks, according to the Missouri State Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the vehicles burst into flames, perhaps because one of the trucks
leaked hydrochloric acid, said Sgt. Jack McMillan of the patrol.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven of the bodies were burned beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
	   McMillan said it was believed there were two more bodies underneath the
wreckage that remained on the highway.
</P>
<P>
	   Interstate 29 was closed in both directions.
</P>
<P>
	   Falling snow had covered already icy roads, making driving dangerous across
the region. A truck jackknifed and cars began crashing into it, McMillan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the wrecked vehicles were melted together from the heat of the fire,
which burned for about an hour. The wreckage was still steaming in the cold
night air at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   A team trained to handle hazardous materials was sent to the scene after the
accident occurred about 1:50 p.m., but had left by early evening.
</P>
<P>
	   Derrick Thomas, a star linebacker for the Kansas City Chiefs, was seriously
injured in a separate, one-vehicle crash Sunday. A spokeswoman for Liberty
Hospital confirmed that the football player was there, but declined to confirm
reports that his back had been injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Chiefs' spokesman Bob Moore confirmed that another person in the vehicle
with Thomas had died.

<HEADLINE> Vandals Burn Haiti Voter Material  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL NORTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Vandals sacked election offices Sunday in
three towns and burned election materials shortly before the start of voter
registration for Haiti's upcoming elections, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Heavily armed men on Sunday broke into the election office in the town of
Dame-Marie in southern Haiti and made off with hundreds of blank voter
identification cards bought with U.S. funds for the March elections, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The election bureau in coastal Petit-Goave, some 40 miles west of
Port-au-Prince, also was sacked early Sunday, election official Marie-Roselore
Aubourg said. On Saturday night, vandals broke into the election office in
Beaumont, a town some 150 miles west of Port-au-Prince, she said. They torched
documents, blank cards and other materials.
</P>
<P>
	   Aubourg said local elections officials had identified the vandals in
Beaumont as close allies of the Lavalas Family Party of former President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
</P>
<P>
	   All over the southern Grand'-Anse district, where the towns are located,
Aristide supporters have demanded a reshuffling of electoral officials, alleging
they will rig elections against Lavalas Family allies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a plot against the electoral apparatus in our district,'' said
Henso Saintclair, president of the Grand'-Anse electoral division.
</P>
<P>
	   The monthlong voter registration period, beginning Monday, was originally
scheduled for Jan. 20 but was postponed because of violence in parts of the
Caribbean country.
</P>
<P>
	   The attacks are the latest troubles in a two-year period of political
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
	   In January 1999, President Rene Preval shut down the country's parliament
after more than a year of conflicts between the executive and legislative
branches.
</P>
<P>
	   He called new two-step elections for November, but they were later reset for
March 16 and April 30.
</P>
<P>
	   Disputes over the staffing of local election offices have burst into
violence in several other provincial towns, causing speculation that elections
may be delayed again.
</P>
<P>
	   In Grande-Goave, about 35 miles west of the capital, mobs on Thursday
prevented the delivery of voter registration materials and set fire to a
senator's office.

   EL SOBRANTE, Calif. (AP) -- A man who had been told he could not speak at a
Sikh temple Sunday returned a short time later and opened fire with a gun,

<P>
	   The alleged gunman was hospitalized, but authorities did not say why.

him he could not speak. He fired several times, authorities said. One of those
shots struck the 46-year-old man in the head, killing him.

weapon.

<HEADLINE> Food Writer Craig Claiborne Dies  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN MATTEWS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Craig Claiborne, who grew from a childhood eating beaten
biscuits in his mother's Mississippi boarding house to become one of the
country's most influential culinary writers in three decades as food editor at
The New York Times, has died. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
	   Claiborne died Saturday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital, the Times said. No
cause of death was given. He lived in Manhattan and in East Hampton.
</P>
<P>
	   Soft-spoken, slight and prolific, Claiborne in 1957 became the first male
food editor at The New York Times, bringing a wide-ranging and critical palate
that appreciated a deli sandwich as well as his beloved classic French food.
</P>
<P>
	   Responsible in some measure for the American mania for food that developed
in the last few decades, Claiborne took readers around the world, discovering
ingredients and recipes and making them accessible to home cooks, male and
female.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said he was the first restaurant critic with a formal education in
food, which he received at the Swiss Hotelkeepers Association school in
Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Claiborne, restaurant reviews often pleased advertisers more than
diners. As reader interest in eating out rose, Claiborne acted as a food
reporter in reviews and columns.
</P>
<P>
	   Not all his research was done in others' kitchens and restaurants. His home
in East Hampton, on the East End of Long Island, was often a laboratory for
recipes and guest quarters for great chefs from this country and abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   A lifelong bachelor fond of formal dining and elaborate parties, Claiborne
described himself as shy and something of a loner. Yet his 70th birthday was
celebrated in Monte Carlo with a three-day bash topped with a black-tie dinner
for more than 200 people, among them more than 60 restaurateurs and chefs.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps his most famous meal was shared with just one person, his longtime
collaborator Pierre Franey, in November 1975 at Chez Denis in Paris. The tab:
$4,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The pair had bid $300 in a public television fund-raising auction for the
prize, donated by American Express, for dinner for two anywhere at any price.
They shared nine wines, including an 1835 madeira, to accompany 31 dishes,
sensuously described in a front-page New York Times story. Hundreds of readers
complained about the excess.
</P>
<P>
	   Claiborne was born Sept. 4, 1920, in Sunflower, Miss. His father, a cotton
farmer, lost most of his property soon afterward and his mother, an accomplished
cook, held the family together financially by opening a boardinghouse.
</P>
<P>
	   As a child, Claiborne was close to the cooks who helped his mother and he
often ate their biscuits, fried chicken, greens and some Creole dishes. In his
``Craig Claiborne's Southern Cooking,'' he noted that ``nothing can equal the
universal appeal of the food of one's childhood and early youth.''
</P>
<P>
	   But, he said, it was a serving of couscous, served in Casablanca during his
Navy service in World War II, that gave him his ``unquenchable interest in food
and food preparation.''
</P>
<P>
	   He studied hotel service in Switzerland and upon returning to the United
States went to work at Gourmet magazine. When Jane Nickerson retired from the
Times, he applied, suggesting it was time the job was held by a man.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1961, four years later, he published his first book, ``The New York Times
Cookbook,'' which eventually sold 3 million copies.
</P>
<P>
	   He went on to write 20 books, including the autobiography ``A Feast Made for
Laughter.'' He revised and updated ``The New York Times Cookbook'' in 1990 to
take into account pesto, sun-dried tomatoes, the food processor, regional
American and Asian foods -- just some of the changes in the way Americans ate
that occurred during Claiborne's tenure as an influential food writer.
</P>
<P>
	   Influential, but not all-powerful: In 1972, Claiborne declared the food
processor a gadget American consumers would not embrace.
</P>
<P>
	   Claiborne retired from the Times in 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   Claiborne's 1992 book ``Elements of Etiquette'' lamented the loss of table
manners and tried to increase the joy of sharing food at table with tips on
appropriate behavior for everything from formal invitations to picking up food
with the fingers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The dinner table is not an appropriate setting for conversations of an
intimate nature, be it romance or health, nor should such depressing topics as
financial problems, career dilemmas and family crises be examined,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And silverware should be the heavy metal at a dinner party, not the
music.''

<HEADLINE> Carrey Wins Best Actor At Globes  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Jim Carrey, who gave an uncanny impersonation
of the late comic Andy Kaufman in "Man on the Moon," won the Golden Globe as
best actor in a movie comedy on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Second year in a row -- what's going on here man?" said Carrey, who picked
up the best dramatic actor Golden Globe last year for "The Truman Show." "I'm
the establishment I once rejected. ... I'm the Tom Hanks of the Golden Globes."
</P>
<P>
	   British actress Janet McTeer won best actress in a musical or comedy film
for her performance as a Southern mom in "Tumbleweeds."
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Cruise of "Magnolia" and Angelina Jolie of "Girl, Interrupted" won
motion picture supporting actor honors.
</P>
<P>
	   A poignant moment in the television categories came when Michael J. Fox was
named best actor for the comedy "Spin City," which he announced he is leaving
because of his fight against Parkinson's disease. But he handled it lightly.
</P>
<P>
	   "Actor out of work -- news at 11," Fox said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Wow. God, I didn't expect this," Cruise said, then thanked wife Nicole
Kidman, who couldn't attend because of work. "Her generosity, her support, her
sacrifices, her talent -- she inspires me."
</P>
<P>
	   Cruise played a TV guru who pitches a "seduce-and-destroy" program to men in
the ensemble drama "Magnolia."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's great to see the view from up here," said Jolie, who plays a manic
sociopath in "Girl, Interrupted."
</P>
<P>
	   In the television categories, cable channel HBO and its stars were big
winners.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sex and the City" was named best TV comedy and its star Sarah Jessica
Parker won best actress. Dramatic acting trophies went to Edie Falco and James
Gandolfini for the acclaimed mob drama "The Sopranos." "RKO 281" was best
miniseries or made-for-TV movie. Halle Berry won best actress in a miniseries
for "Introducing Dorothy Dandridge."
</P>
<P>
	   Among other TV winners, Jack Lemmon was named best miniseries or TV movie
actor for Showtime's "Inherit the Wind."
</P>
<P>
	   "In the spirit of Ving Rhames I'm going to give this to Jack Lemmon," Lemmon
said, lightheartedly recalling the year in which winner Rhames gave his trophy
to Lemmon.
</P>
<P>
	   American Beauty" was the leading movie contender going into this year's
Golden Globes, a ceremony which can serve as a signpost to what will come at the
Oscars. The dark suburban fable gained six Golden Globe nominations, including
best dramatic picture, dramatic actress for Annette Bening, and dramatic actor
for Kevin Spacey.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC broadcast this year's awards, selected by reporters from the Hollywood
Foreign Press Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Barbra Streisand, winner of more Golden Globe trophies than any other
entertainer, including best actress for "Funny Girl" and "A Star is Born,"

	   Some movies that received awards buzz were largely ignored. They included

<HEADLINE> Chiefs' LB Thomas Hurt in Accident  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG TUCKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LIBERTY, Mo. (AP) -- Derrick Thomas, a nine-time Pro Bowl linebacker for the
Kansas City Chiefs, was seriously injured in a one-car accident on an icy road
Sunday afternoon that killed one of his close friends.
</P>
<P>
	   Television reports said the 33-year-old Thomas, one of the NFL's most
dominant defensive players, sustained a broken back. But a team spokesman and a
spokeswoman at Liberty Hospital declined to confirm that.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas and his companions were en route to Kansas City International Airport
to fly to St. Louis for the Buccaneers-Rams NFC championship game when their car
rolled over several times on a snowy highway about 1:30 p.m. CST.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Thomas and the man who died were thrown from the vehicle, the Missouri
State Highway Patrol said.
</P>
<P>
	   The dead man was identified as Michael Tellis, 49, of Kansas City, Kan., the
patrol said. A close friend of Thomas, Tellis helped him set up projects such as
a charity golf tournament which had become an annual event in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
	   An icy snow began falling in the Kansas City metropolitan area around noon.
The weather was also being blamed for a pile-up on Interstate 29 northwest of
Kansas City in which eight deaths had been confirmed by Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Chiefs spokesman Bob Moore said team officials and doctors were en route to
Liberty Hospital north of Kansas City, but were having trouble traveling on the
slick highways. Chiefs president Carl Peterson was on his way back to Kansas
City from St. Louis, where he had been watching the NFC title game.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas, who became an immediate star after being taken in the first round of
the 1989 draft, has spent all 11 years of his NFL career with the Chiefs and was
an All-Pro in his first nine seasons after an All-American career at Alabama. In
just his second season, he set the NFL single-game record with seven sacks
against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   Coaches designed their entire defense around the quick-hitting, 6-foot-3,
255-pound Thomas and he was a mainstay in a consistently tough defense which
helped the Chiefs become one of just three NFL teams to win 100 games in the
decade of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas made headlines in 1998 when he lost his temper during a Monday night
game against Denver and committed three personal foul penalties in the Broncos'
final touchdown drive. He was fined and suspended for one game and issued an
apology to the Broncos and to his fans.
</P>
<P>
	   With one of the quickest first moves of any defender in the league, Thomas
became known for his "sack and strip" move, where he closed fast on a
quarterback's blind side and hacked at his arm to knock the ball out of his
hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Head coach Gunther Cunningham, the Chiefs' defensive coordinator from
1995-98, said Thomas was primarily responsible for the Chiefs' leading the
league with a plus-130 turnover ratio in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   "I take my hat off to No. 58. He is the most underrated football player
right now on our football team," Cunningham said in December. 'For one reason or
another, everybody looks at Derrick Thomas and says, 'Well, he didn't show up in
the playoff game.'
</P>
<P>
	   "If Derrick is not out there at right end, the Chiefs would not have been as
successful as they've been for the last 11 years. Derrick was the starting point
to getting there."

<HEADLINE> Bucs' Shaun King Falls Short  </HEADLINE>
    By FRED GOODALL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Poise and confidence weren't enough for Shaun King this
time.
</P>
<P>
	   King's bid to become the first rookie quarterback to lead his team to the
Super Bowl fell short Sunday, the victim of mistakes he said he'll dedicate his
off-season to eliminating.
</P>
<P>
	   There were the two interceptions he threw in the NFC Championship game, a
failure to score touchdowns on two trips inside the St. Louis 20, a costly delay
of game penalty and two sacks that cost the Tampa Bay Buccaneers yardage and
time on their last possession.
</P>
<P>
	   They all added up to an 11-6 loss to the St. Louis Rams, who were
two-touchdown favorites but were unable to march up and down the field on the
Bucs defense.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the first time I've been on the side of a team not holding up its
end, and I'm going to work this offseason to turn this thing around," said King,
who completed 13 of 29 passes for 163 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm just thankful that I had an opportunity. I mean, how many rookies get
to play for a championship? It's motivation to work hard and try to come back
again."
</P>
<P>
	   King's ability to remain calm under pressure was a big part of the
Buccaneers' march to their first NFC Central title in 18 years, as well as a
come-from-behind victory over Washington in last week's divisional playoff game.
</P>
<P>
	   But the 22-year-old played like a rookie much of Sunday. And while he did
move his team within striking distance for a possible game-winning touchdown,
his inexperience was too much for the Bucs to overcome.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams' second interception, on a poorly thrown pass intended for Warrick
Dunn, set up Kurt Warner's 30-yard touchdown pass to Ricky Proehl that put St.
Louis ahead for good for 4:44 to go.
</P>
<P>
	   And, with the Bucs driving for a possible a game-winning touchdown, King
said he might have serve his team better by throwing the ball away to avoid two
of the five sacks recorded by the Rams defense.
</P>
<P>
	   "I obviously didn't play well enough for us to win, and that's how I judge
my play," King said. "If we win, I feel we played well enough to win. If we
lose, I feel I didn't play well enough for us to win."
</P>
<P>
	   Just as they have done all season, the Bucs stayed close in spite of not
being able to move the ball consistently on offense. King overcame a slow start
to beat the Redskins, but he never really solved the Rams' swarming defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay settled for a field goal after Steve White's interception on the
first play of the game gave the Bucs the ball at the St. Louis 20. King was
unable to get his team into the end zone after his completion to Jacquez Green
and a face mask penalty gave the Bucs a first down at the 12.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams' game plan was to try to force King to beat them. Once Proehl's
catch over Brian Kelly put St. Louis up, that's exactly what the rookie had to
do.
</P>
<P>
	   "He came back for us four times, and we thought he had another one in him,"
defensive tackle Warren Sapp said, referring to the four come-from-behind
victories King led down the stretch after replacing the injured Trent Dilfer.
</P>
<P>
	   King, 5-1 as a starter during the Bucs' run to the title game, moved Tampa
Bay from its own 23 to the St. Louis 22 before a sack for a 12-yard loss took
the steam out of the drive.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay chances were further damaged when an apparent 12-yard completion
to Bert Emanuel -- wiping out the yardage lost on the sack -- was reversed when
the play was reviewed after a booth replay.
</P>
<P>
	   Emanuel also the receiver in another costly play -- or as it turned out,
non-play.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucs, leading 6-5, decided against punting of fourth-and-3 from the St.
Louis 40 early in the fourth quarter. King flipped a short pass to Emanuel, who
turned up the sideline and raced inside the Rams' 20.
</P>
<P>
	   But the officials ruled King didn't get the play off in time, and the Bucs
were assessed a delay of game penalty and punted on the next play.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought we got it off with one second left (on the play clock)," King
said. "The official made the call, and we'll have to live with it."

<HEADLINE> Rams 11, Buccaneers 6  </HEADLINE>
    By BARRY WILNER AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Their offense imploding, their cover blown, the St. Louis
Rams looked ready to head home.
</P>
<P>
	   Then Kurt Warner played like an MVP, getting the Midwest Express attack the
one touchdown it needed. The unheralded defense did the rest, and the Rams are
heading to the Super Bowl to play the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner hit No. 4 wide receiver Ricky Proehl with a 30-yard touchdown pass
with 4:44 remaining Sunday to lift St. Louis past Tampa Bay 11-6 for the NFC
championship.
</P>
<P>
	   "It didn't matter who did it," the quarterback said. "As long as he was
wearing a Rams jersey, it didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
	   "But when it comes down to making a play, we've made plays all year long.
Ricky came through today."
</P>
<P>
	   Proehl had six catches for 100 yards. None of those -- or the 33 receptions
he made this season, or the 467 of his entire 10-year career -- meant anything
close to his leaping grab over backup cornerback Brian Kelly.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm the guy they're always trying to get rid of," he said. "I'm the guy
they are always trying to replace. You know, there's 100 Ricky Proehls out
there. I beg to differ."
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee, which won the AFC crown in Jacksonville 33-14, handed the Rams
their first loss in their seventh game of the season, but opened as 8-point
underdogs.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know we're in for just as tough a game against the Titans," said Warner,
a former Arena Leaguer who got a chance to play this year only because starter
Trent Green wrecked his knee in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa's gallant defensive effort looked like it would be enough to steal the
victory. But quarterback Shaun King made several critical mistakes down the
stretch, including an interception at midfield by fellow rookie Dre' Bly that
set up the winning drive.
</P>
<P>
	   "We brought them into our zone, we brought them into our misery," said
Warren Sapp, the Defensive Player of the Year, "and we had them down 6-5 and
just kept battling ... and it came down to one play."
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy said: "It's a very tough feeling, difficult to be
that close to a Super Bowl and not get it done."
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucs never have gotten it done. Nor have the Rams, whose only Super Bowl
appearance came in the 1979 season, when they beat Tampa Bay 9-0 for the NFC
championship. Then they fell to the Steelers in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   And they aren't likely to get it done if their offense can't get out of its
own way, even if their defense plays "spectacularly," as coach Dick Vermeil
described it.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we showed people we can play every kind of game," said Marshall
Faulk, the NFL Offensive Player of the Year who certainly didn't play his kind
of game. The record-setting running back was held to a total of 49 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   "They wanted to play ball control and take the deep ball away from us. We
did the same to them and thought our offense could make more plays than them."
</P>
<P>
	   They made one more play, offsetting the gallant defensive effort by the
Bucs, who held St. Louis to 309 yards, 91 below its season average. It was
Proehl's first TD of the season, and he finished with six catches for 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you are ever going to bet on someone coming up with a big play, bet on
Ricky Proehl," said Vermeil, the NFL Coach of the Year.
</P>
<P>
	   After Bly brought his interception to the Tampa Bay 47, the league's
highest-scoring offense (526 points during the season, 49 in last week's playoff
victory over Minnesota) finally got into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Rams had to survive a last-ditch march on which they got two of
their five sacks on King, who still managed to lead the Bucs to the St. Louis
22.
</P>
<P>
	   "We made a couple of plays, but I took a couple of sacks, and that's a no-no
at that time," said King, who finished 13-of-29 for 163 yards and two
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
	   A video review that overturned an 11-yard reception by Bert Emanuel hurt
Tampa Bay with 47 seconds remaining. King then threw two incompletions, and the
sellout crowd reached supersonic noise levels in the Trans World Dome.
</P>
<P>
	   It helped that Tampa Bay was more inept on offense than the usually
quick-striking Rams. The Bucs only gained 203 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we showed the NFL and the world something today," Rams defensive
tackle D'Marco Farr said. "The Bucs thought their defense was going to come in
here and walk all over us. We held them without a touchdown and proved that we
are a pretty good defensive team."
</P>
<P>
	   The battle was certainly in the trenches, with the Rams holding the Bucs to
Martin Grammatica's two field goals, while they got one field goal, a safety off
a poor snap, and Warner's dramatic strike to Proehl.
</P>
<P>
	   At the end, as the players gathered around a stage for the trophy
presentation, the cheering never abated.
</P>
<P>
	   Bly waved a victory towel as he raced around the field, while other Rams
simply hugged and reveled in their first trip to the Super Bowl in 20 years,
when they played in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Yes, the team with the worst record of the 1990s heading into this season
will play for the NFL championship next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know what we are up against," Vermeil said. "We know we have to improve
next week."
</P>
<P>
	   That's because the powerhouse offense that dominated the NFC this season
sputtered in the face of Tampa's speedy, physical defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner was stymied by the Bucs' zone and heavy pressure. He finished
26-for-43 for 258 yards. He often threw behind receivers, including on a
critical interception by Hardy Nickerson at the Tampa 3 in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, Warner was picked off three times as the Bucs tamed an attack that
romped past nearly everyone else.
</P>
<P>
	   "We just never really finished drives to put this game out of reach," Warner
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Faulk, who set an NFL record with 2,429 yards from scrimmage this season,
was held to 44 yards rushing on 17 carries and three catches for 5 yards. A
combination of All-Pro linebacker Derrick Brooks and Faulk's own hesitancy made
him look ordinary.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucs' offense was ordinary, as expected. But it was enough to build a
late lead as rookie Grammatica kicked field goals on the first series of each
half for Tampa Bay, which brought a 132-246-1 all-time record into its second
conference title game.
</P>
<P>
	   The staunch defenses turned it into a game of punting and turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay got a takeaway on the first play when defensive end Steve White
tipped and intercepted an attempted screen pass. A drop in the end zone by
Jacquez Green made the Bucs settle for Grammatica's 25-yard field goal and a
surprisingly quick lead.
</P>
<P>
	   But that was all they would get in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   King was sacked and fumbled, losing 12 yards, on one Tampa Bay drive. That
ruined an opportunity for another field goal. And with 11 seconds to go in the
second quarter, his pass from the St. Louis 41 went directly to cornerback Todd
Lyght.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis was more effective moving the ball, but no better at reaching the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
	   After Grammatica's kick, the Rams put together one of their typical drives,
but it yielded only three points. They marched 74 yards in 16 plays and ate up
nearly eight minutes before a fumbled exchange between Warner and Faulk made
them settle for Jeff Wilkins' 24-yarder to tie it.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilkins, kicking with a sore knee, also missed a 44-yarder.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis had a 159-75 yardage edge through 30 minutes. Yet it led only 5-3,
thanks to a high snap by Pro Bowl center Tony Mayberry with King in the shotgun.
</P>
<P>
	   But King scrambled back to knock the ball out of the end zone for the
safety.
</P>
<P>
	   Just as they did to open the game, the Bucs scored on their first possession
of the second half. Grammatica nailed a 23-yarder, set up when Green made a
32-yard reception and Taje Allen was hit with a facemask penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   The 6-5 lead stood far longer than anyone could have expected. In the end,
though, St. Louis found its touch. Just once, but that was enough to send them
to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   "The stadium there is the Georgia Dome," Vermeil said, looking at Rams owner
Georgia Frontiere. "We're taking Georgia to Georgia."

<HEADLINE> Comedian's Son Wins the Hope  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERMUDA DUNES, Calif. (AP) -- In his 10 previous victories around the world,
Jesper Parnevik had never won a nail-biter like he faced Sunday. It couldn't
have come in a more appropriate tournament than the Bob Hope Classic.
</P>
<P>
	   His father is one of the most popular comedians in Sweden, and Bob Hope was
among Bo Parnevik's favorite. The 96-year-old tournament host settled into his
seat behind the 18th green just in time to see a stylish finish to a slapstick
show.
</P>
<P>
	   Parnevik rallied from three strokes down, then blew a two-shot lead. He
thought about a 59 and started hitting shots like someone shooting 79. He hit a
spectator in the head with one of his drives. And he had to save his trademark
victory cigar for the driving range, not the 18th green.
</P>
<P>
	   In the closing scene, Parnevik made a two-putt birdie on the final hole to
win the Hope Classic by one shot over Rory Sabbatini.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a little more interesting than I wanted it to be, but that's just
how I do things," said the zany Swede who wears retro clothing, the bill of his
cap flipped up and has been known to eat volcanic dirt to cleanse his system.
</P>
<P>
	   Parnevik closed with a 6-under 65 -- his 11th consecutive round under par --
to finish at 331 for his third PGA Tour victory in as many years. The $540,000
check was the largest of his career.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory wasn't secure until Sabbatini failed to birdie the par-5 18th at
Bermuda Dunes. The 23-year-old South African hit his tee shot under a tree,
which kept him from reaching the green in two. He hit his third shot over the
palms to 20 feet, but his putt to force a playoff never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not in a situation where I feel like I lost the tournament," he said.
"Jesper ... he played well under the gun. The more opportunities I have, the
less times this will happen."
</P>
<P>
	   It was the sixth straight year the Hope Classic was decided by one stroke,
and it was the first PGA Tour victory in which Parnevik did not have at least of
share of the lead going into the final round.
</P>
<P>
	   David Toms and J.L. Lewis each had a 68 to finish at 333.
</P>
<P>
	   David Duval, the defending champion who closed with a 59 last year, took
himself out of the race early. He didn't make a birdie until the par-5 eighth,
made only one birdie on a par-4 and finished with a 69.
</P>
<P>
	   Matt Gogel, who started the final round of the 90-hole tournament just one
stroke back, didn't make a birdie until the 18th hole. Still, that 25-foot putt
made a difference of $18,500.
</P>
<P>
	   Sabbatini had chances to win the BellSouth Classic and the B.C. Open last
year, and felt confident about getting his first PGA Tour victory. It showed on
the front nine, where he made birdies on three of the first four holes and went
out in 30 with a 20-foot birdie putt on the ninth.
</P>
<P>
	   Parnevik, playing in a twosome because Stephen Ames withdrew because of a
neck and shoulder injury, was the only player to go low with Sabbatini, but he
still trailed by two shots going into the final nine holes.
</P>
<P>
	   Just like that, he went from chasing to leading.
</P>
<P>
	   Sabbatini crushed his approach over the green on No. 10, then lost his focus
when a marshal "tried to play soccer with my golf ball."
</P>
<P>
	   "He almost stepped on it twice," he said. "From then on, it played on my
mind."
</P>
<P>
	   He chipped on to 35 feet and two-putted for bogey, then left a 30-foot
birdie putt on the next hole some 6 feet short.
</P>
<P>
	   Up ahead, Parnevik made a 15-footer on No. 12 to get to 27-under, and then
Sabbatini missed his par putt and fell one stroke behind.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was cruising along just fine," Parnevik said. "I started thinking,
'Wouldn't it be amazing if I shot 59?' That would be two years in a row."
</P>
<P>
	   One problem. Duval never hit lob wedges into bunkers, like Parnevik did on
the 14th. Nor did he hit a spectator in the head with a tee shot, which is what
the Swede did on the 15th.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was awful," Parnevik said. "It looked like he had a big golf ball
growing out of his forehead. I asked him if he was going to be OK, and he said,
'Just as long as you win."'
</P>
<P>
	   If only it were that simple. Parnevik made another bogey on the 16th to set
up his theatrics on the closing hole. He found the fairway with his drive, then
hit a 5-wood to 40 feet. The first putt stopped 5 feet short, but Parnevik made
the next putt with conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   Parnevik was Europe's star in the Ryder Cup and is emerging as one of the
top players on tour. He didn't play the last 10 weeks of last year because of an
irregular heart beat, but hasn't skipped a beat in three tournaments this year.
</P>
<P>
	   He tied for sixth in the Mercedes, tied for third a week later in Honolulu
and went to the top of the money list with his victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   And perhaps it was fitting that Hope, the 96-year-old tournament host, was
looking on. Bo Parnevik never cared for the new comedians who "tell dirty
jokes," the son said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bob Hope was always one of his favorite guys," Parnevik said. "He likes
that kind of humor."
</P>
<P>
	   Parnevik was entertaining in his own way, but he had no complaints about the
outcome.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Stevens Jailed, in Program  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ST. LOUIS (AP) -- New York Rangers forward Kevin Stevens was jailed early
Sunday on a drug charge and later placed in a league substance abuse program.
</P>
<P>
	   Stevens, 34, was arrested at a Collinsville, Ill., motel on misdemeanor
charges of soliciting prostitution and possessing drug paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
	   Police found several grams of suspected crack cocaine, various drug
paraphernalia and about $3,000 in cash in the motel room.
</P>
<P>
	   Stevens gave police a statement admitting he smoked crack cocaine.
Additional felony drug charges against him were pending.
</P>
<P>
	   Pamela J. Velia of St. Louis told police Stevens was smoking crack with a
glass pipe when she got into a cab with him, according to authorities. She said
Stevens gave her $500 in cash and purchased another $500 worth of cocaine from a
street dealer in East St. Louis, Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   Velia said she and Stevens didn't have sex because officers arrived too
soon.
</P>
<P>
	   The cab driver, Alfred Triplett, of East St. Louis, also was arrested. Velia
told police she thought Triplett had a gun and that he wouldn't leave when she
asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Stevens will enter the substance abuse and behavioral program administered
by the NHL and its players' association.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our thoughts are with Kevin and his family at this time," Rangers president
Neil Smith said in a statement. "The New York Rangers' organization will fully
support Kevin in every possible way."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked later about the arrest, the team had no further comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Dave Lewis and Dr. Brian Shaw, the program's doctors, are handling
Stevens' care, which includes medical assessment and in-residence treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Stevens has seen infrequent playing time recently, but was in the lineup
against St. Louis on Saturday night. He has three goals and five assists in 38
games this season.

Cold, Rain Cause Mass Outages in Ga.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- As rain and freezing temperatures spread a coat of ice
across parts of Georgia today, more than a half-million customers lost
electrical service. Many of those households and businesses could be without
power until at least Tuesday as crews struggle over slippery roads to reach
downed lines and ice-coated tree limbs continue to snap, pulling down more.
Georgia Power, which serves 1.8 million customers, restored service to about
140,000 homes and businesses early this evening, said company spokeswoman Lisa
Frederick.

Mitterrand Named in Kohl Scandal

<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- The campaign funding scandal surrounding former chancellor
Helmut Kohl widened with allegations that the French government of Francois
Mitterrand paid millions of dollars to support Kohl's 1994 re-election. A
spokesman for Kohl, meanwhile, denied the veracity of a statement faxed to news
media in Berlin declaring that Kohl intended to identify the source of anonymous
campaign donations. Parliament has launched an inquiry to examine whether bribes
or kickbacks influenced government decisions under Kohl, who was chancellor from
1982-98.

U.S. Troops in Kosovo Investigated

<P>
	   UROSEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.S. soldiers serving with the NATO-led
peacekeeping force in Kosovo may be guilty of treating men in Kosovo too roughly
and of having "inappropriate physical contact" with local women, U.S. army
headquarters in Kosovo said. NATO is investigating allegations the soldiers
acted inappropriately while doing crowd control in Vitina, about 25 miles south
of Kosovo, said a statement on Sunday from Cap Bondsteel, the main U.S. base. A
U.S. soldier serving with the international peacekeeping force in eastern Kosovo
was charged last weekend with sexually assaulting and killing the girl.

President Backing Equal Pay Laws
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to ask Congress tomorrow for $27
million to bolster federal laws requiring that employers pay men and women equal
wages for equal work. Women earn an average of 75 cents for every dollar men are
paid, a disparity Clinton has pointed to in the past as evidence of social
injustice. "We want to make sure that the employers and employees all understand
their rights and responsibilities on equal pay," White House Domestic Policy
Adviser Bruce Reed said today. Officials also want to beef up enforcement of
equal pay laws.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner, which just two weeks ago announced a $145
billion merger with America Online, is expected to reveal plans tomorrow to
merge its music division with EMI Records, which has rights to stars such as the
Beatles and the Rolling Stones. The deal would be worth some $20 billion, a
source familiar with details told The Associated Press. The formal announcement
will be made in London, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Both Warner and EMI have been testing ways to let customers digitally download
music from the Internet.

	   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Jim Carrey, who gave an uncanny impersonation
of the late comic Andy Kaufman in "Man on the Moon," won the Golden Globe as
best actor in a movie comedy on Sunday. Tom Cruise of "Magnolia" and Angelina
Jolie of "Girl, Interrupted" won motion picture supporting actor honors. A
poignant moment in the television categories came when Michael J. Fox was named
best actor for the comedy "Spin City," which he announced he is leaving because
of his fight against Parkinson's disease. Sarah Jessica Parker of "Sex and the

Rams, Titans Are Super Bowl Bound
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams and the Tennessee Titans -- today's
winners, respectively, in the NFC and AFC Championship games -- are Super Bowl
bound. Kurt Warner threw a 30-yard touchdown pass to Ricky Proehl with 4:44 to
go today, lifting the mistake-prone Rams to an 11-6 victory over the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers in the NFC Championship. Tennessee upset the Jacksonville Jaguars
33-14 today to win the AFC title. The Titans beat the Rams in Nashville during
the regular season, 24-21, but St. Louis opens as an 8-point favorite for next
Sunday's game.

Parnevik Wins Bob Hope Classic

<P>
	   BERMUDA DUNES, Calif. (AP) -- Bob Hope settled into his seat behind the 18th
green today just in time to see Jesper Parnevik, the son of a famous Swedish
comedian, win the golf tournament that bears Hope's name. Parnevik finished the
Bob Hope Classic with a 6-under 65 -- his 11th consecutive round under par -- to
finish at 331 for a one-stroke victory over Rory Sabbatini. The victory was his
third on the PGA Tour in as many years, and the $540,000 check was the largest
of his career.

<HEADLINE> Rams 11, Buccaneers 6  </HEADLINE>
    By BARRY WILNER AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Their offense imploding, their cover blown, the St. Louis
Rams looked ready to head home.
</P>
<P>
	   Then Kurt Warner played like an MVP, getting the Midwest Express attack the
one touchdown it needed. The unheralded defense did the rest, and the Rams won
the chance to play the Tennessee Titans in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner hit No. 4 wide receiver Ricky Proehl with a 30-yard touchdown pass
with 4:44 remaining Sunday to lift St. Louis past the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 11-6
for the NFC championship.
</P>
<P>
	   "It didn't matter who did it," the quarterback said. "As long as he was
wearing a Rams jersey, it didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
	   "But when it comes down to making a play, we've made plays all year long.
Ricky came through today."
</P>
<P>
	   Proehl's touchdown was his first of the season and he finished with six
catches for 100 yards. None of those -- or the 33 receptions he made this
season, or the 467 of his entire 10-year career -- meant anything close to his
leaping grab over backup cornerback Brian Kelly.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm the guy they're always trying to get rid of," he said. "I'm the guy
they are always trying to replace. You know, there's 100 Ricky Proehls out
there. I beg to differ."
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee, which won the AFC crown in Jacksonville 33-14, handed the Rams
their first loss in their seventh game of the season, but opened as 8-point
underdogs.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know we're in for just as tough a game against the Titans," said Warner,
a former Arena Leaguer who got a chance to play this year only because starter
Trent Green wrecked his knee in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa's gallant defensive effort looked like it would be enough to steal the
victory. But quarterback Shaun King made several critical mistakes down the
stretch, including an interception at midfield by fellow rookie Dre' Bly that
set up the winning drive.
</P>
<P>
	   "We brought them into our zone, we brought them into our misery," said
Warren Sapp, the Defensive Player of the Year, "and we had them down 6-5 and
just kept battling ... and it came down to one play."
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy said: "It's a very tough feeling, difficult to be
that close to a Super Bowl and not get it done."
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucs never have gotten it done. Nor have the Rams, whose only Super Bowl
appearance came in the 1979 season, when they beat Tampa Bay 9-0 for the NFC
championship. Then they fell to the Steelers in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   And they aren't likely to get it done if their offense can't get out of its
own way, even if their defense plays "spectacularly," as coach Dick Vermeil
described it.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we showed people we can play every kind of game," said Marshall
Faulk, the NFL Offensive Player of the Year who certainly didn't play his kind
of game. The record-setting running back was held to a total of 49 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   "They wanted to play ball control and take the deep ball away from us. We
did the same to them and thought our offense could make more plays than them."
</P>
<P>
	   They made one more play, offsetting the defensive effort by the Bucs, who
held St. Louis to 309 yards, 91 below its season average.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Rams had to survive a last-ditch march on which they got two of
their five sacks on King, who still managed to lead the Bucs to the St. Louis
22.
</P>
<P>
	   "We made a couple of plays, but I took a couple of sacks, and that's a no-no
at that time," said King, who finished 13-of-29 for 163 yards and two
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
	   A video review that overturned an 11-yard reception by Bert Emanuel hurt
Tampa Bay with 47 seconds remaining. King then threw two incompletions, and the
sellout crowd reached supersonic noise levels in the Trans World Dome.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we showed the NFL and the world something today," Rams defensive
tackle D'Marco Farr said. "The Bucs thought their defense was going to come in
here and walk all over us. We held them without a touchdown and proved that we
are a pretty good defensive team."
</P>
<P>
	   It helped that Tampa Bay was more inept on offense than the usually
quick-striking Rams. The Bucs gained just 203 yards and were held to Martin
Gramatica's two field goals, while the Rams got one field goal, a safety off a
poor snap, and Warner's dramatic strike to Proehl.
</P>
<P>
	   At the end, as the players gathered around a stage for the trophy
presentation, the cheering never abated.
</P>
<P>
	   Bly waved a victory towel as he raced around the field, while other Rams
simply hugged and reveled in their first trip to the Super Bowl in 20 years,
when they played in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Yes, the team with the worst record of the 1990s heading into this season
will play for the NFL championship next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know what we are up against," said Vermeil, the NFL Coach of the Year.
"We know we have to improve next week."
</P>
<P>
	   That's because the powerhouse offense that dominated the NFC this season
sputtered in the face of Tampa's speedy, physical defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner was stymied by the Bucs' zone and heavy pressure. He finished
26-for-43 for 258 yards. He often threw behind receivers, including on a
critical interception by Hardy Nickerson at the Tampa 3 in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, Warner was picked off three times as the Bucs tamed an attack that
romped past nearly everyone else.
</P>
<P>
	   "We just never really finished drives to put this game out of reach," Warner
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Faulk, who set an NFL record with 2,429 yards from scrimmage this season,
was held to 44 yards rushing on 17 carries and three catches for 5 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucs' offense was ordinary, as expected. But it was enough to build a
late lead as rookie Gramatica kicked field goals on the first series of each
half for Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   The staunch defenses turned it into a game of punting and turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay got a takeaway on the first play when defensive end Steve White
tipped and intercepted an attempted screen pass. A drop in the end zone by
Jacquez Green made the Bucs settle for Gramatica's 25-yard field goal and a
surprisingly quick lead.
</P>
<P>
	   But that was all they would get in the first half. St. Louis was more
effective moving the ball, but no better at reaching the end zone.
</P>
<P>
	   After Gramatica's kick, the Rams put together one of their typical drives,
but it yielded only three points. They marched 74 yards in 16 plays and got Jeff
Wilkins' 24-yarder to tie it.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis had a 159-75 yardage edge through 30 minutes. Yet it led only 5-3,
thanks to a high snap by Pro Bowl center Tony Mayberry with King in the shotgun.
King scrambled back to knock the ball out of the end zone for the safety.
</P>
<P>
	   Just as they did to open the game, the Bucs scored on their first possession
of the second half. Gramatica nailed a 23-yarder, set up when Green made a
32-yard reception and Taje Allen was hit with a facemask penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   The 6-5 lead stood far longer than anyone could have expected. In the end,
though, St. Louis found its touch. Just once, but that was enough to send them
to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   "The stadium there is the Georgia Dome," said Vermeil, looking at Rams owner
Georgia Frontiere. "We're taking Georgia to Georgia."

<HEADLINE> So Much for Arenaball  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM LITKE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Hold off on the shrine in Canton. Same for the "Arenaball"
instructional videos. What looked just last week like the quarterback and the
offense for the next millennium will be lucky to make it to the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
	   In the NFC Championship game Sunday, the St. Louis Rams scored 11 points.
They usually have that many before the coin toss.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought we could get in the 20s," coach Dick Vermeil said. "I really
did."
</P>
<P>
	   He did not say exactly how, but Vermeil did not have to. Because somehow,
Tampa Bay found a way to score even fewer.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we look at the tapes, we'll both say, 'Jeez, there was a lot of things
that we could have done or should have done,"' Vermeil continued.
</P>
<P>
	   "But I know our destination right now is the Super Bowl in Georgia and to
improve on this week and play a lot better in a much bigger game. And," he said,
"I think we can do that."
</P>
<P>
	   There better be no maybe about it. During the regular season, the Rams
scored more points than all but two teams in NFL history. A week ago, they toyed
with the Minnesota Vikings before shredding them 49-31 as Kurt Warner, the Arena
League-NFL Europe refugee, threw passes to 10 receivers and touchdowns to five
of them.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, Warner joked that in the Arena League, "It would have been an
average day, but I'll take it."
</P>
<P>
	   Against the Bucs, Warner threw exactly one touchdown pass, and receiver
Ricky Proehl had to go up over the top of defender Brian Kelly to get it. It was
set up when Dre' Bly picked off a pass from Tampa Bay's rookie quarterback,
Shaun King, and returned it to the Bucs' 47-yard line.
</P>
<P>
	   There were eight minutes left to play and the Rams were trailing 6-5, only
the third time all season they had been behind at home.
</P>
<P>
	   "It seemed like everything we did, they knew what to expect," Warner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Except maybe Proehl. Warner threw 41 touchdowns during the regular season, a
feat only Dan Marino had previously accomplished. Yet somehow, not one of those
went to Proehl.
</P>
<P>
	   "The guy was our MVP last season, but we've got so much talent on this
football team that he became a situation guy this year. Somebody told me in the
lockerroom that he had 34 catches this year and 25 of them went for first downs.
He did the exact same thing today that he's been doing all year," Warner said.
"He came up big."
</P>
<P>
	   It would be hard to exaggerate how big.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams and Warner and their low-tech coach with his high-octane attack
have been the best story of the NFL season. With aging stars John Elway, Reggie
White and Barry Sanders retiring, marquee names Terrell Davis, Steve Young,
Michael Irvin and Jamal Anderson sidelined, and traditional powers like the
Broncos, 49ers, Packers and Cowboys staggering, the quality of play has been
uneven at best.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams ran off a half-dozen wins to begin the season, and even more
impressive was the way they won. Warner, who was stocking shelves in a grocery
only a few years ago, stepped in for injured starter Trent Green in August and
almost immediately brought St. Louis offensive coordinator Mike Martz's
mad-scientist schemes to life.
</P>
<P>
	   The qualities that helped Warner thrive in the short, narrow Arena League
fields (50 yards long by 28 yards wide) and its action-every-second environment
made him the perfect pilot to run Martz's offense. He made quick reads and hit
fast receivers in full stride, coaxing a full-throated roar from the 66,000 St.
Louisans who packed the Trans World Dome week in and week out.
</P>
<P>
	   When things were humming and the joint was jumping, and you looked down on
the artificial turf from on high, the Rams looked like pool balls on a break.
The amazing thing was they always seemed to call the right pocket.
</P>
<P>
	   At least until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was a time I don't think they had any idea what play to run to get
out of the mess that we put them into," Bucs defensive tackle Warren Sapp said.
"We put them in misery, and we've come to love misery around here."

<HEADLINE> Comedian's Son Wins the Hope  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERMUDA DUNES, Calif. (AP) -- In his 10 previous victories around the world,
Jesper Parnevik had never won a nail-biter like he faced Sunday. It couldn't
have come in a more appropriate tournament than the Bob Hope Classic.
</P>
<P>
	   His father is one of the most popular comedians in Sweden, and Bob Hope was
among Bo Parnevik's favorite. The 96-year-old tournament host settled into his
seat behind the 18th green just in time to see a stylish finish to a slapstick
show.
</P>
<P>
	   Parnevik rallied from three strokes down, then blew a two-shot lead. He
thought about a 59 and started hitting shots like someone shooting 79. He hit a
spectator in the head with one of his drives. And he had to save his trademark
victory cigar for the driving range, not the 18th green.
</P>
<P>
	   In the closing scene, Parnevik made a two-putt birdie on the final hole to
win the Hope Classic by one shot over Rory Sabbatini.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a little more interesting than I wanted it to be, but that's just
how I do things," said the zany Swede who wears retro clothing, the bill of his
cap flipped up and has been known to eat volcanic dirt to cleanse his system.
</P>
<P>
	   Parnevik closed with a 6-under 65 -- his 11th consecutive round under par --
to finish at 331 for his third PGA Tour victory in as many years. The $540,000
check was the largest of his career.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory wasn't secure until Sabbatini failed to birdie the par-5 18th at
Bermuda Dunes. The 23-year-old South African hit his tee shot under a tree,
which kept him from reaching the green in two. He hit his third shot over the
palms to 20 feet, but his putt to force a playoff never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not in a situation where I feel like I lost the tournament," he said.
"Jesper ... he played well under the gun. The more opportunities I have, the
less times this will happen."
</P>
<P>
	   It was the sixth straight year the Hope Classic was decided by one stroke,
and it was the first PGA Tour victory in which Parnevik did not have at least of
share of the lead going into the final round.
</P>
<P>
	   David Toms and J.L. Lewis each had a 66 to finish at 333.
</P>
<P>
	   David Duval, the defending champion who closed with a 59 last year, took
himself out of the race early. He didn't make a birdie until the par-5 eighth,
made only one birdie on a par-4 and finished with a 69.
</P>
<P>
	   Matt Gogel, who started the final round of the 90-hole tournament just one
stroke back, didn't make a birdie until the 18th hole. Still, that 25-foot putt
made a difference of $18,500.
</P>
<P>
	   Sabbatini had chances to win the BellSouth Classic and the B.C. Open last
year, and felt confident about getting his first PGA Tour victory. It showed on
the front nine, where he made birdies on three of the first four holes and went
out in 30 with a 20-foot birdie putt on the ninth.
</P>
<P>
	   Parnevik, playing in a twosome because Stephen Ames withdrew because of a
neck and shoulder injury, was the only player to go low with Sabbatini, but he
still trailed by two shots going into the final nine holes.
</P>
<P>
	   Just like that, he went from chasing to leading.
</P>
<P>
	   Sabbatini crushed his approach over the green on No. 10, then lost his focus
when a marshal "tried to play soccer with my golf ball."
</P>
<P>
	   "He almost stepped on it twice," he said. "From then on, it played on my
mind."
</P>
<P>
	   He chipped on to 35 feet and two-putted for bogey, then left a 30-foot
birdie putt on the next hole some 6 feet short.
</P>
<P>
	   Up ahead, Parnevik made a 15-footer on No. 12 to get to 27-under, and then
Sabbatini missed his par putt and fell one stroke behind.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was cruising along just fine," Parnevik said. "I started thinking,
'Wouldn't it be amazing if I shot 59?' That would be two years in a row."
</P>
<P>
	   One problem. Duval never hit lob wedges into bunkers, like Parnevik did on
the 14th. Nor did he hit a spectator in the head with a tee shot, which is what
the Swede did on the 15th.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was awful," Parnevik said. "It looked like he had a big golf ball
growing out of his forehead. I asked him if he was going to be OK, and he said,
'Just as long as you win."'
</P>
<P>
	   If only it were that simple. Parnevik made another bogey on the 16th to set
up his theatrics on the closing hole. He found the fairway with his drive, then
hit a 5-wood to 40 feet. The first putt stopped 5 feet short, but Parnevik made
the next putt with conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   Parnevik was Europe's star in the Ryder Cup and is emerging as one of the
top players on tour. He didn't play the last 10 weeks of last year because of an
irregular heart beat, but hasn't skipped a beat in three tournaments this year.
</P>
<P>
	   He tied for sixth in the Mercedes, tied for third a week later in Honolulu
and went to the top of the money list with his victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   And perhaps it was fitting that Hope, the 96-year-old tournament host, was
looking on. Bo Parnevik never cared for the new comedians who "tell dirty
jokes," the son said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bob Hope was always one of his favorite guys," Parnevik said. "He likes
that kind of humor."
</P>
<P>
	   Parnevik was entertaining in his own way, but he had no complaints about the
outcome.

<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Buccaneers didn't appear overly dismayed
about a controversial disallowed catch near the end of Sunday's 11-6 loss to St.
Louis in the NFC Championship game.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaun King's 12-yard pass to Bert Emanuel to the Rams 23 with 40 seconds to
go was ruled incomplete by referee Bill Carollo. In the last two minutes of each
half, officials are in charge of replay review.
</P>
<P>
	   Carollo said the tip of the ball hit the artificial turf as Emanuel secured
it. The decision turned a third-and-10 situation to third-and-22, and two plays
later the Bucs ran out of downs.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was loud out there and I'm not exactly sure what they said," Bucs coach
Tony Dungy said. "I'm a league guy, so if they say it hit the ground then I'm
sure it hit the ground."
</P>
<P>
	   King and Emanuel both thought it was a catch. But King said it was all part
of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those kinds of things you have no control over," King said. "The officials
made what they thought was the right call so we have to live with it."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   INJURY REPORT: Rams rookie receiver Torry Holt left with bruised ribs in
the first quarter after catching three passes for 14 yards on the team's second
drive. He returned in the third quarter, but left near the end of the period
with a bruised right shoulder. Fellow wideout Az-Zahir Hakim missed the start of
the second half because of cramps. Rams offensive tackle Fred Miller sprained
his right knee in the fourth quarter, but returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Bucs defensive tackle Marcus Jones broke a finger in the first quarter, but
returned. Special teamer Dexter Jackson bruised his hip in the third period and
didn't return.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   INJURED KICKER: Rams kicker Jeff Wilkins, questionable early in the week
due to chronic tendinitis in his left knee, missed a 44-yarder in the second
quarter. Wilkins missed a 42-yarder last week against Minnesota, and blamed it
on pain in the knee.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Dick Vermeil was happy he didn't have to use him at the end of the
game. Ricky Proehl rescued Wilkins with his third-down, 30-yard game-winning
touchdown catch with 4:44 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just thought we had better complete it because our field goal situation
isn't as healthy as you would like it to be," Vermeil said. "You don't want to
dump a game in a kicker's lap if you don't have to."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   NEW VOICE: Missouri basketball and football play-by-play man Mike Kelly
filled in on CBS' radio coverage of the game after Howard David was stranded in
New York due to a winter storm. Kelly, of Columbia, Mo., got the call about
seven hours before gametime.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   REMEMBERING CARDINALS: The Rams paid homage to their West Coast past and
St. Louis' football past at the coin toss. Dan Dierdorf, a Hall of Fame
offensive lineman with the St. Louis Cardinals, and former Rams running back
Lawrence McCutcheon were honorary captains. Dierdorf was introduced to
thunderous applause.
</P>
<P>
	   The Buccaneers were represented by Hall of Fame defensive end Lee Roy Selmon
and quarterback Doug Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   INEXPERIENCED QUARTERBACKS: Kurt Warner and Shaun King entered the game
with a combined 23 games experience. That's the fewest in a conference
championship game since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   NOISE FACTOR: The Bucs installed two extra speakers in Shaun King's helmet
to help the rookie quarterback receive communications from the sideline in the
noisy Trans World Dome.
</P>
<P>
	   Although coach Tony Dungy said crowd noise was a factor in a costly delay of
game penalty that stopped a promising drive early in the fourth quarter, King
said the fans, in general, were not that big of a distraction.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were loud. They did a good job of providing homefield advantage," King
said. "They were just like we'd thought they would be."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   TAUNTING?: The Rams danced and celebrated in front of Tampa Bay's bench
after the Bucs turned the ball over on downs with 34 seconds remaining, and
several players on the teams exchanged words and shoves.
</P>
<P>
	   Bucs defensive tackle Warren Sapp didn't take offense.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think they were taunting. I think they were happy that they won a
ballgame that they were about to lose," the NFL Defensive Player of the Year
said. "I probably would have done the same thing. I'd probably have been out on
the 50-yard line, falling down and rolling around all over the ground."

<HEADLINE> So Much for Arenaball  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM LITKE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Hold off on the shrine in Canton. Same for the "Arenaball"
instructional videos. What looked just last week like the quarterback and the
offense for the next millennium will be lucky to make it to the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
	   In the NFC Championship game Sunday, the St. Louis Rams scored 11 points.
They usually have that many before the coin toss.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought we could get in the 20s," coach Dick Vermeil said. "I really
did."
</P>
<P>
	   He did not say exactly how, but Vermeil did not have to. Because somehow,
Tampa Bay found a way to score even fewer.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we look at the tapes, we'll both say, 'Jeez, there was a lot of things
that we could have done or should have done,"' Vermeil continued.
</P>
<P>
	   "But I know our destination right now is the Super Bowl in Georgia and to
improve on this week and play a lot better in a much bigger game. And," he said,
"I think we can do that."
</P>
<P>
	   There better be no maybe about it. During the regular season, the Rams
scored more points than all but two teams in NFL history. A week ago, they toyed
with the Minnesota Vikings before shredding them 49-31 as Kurt Warner, the Arena
League-NFL Europe refugee, threw passes to 10 receivers and touchdowns to five
of them.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, Warner joked that in the Arena League, "It would have been an
average day, but I'll take it."
</P>
<P>
	   Against the Bucs, Warner threw exactly one touchdown pass, and receiver
Ricky Proehl had to go up over the top of defender Brian Kelly to get it. It was
set up when Dre' Bly picked off a pass from Tampa Bay's rookie quarterback,
Shaun King, and returned it to the Bucs' 47-yard line.
</P>
<P>
	   There were eight minutes left to play and the Rams were trailing 6-5, only
the third time all season they had been behind at home.
</P>
<P>
	   "It seemed like everything we did, they knew what to expect," Warner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Except maybe Proehl. Warner threw 41 touchdowns during the regular season, a
feat only Dan Marino had previously accomplished. Yet somehow, not one of those
went to Proehl.
</P>
<P>
	   "The guy was our MVP last season, but we've got so much talent on this
football team that he became a situation guy this year. Somebody told me in the
lockerroom that he had 34 catches this year and 25 of them went for first downs.
He did the exact same thing today that he's been doing all year," Warner said.
"He came up big."
</P>
<P>
	   It would be hard to exaggerate how big.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams and Warner and their low-tech coach with his high-octane attack
have been the best story of the NFL season. With aging stars John Elway, Reggie
White and Barry Sanders retiring, marquee names Terrell Davis, Steve Young,
Michael Irvin and Jamal Anderson sidelined, and traditional powers like the
Broncos, 49ers, Packers and Cowboys staggering, the quality of play has been
uneven at best.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams ran off a half-dozen wins to begin the season, and even more
impressive was the way they won. Warner, who was stocking shelves in a grocery
only a few years ago, stepped in for injured starter Trent Green in August and
almost immediately brought St. Louis offensive coordinator Mike Martz's
mad-scientist schemes to life.
</P>
<P>
	   The qualities that helped Warner thrive in the short, narrow Arena League
fields (50 yards long by 28 yards wide) and its action-every-second environment
made him the perfect pilot to run Martz's offense. He made quick reads and hit
fast receivers in full stride, coaxing a full-throated roar from the 66,000 St.
Louisans who packed the Trans World Dome week in and week out.
</P>
<P>
	   When things were humming and the joint was jumping, and you looked down on
the artificial turf from on high, the Rams looked like pool balls on a break.
The amazing thing was they always seemed to call the right pocket.
</P>
<P>
	   At least until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was a time I don't think they had any idea what play to run to get
out of the mess that we put them into," Bucs defensive tackle Warren Sapp said.
"We put them in misery, and we've come to love misery around here."	   By
misery, Sapp meant an ugly, tough, old-fashioned defensive struggle, which is
what the Bucs planned all along. They intercepted Warner's first pass of the
game as a calling card, finished every hit as hard as they could, and were still
hanging around when a desperation fourth-down pass from King to Bert Emanuel
with 41 seconds left sailed harmlessly over the end zone.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucs were too drained to repeat the usual lines about moral victories.
But they should get flowers when they arrive home this week, courtesy of the
Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
	   What Tampa Bay proved is that Warner and Arenaball can be disrupted. By
blitzing regularly and building pressure with their defensive linemen running
slants, they staged a clinic on how to gum up the works.
</P>
<P>
	   "It wasn't a matter of run-and-gun and all the bull they talk about. The guy
made a great play on the sideline, no doubt about it," Sapp said, talking about
the TD catch by Proehl.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had the opportunities to put them away and we didn't, so they're the
champions."
</P>
<P>
	   For one more week, at least.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Raid Hospital in Thailand  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- About 10 armed men from the Myanmar insurgent group
God's Army raided a hospital in western Thailand on Monday, demanding that the
doctors treat their injured, the Thai interior minister said.
</P>
<P>
	   The insurgents also wanted Thai authorities to open the border to allow
God's Army to seek refuge in Thailand, Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart
told a radio station.
</P>
<P>
	   The ITV television network reported that the armed men raided the hospital
around 7 a.m., and police soon surrounded the building in the town of
Ratchaburi, about 60 miles west of Bangkok and 30 miles east of the border with
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
	   The raiders, wearing camouflage and armed with hand grenades and assault
rifles, tied a grenade to the hospital gate and fired guns in the air, the
station reported.
</P>
<P>
	   They seized the hospital's emergency room, it reported. There were no
immediate reports of any casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanan said he was flying to the scene with the Thai national police chief,
Gen. Pracha Promnok, and would coordinate negotiations with the rebels
personally.
</P>
<P>
	   Thai special forces would also be sent to the scene, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   God's Army is an insurgent guerrilla group of about 200 mostly ethnic Karen
fighters battling the military regime in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
	   They have given shelter to the five student rebels who raided the Myanmar
Embassy in Bangkok Oct. 1-2.
</P>
<P>
	   The students were demanding democracy in their homeland, which has been
ruled by military since 1962. The students were given their freedom by the Thai
authorities in return for the safe release of the hostages from the embassy.

<HEADLINE> Storm Knocks Out Power to Thousands  </HEADLINE>
   By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Rain and freezing temperatures spread a coat of ice across
parts of Georgia on Sunday, knocking out electrical service to more than a
half-million customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those households and businesses could be without power until at
least Tuesday as crews struggle over slippery roads to reach downed lines and
ice-coated tree limbs continue to snap, pulling down more.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the worst storm since Hurricane Opal came through in 1996, and it
took six days to get power fully restored for that one,'' said Georgia Power
spokeswoman Becky Blaylock. ``If it keeps raining and it freezes again ... we
could be looking at more people without power. We're in for a long haul.''
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes declared a state of emergency Sunday for 20 northern
counties, and the Red Cross opened eight shelters around the state for people
who had no heat.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow and freezing rain also fell in other parts of the southern
Appalachians, and locally heavy rain fell across coastal areas of Georgia and
the Carolinas as the storm pushed eastward and out to sea. Up to 3 inches of
snow fell in some areas of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The rain had been forecast to end late Saturday in Georgia but was still
falling Sunday afternoon. Temperatures in the Atlanta area didn't warm above
freezing until the middle of the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Ice accumulated a half-inch thick on trees in parts of northern Georgia, and
the weight of the ice on power lines pulled down utility poles.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 340,000 home and business customers of Georgia Power lost service
statewide, 290,000 of them in the metropolitan Atlanta area, Ms. Blaylock said.
At least 175,000 customers of electric membership corporations also were blacked
out. That number was trimmed to 73,000 by nightfall Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of utility repair crews were put to work in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia Power, which serves 1.8 million customers, restored service to about
140,000 homes and businesses early Sunday evening, said company spokeswoman Lisa
Frederick.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's just the sheer volume and massive nature of the problem that makes us
go from one spot to the next to the next. We fix one, and another tree breaks,
and causes another outage,'' said Pat Kerley of the Jackson Electric Membership
Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   North Carolina's major utilities reported approximately 20,000 customers
without electricity Sunday after parts of that state got a mixture of sleet,
rain and snow. However, Carolina Power &AMP; Light spokeswoman Sally Ramey said not
all of the outages could be blamed on the weather.
</P>
<P>
	   Fallen branches and power lines closed about 20 roads in northern Georgia,
State Department of Transportation spokeswoman Vicki Gavalas said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If my neighborhood is any indication, they're snapping like matchsticks,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport remained open, but many flights
were delayed or canceled as crews tried to de-ice the planes.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Saturday, a U.S. Airways jet that had landed at North Carolina's
Charlotte-Douglas International Airport slid onto a grassy area as it turned
onto a taxiway. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   In central Tennessee, where 3.5 inches of snow fell Saturday, a de-icing
truck nicked the wing of a Northwest Airlines DC-9 at Nashville International
Airport. No one was injured, said Northwest spokeswoman Mary Beth Schubert.
</P>
<P>
	   Parts of South Carolina got up to 6 inches of snow late Saturday, and
traffic on parts of Interstate 85 came to a standstill in several spots because
of slippery pavement and accidents. More than 70,000 customers in the state were
without power and the weather was blamed on at least one traffic fatality.

<HEADLINE> Mussina Hopes To Remain With Os  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BALTIMORE (AP) -- Mike Mussina said he would like to finish his career with
Baltimore Orioles, but not at any price.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm pretty sure we're going to do it little differently. The last time I
was uncomfortable being a free agent," Mussina said. "I'm more comfortable
dealing with that situation now."
</P>
<P>
	   Mussina signed a three-year, $20.45 million deal in 1997. Mussina and
majority owner Peter Angelos reached the deal only after Mussina overruled his
agent's advice to press for more money.
</P>
<P>
	   "The last time we really had a good club. We'd been to the playoffs (in
1996) and I felt we had the club to get into the Series," he said. "I thought
this might be my best chance here, so let's stick with it. I really wanted to
see if we could make a run. It hasn't worked out that way.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was a situation where you were talking about $2 million or $3 million"
over the course of the contract," he added. "This is a situation where you're
talking about a lot more than that. Did it play against me last time? Possibly.
But are things going to play against me this time? I don't think so. I think
I've earned the right to be considered one of the best pitchers in the league."
</P>
<P>
	   Mussina, 31, was second in Cy Young Award balloting last season after going
18-7 with a 3.50 ERA in 31 starts. A shoulder injury in August prevented Mussina
from a chance at his first 20-win season. In the past three seasons, Mussina is
46-25.
</P>
<P>
	   Mussina pointed to the one-year, $12 million contract awarded David Cone by
the New York Yankees two months ago as an example of a deal he might consider.
</P>
<P>
	   "David Cone is one of the top starting pitchers in the league, but he's 37
years old and he's going to make $12 million," Mussina said.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's just an example, but I'm six years younger and probably have a
bigger role on this team than he has on their team."

<HEADLINE> Rams 11, Buccaneers 6  </HEADLINE>
    By BARRY WILNER AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- In Mark McGwire's city, the St. Louis Rams finally found
the long ball. It landed them in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Their Midwest Express offense imploding, the Rams looked ready to head home.
Then came their one big play Sunday, when Kurt Warner acted like an MVP, hitting
Ricky Proehl for a 30-yard touchdown with 4:44 remaining in the NFC Championship
game.
</P>
<P>
	   The unheralded defense did the rest, and the Rams won the chance to play the
Tennessee Titans for the NFL title, beating Tampa Bay 11-6.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner hit No. 4 wide receiver Proehl down the left sideline over backup
cornerback Brian Kelly.
</P>
<P>
	   "It didn't matter who did it," the quarterback said. "As long as he was
wearing a Rams jersey, it didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
	   "But when it comes down to making a play, we've made plays all year long.
Ricky came through today."
</P>
<P>
	   Proehl's touchdown was his first of the season and he finished with six
catches for 100 yards. None of those -- or the 33 receptions he made this
season, or the 467 of his entire 10-year career -- meant anything close to his
leaping grab.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm the guy they're always trying to get rid of," he said. "I'm the guy
they are always trying to replace. You know, 'There's 100 Ricky Proehls out
there.' I beg to differ."
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee, which won the AFC crown in Jacksonville 33-14, handed the Rams
their first loss in their seventh game of the season, but opened as 8-point
underdogs.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know we're in for just as tough a game against the Titans," said Warner,
a former Arena Leaguer who got a chance to play this year only because starter
Trent Green wrecked his knee in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa's gallant defensive effort looked like it would be enough to steal the
victory. But quarterback Shaun King made several critical mistakes down the
stretch, including an interception at midfield by fellow rookie Dre' Bly that
set up the winning drive.
</P>
<P>
	   "We brought them into our zone, we brought them into our misery," said
Warren Sapp, the Defensive Player of the Year, "and we had them down 6-5 and
just kept battling ... and it came down to one play."
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy said: "It's a very tough feeling, difficult to be
that close to a Super Bowl and not get it done."
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucs never have gotten it done. Nor have the Rams, whose only Super Bowl
appearance came in the 1979 season, when they beat Tampa Bay 9-0 for the NFC
championship. Then they fell to the Steelers in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   And they aren't likely to get it done if their offense can't get out of its
own way, even if their defense plays "spectacularly," as coach Dick Vermeil
described it.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we showed people we can play every kind of game," said Marshall
Faulk, the NFL Offensive Player of the Year who certainly didn't play his kind
of game. The record-setting running back was held to a total of 49 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   "They wanted to play ball control and take the deep ball away from us. We
did the same to them and thought our offense could make more plays than them."
</P>
<P>
	   They made one more play, offsetting the defensive effort by the Bucs, who
held St. Louis to 309 yards, 91 below its season average.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Rams had to survive a last-ditch march on which they got two of
their five sacks of King, who still managed to lead the Bucs to the St. Louis
22.
</P>
<P>
	   "We made a couple of plays, but I took a couple of sacks, and that's a no-no
at that time," said King, who finished 13-of-29 for 163 yards and two
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
	   A video review that overturned an 11-yard reception by Bert Emanuel hurt
Tampa Bay with 47 seconds remaining. King then threw two incompletions, and the
sellout crowd reached supersonic noise levels in the Trans World Dome.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we showed the NFL and the world something today," Rams defensive
tackle D'Marco Farr said. "The Bucs thought their defense was going to come in
here and walk all over us. We held them without a touchdown and proved that we
are a pretty good defensive team."
</P>
<P>
	   It helped that Tampa Bay was more inept on offense than the usually
quick-striking Rams. The Bucs gained just 203 yards and were held to Martin
Gramatica's two field goals, while the Rams got one field goal, a safety off a
poor snap, and Warner's dramatic strike to Proehl.
</P>
<P>
	   At the end, as the players gathered around a stage for the trophy
presentation, the cheering never abated.
</P>
<P>
	   Bly waved a victory towel as he raced around the field, while other Rams
simply hugged and reveled in their first trip to the Super Bowl in 20 years,
when they played in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Yes, the team with the worst record of the 1990s heading into this season
will play for the NFL championship next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know what we are up against," said Vermeil, the NFL Coach of the Year.
"We know we have to improve next week."
</P>
<P>
	   That's because the powerhouse offense that dominated the NFC this season
sputtered in the face of Tampa's speedy, physical defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner was stymied by the Bucs' zone and heavy pressure. He finished
26-for-43 for 258 yards. He often threw behind receivers, including on a
critical interception by Hardy Nickerson at the Tampa 3 in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, Warner was picked off three times as the Bucs tamed an attack that
romped past nearly everyone else.
</P>
<P>
	   "We just never really finished drives to put this game out of reach," Warner
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Faulk, who set an NFL record with 2,429 yards from scrimmage this season,
was held to 44 yards rushing on 17 carries and three catches for 5 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucs' offense was ordinary, as expected. But it was enough to build a
late lead as rookie Gramatica kicked field goals on the first series of each
half for Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   The staunch defenses turned it into a game of punting and turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay got a takeaway on the first play when defensive end Steve White
tipped and intercepted an attempted screen pass. A drop in the end zone by
Jacquez Green made the Bucs settle for Gramatica's 25-yard field goal and a
surprisingly quick lead.
</P>
<P>
	   But that was all they would get in the first half. St. Louis was more
effective moving the ball, but no better at reaching the end zone.
</P>
<P>
	   After Gramatica's kick, the Rams put together one of their typical drives,
but it yielded only three points. They marched 74 yards in 16 plays and got Jeff
Wilkins' 24-yarder to tie it.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis had a 159-75 yardage edge through 30 minutes. Yet it led only 5-3,
thanks to a high snap by Pro Bowl center Tony Mayberry with King in the shotgun.
King scrambled back to knock the ball out of the end zone for the safety.
</P>
<P>
	   Just as they did to open the game, the Bucs scored on their first possession
of the second half. Gramatica nailed a 23-yarder, set up when Green made a
32-yard reception and Taje Allen was hit with a facemask penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   The baseball-like 6-5 lead stood far longer than anyone could have expected.
In the end, though, St. Louis found its touch. Just once, but that was enough to
send them to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   "The stadium there is the Georgia Dome," said Vermeil, looking at Rams owner
Georgia Frontiere. "We're taking Georgia to Georgia."

<HEADLINE> 'Hurricane' Carter Praises Movie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rubin "Hurricane" Carter, who recently criticized the
movie that chronicled his life, lavished praise on it Sunday as he presented a
film clip at the Golden Globe awards.
</P>
<P>
	   "I only have 27 seconds. And you know I can't open my mouth in 27 seconds,"
said the former boxer, who was wrongfully convicted of three murders in 1966 and
spent 19 years in prison. "But I am indeed honored that a film about the story
of my life has been nominated for a Golden Globe award."
</P>
<P>
	   Denzel Washington plays Carter in the movie "The Hurricane." Carter, who now
works as an advocate for prisoners who believe they are innocent, emphasized
that he's still enjoying an "ongoing life.
</P>
<P>
	   "Notice that," he said. "A life in progress."
</P>
<P>
	   The movie was criticized for liberties the filmmakers took with facts,
including the suggestion that members of a Canadian commune were solely
responsible for overturning Carter's conviction by discovering evidence that was
suppressed.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter himself pointed out the discrepancy, crediting his lawyers for much
of the work that set him free.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Sunday, Carter only praised the film, telling the audience he was
"proud and pleased" to share the clip.
</P>
<P>
	   "Norman," he told director Norman Jewison, "your direction captures the very
essence of humanity, the ability to grow beyond our feeble preoccupations and go
beyond our weak and selfish selves."

<HEADLINE> McCain Says One Campaign Is Enough  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WOLFEBORO, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain says he's having a great time
campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination, but one presidential run
is enough.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would never do this again. I'm too tired,'' McCain told reporters who
surrounded him on his campaign bus Sunday. ``I think it's fun once. I don't see
how it's fun twice.''
</P>
<P>
	   At that point, his wife Cindy, who had just gotten off a cell phone after
speaking with one of their daughters, piped up and said, ``You've got my vote.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain clarified that if he upset front-runner George W. Bush and won the
GOP presidential nomination, then went on to win the White House, he would run
for re-election. But he said he would go as long as he can without Secret
Service protection.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, 63, said the campaign is ``very, very hard on our kids,'' who stay
back in the senator's home state of Arizona while he and his wife travel. McCain
has seven children, including three from a previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't get it, how people keep going back and back and back,'' said
McCain, who is serving his third term in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   A Navy veteran and former prisoner of war in Vietnam, McCain added that he
gets physically tired sometimes, and often drinks between eight and 10 cups of
coffee per day. He sipped coffee while talking with reporters Sunday, and twice
dug his hands into a giant bag of gummy bears candy.
</P>
<P>
	   As an example of the fatigue he says he sometimes suffers, McCain, who is
locked in a tight race here with Texas Gov. George W. Bush, said that when a
fire alarm sounded in his hotel early Sunday morning, he turned to his wife and
said, ``Forget about it. I'd rather burn to death.''

<HEADLINE> Backstage at Golden Globe Awards  </HEADLINE>
    By BETH HARRIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Halle Berry, often singled out as one of
Hollywood's most beautiful women, scored a Golden Globe victory for her inner
self.
</P>
<P>
	   Berry won for best actress in a miniseries or TV movie for "Introducing
Dorothy Dandridge." She also co-produced the true story about the first black
woman to be nominated for a best actress Academy Award.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is for my hard work and my stamina and my ability to keep going when
other people said no," Berry said backstage, tears streaming down her face.
</P>
<P>
	   "I finally feel a part of Hollywood and that feels so good," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Berry shopped the Dandridge story to major studios and other cable channels
without success until HBO accepted it. She compared her struggle to find quality
parts to that of Dandridge, an Oscar nominee in the 1950s for "Carmen Jones."
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes I don't get a shot at roles because the directors and producers
say, 'I don't want to go black,"' she said. "So sometimes I don't even get in
the room.
</P>
<P>
	   "In just five seconds, by announcing my name, hopefully that burden will be
removed from me," she said. "This is for my inner self and my struggle."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Jack Lemmon won't be giving his Golden Globe for best actor in a miniseries
or TV movie to Ving Rhames.
</P>
<P>
	   "In his spirit, I gave it to me," Lemmon said.
</P>
<P>
	   A few years ago, Rhames spontaneously gave his Golden Globe to Lemmon, who
had presented him with it.
</P>
<P>
	   Lemmon was nominated in the category for his roles in both "Inherit the
Wind" and "Oprah Winfrey Presents: Tuesdays With Morrie." He won for "Inherit
the Wind."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Michael J. Fox went out a winner.
</P>
<P>
	   The actor who has Parkinson's disease said last week that he's leaving his
hit ABC series "Spin City," where he also had producing duties.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd love to see this show carry on and if it does, I might even pop in now
and then," he said backstage after winning as best actor in a comedy series.
"There's a lot of people I'd like to see hang onto their jobs."
</P>
<P>
	   Fox said he will act again, but that the rigors of acting and producing 26
episodes of a weekly TV show was too taxing.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Fonda's victory came at a price.
</P>
<P>
	   His win for best supporting actor in a series, miniseries or TV movie for
"Passion of Ayn Rand" cost him $2,000, a bet he made with an anonymous friend.
</P>
<P>
	   "I lost $2,000, but this is better," he said backstage. "What an affirmation
that I did my job."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked what he was going to do next, Fonda said: "I'm going to try to get
that $2,000 back and buy a magnum of Dom and get utterly wasted."

<HEADLINE> Contradiction Found in Bush Campaign  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MASON CITY, Iowa (AP) -- The Bush campaign got caught in a contradiction
Sunday about how the candidate will be made available in the future for
questioning on the issues.
</P>
<P>
	   One spokeswoman, Mindy Tucker, said formal meetings between reporters and
GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush were being cut back because they
can harm ``the message of the day.''
</P>
<P>
	   During one such formal news conference on Thursday in Pella, the Texas
governor was peppered with abortion questions and not about the issue that had
been his focus on the stump, tax cuts. He later complained about the news
conference to aides back in Austin, Texas, according to sources within the Bush
camp.
</P>
<P>
	   After Tucker's statement, the campaign's communications chief, Karen Hughes,
said her aide had misspoken. Hughes said Bush would continue to be available,
but on an informal basis that befits the ``much more drop-in, much more
drop-by'' campaign style of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   She said the Pella news conference had no impact on the decision. She also
noted that Bush had engaged in impromptu, informal meetings with reporters since
the news conference, and that the governor also underwent questioning on two
nationally televised talk shows over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Referring to New Hampshire, where the presidential campaign moves after
Monday's Iowa caucuses, Hughes said: ``The nature of New Hampshire politics is
much more informal, much more drop-in, much more drop-by, and we're going to be
doing quite a bit of that in New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes' comments were much more tepid than the statements made by her aide,
who has been accompanying the traveling press corps.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not going to have one big, fat news conference on our schedule where
everyone can come and ask about what you think the news is,'' Tucker told
reporters midday Sunday aboard a campaign bus traveling from Waterloo to the
local airport.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not in our best interest. We have a message of the day, and we want
to stick with it,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the short flight from Waterloo to Mason City, Tucker added: ``We are
going to have news conferences when we have news to put out, and if you have
questions, we'll do our best to make him available.''
</P>
<P>
	   After Bush spoke to a community audience at North Iowa Area Community
College in Mason City, Hughes made her clarification.

<HEADLINE> Andrew Cuomo May Run For N.Y. Gov.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, N.Y. (AP) -- Federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, son of former
New York Governor Mario Cuomo, said Sunday he's considering running for the
office his father once held.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to focus on the presidential (election), then look at all the
options,'' Cuomo said after an afternoon hunting outing with Assembly Majority
Leader Michael Bragman and Buffalo-area Assemblyman Dick Smith at a 5,000-acre
wildlife preserve.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An option that I would take a serious look at is coming back and running
for governor,'' Cuomo said. ``New York is home. I want to come back to New York.
The only question is when.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo's interest in following his father, who served three terms before
losing to Republican George Pataki in 1994, could pit him against another
Democrat, state Comptroller Carl McCall.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall considered challenging Republican Gov. George Pataki in 1998 but
backed down in the face of the governor's healthy poll numbers and bulging
campaign bank account.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Raid Hospital in Thailand  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- About 10 men from the Myanmar insurgent group God's
Army raided a hospital Monday in western Thailand, demanding that the doctors
treat their injured, the Thai interior minister said.
</P>
<P>
	   The insurgents also wanted Thai authorities to open the border to allow
God's Army to seek refuge in Thailand, Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart
told a radio station.
</P>
<P>
	   The ITV television network reported that the armed men raided the hospital
around 7 a.m., and police soon surrounded the building in the town of
Ratchaburi, 60 miles west of Bangkok and 30 miles east of the border with
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
	   The raiders, wearing camouflage and armed with hand grenades and assault
rifles, tied a grenade to the hospital gate and fired guns in the air, the
station reported.
</P>
<P>
	   They seized the hospital's emergency room, it reported. There were no
immediate reports of any casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanan said he was flying to the scene with the Thai national police chief,
Gen. Pracha Promnok, and would coordinate negotiations with the rebels
personally.
</P>
<P>
	   Thai special forces would also be sent to the scene, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   God's Army is an insurgent guerrilla group of 200 mostly ethnic Karen
fighters battling the military regime in Myanmar. It is led by 12-year-old twin
boys named Luther and Johnny Htoo. Their followers believe the boys have
mystical powers that make them invulnerable during battles.
</P>
<P>
	   The group has given shelter to the five student rebels who raided the
Myanmar Embassy Oct. 1-2 in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
	   The students were demanding democracy in their homeland, which has been
ruled by the military since 1962. The students were given their freedom by the
Thai authorities in return for the safe release of the hostages from the
embassy.

<HEADLINE> Andrew Cuomo says he might be in the hunt for governor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SAVANNAH, N.Y. (AP) - Federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo bagged a
couple of pheasants during a hunting expedition on Sunday, then trained his
sights on the future.
<P>
	   "I want to focus on the presidential (election), then look at all the
options," Cuomo said after an afternoon outing with Assembly Majority Leader
Michael Bragman and Buffalo-area Assemblyman Dick Smith at a 5,000-acre wildlife
preserve owned by mall developer Robert Congel. "An option that I would take a
serious look at is coming back and running for governor. That's whether or not
(Al) Gore wins. I've been in Washington. I've been there for seven years. New
York is home. I want to come back to New York. The only question is when. I've
made no commitments and no promises, so I'll reassess everything after
November."
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo, a staunch proponent of developing the Erie Canal into a tourist
mecca, didn't hesitate in assessing the performance of Republican George Pataki,
who is halfway through his second four-year term as governor and, with more than
$2.3 million on hand, considering another run.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going on six years now, and the upstate New York economy is not doing
well, period," said Cuomo, the eldest son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo. "The
upstate economy is doing better than it was - no kidding - because the whole
national economy is doing better. Every state is up. The question is relative
progress, and when you look at the relative progress of upstate New York, it's
depressing."
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo said that if upstate were analyzed as a state, without including New
York City, it would rank 48th in economic growth. "To the extent that state
numbers are getting better, it's only New York City," he said. "Wall Street."
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo's interest in following his father, who served three terms before
losing to Pataki in 1994, could pit him against state Comptroller H. Carl
McCall, the only black ever elected to statewide office in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall considered challenging Pataki in 1998 but backed down in the face of
the governor's healthy poll numbers and bulging campaign bank account.
Ironically, Bragman is leading an advisory committee to help promote McCall's
potential candidacy, while Andrew Cuomo has yet to form a state campaign
committee and has not begun raising money for a possible gubernatorial campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is way premature," Cuomo said. "This is three years away. You don't
know who's going to run, you don't know what the circumstances are going to be,
and I don't even think it's productive to engage this race this early. There's a
lot between here and there. I don't think anything that divides the Democratic
Party is a good thing now. We have the luxury of basic unity as a party, which
we don't have often. Let's stay unified."
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo, Bragman, Smith and Congel all were unified in one thing - their
support of the Erie Canal.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have a passion to see the upstate New York economy improve to where it
should be, and I've always admired the Erie Canal," said Congel, whose Pyramid
Cos. have developed more than 20 malls in the Northeast. "We have a
multimillion-dollar infrastructure that functions that just isn't utilized. I
believe it would be a gigantic economic boom for all of upstate New York, and I
have a passion to see it happen. All that needs to be done is to market it
properly."
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo, as HUD secretary, is threatening to sue gun manufacturers unless they
adopt a code of conduct and take other steps to keep guns away from kids and
criminals. But he said he saw no conflict in donning camouflage on this wintry
day and grabbing his 12-gauge Remington shotgun for the hunt near the Montezuma
Wildlife Refuge west of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
	   "I enjoy the outdoors," he said. "I consider myself a sportsman. I enjoy
hunting, I enjoy fishing. It's a very important part of our heritage. I think
it's something that we have to recognize and respect and nurture, and I'm proud
of it. I'm also pro gun safety and pro the intelligent marketing and
distribution of guns. But the two are not inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can be a hunter, a conservationist, and a Democrat. Just because you
are pro gun safety doesn't mean you're anti-gun."

<HEADLINE> Carrey Wins Best Actor At Globes  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Jim Carrey, who gave an uncanny impersonation
of the late comic Andy Kaufman in "Man on the Moon," won the Golden Globe as
best actor in a movie comedy on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Second year in a row -- what's going on here man?" said Carrey, who picked
up the best dramatic actor Golden Globe last year for "The Truman Show." "I'm
the establishment I once rejected. ... I'm the Tom Hanks of the Golden Globes."
</P>
<P>
	   British actress Janet McTeer won best actress in a musical or comedy film
for her performance as a Southern mom in "Tumbleweeds."
</P>
<P>
	   The award for best actress in a dramatic film went to Hilary Swank for the
real-life story "Boys Don't Cry," in which she played a young woman who was
killed after her masquerade as a man was discovered.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Cruise of "Magnolia" and Angelina Jolie of "Girl, Interrupted" won
motion picture supporting actor honors.
</P>
<P>
	   A poignant moment in the television categories came when Michael J. Fox was
named best actor for the comedy "Spin City," which he announced he is leaving
because of his fight against Parkinson's disease. But he handled it lightly.
</P>
<P>
	   "Actor out of work -- news at 11," Fox said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Wow. God, I didn't expect this," Cruise said, then thanked wife Nicole
Kidman, who couldn't attend because of work. "Her generosity, her support, her
sacrifices, her talent -- she inspires me."
</P>
<P>
	   Cruise played a TV guru who pitches a "seduce-and-destroy" program to men in
the ensemble drama "Magnolia."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's great to see the view from up here," said Jolie, who plays a manic
sociopath in "Girl, Interrupted."
</P>
<P>
	   In the television categories, cable channel HBO and its stars were big
winners.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Sopranos" was named best drama series and dramatic acting trophies went
to Edie Falco and James Gandolfini. The acclaimed mob drama also earned a
supporting actress trophy for Nancy Marchand.
</P>
<P>
	   HBO's other winners were "Sex and the City" as best TV comedy, its star
Sarah Jessica Parker as best actress, "RKO 281" as best miniseries or
made-for-TV movie, and Halle Berry as best actress in a miniseries for
"Introducing Dorothy Dandridge."
</P>
<P>
	   Among other TV winners, Jack Lemmon was named best miniseries or TV movie
actor for Showtime's "Inherit the Wind."
</P>
<P>
	   "In the spirit of Ving Rhames I'm going to give this to Jack Lemmon," Lemmon
said, lightheartedly recalling the year in which winner Rhames gave his trophy
to Lemmon.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Fonda was TV's best supporting actor, for the Showtime miniseries
"Passion of Ayn Rand."
</P>
<P>
	   American Beauty" was the leading movie contender going into this year's
Golden Globes, a ceremony which can serve as a signpost to what will come at the
Oscars. The dark suburban fable gained six Golden Globe nominations, including
best dramatic picture, dramatic actress for Annette Bening, and dramatic actor
for Kevin Spacey.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC broadcast this year's awards, selected by reporters from the Hollywood
Foreign Press Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Barbra Streisand, winner of more Golden Globe trophies than any other
entertainer, including best actress for "Funny Girl" and "A Star is Born,"
received the Cecil B. DeMille Award for "outstanding contribution to the
entertainment field."
</P>
<P>
	   The tribute, which forced presenter Shirley MacLaine to vamp when the
TelePrompTer didn't work, chewed up a lengthy chunk of the slow-paced show's
last hour.
</P>
<P>
	   "Someone asked me recently if they should be an actor and I said, 'If you
have to ask then the answer is no, because the only reason to chose that life
for yourself is because you feel passionate about it, because you have no other
choice," Streisand said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some movies that received awards buzz were largely ignored. They included
"The Green Mile" starring Tom Hanks, "Anna and the King" with Jodie Foster, and
"Angela's Ashes" starring Emily Watson. Stanley Kubrick's final film, "Eyes Wide
Shut," received just one nomination, for best score.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden Globe shows have come to be known for bordering on the giddy.
</P>
<P>

Cold, Rain Cause Mass Outages in Ga.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- As rain and freezing temperatures spread a coat of ice
across parts of Georgia today, more than a half-million customers lost
electrical service. Many of those households and businesses could be without
power until at least Tuesday as crews struggle over slippery roads to reach
downed lines and ice-coated tree limbs continue to snap, pulling down more.
Georgia Power, which serves 1.8 million customers, restored service to about
140,000 homes and businesses early this evening, said company spokeswoman Lisa
Frederick.

Elian's Grandmothers Pray in NYC

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez blew kisses and wiped
away tears as they stood before 2,000 people praying in a Manhattan church today
for the 6-year-old boy's return to Cuba. The two women, Raquel Rodriguez and
Mariela Quintana, did not speak as worshippers at the interdenominational
Riverside Church gave them a standing ovation. The U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service has ordered the boy returned to Cuba. His great-uncle has
filed suit to stop the INS. And lawmakers in Congress plan an attempt this week
to declare Elian a U.S. citizen. If such legislation becomes law, the boy no
longer would be an immigrant under INS jurisdiction.

<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- About 10 armed men from the Myanmar insurgent
group God's Army raided a hospital in western Thailand on Monday, demanding that
the doctors treat their injured, the Thai interior minister said. The insurgents
also wanted Thai authorities to open the border to allow God's Army to seek
refuge in Thailand, Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart told a radio station.
God's Army is an insurgent guerrilla group of about 200 mostly ethnic Karen
fighters battling the military regime in Myanmar. They have given shelter to the
five student rebels who raided the Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok Oct. 1-2.

Sikh temple today returned a short time later and opened fire with a gun,
killing a man, authorities said. The alleged gunman was hospitalized, but
authorities did not say why. Sgt. Joe Caruso of the Contra Costa County
Sheriff's Department said the suspect was not a member of the temple, but had
asked to speak. His request was denied, he left, came back and approached the
man who told him he could not speak. He fired several times, authorities said.
One of those shots struck the 46-year-old man in the head, killing him.

<HEADLINE> China Arrests Underground Catholics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Authorities in northern China have arrested five members of
the underground Roman Catholic church, including a bishop who already has spent
some two decades in jail, a monitoring group said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Han Dingxiang, the 63-year-old bishop of Yongnian in northern Hebei
province, was arrested on or around Dec. 1, 1999, when he was leading a
religious retreat in Hebei's capital, Shijiazhuang, the U.S.-based Cardinal Kung
Foundation said.
</P>
<P>
	   The group said Han has previously served about 20 years in jail. While Han
has also often been detained for short periods and then released, he has now
been in detention for nearly two months, the group said. It added that it did
not know where he was being detained.
</P>
<P>
	   China's officially atheist communist government requires that Christians of
all denominations worship in state-registered churches. Millions of Christians,
however, prefer instead to worship in unofficial churches -- known as ``house
churches'' because they are held in private homes -- risking arrest, fines and
official harassment.
</P>
<P>
	   The government also does not allow the state-controlled official Catholic
church to recognize papal authority. In a further challenge to the Vatican, the
official church ordained five bishops on Jan. 6, the same day Pope John Paul II
presided over the ordinations of 12 bishops from seven other countries.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the crackdown on the unofficial church in Hebei, a center of
resistance to the state-controlled church, police also arrested Wang Chengqun, a
Catholic lay leader from Baoding city, shortly before Christmas, the Cardinal
Kung Foundation said. It said Wang is now being held in a labor camp in the
province's Gaoyang county.
</P>
<P>
	   Wang has been arrested seven times, spending a total of around 10 years in
detention, over the past 20 years, the group said. He suffered a stroke, leaving
him partially paralyzed, during his last spell in a labor camp in 1997, it
added.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese authorities also are holding two Catholic priests, Guo Yibao and
Wang Zhenhe, in a detention center in Hebei's Xushui county, the group said. Guo
and Wang, both from Anjia township in Xushui, were arrested last Easter as they
were on their way to deliver mass, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another priest from Hebei, Xie Guolin, also was detained in 1999, but the
foundation said it had no other details about his arrest.

<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Rookie Roman Lyashenko scored goals 10 seconds apart early
in the third period Sunday night, lifting the Dallas Stars to a 3-2 comeback win
over the Chicago Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
	   Lyashenko, who had just two goals in 25 previous games, tied it 2-2 at 1:02
after picking off Bryan McCabe's pass. He then beat Jocelyn Thibault for the
game-winner from the right circle.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Modano also scored for Dallas, which has won three of its last four
games and improved its league-best road record to 13-9-4.
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Gilmour had a goal and assist for the Blackhawks, who have lost three
straight and four of five. Michael Nylander also scored for Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   Thibault stopped 19 shots and Dallas' Ed Belfour blocked 24.
</P>
<P>
	   Nylander opened the scoring with a power-play goal, set up by Gilmour's
behind-the-back centering pass, at 6:24. Gilmour made it 2-0 at 13:58 by popping
a rebound past Belfour after Tony Amonte had driven to the net.
</P>
<P>
	   Modano cut it to 2-1 with 1:13 left in the period, during a Dallas power
play, with a knee-high deflection of Darryl Sydor's shot from the left point.
</P>
<P>
	   In the second period, Amonte swept a deflection from mid-air into the net
with 3:04 left, but the goal was disallowed after video review showed his stick
was above his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
	   Lyashenko tied it 2-2 at 1:02 of the third. After intercepting McCabe's
pass, he raced in alone and beat Thibault with a high shot. The game-winner was
a short-side shot over Thibault's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
	   The Stars' team record for the fastest two goals by one player is seven
seconds, set by Bill Goldsworthy in 1971.

<HEADLINE> Rockets 101, Heat 88  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL A. LUTZ AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOUSTON (AP) -- Matt Bullard scored a season-high 24 points and led a
3-point barrage as the Houston Rockets beat the Miami Heat 101-88 to extend
their winning streak to six games.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rockets hit 15 of 31 3-pointers. Their previous season high was
13-for-32 on Nov. 20 at Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rockets led 46-40 at the half and saved their big punch for the third
quarter when they shot 11-of-17 overall and 6-for-6 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
	   Bullard had 13 points in the period, nine coming on 3-pointers, as the
Rockets took a 78-61 lead into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Hakeem Olajuwon got the final period started with a crowd-pleasing "Dream
Shake" jumper, and Bullard added another 3-pointer to keep the pressure building
against the stunned Heat.
</P>
<P>
	   Bullard was 6-for-10 on 3-pointers and Cuttino Mobley added 18 points,
including 4-for-6 on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   Alonzo Mourning led the Heat with 23 points and 11 rebounds and Voshon
Lenard put on a late spurt and finished with 20 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Heat built a 29-22 lead early in the second quarter, but Mobley came in
and scored 13 points, fueling a 20-5 run by the Rockets for a 42-34 lead with
2:53 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
	   Mobley started the rally with two 3-point baskets, and after Kenny Thomas
and Walt Williams added 3-pointers, Mobley hit another shot, Francis hit two
free throws and Kelvin Cato had a three-point play.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory ended an eight-game losing streak against the Heat and also
stopped a 10-game losing streak to teams coached by Heat coach Pat Riley.

<HEADLINE> Coyotes 3, Sharks 2, OT  </HEADLINE>
    By MEL REISNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Jyrki Lumme flipped the winning goal into the net with 44
seconds left in overtime and sent the Phoenix Coyotes to a 3-2 victory over the
San Jose Sharks on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory kept Phoenix in first place in the Pacific Division with its
division-leading 26th victory. The Coyotes are 10-4 in their division and 20-9-2
against Western Conference, the best marks in the conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Keith Tkachuk assisted on the winner, passing to Lumme about 15 feet out in
the slot while being knocked to the ice. San Jose goaltender Steve Shields, who
was at the side of the crease and could only flail at the puck as it flew past.
</P>
<P>
	   The game started hours after Carolina traded Keith Primeau to Philadelphia,
ending speculation that Coyotes owner Richard Burke wanted to unload Tkachuk and
his $8.3 million salary to acquire Primeau in a three-way deal involving the
Hurricanes and New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
	   Signs supporting Tkachuk dotted the America West Arena, where Burke claims
to have lost $23 million in the last two seasons. One said, "Keep Tkachuk, Trade
Bobby Smith" -- a reference to the Coyotes general manager.
</P>
<P>
	   Rick Tocchet and Louie DeBrusk scored earlier for the Coyotes, and Todd
Harvey and Owen Nolan had third-period goals as the Sharks surged back.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes' Sean Burke made 28 saves, including 12 in the third period. But
Burke allowed two goals in the final period as the Coyotes blew a two-goal lead
in the third for the second time in three games.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, though, the Coyotes recovered thanks to Lumme's seventh goal and
99th of his career. It was the Swedish defenseman's 400th career point.
</P>
<P>
	   Nolan got his 30th goal on a one-timer with 7:25 remaining in regulation.
Harvey broke up Burke's shutout on 2:09 earlier, scoring on a rebound for the
Sharks' third power-play goal in their last two games.
</P>
<P>
	   Until then, the Coyotes had killed 29 of the last 30 penalties against them.
</P>
<P>
	   Tocchet also had a power-play goal, deflecting a slap shot by Keith Carney
9:33 into the game. It made him the seventh Coyotes player with 10 or more goals
this season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes peppered Shields with nine shots in the first seven minutes of
the second period, and DeBrusk made it 2-0 at the 5:00 mark when he took a slap
shot on the fly from above the circle.
</P>
<P>
	   Shields made 30 saves.

<HEADLINE> Speedskating Records Broken  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUTTE, Mont. (AP) -- Chris Witty of West Allis, Wis., and Hiroyasu Shimizu
of Japan set world outdoor records Sunday at the fourth Essent World Cup
speedskating sprints.
</P>
<P>
	Witty covered the women's 1,000 meters in 1 minutes, 16.96 seconds, nearly a
full second ahead of runnerup Edel Therese Hoiseth of Norway.
</P>
<P>
	``Perfect day and perfect ice,'' said Witty, who broke the 1:18.75 track record
she set Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	The Nagano Olympics double medalist said she didn't realize she was skating at
outdoor record pace ``until the backstretch and I had 200 meters to go, and I
could hear the coaches say, `You have a good one going.'
</P>
<P>
	The world record is 1:14.61, held by Germany's Monique Garbrecht, who finished
third in 1:18.12.
</P>
<P>
	Shimizu, the reigning Olympic champion, won the men's 500 meters in an outdoor
record 35.27 seconds, which also beat the 35.51-second course record he and
Canadian Jeremy Wotherspoon set in tying for the win on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	Shimizu said he can now focus on regaining 500-meter world record that
Wortherspoon wrestled from him on Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
	Wortherspoon tied again, this time for second place with teammate Michael
Ireland, in 35.57.
</P>
<P>
	Casey FitzRandolph of Verona, Wis., was the top American finisher, placing
sixth in 35.99.
</P>
<P>
	Wotherspoon won the men's 1,000 meters in 1:10.56, just .12 seconds off his
track record set Saturday. Ireland was second in 1:10.73 and Erben Wennemars of
the Netherlands was third in 1:10.76. FitzRandolph was fourth in 1:11.06.
</P>
<P>
	Eriko Sanmiya of Japan won the women's 500 meters in a track record 39.0
seconds, followed by Canadian Catriona Lemay-Doan in 39.08 and Svetlana Zhurova
of Russia in 39.09.
</P>
<P>
	Witty was ninth in 39.66.
</P>
<P>
	Garbrecht easily held her World Cup overall lead in the women's 500 and 1,000
standings, while Shimizu leads in the men's 500 and Wotherspoon in the 1,000
going into next weekend's final World Cup event in Calgary.

<HEADLINE> Flyers 4, Penguins 4, OT  </HEADLINE>
    By ALAN ROBINSON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- John LeClair scored with a minute to play and the
Philadelphia Flyers tied the Pittsburgh Penguins 4-4 Sunday night despite
squandering a third-period lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Penguins led 2-0, fell behind 3-2 as the Flyers' top-ranked power play
scored twice, then took back the lead at 4-3 on goals by Jiri Slegr and Robbie
Brown 1:04 apart in the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   But with the Penguins trying to run out the clock and win for the second
time in seven games, LeClair directed the puck past Tom Barrasso at 19:00 of the
third -- his 26th goal and 11th in his last 15 games against the Penguins.
</P>
<P>
	   The Penguins, playing their third consecutive game without the injured
Jaromir Jagr (ribs), remained winless in overtime -- 0-5-4. The Flyers, also
without their star as Eric Lindros sat out with a concussion, are 3-2-7 in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   The Flyers had been held to three goals while going 0-3-1 in their previous
four games.
</P>
<P>
	   Slegr made it 3-3 at 6:06 of the third with a shot through traffic from just
inside the top of the left circle that eluded rookie goaltender Brian Boucher,
who had allowed two goals in his previous two starts.
</P>
<P>
	   Slegr, scoreless for 16 games, was so happy he finally scored that he took
several strides on skates and banged his chest into the glass along the
left-wing boards.
</P>
<P>
	   The Penguins, outshot 33-16 at the time and 39-27 overall, retook the lead
at 7:10 when Brown, stationed along the goal line, punched in the rebound of Jan
Hrdina's shot for sixth goal and second in as many nights. He also scored in
Pittsburgh's 4-2 loss at Montreal on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   German Titov, who criticized coach Herb Brooks last week in a Russian
newspaper interview for his lack of playing time, scored twice in the first 3:02
as the Penguins -- losers of five of six -- jumped into a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   But the lead and the sudden burst of offense from a team that was held to 29
shots in its previous two games didn't hold up.
</P>
<P>
	   The Flyers, reconfiguring their lines with Lindros out and Rod Brind'Amour
gone after being dealt to Carolina for holdout Keith Primeau earlier in the day,
had plenty of scoring chances but couldn't convert enough of them.
</P>
<P>
	   Philadelphia outshot Pittsburgh 20-4 in the first period and killed off a
five-minute Penguins power play early in the second period, yet trailed 2-1
until Marc Bureau scored his second goal at 15:27 of the second.
</P>
<P>
	   Bureau, normally the seldom-used fifth-line center, moved up to the fourth
line to replace Simon Gagne, who shifted to the top line and put the Flyers
ahead 3-2 with a power-play goal at 18:30 of the second.
</P>
<P>
	   Defenseman Eric Desjardins also scored on the power play at 4:51 of the
first, his 11th of the season. The Flyers lead the league with 49 power-play
goals.
</P>
<P>
	   Jagr, the NHL scoring leader, tried to skate earlier Sunday, but appeared to
be in pain and almost certainly won't play Tuesday against the New York Rangers.
He hasn't played since getting hurt just before scoring a goal Jan. 15 in
Nashville.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Stevens Jailed, in Program  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ST. LOUIS (AP) -- New York Rangers forward Kevin Stevens was jailed early
Sunday on a drug charge and later placed in a league substance abuse program.
</P>
<P>
	   Stevens, 34, was arrested at a Collinsville, Ill., motel on misdemeanor
charges of soliciting prostitution and possessing drug paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
	   Police found several grams of suspected crack cocaine, various drug
paraphernalia and about $3,000 in cash in the motel room.
</P>
<P>
	   Stevens gave police a statement admitting he smoked crack cocaine.
Additional felony drug charges against him were pending.
</P>
<P>
	   Pamela J. Velia of St. Louis told police Stevens was smoking crack with a
glass pipe when she got into a cab with him, according to authorities. She said
Stevens gave her $500 in cash and purchased another $500 worth of cocaine from a
street dealer in East St. Louis, Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   Velia said she and Stevens didn't have sex because officers arrived too
soon.
</P>
<P>
	   The cab driver, Alfred Triplett, of East St. Louis, also was arrested. Velia
told police she thought Triplett had a gun and that he wouldn't leave when she
asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Stevens will enter the substance abuse and behavioral program administered
by the NHL and its players' association.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our thoughts are with Kevin and his family at this time," Rangers president
Neil Smith said in a statement. "The New York Rangers' organization will fully
support Kevin in every possible way."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked later about the arrest, the team had no further comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Dave Lewis and Dr. Brian Shaw, the program's doctors, are handling
Stevens' care, which includes medical assessment and in-residence treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Stevens has seen infrequent playing time recently, but was in the lineup
against St. Louis on Saturday night. He has three goals and five assists in 38
games this season.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-time All-Star helped Pittsburgh to Stanley Cup titles in 1991 and
1992. He scored 54 goals for Pittsburgh in 1991-92 and had 55 in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
	   The former Boston College star has 318 goals and 371 assists in 13 seasons
with Pittsburgh, Boston, Los Angeles and New York.

<HEADLINE> Ten Killed on Icy Mo. Interstate  </HEADLINE>
   By JASON STRAIT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PLATTE CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A truck jackknifed on an icy stretch of highway
north of Kansas City on Sunday, causing a fiery, multicar accident that killed
10 people, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   The accident at 1:50 p.m. involved 19 cars and five trucks, many of which
burst into flame, perhaps because one of the trucks leaked hydrochloric acid,
said Sgt. Jack McMillan of the Missouri State Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
	   It took rescue workers over eight hours to reach the final two victims,
whose car was buried at the bottom of the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
	   Nine of the bodies were burned beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
	   Interstate 29 remained closed in both directions into the night.
</P>
<P>
	   Falling snow had covered already icy roads, making driving dangerous across
the region. A truck jackknifed and cars began crashing into it, McMillan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the wrecked vehicles were melted together from the heat of the fire,
which burned for about an hour. The wreckage was still steaming in the cold air
at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Derrick Thomas, a star linebacker for the Kansas City Chiefs, was seriously
injured in a separate, one-vehicle crash. A spokeswoman for Liberty Hospital
said the football player was there, but declined to confirm reports that his
back had been injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Chiefs' spokesman Bob Moore said another person in the vehicle with Thomas
had died.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Terrell Brandon wasted little time re-establishing
himself as the driving force behind the Timberwolves' offense as Minnesota set a
team record with its fifth straight road win.
</P>
<P>
	   Brandon, returning to the Minnesota lineup after missing three games with a
strained right calf, had 15 points and nine assists as the Timberwolves defeated
Golden State 99-81 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Garnett had 22 points and 15 rebounds for Minnesota, which has won
nine of its last 10 road games. Before the recent streak of success, the
Timberwolves had lost 17 of 18 away from home in a stretch that began last
season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Timberwolves have won four straight overall and 15 of their last 18.
</P>
<P>
	   Mookie Blaylock had 14 points and Jason Caffey added 13 for Golden State,
which had won its previous two games after snapping a 12-game losing streak. But
Antawn Jamison, who scored 32 and 37 points in those two victories, had just
seven points on 3-for-15 shooting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Garnett, who guarded Jamison for most of the evening, had three steals and
committed only one foul in 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   After leading by 11 points at halftime, the Timberwolves extended their lead
to 80-59 entering the fourth quarter. The margin grew to 27 points late in the
final period.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden State starting center Donyell Marshall left the game early in the
second quarter with bruised ribs and played just six minutes the rest of the
game. The Warriors said X-rays were negative.

<HEADLINE> American Beauty Wins at Globes  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- "American Beauty," a dark fable of life in
suburbia, captured the Golden Globes for best drama, director and screenplay
Sunday night, while "Toy Story 2" was judged the best comedy movie.
</P>
<P>
	   Denzel Washington's portrayal of a boxer wrongly convicted of murder and Jim
Carrey's uncanny impersonation of the late comic Andy Kaufman won top movie
actor honors as real-life stories ruled at the awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
	   Picking up his Globe for best dramatic movie actor, Washington was
accompanied to the stage by Rubin "Hurricane" Carter, whose story was told in
the film "The Hurricane."
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything that has happened with this film and this moment is about the
love that has come from him," Washington said.
</P>
<P>
	   Carrey was named best movie comedy actor for "Man on the Moon." A year ago
he won best dramatic actor for "The Truman Show."
</P>
<P>
	   "Second year in a row -- what's going on here man?" said Carrey. "I'm the
establishment I once rejected. ... I'm the Tom Hanks of the Golden Globes."
</P>
<P>
	   The best dramatic film actress Globe also emerged from a true story. Hilary
Swank won for her breakout role in "Boys Don't Cry," in which she played a young
woman who was killed after her masquerade as a man was discovered.
</P>
<P>
	   British actress Janet McTeer won best actress in a musical or comedy film
for her performance as a Southern mom in "Tumbleweeds."
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Cruise of "Magnolia" and Angelina Jolie of "Girl, Interrupted" won
motion picture supporting actor honors.
</P>
<P>
	   "All About My Mother," from Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodovar, won the
foreign-language movie award.
</P>
<P>
	   A poignant moment in the television categories came when Michael J. Fox was
named best actor for the comedy "Spin City," which he announced he is leaving
because of his fight against Parkinson's disease. But he handled it lightly.
</P>
<P>
	   "Actor out of work -- news at 11," Fox said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the television categories, cable channel HBO and its stars were big
winners.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Sopranos," which won few major awards at the Emmys last year, was named
best drama series and dramatic acting trophies went to Edie Falco and James
Gandolfini. The acclaimed mob drama also earned a supporting actress trophy for
Nancy Marchand.
</P>
<P>
	   HBO's other winners were "Sex and the City" as best TV comedy, its star
Sarah Jessica Parker as best actress, "RKO 281" as best miniseries or
made-for-TV movie, and Halle Berry as best actress in a miniseries for
"Introducing Dorothy Dandridge."
</P>
<P>
	   Among other TV winners, Jack Lemmon was named best miniseries or TV movie
actor for Showtime's "Inherit the Wind."
</P>
<P>
	   "In the spirit of Ving Rhames I'm going to give this to Jack Lemmon," Lemmon
said, lightheartedly recalling the year in which winner Rhames gave his trophy
to Lemmon.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Fonda was TV's best supporting actor, for the Showtime miniseries
"Passion of Ayn Rand."
</P>
<P>
	   "American Beauty" was the leading movie contender going into this year's
Golden Globes, a ceremony which can serve as a bellwether for the upcoming
Oscars. The film had six nominees, including actress Annette Bening and actor
Kevin Spacey.
</P>
<P>
	   Barbra Streisand, winner of more Golden Globe trophies than any other
entertainer, including best actress for "Funny Girl" and "A Star is Born,"
received the Cecil B. DeMille Award for "outstanding contribution to the
entertainment field."
</P>
<P>
	   The tribute, which forced presenter Shirley MacLaine to vamp when the
TelePrompTer didn't work, chewed up a lengthy chunk of the slow-paced show's
last hour.
</P>
<P>
	   "Someone asked me recently if they should be an actor and I said, 'If you
have to ask then the answer is no, because the only reason to chose that life
for yourself is because you feel passionate about it, because you have no other
choice," Streisand said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some movies that received awards buzz were largely ignored. They included
"The Green Mile" starring Hanks, "Anna and the King" with Jodie Foster, and
"Angela's Ashes" starring Emily Watson. Stanley Kubrick's final film, "Eyes Wide
Shut," received just one nomination, for best score.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC broadcast this year's awards, selected by reporters from the Hollywood
Foreign Press Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden Globe shows have come to be known for bordering on the giddy.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, Jack Nicholson delivered a salty acceptance speech and
Christine Lahti took the stage with toilet paper on her shoe, a reference to the
year she was in the ladies' room when her trophy was announced.
</P>
<P>
	   The awards have gained in prestige, but they once were viewed with suspicion
because of allegations of corrupt voting and questionable professionalism.
</P>
<P>
	   The low point came in 1981, when Pia Zadora was given a statue for the bomb
"Butterfly" and networks refused to show the program. After an effort to regain
respectability, the ceremony was welcomed back by television in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, association members quickly returned pricey watches sent to them
by the company that released the Sharon Stone comedy "The Muse."
</P>
<P>
	   "We are not stupid," said association president Helmut Voss. The awards
bring the group $2 million in income and members wouldn't endanger that by
casting doubt on their integrity, he said.

<HEADLINE> No. 1 Cincinnati 72, Marquette 60  </HEADLINE>
    By GREG BEACHAM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Jermaine Tate had 15 points as top-ranked Cincinnati won
its 10th straight game, 72-60 over Marquette on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bearcats jumped to a 27-point halftime lead but allowed two big runs by
the Golden Eagles in the second half. Marquette trailed 58-49 with five minutes
to play but couldn't get any closer.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati's season-long pattern of quick starts and sloppy finishes
continued. With relentless defense and dominating inside play, Cincinnati jumped
out to a 23-2 lead after 12 minutes and led 39-12 at halftime, holding Marquette
to 4-of-26 shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Golden Eagles opened the second half with a 22-6 run of their own,
bringing the crowd roaring into the game. Cincinnati survived with offense from
Steve Logan and Pete Mickeal, who finished with 13 points apiece.
</P>
<P>
	   Tate, the only Cincinnati starter without a double-digit scoring average,
led five Bearcats in double figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Brian Wardle scored 24 of his 28 points in the second half to lead
Marquette.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bearcats (18-1, 6-0 C-USA) remained undefeated in conference play, while
Marquette (11-6, 4-2) lost for just the second time in eight games, with both
defeats coming against Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
	   Defending with tremendous intensity and passing with a fluidity Cincinnati
hasn't always shown this season, the Bearcats looked marvelous in the game's
first 12 minutes. Tate had 12 points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati made its opening run without a basket from leading scorer Kenyon
Martin, who got in foul trouble and received a technical foul as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin picked up his third foul with 2:19 left in the first half, and he
received a technical for protesting. After giving Martin a tongue-lashing, coach
Bob Huggins put Martin on the bench and left him there to start the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   Wardle scored 13 points in the first seven minutes of the second half as the
Golden Eagles suddenly came to life. Marquette trailed just 45-34 with 11:50 to
play before a 10-2 Cincinnati run, capped by a 3-pointer from Mickeal, that
appeared to take the Bearcats out of danger.
</P>
<P>
	   But Marquette came back again and cut Cincinnati's lead to single digits
with less than six minutes to play. But the Golden Eagles went four straight
possessions without a score, and the Bearcats hit their free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   If Marquette is to keep alive its streak of beating Cincinnati once in each
of the past six seasons, the Golden Eagles will have to upset the Bearcats in
the Conference USA tournament in March.
</P>
<P>
	   The Golden Eagles tried to play man-to-man defense early against the
Bearcats, but that led to matchups like 6-foot-9 Cincinnati guard DerMarr
Johnson against 6-2 Marquette guard John Cliff.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bearcats hit six of their first eight shots, making the kind of early
run that has turned most of their games into laughers this year. Logan's third
3-pointer with 13:43 left in the first half made it 17-2.
</P>
<P>
	   With first place in Conference USA on the line and the Golden Eagles playing
some of their best basketball in years, Marquette expected a near-sellout at the
Bradley Center. But the game's 8:30 p.m. CST starting time on a Sunday meant
large blocks of empty seats in the arena's upper bowl.

<HEADLINE> 'Hurricane' Carter Praises Movie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When Denzel Washington won the Golden Globe for best
dramatic film actor Sunday night, he took the wrongfully convicted boxer he
portrayed in "The Hurricane" up on stage and said: "He's all love."
</P>
<P>
	   The film chronicled the 19 years Rubin "Hurricane" Carter spent in prison
for three murders in 1966 he didn't commit.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we made this film, I really began to understand what 'God is love'
means. This man right here is love, he's all love. He lost about 7,300 days of
his life, and he's love, he's all love," Washington said.
</P>
<P>
	   The acceptance speech followed Carter's appearance earlier in the ceremony
when he presented a film clip of "The Hurricane," receiving a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I only have 27 seconds. And you know I can't open my mouth in 27 seconds,"
Carter said. "But I am indeed honored that a film about the story of my life has
been nominated for a Golden Globe award."
</P>
<P>
	   Carter, who now works as an advocate for prisoners who believe they are
innocent, emphasized that he's still enjoying an "ongoing life."
</P>
<P>
	   "Notice that," he said. "A life in progress."
</P>
<P>
	   The movie was criticized for liberties the filmmakers took with facts,
including the suggestion that members of a Canadian commune were solely
responsible for overturning Carter's conviction by discovering evidence that was
suppressed.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter himself pointed out the discrepancy, crediting his lawyers for much
of the work that set him free.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Sunday, Carter only praised the film, telling the audience he was
"proud and pleased" to share the clip.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pa. House Fire Kills 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEVITTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Fire spread through the first floor of a suburban
Philadelphia home early Sunday, killing a 4-year-old girl, her mother and her
grandparents, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Liebel said he and other neighbors saw smoke and flames in the house
about 7 a.m. They tried to reach the family by breaking windows and shoveling
snow in to stop the fire, but the smoke was too thick to see inside.
</P>
<P>
	   One neighbor was to pull the 4-year-old girl out, but efforts to revive her
were unsuccessful, said Michael Moretti, county director of emergency services.
</P>
<P>
	   The two-story house was ablaze when firefighters arrived about 7 a.m. The
bodies of Colleen Connor, 28, Dale Connor, 51, and Donald Connor, 45, were found
inside, police said. Authorities said the little girl's name was either Cassie
or Kasey.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire was concentrated on the first floor and may have been sparked by an
electrical problem, Falls Township police said. An official cause had not been
determined.

Candidates Canvas in Iowa
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- On the eve of Iowa's caucuses, Republican and
Democratic presidential candidates canvassed churches and national talk shows,
scouring for last-minute support even as they began looking ahead to contests in
New Hampshire and beyond. Entering the first election contest of Campaign 2000,
Republican George W. Bush and Gore held wide leads in polls of voters who
planned to visit schools, civic clubs, fire stations and other sites Monday to
support one of eight major contestants. The underdog candidates, all resigned to
losing, were shooting for face-saving finishes.

	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Houses and businesses across parts of Georgia could be
without power until Tuesday as crews struggle to repair lines that fell down
amid rain and freezing temperatures that spread ice across the state. More than
a half-million customers had their electrical service knocked out. Georgia Gov.
Roy Barnes declared a state of emergency Sunday for 20 northern counties. Snow
and freezing rain also fell in other parts of the southern Appalachians, and
locally heavy rain fell across coastal areas of Georgia and the Carolinas as the
storm pushed eastward and out to sea.

<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- About 10 armed men from the Myanmar insurgent
group God's Army raided a hospital in western Thailand on Monday, demanding that
the doctors treat their injured, the Thai interior minister said. The insurgents
also wanted Thai authorities to open the border to allow God's Army to seek
refuge in Thailand, Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart told a radio station.
God's Army is an insurgent guerrilla group of about 200 mostly ethnic Karen
fighters battling the military regime in Myanmar. They have given shelter to the
five student rebels who raided the Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok Oct. 1-2.

killing a man, authorities said. The alleged gunman was hospitalized, but
authorities did not say why. Sgt. Joe Caruso of the Contra Costa County

asked to speak. His request was denied, he left, came back and approached the
man who told him he could not speak. He fired several times, authorities said.
One of those shots struck the 46-year-old man in the head, killing him.

<HEADLINE> Andrew Cuomo May Run For N.Y. Gov.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, N.Y. (AP) -- Federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, son of former
New York Governor Mario Cuomo, said Sunday he's considering running for the
office his father once held.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to focus on the presidential (election), then look at all the
options,'' Cuomo said after an afternoon hunting outing with Assembly Majority
Leader Michael Bragman and Buffalo-area Assemblyman Dick Smith at a 5,000-acre
wildlife preserve.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An option that I would take a serious look at is coming back and running
for governor,'' Cuomo said. ``New York is home. I want to come back to New York.
The only question is when.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo's interest in following his father, who served three terms before
losing to Republican George Pataki in 1994, could pit him against another
Democrat, state Comptroller H. Carl McCall.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall considered challenging Pataki in 1998 but backed down in the face of
the governor's healthy poll numbers and bulging campaign bank account.
