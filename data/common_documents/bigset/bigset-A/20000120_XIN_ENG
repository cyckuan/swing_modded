<HEADLINE> European Commission Releases Structural Reform Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
Wednesday published an 84-point Action Plan for consultation with
EU members on EC structural reform.
</P>
<P>
The commission, European Union (EU)'s executive branch, said
the plan was based on accountability, efficiency and transparency
principles in the public service, and set judging standards to
meet its targets.
</P>
<P>
The proposals in the plan, with clear time-table for
implementation, included three aspects of the reform -- to
establish a new system to supervise management, to get the best
out of the Commission's staff, and to enhance financial management.
</P>
<P>
EC Vice President in charge of the reform, Neil Kinnock, said
the leaders of EU governments gave the EC the reform mandate. "We
started working immediately on fulfilling that mandate and, in the
first four months, we have made several valuable and progressive
innovations", he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today we published the detailed strategy document for
consultation with the member state governments, the European
Parliament, our own staff and their representatives, and the wider
public. Full account will be taken of responses before the Reform
Strategy White Paper in its final form comes to the commission
meeting on March 1," Kinnock said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Urged Not to Be Pessimistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni urged all people in the east African country not to be
pessimistic either in the security situation or in the country's
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The president made the appeal in a televised speech broadcast
live countrywide on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
In the nearly two-hour speech, the president expressed full
confidence in improving the security situation in both the
northern and western parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the Amnesty Law fails to work, the government
would take a tougher stand against the rebels terrorizing in the
above regions.
</P>
<P>
"The Amnesty Law only deals with the old crimes of the rebels.
If they commit new and serious crimes, they would be punished,"
said the president.
</P>
<P>
Museveni stressed the importance of the Nairobi peace accord he
signed with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in early December
last year, saying that it is working well.
</P>
<P>
However, the Ugandan president admitted that there were some
inefficiencies in the intelligence agencies, which added to the
difficulty in eliminating the rebel activities.
</P>
<P>
"I assure you that if your commanders adhere to the doctrine
laid out, they could achieve results. That's why I visited these
places so often," the president told the nation.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, he said that bank closures do not
indicate the economy is in bad shape. On the contrary, it means
the economy is improving, he said, adding that his government is
doing all it can to take Uganda into a new millennium of hope.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Supports Referendum on Political System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni said on Wednesday evening that he and his government
supports the coming referendum on political system and will
respect its results.
</P>
<P>
"We ask the people to choose how they should be governed. The
government would fully respect the referendum results because
that's the people's choice," the 55-year-old president promised in
a two-hour speech to the nation.
</P>
<P>
"There are two different opinions. That's why we hold the
referendum and ask the people to decide," Museveni said.
</P>
<P>
Some say it's high time to introduce multi-party system while
others say it's not time yet, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The president refuted allegations that the ruling National
Resistance Movement is taking advantage of the referendum
scheduled for June and July this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1995 Constitution, a referendum should be held in
five years to decide the country's political system by the people.
</P>
<P>
Other political parties have been accusing the National
Resistance Movement of using some provisions in the Constitution
banning the organized activities by other parties, a charge denied
by the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
It's widely believed that the ruling party would come out of
the referendum as the sole winner.
</P>
<P>
The National Resistance Movement enjoys widespread backing from
farmers and producers in the country. The party came to power in
1986 when President Museveni won the guerrilla war.

<HEADLINE> Italian Aid Mission to Kosovo Detained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Four of those in charge at Mission
Rainbow, the Italian aid mission for Kosovo, including its
director, Massimo Simonelli, 44, were ordered detained Thursday by
the prosecutor's office of the southeastern Italian city of Bari.
</P>
<P>
Judicial sources, who disclosed that the investigators are also
seeking Rhami Isufi, a 45-year-old Albanian from Vlore, said the
men were ordered detained in connection with allegations of
embezzlement, concealment and falsification of public acts and
similar misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
The Bari prosecutor's office began a second inquiry into
Mission Rainbow on August 20 last year concerning 914 containers
of aid materiel abandoned on the wharf of Bari's port and into how
private donations totaling 130 billion lire (about 70 million U.S.
dollars) were managed.
</P>
<P>
Simonelli has been one of Italy's top civil protection
officials since the civil protection department was created at the
prime minister's office in 1982.
</P>
<P>
The other detained officials were identified as Silvia
Lucatelli, 37, Luciano Tenaglia, 43, and Alessandro Mobono, 35.
</P>
<P>
Simonelli, Lucatelli and Tenaglia were reportedly transferred
out of the prime minister's office a few days ago. The
investigations began in September.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the civil protection department Thursday
evening claimed "complete transparency" in its handling of Mission
Rainbow, and said the investigators had been given "total and
loyal cooperation."
</P>
<P>
The judicial sources said the inquiries concern the Italian
refugee facilities set up at Vlore in Albania, consisting of 10
tent camps managed for the first time by the Italian regions.
</P>
<P>
Simonelli was the top official at the mission, which was
created on April 1, shortly after NATO started its air raids
against Yugoslavia, to funnel the donations of almost 70 million U.
S. dollars and other aid offers to help the hundreds of thousands
of Albanian Kosovars fleeing their homes.
</P>
<P>
The Camp of the Regions at Vlore was opened on April 28 and
gave a temporary home to 5,200 refugees.

<HEADLINE> French Parliament Adopts Law on Volunteer Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The French National Assembly (
lower house of parliament) adopted Thursday the law on volunteer
service by young people, prepared after the country decided to
stop military conscription in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The deputies from both right-wing and left-wing parties voted
for the law, while the Greens abstained.
</P>
<P>
The law is expected to come into force after being endorsed by
the Senate on February 9.
</P>
<P>
All French citizens aged from 18 to 28 can accomplish a
volunteer service from six to 24 months in France or abroad.
</P>
<P>
The service will be in response to the needs of the country and
its citizens in the fields of protection, social cohesion, and
national and international aid operation, said French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
The young volunteers will join civil defense, security service,
maintenance of public order and environment protection, as well as
help people in economically impoverished areas and help renovate
poor urban districts.

<HEADLINE> Mir to Stay in Space Until August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government decided
Thursday to prolong the operation of the Mir space station until
next August, Director of the Russian Aerospace Agency Yuri Koptev
said.
</P>
<P>
Mir has been orbiting the Earth for 14 years instead of the
originally planned three, but has flown empty for nearly half a
year.
</P>
<P>
The next mission will be sent to Mir on March 31, and the
Progress M-1 cargo space ship will approach the station on
February 1 to bring supplies to Mir. In April, another space
vehicle would be sent to the station, Koptev said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the delayed launch of the Russian-built Zvezda (Star)
living quarters for the International Space Station (ISS) would
take place at the end of July, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ISS is being built jointly by the United States, Russia,
the European Space Agency, Canada and Japan.
</P>
<P>
"It is planned to launch the service module at the end of July
and launch three ships (to the ISS) by the end of this year, one
manned ship and two cargo ships," Koptev said.
</P>
<P>
He said 3.4 billion rubles (about 120 million U.S. dollars) had
been budgeted for Russia's space programs in 2000 in general,
including about 1.2 billion rubles for the service module.
</P>
<P>
However, these funds were not enough to complete the work and
more money is needed from foreign and domestic investors.
</P>
<P>
A total of 750 million rubles would be needed to keep Mir
flying until August and talks were going on with a company on
possible investment, said Yuri Semyonov, head of the Energiya
Rocket Company, which built Mir.
</P>
<P>
"The first funds have already been received and more financing
will be forthcoming if certain conditions are met. The money is
there, but it has to be released," Semyonov said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Energiya said a U.S. firm, Golden Apple,
had promised to send 20 million dollars by March to continue the
program, which started in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Mir has been empty and partly shut down since last August and
is to be crashed into the Pacific Ocean unless funds are found.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Concedes in Trade Talks With EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has made a
concession in its rocky trade talks with the European Union (EU)
but remains " disappointed" with the negotiations, South African
Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini- Zuma said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa has come up with a kind of compromise which we
think is the best we can offer," Zuma told a press conference
after meeting with her Belgian counterpart Louis Michel in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
She declined to elaborate on the compromise over use of the
names "grappa" (made in Italy) and "ouzo" (made in Greece) on
South African wine and alcohol products.
</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed with the way in which these negotiations
are going," she said. "Nevertheless, we hope that progress will be
made."
</P>
<P>
Zuma also met for an hour with Poul Nielson, EU development and
 humanitarian commissioner, who had finished a two-day negotiation
with South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin in
Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and EU last October signed the trade, development
and cooperation agreement, which is worth 170 billion U.S. dollars
and has taken effect on January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, the pact was pulled into a deadlock after Italy and
Greece threatened not ratify the agreement if South Africa did not
meet their demands to abandon using the term of "grappa" and
"ouzo".

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said that her country is
tightening controls on " illicit" Angolan diamonds, South African
Press Association reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The South African government was tightening its airport
controls, Zuma said in Brussels during her one-day visit to
European Union headquarters, " and we are also asking our own
diamond traders not to buy illicit diamonds from Angola."
</P>
<P>
"As a government we are doing all we can to make sure that
illicit diamonds from Angola do not come through South Africa,"
Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
"In this we are also trying to protect our own diamond industry
because it is very important for our diamonds not to be mixed up
with illicit diamonds."
</P>
<P>
The embargo of Angolan diamonds is aimed to prevent the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) from financing
its war against the Luanda authority with the proceeds of diamond
sales.

JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Defense Force
announced Thursday that travellers taking the trans-Caprivi
highway in Namibia's violent northeast bordering Angola will be
escorted by Namibia's military in the future.
</P>
<P>
Namibian Defence Force Chief of Staff Martin Shalli told South
African Press Association that his troops would escort vehicles

Seven people -- three French tourists and four Namibian
civilians -- have been killed by suspected bandits of the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in the border
area in the past three weeks, the South African news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Armed convoys will leave twice a day at 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.
going in both directions to make the road safe, Shalli was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Namibia last month gave the Angolan government the permission
to use its northern territory as a springboard to attack UNITA
rebels in southern Angola.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Put Under Criminal Investigation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel Attorney-General
Elyakim Rubinstein Thursday ordered police to upgrade the
examination into President Ezer Weizman's alleged financial
improprieties to criminal probe level.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Justice Ministry said that Rubinstein
made the decision after a special police team presented him "
alleged evidence of a relationship of a business nature between Mr.
Weizman and a company connected to (French millionaire) Mr.
(Edouard) Saroussi," who have donated at least 453,000 U.S. dollars
to Weizman as "gifts".
</P>
<P>
The business link, that began in 1983 or 1984, continued even
after Weizman served as a Cabinet minister, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Given these findings, Rubinstein and State Attorney Edna Arbel
have asked the police to open a criminal investigation in
cooperation with the tax authorities.
</P>
<P>
Some law experts said the probe will lead to allegations against
Weizman over bribery and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the calls for Weizman's resignation will
intensify after the launch of the criminal probe, the first of its
kind against a reigning president in Israel's 52-year history.
</P>
<P>
However, Weizman was continuing his highly-ceremonial duty
Thursday by meeting with visiting Armenian President Robert
Kocharian.
</P>
<P>
Arye Shumer, director-general of the President's Office, said
that Weizman would not resign and he would decide on his future
after receiving Arbel's judgment on the case.
</P>
<P>
Labor Party Secretary-General Ra'anan Cohen said Weizman does
not have to resign and he hoped Weizman will come out clean.
Chairman of the ruling coalition Ophir Pines-Paz also stated that
Weizman should not be forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's lawyer Ya'akov Weinroth said he was informed of the
criminal investigation on Wednesday night. He responded Thursday in
a statement that the president asked to be investigated in the same
way as any other citizen, without privileges.
</P>
<P>
Weizman was charged by investigation journalist Yoav Yitzhak at
the end of last year with receiving at least 453,000 dollars from
textile magnate Saroussi via a trust fund when he was a Knesset
(Parliament) member and cabinet minister between 1988 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
Weizman admitted that he did receive "cash gifts from Saroussi,
a close personal family friend, for personal use". But, Weizman
claimed, since Saroussi is not a resident or citizen of Israel and
has no business interests in Israel, he was therefore under no
legal obligation to report the gifts to Knesset or tax authorities.
</P>
<P>
State Attorney Arbel started her investigation on January 11
after receiving financial documents related to the cash gifts.
</P>
<P>
But three days later, Rubinstein and Arbel stated in a dramatic
press conference that after going over the material evidence, they
had reached the conclusion that a police team should be formed to
continue the examination and make additional clarifications.
</P>
<P>
Thus, a four-member special police team began probe last Sunday.
But at that time, they emphasized that the nature of the probe is
an examination, not a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
Elected president in 1993 and re-elected in 1998, Weizman was
one of the most outspoken and popular politicians in Israel. The
fighter-turned-peacemaker will end his second-term as president in
2003, if not resign because of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
If Weizman chooses to step down at last, his duty will be taken
over by Knesset Speaker Avraham Burg until a new election is held
in the Knesset. Former Prime Minister and Regional Cooperation
Minister Shimon Peres was viewed by many analysts as the leading
candidate to succeed Weizman.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Calls for Solving Cyprus Issue Through Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said on Thursday that it is possible to solve the Cyprus
issue through dialogue between Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit made the remarks while meeting with visiting Greek
Foreign Minister George Papandreou, who arrived here later
Wednesday for a three-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries can speed up their rapprochement
process by cooperating in the fields of economy, culture, tourism
and anti-crime drive. He also invited his Greek counterpart
Constantinos Simitis to visit Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and
Papandreou signed four agreements on tourism, environment,
investments and fighting terrorism, organized crime, illegal
immigration and drug trafficking following their talks.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were designed to build confidence between the two
long-time rivals before they tackle more contentious issues such as
Cyprus and the Aegean Sea disputes which have led the two Aegean
neighbors to the brink of war three times during the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The Turko-Greek ties have been improved steadily since the two
countries rushed aid to each other following devastating
earthquakes last summer and Greece dropped its objection to
Turkey's European Union (EU) candidacy at the EU Helsinki summit
last December.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference held after the talks, Papandreou
said that Greece will help press for Turkey's membership in the EU.
</P>
<P>
Cem said that Greece will advise Turkey on the legal and
administrative steps that Turkey must take to win membership.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish minister also proposed to set up a working group to
discuss "military goodwill measures," including reducing the size
and extent of military exercises in the Aegean Sea where Turkish
and Greek warplanes sometimes stage mock dogfights.
</P>
<P>
But Papandreou said he needs to discuss the offer with the Greek
defense ministry.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Papandreou's visit shows that the Turko-Greek
ties have entered an important stage.

<HEADLINE> Putin, Italian FM Meet Over Ties, Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Acting Russian President
Vladimir Putin met here Thursday with Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini and the two discussed bilateral ties and the
situation around Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Putin told Dini that Moscow remains open to contacts with
various international organizations and is prepared to inform the
world public in detail about the actual situation in the North
Caucasus, where federal troops are in the middle of a campaign to
root out Chechen rebels, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said
following the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed their cooperation within the G-8
and the reorganization of the United Nations, including the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The positions of Moscow and Rome on the reorganization of the U.
N. have a great deal in common, Ivanov said, adding that "the
approach to this unique international organization must be very
cautious," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Italian side reaffirmed its interest in broader relations
between Russia and the European Union, noting that the principles
of world security cannot be implemented in the absence of active
cooperation with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Dini also proposed that Russia "unfreeze its relations with
NATO." Russia-NATO ties have been frozen following the start of
the military alliance's bombing raids on Yugoslavia last March.
</P>
<P>
The Italian minister arrived here earlier Thursday to attend a
trilateral meeting of foreign ministers of Russia, Italy and
Germany. The meeting is slated for Friday.
</P>
<P>
Putin said the trio meeting will be a very positive step for
the development of cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Dini invited Putin to visit Italy, but Putin said the trip will
not take place before the presidential race scheduled for March 26.
Putin is a leading candidate for the post.

Moi was speaking at the Kenyatta International airport upon
arrival from Gabon after a four-day official visit, where he
attended the sub-Saharan regional conference on poverty reduction

</P>
<P>
The president said that the cooperation between the
international donor community with Kenya had been fully restored.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moi said that no foreigner would be allowed to buy
land in the east African country except for investment purposes.
</P>
<P>
Moi said that it was prohibited for foreigners to buy land for
 speculation because it would deny Kenyan citizens the chances to
own land.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that the government had an obligation to
protect the interests of its people and thus would not allow
anyone to waylay the goal.

<HEADLINE> Greece: Papandreou's Visit to Turkey, Positive Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- With the signing of several
bilateral cooperation agreements between Greece and Turkey, Athens
Thursday called the visit by its Foreign Minister George
Papandreou to Ankara "a positive event."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that the positive climate now existing
between the two neighboring countries should be proved and that
the recent European Union (EU) summit in Helsinki was a milestone
for Greece as far as the course for Greek-Turkish rapprochement
was concerned.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou arrived in Ankara Wednesday afternoon for a three-
day official visit, the first by a Greek foreign minister since
1962.
</P>
<P>
In Ankara, Papandreou signed with his Turkish counterpart,
Ismail Cem, four agreements for bilateral cooperation on tourism,
investment, security and the environment.
</P>
<P>
Before the signing of the agreements, he also met with Turkish
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, who invited his Greek counterpart,
Costas Simitis, to officially visit Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Greek minister is also expected to meet with Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel later Thursday.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at
odds over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea, and the Cyprus problem, but the two countries have since late
June taken some steps to improve their strained relations.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of Papandreou's visit to Turkey, the Hellenic
Rail Organization (OSE) will launch Friday a pilot intercity train
link from the northern Greek city of Alexandroupolis to the
Turkish city of Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
A joint conference of Greek and Turkish journalists and media
executives will take place in Athens in early February, and Cem
will also address the conference and sign with Papandreou the rest
of the 10 bilateral cooperation agreements.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Hits New Record in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trade deficit had been setting new records month after
month in 1999. The report said that November's deficit in trade in
goods and services was up 3.7 percent from the October imbalance
of 25.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that imports shot up 1.4 percent to a record
109.4 billion dollars in November, reflecting robust U.S. demand
for foreign cars, business equipment, consumer goods ranging from
clothing to household appliances and a rising oil import bill.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exports rose a brisk 0.7 percent to a record 82.9
billion dollars as demand for U.S. products from overseas
economies picked up after being severely depressed from the Asian
financial crisis. Sales of telecommunications equipment,
semiconductors, TV sets and VCRs, and industrial supplies all
increased, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Through the first 11 months of 1999, the U.S. trade deficit was
running at an annual rate of 266.8 billion dollars, far surpassing
last year's record deficit of 164.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trade imbalance is the one blot on an otherwise superior
economic performance that has pushed the U.S. unemployment rate
down to a 30-year low of 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
November's report reflected record imports from key U.S.
markets, specifically Canada and Western Europe. The trade gap
with Canada soared to 3.25 billion dollars, up from 2.94 billion
dollars in October. Imports from Western Europe also rose to a
record 19.96 billion dollars in November. The deficit with Germany
jumped by 29.4 percent to a record 3 billion dollars as imports
from that country rose to an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
However, the report showed that the U.S. deficit with China
narrowed by 9.2 percent to 6.5 billion dollars. The politically
sensitive deficit with Japan also narrowed by 11.3 percent to 6.4
billion dollars in November.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. foreign oil bill increased 0.9 percent to 7 billion
dollars in November as crude oil prices hit their highest level
since January 1997.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Governor General Orders Rideau Hall Smoke Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Governor General
Adrienne Clarkson has ordered smoke free at her Rideau Hall
mansion in Ottawa, the Ottawa Citizen newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time a governor general of the country has
ever banned smoking at the mansion on Sussex Drive for the past
162 years, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Madame Clarkson and her husband John Ralston Saul are both non-
smokers. "They prefer to offer a non-smoking environment for their
guests," Rideau Hall press secretary Stewart Wheeler was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"She thinks Rideau Hall is, rightfully, a showcase for Canada's
best art," and wants to ensure the art showcased in the mansion is
not destroyed by second-hand smoke, the press secretary added.
</P>
<P>
Among the treasured works of art inside the mansion are
portraits, tapestries, sculptures and crafts, including a door
featuring a floral design hand-painted by a spouse of a former
governor general.
</P>
<P>
The country is in the middle of its Non-Smoking Week 2000 from
January 16 to 22.
</P>
<P>
A national survey indicated Wednesday that 47 percent of
Canadian smokers are contemplating quitting the harmful habit this
year, a two-fold increase from 1995.

MOSCOW, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Russian general was
killed in Grozny Tuesday, the Itar-Tass news agency reported
Thursday, citing unofficial sources.
</P>
<P>
Major General Mikhail Malofeyev, the deputy commander of the
northern federal grouping in Chechnya, was earlier confirmed
missing by the Russian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Malofeyev sustained two gunshot wounds in the spine and one in
the head and died on the spot when his unit was ambushed in
Zavodskoi district, Tass said, quoting eyewitness reports.
</P>
<P>
The general had arrived in the Chechen capital to familiarize
himself with the situation.
</P>
<P>
He had earlier been reported to be captured by Chechen rebels,
but the reports were denied as a propaganda ploy of the militants.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen capital has witnessed the fiercest fighting over
the past few days since federal troops launched the assaults on
rebels in the breakaway republic last September.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Scientists Discover Butterfly Ultrasonic Ears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Canadian scientists have
discovered ultrasonic ears on the wings of nocturnal butterflies,
The Globe and Mail newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A Carleton University entomologist has witnessed the action of
the microscopic ears hidden underneath scales at the base of their
wings.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jayne Yack caught some hedylids, an odd branch of the
butterfly family, on an island in the Panama Canal and zapped them
with high-frequency sound.
</P>
<P>
She was thrilled to see the insects scatter, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"It's really exciting. I love seeing something that nobody's
seen before," she was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that butterflies evolved into daytime fliers
with the exception of the hedylids as bats appeared on Earth about
60 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
The newest finding has proved the rule that an insect flying at
night needs some way to avoid bats.
</P>
<P>
"It supports what we already knew: that bats are the reason why
most nocturnal insects have ears," said James Fullard, a professor
at the University of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
"Now we're thinking about bats as influencing whether or not an
insect flies during the day or night," the professor concluded.

But the cabinet was quoted by Swiss Radio International as

<HEADLINE> Italy Fails on Planning EU Funds, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Audit Court said Thursday
that Italian policy-makers have totally failed in efforts to
utilize European Union structural funds allocated for the country.
</P>
<P>
In a report for parliament on Italy's financial relations with
the EU and management of EU funds, the court said planning has, to
date, been totally inadequate for the purpose of effectively using
EU funds.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that by the end of 1996, only 19 percent
of funds earmarked for the period 1994-99 had been used.
</P>
<P>
Policy-makers must now start from scratch if Italy hopes not
only to receive these funds from Brussels but to use them to "
generate real economic and social gains," said the magistrates on
the Audit Court.
</P>
<P>
The report acknowledged that strides have already been taken in
this direction and said that in the three years to the end of 1999,
the use of these funds may reach 75 percent, though planning "
still appears fragmentary, dispersed in thousands of rivulets" and
distant from the real needs of the regions targeted.
</P>
<P>
The court said that in recent times, "there has been a race to
present projects" but there has been no overall assessment of the
coherence of these projects or of how effective they will be for
the purpose of real economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, it was learned here that underdeveloped Italian
regions entitled to EU structural funds only used up 64 percent of
the total amount allotted to them in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The figures were on Italy's policies regarding the EU's next
seven-year aid package for economically-depressed areas.
</P>
<P>
The data, which emerged at the conference entitled European
Social Fund 2000-2006, A Chance for Development, confirmed Italy's
notorious reputation for making the worst use of its structural
fund allowance of any EU member.

MOSCOW, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Acting Russian President
Vladimir Putin Thursday appointed former Kremlin spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky as a presidential aide.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky was dismissed from his post as spokesman for
former President Boris Yeltsin in 1998 and had until recently been
a deputy to Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
He will now coordinate the informational and analytical

</P>
<P>
Gromov said the conflict is entering its final stage and there
is a need to explain what is happening.
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops launched the campaign last September
following armed Chechen incursions into neighboring Daghestan and
a series of apartment bombings, also blamed on Chechen militants,
that killed over 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.

JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian Defense Force
Thursday displayed 200 captured rebels of the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to the international
media in Rundu on the Angola-Namibia border.
</P>
<P>
Th UNITA fighters had been captured along the Kavango River,
which forms the border between the two countries, according to a
report by South African Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Journalists were allowed to speak to two of the UNITA captives,
who said they had been captured inside Namibia 120 kilometers east
of Rundu.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government had given strong support to Namibia's
Southwest African People's Organization (SWAPO) guerrillas during
its war against the South African occupation.
</P>
<P>
In return, Namibia's SWAPO government last December permitted
the Angolan government to use its Caprivi Strip to attack the
UNITA rebels based in areas across the Kavango River border.
</P>
<P>
Since January 3, seven people have been killed and a dozen of
others wounded in several gun attacks by UNITA rebels against
locals and visitors in northern Namibia.

<HEADLINE> Five Namibian Soldiers Killed in DRC Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Defense Minister
Erkki Nghimtina announced on Thursday that five Namibian soldiers
were killed earlier this week in the strategic Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC) town of Ikela by a shell fired by rebels.
</P>
<P>
According to South African Press Association, Nghimtina said
another 11 Namibian soldiers were also injured in the shell fired
by rebels of the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) on Monday
into Ikela, which lies on the main road to the northern city of
Kinsangani, the DRC's third biggest city.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the rebel siege of Ikela had been lifted last
weekend when the allied troops supporting DRC President Laurent
Kabila secured the main supply route to the town.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 Namibian, Zimbabwean and Angolan troops have been
surrounded at Ikela by RDC rebels since November.
</P>
<P>
"They had blocked the way to Ikela. We were compelled to use
airlifts for food and all other equipment," Nghimtina said.
</P>
<P>
The rebel siege, he added, had been a violation of the Lusaka
ceasefire agreement signed in August, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Between 20 and 30 Namibian soldiers have died in the DRC since
Namibia sent troops to support Kabila in August 1998.

<HEADLINE> Spain Urges to Implement S. Africa-EU Trade Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Deputy Foreign
Minister Carlos Bastarreche Thursday urged for quick
implementation of the free trade pact between South Africa and the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Bastarreche, who is on a visit in Pretoria, said Spain is
"extremely happy" with the South Africa-EU trade, development and
cooperation agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We hope it will enter into force as soon as possible," he said
after meeting his South African counterpart Aziz Pahad.
</P>
<P>
In the latest hurdle to the deal, Italy and Greece insisted that
South African liquor producers should stop the use of the terms of
"grappa" (made in Italy) and "ouzo" (made in Greece) to describe
their wine products.
</P>
<P>
"There have been some unexpected hitches, but I think that in
the nature of such comprehensive negotiations one must expect this
to happen," Pahad said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we must be optimistic because we are convinced
that both sides see the importance of this deal."
</P>
<P>
The South Africa-EU trade deal, which is worth 170 billion U.S.
dollars, was signed last October and has been in effect since
January 1 this year. However, Italy and Greece refused to ratify
the agreement because South Africa did not meet their demands to
phase out the using of "grappa" and " ouzo".

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani Government
Thursday decided to regulate the sector of Cable TV Channels and
authorized Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to invite
applications for the issuance of licenses.
</P>
<P>
Advisor to the Chief Executive on Information Javed Jabbar told

Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Executive General Pervaiz
Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
"The Government has authorized the PTA to invite applications
for the issuance of licenses to regulate the sector of Cable
Television Channels - that is the distribution of cable TV
channels as opposed to content origination."

Jabbar said the cabinet decision marks an important step
towards acknowledging the importance of this sector.
</P>
<P>
The Cable TV Network sector has witnessed a spectacular
mushroom growth in the last three years in Pakistan, he said,
adding that "it is a very good sign because it shows a sense of
enterprise at the grass roots level, using very low-cost
distribution methods."
</P>

More than 500,000 homes are benefiting from the availability of
cable TV channel distribution system, he said.

<HEADLINE> Turner Wins Wimbledon Cable Deal, NBC Renews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- TV giants NBC and Turner
Sports collaborated on another bid, agreeing Tuesday to a three-
year contract worth more than 90 million U.S. dollars for the U.S.
television rights for the Wimbledon tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
The new deal for the June's event is valued at about 30 million
U.S. dollars a year in cash and promotional considerations,
according to reports reached here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
NBC, which has televised Wimbledon for 31 years, is paying
about 22 million U.S. dollars a year, some 16 percent more than
the 19 million U.S. dollar in the previous deal. Turner's
agreement for the cable TV networks TNT and CNN/SI is worth about
eight million U.S. dollars, the same as HBO paid in its expired
contract.
</P>
<P>
This marks the first time Wimbledon will be available on basic
cable HBO, which like Turner Sports is owned by Time Warner,
decided last summer not to renew its contract after 25 years.
</P>
<P>
NBC and Turner already have a joint venture with NASCAR, and
team on coverage of the NBA. They will share some production costs
in this deal, which begins in June.
</P>
<P>
The deal puts 124 1/2 hours of coverage on U.S. television, 25
percent more than NBC and HBO aired. NBC will once again show 35 1/
2 hours, TNT will take over HBO's 61 hours, and CNN/SI will air
two hours of taped coverage in prime time each night. It is the
first event programming on the sports news channel.

<HEADLINE> China Draws Foreign Investment to Develop City Subways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A joint venture to produce
world-class subway engines went into construction today in the
southwestern part of Shanghai, China's largest commercial city.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Alsthom Transport Electrical Equipment Co. Ltd.
will be built with a total investment of 10 million U.S. dollars,
60 percent of which will come from the French side.
</P>
<P>
After its completion in six months, the company will produce
168 sets of advanced locomotives each year, and will provide the
mass transit Peal Line in Shanghai with key equipment, said Pierre
Lenfent, president of the company.
</P>
<P>
Alsthom also works in cooperation with other Chinese companies
to produce city railway facilities.
</P>
<P>
China has historically spent large sums to import equipment for
subway projects in Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the four cities which now have subways --
Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Guangzhou -- another ten cities
including Shenzhen, Nanjing and Wuhan are planning to build train
systems.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai plans to build 11 subways and seven light rails with a
total length of over 460 kilometers, or four times of the current
total length of subway lines in China.
</P>
<P>
"The Shanghai project is a landmark for Alsthom," said Lenfent,
adding that the company will take part in the construction of
subways in Shanghai and other Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the French government will provide more than 350
million U.S. dollars in loans for the Peal Line in Shanghai. The

<HEADLINE> 125 Billion Yuan Misused in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The 1999 national audit in
China has revealed that 125 billion yuan (about 15 billion U.S.
dollars) was misused or embezzled, according to Li Jinhua, Auditor-
General of the National Audit Office (NAO).
</P>
<P>
The money should have been used for poverty-relief programs,
for the construction of water conservancy projects or for
resettlement of residents in the Three Gorges dam area, Li told a
national audit meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
Auditing departments conducted audits in 112,000 units in the
January-November period of last year, preventing 29.8 billion yuan
from being misused while disclosing 1,458 criminal activities, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
The audit of a poverty-relief fund which was designated to
cover 592 major poor counties from 1997 to mid-1999, found that 4.
3 billion yuan had been spent on government expenditures and for
constructing government and private buildings and buying cars for
official and personal use, while another 2.4 billion yuan was
diverted to counties which had no active poverty-relief projects.
Forty-four cases involving 71 persons were discovered.
</P>
<P>
While auditing the use of a special fund for water conservancy
projects across the country, the NAO found the Ministry of Water
Resources misused and illegally raised three billion yuan, while
another five billion yuan for resettlement of residents in Three
Gorges dam area was embezzled. Fourteen people were involved, the
audit found.
</P>
<P>
The NAO also audited the financial records of some 2,400 courts
and 2,100 procuratorates above the county level, finding 81
embezzlement cases involving 5.7 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>

and Commercial Bank of China and the Construction Bank of China,

<HEADLINE> Hoss: Lebanon Borders with Israel Non-negotiable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Salim Hoss said Thursday that his country's
internationally recognized borders are non-negotiable.
</P>
<P>
He was reacting to remarks by Israeli Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz
to the effect that a peace treaty with lebanon would involve
demarcation of new borders.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 15-kilometer deep border strip in south
Lebanon in 1985 as a self-styled security zone to buffer guerrillas
cross border attacks. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah and other
resistance groups have been fighting to oust 1,500 Israeli troops
and 2,500 allied militiamen there.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon categorically rejects any talk over this (the new
border) issue, and internationally recognized borders will not be
subject to changes or re-demarcation, Hoss said.
</P>
<P>
All international resolutions have recognized lebanon's borders,
the latest being the United Nations Security Council resolution 425
that calls for israel's unconditional withdrawal from lebanon, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lebanese cabinet ministers urged the United States to
play an effective role to press Israel to end its intransigence and
restart the Syrian peace track.
</P>
<P>
Talks between Syria and Israel have been put off indefinitely
because of Israel's refusal to commit to a full withdrawal from the
strategic Golan Height, which it captured from Syria in the 1967
Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its main power broker Syria have been coordinate
stances over peace talks with Israel. Beirut would have joined the
talks if there had been obvious progress during the past two rounds
of Syrian-Israeli talks in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet ministers said in a statement that Lebanon looks
forward to substantial progress on this front to enable its
participation in the settlement talks with israel on grounds of the
U.N. Security Council resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Israel's constant escalation of fighting in south Lebanon and
western Beqaa will not terrify the lebanese, it the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Govt to Present Draft Constitution in 3 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan ruling People's
Alliance (PA) government decided on Thursday to present a draft
constitution in Parliament in three months to end the protracted
ethnic conflicts, said the state radio.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of the PA's constituent parties had a
meeting from Thursday morning until 3:30 p.m. to discuss the
constitution reform, said the state radio in its night broadcast.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition, the United National Party (UNP), has
pledged support to improve the draft constitution, said the radio.
</P>
<P>
Ranil Wickremesinghe, leader of the UNP, said in a letter to
President Chandrika Kumaratunga that his party would back the
government's constitutional plan if some of the opposition's own
reform proposals were included.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should include in the draft constitution
UNP proposals relating to the establishment of independent
elections and police and judicial services commissions.
</P>
<P>
The meeting chaired by President Kumaratunga has also decided
to invite the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
for talks, said the radio.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been troubled by the long-running conflicts
between government troops and LTTE rebels who have been fighting
for a separate homeland for minority Tamils in the north and east
of the country since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The PA government has proposed the draft constitution to end
the ethnic war by devolving more powers to regional councils,
including one in the northeast administered by minority Tamils to
partly meet LTTE's demand for independence.
</P>
<P>
But the draft constitution has been stalled in Parliament for
more than three years for want of a two-third majority due to the
lack of the UNP support.

<P>
MANILA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Labor Secretary
Bienvenido Laguesma said Thursday that some 200,000 Filipino
seafarers would be deployed in different parts of the world during
this year.
</P>

Among the countries relying mostly on Filipino seafarers are
Greece, Japan, Norway, and Sweden, Laguesma said.
</P>
<P>
He added that many officers in the world maritime industry
would be completing their five-year service this year and
qualified Filipino seafarers would be available to replace them.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma also told the meeting that some 8 billion U.S. dollars
would be remitted by Filipino seafarers and other Filipino
overseas workers within this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Laguesma, there are six million documented and
undocumented Filipino overseas workers.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Invites Strikers For Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government on
Thursday invited leaders of the port workers' trade unions for a
fresh round of talks in a bid to bring an end to a major strike
which paralyzed all of the country's 11 large ports.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which will mainly focus on wage revisions of the
port and dock workers, are expected to resume on Friday morning
between the Ministry of Surface Transport and the five port and
dock workers' federations spearheading the strike, the Press Trust
of India (PTI) reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 workers participated in the current strike,
which began at midnight Monday shortly after the previous round of
talks ended in stalemate.
</P>
<P>
The government sent out its invitation for new talks after
Surface Transport Minister Rajnath Singh received a letter from a
leader of one of the five port and dock workers' federations,
according to the PTI.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that Shanti Patel, president of the All
India Port &AMP; Dock Workers' Federation, also sent a letter to the
Surface Transport Minister. But the trade union leader was not
available to confirm this.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the government is willing to talk to
representatives of all the five federations and hopes Patel would
bring his colleagues to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
Also according to the PTI, leaders of the five federations of
port and dock workers are expected to arrive in Delhi on Friday to
participate in the new round of talks.
</P>
<P>
Although the Indian government had deployed navy and
territorial army at the strike-hit ports to maintain their
essential maritime operations, operational efficiency at these
ports on Tuesday and Wednesday was merely 40 and 53 percent of
that before the strike, government sources revealed.
</P>
<P>
A port management official at the Jawarhalal Nehru Port
estimated that the strike is causing economic losses worth some 25
million rupees (about 580,000 U.S. dollars) to the ports every day.
</P>
<P>
Surface Transport Minister Rajnath Singh discussed about the
port workers' strike with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on
Wednesday and expressed hopes for an early breakthrough, the PTI
reported.

<HEADLINE> S. African Foreign Minister Arrives in Brussels for Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma Thursday arrived in Brussels,
Belgium, for talks on the South African-European Union (EU) trade,
development and cooperation agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to Brian Ritter, an official with the South African
mission, the main purpose of Zuma's short visit is to break the
deadlock of the implementation of the South Africa-EU trade pact.
</P>
<P>
Zuma will also discuss with the EU officials about the overall
relationship between South Africa and Europe, the European Program
for Reconstruction and Development in South Africa, and the
development assistance that Europe provides to South Africa, he
said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and the EU last year signed the 17 billion U.S.
dollar free trade agreement scheduled to go into effect since
January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, two EU member states, Italy and Greece, threatened not
to ratify the accord because South Africa refused to abandon using
terms of "grappa" (made in Italy) and "ouzo" (made in Greece) on
its wine products.
</P>
<P>
The EU Tuesday sent its development commissioner Poul Nielson to
Pretoria to exchange views on the deadlock. However, no
breakthrough was made after Nielson and South African Trade and
Industry Minister Alec Erwin finished their two-day talks on
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Council of Europe to Send Observers to Russian N. Caucasus Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Parliamentary Assembly of
the Council of Europe (PACE) will send permanent observers to
Russia's North Caucasus region, PACE President Lord Russell-
Johnston said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Russell-Johnston told a news conference that Russian acting
President Vladimir Putin, during their meeting Monday, said Moscow
is open to any proposals aimed at improving the situation in the
North Caucasus and stands ready to put those proposals into
practice.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Putin as saying that he can only welcome the idea of
the presence of international organizations in the North Caucasus
because that will insure the inflow of objective information about
the situation in the region, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Russell-Johnston said an observer mission should not be large
and that it should consist of journalists and human rights
activists from the Council of Europe, the European Union (EU) and
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops are in the middle of a campaign to root
out rebels from the breakaway republic of Chechnya. The military
actions have come under pressure from the West, which accuses
Moscow of using excessive force and causing major civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Russia has staunchly defended the actions as against bandits
and international terrorists. The assaults were launched last
September following two waves of Chechen armed incursions into
neighboring Dagestan and a series of apartment bombings, also
blamed on Chechen militants, that left over 300 people dead and
hundreds more wounded in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Federal airplanes flew more than 200 combat missions
over the 24 hours in Chechnya, Interfax said, citing the
headquarters of the federal force in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary reports, over 20 rebel strongholds and
fortified areas, six automobiles, one armored vehicle, four air
defense installations, two reinforced firing positions, one
command post, two mobile communication centers, one rebel camp and
one arms depot were destroyed in the raids.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting continues in Grozny, where federal troops are
in the fourth day of a major campaign to seize the Chechen capital.
</P>
<P>
Russell-Johnston, who started his Russia visit Monday, said the
proposed observers will be non-military personnel and that they
could be stationed in the region both during the conflict and
after it.
</P>
<P>
He said his opinion about the situation in Chechnya has changed
following trips in Moscow and to the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Russell-Johnston repeated his call for a cease-fire in Chechnya
but admitted that Moscow cannot hold talks with Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov because he has lost his grips of the situation and
is under the control of forces that are not responsible for
anything.

MOSCOW, January 20 (Xinhua) -- An avalanche Wednesday buried a
passenger bus in Russia's North Ossetia Wednesday, killing seven
people and injuring 36 others, the Interfax news agency reported

<P>
The bus, traveling from the Georgian capital of Tbilisi to
Moscow, was believed to be carrying 53 people, including two
drivers. Ten people remain missing.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred on the 102nd kilometer point of the
Transcaucasian highway between Nar and the northern entrance of
the Rok tunnel, Interfax said, citing the press service of the
Ministry for Emergency Situations.
</P>
<P>
A North Ossetian rescue team, border guards and policemen are
operating at the site as the search for the 10 missing passengers
continues.

TOKYO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of Japan's three
opposition parties agreed Thursday to press Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi to dissolve the House of Representatives for an early
general election, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached by Yukio Hatoyama, leader of the

Chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa and Social Democratic Party chairwoman
Takako Doi during a meeting on the opening day a 150-day regular
Diet (parliament) session.

The three leaders also agreed to urge the Liberal Democratic
Party, the Liberal Party and the New Komeito party during the Diet
session to thoroughly deliberate a bill to reduce the number of
seats in the lower house.
</P>
<P>
They also vowed to take concerted actions to prevent the
coalition from ramming the bill which would cut the number of
lower house members chosen by proportional representation through
the Diet.

<HEADLINE> European Airspace Group Calls for Federal-Style Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- President of the European
airspace and armaments group Aerospatiale-Matra, Philippe Camus,
said on Thursday that Europe should have federal-style programs
for developing its armaments.
</P>
<P>
"The major European programs should succeed with a coherent
policy as the United States does," he said during a meeting with
the press.
</P>
<P>
Camus said that the on-going restructuring of the European
armaments industries don't make sense unless it is accompanied
with a political will.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the European governments to create "a favorable
political and regulative environment."
</P>
<P>
He also urged European countries to quicken the pace of
developing their key armaments.
</P>
<P>
Camus regretted that the policy fixed by six European
governments in July 1998 to develop a common armaments industry
capable of exporting sensitive technologies has not been
implemented yet.
</P>
<P>
"We Europeans should be placed in the analogous conditions to
those of our American competitors," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU to Fund Sino-European Educational Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- European Commission said
Thursday it has decided to earmark 10.95 million euros (11.05
million U.S. dollars) to fund the Phase II of the China-Europe
International Business School (CEIBS).
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) executive said a financing agreement
has been signed between China and the EU. European Commissioner
for External relations Chris Patten signed the agreement on behalf
of the EU executive.
</P>
<P>
The school was set up in Shanghai in 1994 to address the need
for high-level management education in China, in support of the
country's economic, social and administrative reforms and further
integration into the world economy, the EU Commission said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Phase I of the educational project has already proved a success
and the CEIBS is rapidly becoming one of the premier business
schools in Asia, as well as raising the EU's profile in China,
including through internships and exchanges, the Commission said.
</P>
<P>
Phase II of the project will develop contacts between the
Chinese education system and private sector, build up a center of
expertise about Chinese management issues and develop CEIBS into a
self-sustainable and independent business school.
</P>
<P>
The five-year project includes components intended to improve
the school's institutional governance and management, strengthen
the core permanent faculties, encourage and develop networking
between CEIBS and European business schools, professionals and
sponsor firms, and to promote research activities, the EU
executive said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Remains Open to Resume Contacts With NATO, FM Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Thursday that Moscow remains ready to resume contacts
with NATO but Russia "should clearly know to what extent the
alliance intends to take our interests and concerns into account
and follow the provisions of the Russia-NATO Founding Act."
</P>
<P>
"The developments in and around Yugoslavia have raised many
questions," Ivanov said in an article Thursday in the Nezavisimaya
Gazeta newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Moscow's ties with NATO have been frozen since the alliance
started the 11-week bombing campaign against Yugoslavia last March.
Contacts between Russia and NATO have so far been limited to
peacekeeping operations in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"NATO is a reality in the European arena and it would be
shortsighted, to say the least, to ignore this fact," Ivanov said
in the article on Russian foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
He said Moscow favors "the most constructive cooperation" with
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"There are no fleeting, temporary aspects to our approach to
relations with the EU and the current processes in it. We expect
our European partners to act accordingly in developing their ties
with the Russian Federation," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the minister said Russia "is open for close,
intensive interaction with the U.S." The two countries are in for
"serious work to further deepen disarmament processes and advance
bilateral trade and economic relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russia is expanding its involvement in integration
efforts in the Asia-Pacific region, consistently building up ties
with leading Asian countries such as China, India, Japan, Iran and
others, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow counts on the dynamic development of cooperation with
South America, Africa and the Middle East, he said.
</P>
<P>
He singled out that relations with CIS countries would remain
a priority for Russian foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov also blasted attempts by Western countries "to adjust
fundamental principles of international law" and their doctrines
of "restricted sovereignty and humanitarian interference."
</P>
<P>
"This is a road to nowhere, or to be more exact, back to a
world of confrontation," he warned.

<HEADLINE> European Airspace Armaments Group Raps "American Fortress" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The President of the European
airspace and armaments group Aerospatiale-Matra Philippe Camus
Thursday rapped the U.S. refusal to cooperate with Europe in the
field.
</P>
<P>
"There exists a will on the European side to open itself.
Aerospatiale-Matra has always affirmed that it does not exclude a
trans-Atlantic partnership," he said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He gave the examples of cooperation given by Aerospatiale-Matra
to Lockheed-Martin on several projects in 1999, including
developing a new oil supply plane, and the cooperation with Boeing
on the European air-to-air missile, the Meteor.
</P>
<P>
Camus said that Europe's conception of cooperation with the U.S.
is based on a strategy of balance.
</P>
<P>
He said the latest establishment of great pillars of European
airspace and defense, such as the European Aeronautic, Defense and
Space Company (EADS), Matra Bae Dynamics and Thomson-CSF, was only
for keeping such a balance and did not mean the construction of a
"European fortress".
</P>
<P>
"But there is for the moment an American fortress. This is the
real problem, blocking the development of a trans-Atlantic
cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Market Policy Vital to Growth of China's Microelectronics Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China's market policy is the
driving force behind the development of the country's
microelectronics industry, more so than technology and investment,
a top official with a Chinese think tank said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Mianheng, vice president of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS), said during an annual CAS working meeting, that
the academy plays an important role in pushing forward the
development of China's microelectronics industry.
</P>
<P>
The microelectronics industry, with integrated circuit products
as its major feature, is regarded as the foundation of the
computer and information industry, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
When making the development plan in the 21st century, CAS
listed information technology as one of the nine pioneer research
fields, and gave priority to computer technology research.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that CAS should link the development of high-
technology with the national economy, and the research and
development of high-technology should be market-oriented.
</P>
<P>
He said all the high-tech institutes and companies under CAS
should consider the relationship between science and economy and
do more to ensure the steady growth of the national economy.

<HEADLINE> Top Tibet Official Meets New Living Buddha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Tibet
Autonomous Region said today he hopes the Seventh reincarnation of
Raiqen living Buddha will be a "learned and patriotic living
Buddha."
</P>
<P>
Legqog, chairman of the regional people's government, met with
the two-year-old boy who succeeded to the throne of the Sixth
Raiqen living Buddha in Lhasa on Sunday, congratulating the child
on behalf of the regional government.
</P>
<P>
Describing the government's ordination of the living Buddha as
"a happy event of Tibetan Buddhism," Legqog said it not only
reflected the common wish of the majority of Buddhists, but again
proved the consistency of the Chinese Communist Party's policy of
freedom of religious belief.
</P>
<P>
The chairman, a native Tibetan, hoped the new Raiqen living
Buddha and Raiqen Monastery, the traditional seat, would carry on
the tradition of patriotism embodied by former living Buddhas as
well as their desire to preserve the unity of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the monastery and relevant departments of religious
affairs should foster a well-educated and patriotic living Buddha
who "loves the Communist Party of China, the socialist country and
Tibetan Buddhism."

<HEADLINE> Jordan Rejects Hamas Call for Dialog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government has
rejected a recent offer by the Palestinian Islamic Resistance
Movement, or Hamas, to open a dialog on Jordan's expulsion of the
group's leaders, informed sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no dialog, there has not been one in the past and
will never be one in the future," Minister of Information Saleh
Kallab was quoted as saying by the sources.
</P>
<P>
The minister was refusing a recent offer for talks by Hamas
political chief Khalid Mishaal, who was expelled with three other
Hamas leaders to Qatar last November after a government crackdown
on the movement in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
However, Kallab said they could return to the kingdom as
ordinary citizens but not as members of any organization.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas officials, all Jordanian citizens, had appealed
through a Jordanian lawyer against the expulsion order, which they
said was unconstitutional, to the higher court of justice of
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The government rounded up 21 Jordanian members of Hamas,
including the four leaders, and closed all Hamas offices in Amman
last August under pressure from the United States, Israel and the
Palestinian authorities to contain the Islamic militant group's
activities.
</P>
<P>
They were later released upon a royal decree by Jordanian King
Abdullah Bin Hussein following mediation efforts by Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The movement remains opposed to the peace process between Israel
and the Palestinians and is also critical of Jordan's 1994 peace
treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
It has carried out several deadly attacks on Israeli civilian
targets during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Amman believed that the ban on Hamas' presence and
activities in the kingdom would remain in the foreseeable future,
at least before substantial progress is made in the ongoing
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, despite the plea by Hamas leaders
to return.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials have vowed to try the Hamas leaders in a
court if they return, and insisted that the case against them have
not be dropped but only shelved for the time-being pending further
developments.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas members had been charged with participation in illegal
foreign organization, illegal possession of arms and ammunition and
attempts to conduct anti-Israel military exercises in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
However, the movement enjoyed widespread sympathy among
Jordanians, over 60 percent of whom are of Palestinian origins.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Develop Telemedicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is expected to
spend about 100 million ringgit (about 26.315 million U.S. dollars)
in developing the telemedicine applications and rolling them out
over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
For a start, health information for consumers through the mass
customized personalized health information and education (MCPHIE)
project would be available nationwide, Health Minister Chua Jui
Meng said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, information and training required by health
practitioners to support provision of high quality services will
also be available nationwide," he was quoted by Bernama News
Agency as saying at a signing ceremony here for the MSC (
Multimedia Super Corridor) telemedicine flagship applications
between the Malaysian government and two companies -- Medical On-
line Sdn Bhd and WorldCare Health Malaysia Sdn Bhd.
</P>
<P>
Telemedicine, one of the seven initial MSC flagship
applications launched by the government in 1997, is expected to
spearhead the country's efforts to leapfrog into the information
age.
</P>
<P>
Four projects -- the lifetime health plan (LHP), MCPHIE,
continuing medical education (CME) and teleconsultation -- are
designed to provide an integrated healthcare delivery system.
</P>
<P>
According to Chua, the objective of the LHP project is to
provide to each individual a proactive and prospective
personalized lifetime health plan to assist and guide the
individual and his care provider to proactively manage his state
of wellness.
</P>
<P>
MCPHIE is to provide information and education that is specific
and relevant to each individual regarding his own specific health
requirements.
</P>
<P>
Those under the CME must ensure that they receive the proper
information and education to provide high quality care in the fast-
changing world of medicine.
</P>
<P>
To overcome this hindrance, Chua said "we will, through the
fourth project -- teleconsultation -- enable the consultation to
be carried out between care providers at different locations."
</P>
<P>
Teleconsultation hubs and spokes will be available in every
state through 42 government and four university medical centers.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the healthcare services that will be
delivered through this network will enable the individual to
access high quality care throughout his life regardless of his
geographical location or his healthcare provider.

the end of June 2000.
</P>
<P>
In his radio program "Ipa-Bombo sa Pangulo" aired nationwide,
the president said it is high time the government end decades of
war with the rebels which, he said, have stunted the country's
growth.
</P>
<P>
"I am hopeful that we can help each other. We share the dream
of having true peace, especially in Mindanao," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that he would verify reports that the
secessionist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) is seeking
support for setting up an independent republic within the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He said he has not received intelligence reports that the MILF
is trying to establish satellite offices abroad to seek support
for its bid to establish an independent government.
</P>
<P>
However, Estrada stressed he would bring up the matter with
Secretary Orlando Mercado of the Department of National Defense
and Armed Forces Chief of Staff General Angelo Reyes.
</P>
<P>
If the reports are true, the president warned, the MILF must
drop this plan as the government will not allow it.
</P>
<P>
"They must be dreaming. We will not allow the creation of a
separate republic. There is only one government and one
constitution here," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government forged a peace accord with the Moro National
Liberation Front in 1996, ending 30 years of fighting in Mindanao.
Encouraged by this, the government is currently talking peace with
the MILF.
</P>
<P>
The government is also conducting peace efforts with leftist
rebels at the local level after the latter cut off formal talks at
national level in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
On January 13, the president said he is giving the peace
process until end of June this year to reach a positive conclusion.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Satisfied With U.N. Sanctions on Angolan Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States is glad to see
that a meeting of the U.N. Security Council held in New York on
Tuesday recommended more efficient sanctions against the Angolan
rebels led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the next week could be decisive for securing
peace (in Angola)," the official Jornal de Angola newspaper
Thursday quoted U. S. envoy Howard Wolpe, who is responsible for
the issues in the Great Lakes region, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wolpe made the remarks here after a meeting with Angolan
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos to discuss the current
political-military and social- economic situation in Angola and
issues on the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the U.N. Security Council made a decision
on Tuesday to reinforce the sanctions against the Angolan rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Richard
Holbrooke, his country will do more than before for applying
sanctions against Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions are only part of the U.N. policy for securing
peace and humanitarian support in Angola, he said, adding that the
United Nations has launched an appeal for 258-million-dollar
assistance for Angola.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed and
one wounded after gunmen opened fire at a station bus in Karan
district of North Mogadishu, Somalia Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The deceased include a lady, a boy and a businessman who owned a
small telecommunications facility near the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the area, the shooting was a
retaliation move carried out by Daud subclan militiamen against
the Eli subclan people. Both subclans belong to the main Abgal
clan of faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen, who carried out the attack, had been annoyed by the
killing of one of their fellow men, a driver called Hussein Arif,
by militiamen from the Eli subclan near Gumarrey village along the
road to Adaleh district some 100 kilometers northeast of Mogadishu
last Friday.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls for Risk Assessment to Prevent Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Environment Program
(UNEP) and the U.N. Center for Human Settlements (Habitat)
Thursday called for vulnerability assessment to prevent disasters
and minimize the damage.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in deaths from recent natural disasters makes
mitigation and prevention of disasters an urgent priority,
particularly as evidence shows that their impact can be minimized
through better environmental and urban planning." said Klaus
Toepfer, chief of the UNEP and the Habitat.
</P>
<P>
In the 1999 Turkey earthquake, the extent of damage was
compounded by problems associated with poor city planning, the
UNEP said in a news release issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In Venezuela, the impact of the floods was also aggravated by
the process of urbanization, which unfortunately was accompanied
by the destruction of the environment and increased vulnerability
of the area to floods, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi-based UNEP and Habitat urged the international
community to work with the local authorities to carry out a
practical assessment of the vulnerability of the cities in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The risk assessment would be based on indicators such as
geographical location, the state of the buildings and
infrastructure, land use management policies and the state of the
immediate environment, they said.

<HEADLINE> 14 People Killed by Diarrhoea in Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- An outbreak of diarrhoea
in Lesotho has killed 14 people and left at least 17 in critical
condition, South African Press Association reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho's Medical Information Service spokesman Andrew Jamieson
was quoted as saying more than 1,200 people were infected over the
period from January 7 to 11 in the southern districts of Mafeteng,
Mohale's Hoek, Quthing and Thaba-Tseka.
</P>
<P>
He said 1,000 cases had been reported in the Mohale's Hoek
Hospital alone, and the patients were suffering from fever,
abdominal pain and frequent bloody stools.
</P>
<P>
The Lesotho Health Ministry ascribed the outbreak of the disease
to the recent heavy rains, which had caused water sources
contaminated with faecal matter, especially in villages without
water sewerage.
</P>
<P>
Health teams despatched to the area had found that the bacteria
were relatively resistant to commonly used antibiotics and the
doctors had to treat patients with more sophisticated and
expensive medicines.
</P>
<P>
Visitors should bring reliable bottled water and clean food
with them while travelling to the infected regions, Jamieson
suggested.

<HEADLINE> Nanjing People Protest Against Gathering in Japan to Deny Nanjing Massacre (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- People from all walks of life
in this capital city of east China's Jiangsu Province have in the
past few days staged rallies to protest against the Japanese right-
wing's planned gatherings in Osaka on Sunday aimed at denying the
1937 Nanjing Massacre.
</P>
<P>
Historians with the Research Institute of the Nanjing Massacre
(RINM), Nanjing University, the Jiangsu Academy of Social Sciences,
and the Second Chinese Historical Archives have presented a
copious amount of historical evidence proving the occurance of the
Nanjing Massacre and uncovering the evil and arrogance of the
Japanese military.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that in the new century of peace and
development, the real purpose of the Osaka gathering is to distort
historical fact and whitewash war crimes committed by the Japanese
invaders.
</P>
<P>
Sun Zhaiwei, RINM vice-chairman, said that the gathering is a
blatant denial of the massacre, in which about 300,000 unarmed
Chinese were slaughtered by Japanese aggressors.
</P>
<P>
People in China, Asia and the world must not tolerate the group
's manipulation of historical facts and provocation to world peace,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jurists, teachers, professors, publishers and media
professionals in Nanjing have also held meetings to decry the
planned Sunday gathering.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Jiangsu Provincial Law Association, the
Jiangsu Provincial Society of Lawyers and the city's Office of
Notarization said that the Nanjing Massacre was a wartime atrocity
committed by the Japanese troops on the Chinese people and it is a
widely-ackowledged barbarity that cannot be denied.

</P>
<P>
Ge Xuesong, an official with the Ministry of Science and
Technology, revealed that a total of 602 projects, involving 1,655
researchers, have been chosen as winners of the central government
awards.
</P>
<P>
Jose Albert de Camargo from Brazil, Umberto Colombo from Italy,
Shouyichi Yishimoto from Japan, and Rita Colwell from the United
States were given China International Science and Technology
Cooperation Awards for their contributions to the cooperation and
exchange in science and technology between China and the rest of
the world.
</P>
<P>
Ge said the awards were focused on projects involving
intellectual property rights, high-technology, special techniques
for solving major problems which hold back the development of the
national economy, and projects to boost sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The awards consist of State Natural Science Awards, State
Invention Awards, State Science and Technology Advancement Awards,
and China International Science and Technology Cooperation Awards.
</P>
<P>
However, the class-one prizes on the lists for State Natural
Science Awards and State Invention Awards remain vacant as
selection experts have failed to find any eligible scientific and
technological breakthroughs made in mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Sciences, China's leading research body,
clinched nine of the top 18 awards, or class-two prices, in the

<HEADLINE> Overseas Citizens Cited in China for Outstanding Contributions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Four scientists from Brazil,
Italy, Japan and United States have been chosen by the Chinese
government as outstanding overseas citizens for their work to
promote cooperation in science and technology between China and
the world.
</P>
<P>
They are Jose Albert de Camargo from Brazil, Umberto Colombo
from Italy, Shouyichi Yishimoto from Japan, and Rita Colwell from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Their names were announced here today by the Ministry of
Science and Technology, which also made public a list of Chinese
scientists selected for their outstanding achievements in science
and technology.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, Jose Albert de Camargo, president
and CEO of the Brazilian Metallurgical Mining Company, has made a
significant contribution to the development and production of high-
strength, low-alloy steel using columbium in China since 1979.
</P>
<P>
Columbium is a raw material widely used in high-tech products.
</P>
<P>
Umberto Colombo, chairman of the Scientific Committee of the
ENI Enrico Mattel Foundation, has furthered Sino-Italian
cooperation and exchanges in science and technology since the
early 1970s, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
During his tenure as chairman of the Italian Nuclear Energy
Organization, Colombo signed an agreement between China and Italy
on cooperation in peaceful use of nuclear energy, which has been
satisfactory to both countries.
</P>
<P>
Colombo has also been closely following environmental
protection and development in China, and since 1994 has been a
member of the China International Cooperation Committee on
Environment and Development, which serves as a top advisory body
for the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Japanese agronomist Shouyichi Yishimoto introduced the use of
plastic sheeting to Chinese farmers in 1974. He has come to 26
Chinese provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions to offer
help to local farmers. The technique introduced by him has
facilitated poverty reduction in China.
</P>
<P>
Rita Colwell, director of United States National Science
Foundation, was also cited by the ministry for her work to promote
scientific and technological exchange between Chinese researchers
and their overseas counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Number of Daily Flights to Peak at Lunar New Year in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 600 flight movements
are expected to take place at the Hong Kong International Airport
on February 4, the day preceding the Chinese Lunar New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
This will be an all-time high in the total number of flights
the airport handles in a single day.
</P>
<P>
"The number of flight movements expected on the peak traffic
day represents an increase of nearly 30 percent when compared with
an average of 460 movements a day," a spokesman for Hong Kong's
Civil Aviation Department (CAD) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday, 27 airlines have submitted slot requests to
operate 936 additional scheduled and ad-hoc charter flights during
the two-week period from January 29 to February 13, with most of
the applications falling on the period of February 3 to 11. All
the requests received so far have been accepted.
</P>
<P>
Those airlines that have already submitted slot requests plan
to operate flights to 24 destinations in the Chinese mainland, 11
destinations in Southeast Asia, nine destinations in Northeast
Asia, four destinations in Australia and New Zealand, and two
destinations in the Middle East and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The record high for the former Kai Tak airport was 483 flight
movements in a single day, which occurred on February 5, 1997.
</P>
<P>
To ensure smooth air traffic operations, CAD will deploy 12.5
percent extra staff to work in the Air Traffic Control Center and
the Air Traffic Control Tower from February 3 to 11.
</P>
<P>
The total flight slots allocated for the two-week period
represent a 36 percent rise over the Chinese New Year period in
1999. The previous record high of flight movements in a single day
occurred on both April 2 and 6, 1999, when on each of those days
560 flight movements took place at the HK International Airport.

<HEADLINE> German Businessman Acquitted, Freed by Iranian Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian court on Thursday
morning acquitted the German businessman Helmut Hofer and released
him from prison, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth court hearing, Hofer was acquitted of charges of
having connection with foreigners but was fined 20 million rials
(about 6,666 U.S. dollars at official rate, 2,380 dollars at market
rate) for insulting a guard in prison.
</P>
<P>
Hofer can return to his country as soon as he pays the fine in
cash, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The German businessman was arrested in September 1997 for an
affair with an Iranian Muslim woman and was sentenced to death in
January 1998. Iranian laws prohibit affairs between a non-Muslim
man and a Muslim woman.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian court acquitted him of adultery for insufficient
proof in October after the Iranian Supreme Court ordered a retrial,
as Hofer claimed that he had converted to Islam before having an
affair with the woman.
</P>
<P>
But he was jailed in October again on charges of having
connections with foreigners and insulting an Iranian prison guard.
</P>
<P>
Hofer's case has been a hurdle for better relations between Iran
and Germany, though both voiced their readiness to improve their
relations.
</P>
<P>
Germany is Iran's largest trading partner of Iran, but their
relations have been strained since April 1997 after a Berlin court
accused Iranian leaders of sponsoring terrorist assassinations
against Iranian dissidents in Germany.

<HEADLINE> Iran Most Serious in Anti-drug Fight: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami said Thursday that Iran is the most serious country in the
world in fighting the "ugly phenomenon" of narcotic drugs
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a large gathering in the city of Roudan in southern
province of Hormozgan, Khatami said that Iran, who sacrifices tens
of soldiers each year combatting drugs, is recognized as a big
obstacle in the way of drugs shipment to the West.
</P>
<P>
The drugs are mainly produced in neighboring Afghanistan, and
smuggled through Iran to Europe and the Gulf countries. Afghanistan
has become a major center of drug production and smuggling, Khatami
said, quoted by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Iran started massive anti-drug campaigns from 1989, after the
Majlis (parliament) passed a strict anti-drug law allowing capital
punishment for smugglers caught with 50 kilograms of opium or 30
grams of heroin.
</P>
<P>
Vice President for Executive Affairs Mohammad Hashemi said on
Monday that 235 tons of various narcotics were confiscated and 740
drug traffickers were killed in 1999 while Iran also lost 183
policemen in fighting against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The large number of casualties and extent of campaign indicated
the significance of anti-drug operations in Iran, he said, adding
that Iran's efforts to intercept convoys of drugs will help them
save the population in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also called on local people and officials to take
serious steps against drug trafficking since the city Roudan is
vulnerable and exposed to drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Underlining the need for greater investment in the city, Khatami
said given its agricultural potentials and climatic advantages, the
region can be turned into a tourist zone for provincial tourists.
</P>
<P>
Citing growing palm trees and cultivating shrimps as other
potentials of Roudan, he expressed hope that facilities will be
provided in those areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Vietnamese National
Assembly Vice-President Nguyen Van Yen called on Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina at her official residence here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the warm and traditional friendship between
Bangladesh and Vietnam, Nguyen Van Yen expressed the hope that the
cooperation between the two countries, particularly in the field
of trade and commerce, would be further strengthened in the future.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina recalled that Bangladesh was always in support of
the Vietnamese people in their crucial struggle for liberation.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Van Yen, who termed his visit as a very fruitful one,
renewed the invitation of his government to the Bangladeshi prime
minister to visit his country at a convenient time. Sheikh Hasina
was forced to cancel her Vietnam visit in November, 1998, due to
the devastating flood that ravaged Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Congress Agrees on 2000 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The bicameral conference
committee of the Philippine Congress agreed Thursday to a 629-
billion-peso (15.725 billion U.S. dollars) budget for the year
2000, with 22 billion pesos (550 million dollars) to be slashed
from the government-proposed 651-billion-peso (16.275 billion
dollars) budget.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority leader Franklin Drilon said the budget impasse
break would now enable the Senate and the House of Representatives
to approve the millennium budget by next week for signing by
Philippine President Joseph Estrada, possibly by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
Drilon, also a member of the three-man Senate contingent, said
the 22-billion-peso cut would retain the budget deficit ceiling
this year to 62.5 billion pesos (1.56 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of the 22 billion pesos to be cut, some 7 billion pesos (175
million dollars) will be real cuts while the remaining 15 billion
pesos (375 million dollars) will be contingent cuts which could be
restored to the 2000 budget once revenue collections pick up.
</P>
<P>
The 7 billion peso real cuts would be slashed in the
intelligence funds of various government agencies, Drilon said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-billion-peso contingent cuts include 10 billion pesos (
250 million dollars) from the internal revenue allocation (IRA) of
the local government units (LGUs) and 5 billion pesos (125 million
dollars) from national government agencies.
</P>
<P>
The Senate finance committee has originally proposed the
cutting of the 30-billion-peso (750 million dollars) IRA of the
LGUs but pressures from President Estrada and the insistence of
local government officials prompted the bicameral body to restore
the IRA.
</P>
<P>
The restoration caused the budget impasse in last December
since members of the committee failed to agree on where to source
the additional 30 billion pesos.
</P>
<P>
Drilon said the bicameral conference committee's technical
staff is now working on the final and consolidated version of the
2000 budget. He said the body would meet again next Tuesday to
review the final report.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Warns of adopting Emergency Rules in Lagos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Presidency Wednesday
renewed its threat to declare emergency rule in Lagos State,
saying the violent activities of the radical Oodua People's
Congress (OPC) will potentially set the country ablaze.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Thursday quoted
President Olusegun Obasanjo's spokesman Doyin Okupe as saying in
Abuja that the government is resolved to protect all Nigerians
and other nationals residing in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the country's nascent democracy is
being stifled at birth by criminals who are taking the liberty
which democracy provides as license to perpetrate crime through
violence.
</P>
<P>
No responsible government that is seriously engaged in courting
foreign investors will condone these nefarious acts of
criminality, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that President Obasanjo has made it clear to all
Nigerians that his administration will not be diverted or swerved
from its focus of liberating the Nigerian people from the menacing
claws of poverty which has plagued the country for several years.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman accused Lagos State Governor Bola Tinubu of
failing to ensure peace in the state.
</P>
<P>
Tinubu should read the appropriate riot act to hoodlums in the
city of Largos, give appropriate instructions after due
consultation with security agents and perhaps with the Federal
government on possible areas of assistance and co-operation in an
effort to bring peace and security to the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
Okupe's remarks came on the heels of the demonstration of
support from the Alliance for Democracy (AD) governors for their
Lagos counterpart.
</P>
<P>
AD is one of the country's major opposition parties. Recent
violence in Lagos has killed hundreds of people.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Manufacturers Blame Budget Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Delay by Nigeria's National
Assembly to approve the country's Year 2000 Budget was described
by manufacturers on Wednesday as equivalent to holding the economy
hostage and a direct invitation to economic stagnation.
</P>
<P>
If it should take months for the legislative arm of the
government to pass a budget, the essence of whatever caution they
are taking may be of little value, the Guardian newspaper Thursday
quoted Manager of Dunlop Nigeria Ltd. Dayo Lawuyi as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the delay would manifest in the implementation of both
the fiscal and monetary policies, hence affect the operations and
performance of the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
According to Hassan Wehbe, Chairman of Foam Manufacturers Group
of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (FMG-MAN), the
parliament's delay in approving the budget may stall economic
recovery process as crucial expenditures and total commercial
volumes may be whittled down because of uncertainties.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Civil Service Undergoing Computer Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 directors in the
federal civil service of Nigeria are undergoing computer literacy
training to meet the challenges of the information technology age.
</P>
<P>
The course, organized by the African Center for Development and
 Strategic Studies (ACDSS), is part of a program designed to
re-orient civil servants for the new millennium, according to a
report by the New Nigerian newspaper on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address in the capital Abuja, head of Service of
the Federation Abu Obe said that "the civil service could not be
left behind in the global craze for technology acquisition, hence
the directors are brought together to update their knowledge."
</P>
<P>
The civil service would be better if all directors are computer
literate, he said, urging them to apply their newly acquired
skills for efficient discharge of their official responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
At the function, ACDSS Head and former Executive Secretary of
the African Economic Commission Adebayo Adedeji said the course
was intended to rejuvenate the directors and assist them to attain
meaningful levels of efficiency in the application of functional
policies of the present administration.
</P>
<P>
The course is timely, especially with the determination of the
Obasanjo government to truly professionalize its civil service, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The training course is scheduled to conclude at the end of this
month.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and the
European Union (EU) wound up a two-day meeting in Pretoria on
Thursday failing to break the deadlock over the implementation of
the free trade agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The trade, development and cooperation agreement, signed last
year and scheduled to be implemented on January 1, was blocked by
two EU members, Italy and Greece, which threatened not to ratify
the agreement if South Africa did not comply with their demands
that its wine products should not use the terms of "grappa" (made
in Italy) and "ouzo" (made in Greece).
</P>
<P>
South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin and EU
development commissioner Poul Nielson discussed the implication of
the decisions taken by Italy and Greece with regard to the
agreement, Erwin's spokesman Edwin Smith said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Smith said the discussions between Erwin and Nielson were not
to reach any agreement, but to communicate the nature of the
problem from the EU and South Africa's position on the matter.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A rare variety of bird unseen
for decades has been found in the northern part of south China's
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The "gorsachius magnificus," which is on the edge of extinction,
apparently lives only in the evergreen forests of China. There are
records of the bird's existence in the past in south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say the gorsachius magnificus must be one of
the world's rarest species with one of the narrowest distributions.
"There is still no systematic knowledge of the bird's habits and
characteristics," said an expert.
</P>
<P>
On this occasion, three gorsachius magnificus were spotted and
a report was made of its presence in the province.
</P>
<P>
Experts are now conducting further studies to gain a better
knowledge of the number, distribution and habits of the bird in
the province.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Int'l Airport Completes its Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong International
Airport, one of the finest in the world, finished its construction
completely after the opening of the passenger terminal Northwest
concourse on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the concourse marked a construction milestone at
Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA), and positioned the airport
to contribute to Asia's economic revival at the start of the new
century, said Fung Kwok-king, chairman of the Hong Kong Airport
Authority (HKAA) at the opening ceremony of the 2.1 billion HK-
dollar structure Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This new concourse raises the airport's handling capacity to
45 million passengers a year - more than adequate to meet our
immediate and future needs, including the expected increase in
traffic from the Disneyland Project in 2005," said Fung.
</P>
<P>
The new concourse is about 300 meters long and adds 34,000
square meters of floor space, bringing total floor area to 550,000
square meters for the passenger terminal, which was already one of
the largest buildings of its type in the world. Now, more than 60
airlines connect Hong Kong to over 120 destinations around the
world.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the newly completed airport, Donald Tsang,
financial secretary of Hong Kong SAR, said it was the epitome of
Hong Kong's can-do spirit - a mind-set that overcomes seemingly
impossible obstacles to get things done.
</P>
<P>
Fung added that in addition to its contribution to tourism -
Hong Kong's second largest income earner - air cargo was playing a
rapidly expanding role in the local and regional economy.
</P>
<P>
For several years, Hong Kong has been the world's busiest
center for international air cargo. In 1999, the airport processed
just under 2 million tons, an increase of 21.4 percent over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
"We are poised to harness the potential of the information
economy generated by high-tech communications and electronic
commerce. We will also take advantage of the opportunities arising
from China's impending entry into the World Trade Organization,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> IMF, Indonesia Signs new Letter of Intent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the Indonesian government here on Thursday signed a new
letter of intent (LoI) containing the country's medium-term
economic strategy, macroeconomic policies for 1999/2000 and the
2000 fiscal year and structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
Under the new LoI or known as Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies, which was signed by Coordinating Minister for
Economy, Finance and Industry Kwik Kian Gie and IMF Director for
Asia Pacific Hurbert Neiss, Indonesia economic growth in the
medium-term is envisaged to grow by 5-6 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The strategy (for medium-term economic) envisages restoring a
growth rate of 5-6 percent over the medium term, and Bank
Indonesia (in the context of the new Central bank Act) has adopted
a target of keeping inflation below 5 percent annually," the
memorandum said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in macroeconomic policies for the fiscal year 1999/
2000 and 2000, the memorandum said that policies are based on
growth being in the 1-2 percent range in 1999/2000 and then
strengthening to the 3-4 percent range during the fiscal year 2000
(April to December).
</P>
<P>
"Low single digit inflation will be entrenched and the external
reserve position will be further strengthened," the document said.
</P>
<P>
The document also said that the fiscal deficit for 1999/2000 is
currently estimated at about 3.75 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP) while deficit for the fiscal year 2000 is expected
to be 5 percent of GDP, which will be financed by domestic and
foreign sources.
</P>
<P>
In the structural reforms agenda the two sides (IMF and
Indonesia) also agree to avoid introducing any new trade barriers
and remove remaining distortional elements in the trade structure.
</P>
<P>
"We will establish a three-tiered tariff structure (0, 5, and
10 percent) for all goods except alcohol and automobiles," the
memorandum said.
</P>
<P>
The document also said that in a bid to boost fiscal reforms
agenda, the two sides plan to initiate a comprehensive study on
whether the islands of Batam, Rempang and Galang (in Riau province)
should be considered as a tax free area.

Indonesia and IMF have signed several agreements on Indonesia's
economic situation and the fund's aid package to the country since

<HEADLINE> Tamil Rebels Pound Police Parade in Northeastern  Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Tamil rebels fired mortars at a
police passing out parade in northeastern Sri Lanka on Thursday,
killing a constable and four relatives of the police cadets,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels pounded the
ceremony at Morawewa police school in the Trincomalee district,
officials said, adding that 29 others were wounded in the incident.
</P>
<P>
In another attack on a gasoline tanker, LTTE rebels shot dead
the driver and wounded two others on Thursday morning in the
eastern district of Batticaloa, the Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Government troops had killed nine members of LTTE in four
separate conflicts in the northernmost peninsula of Jaffna during
the last two days, the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Since last month the rebels have launched successive offensives
in a bid to capture the Elephant Pass, a causeway linking the
peninsula with the rest of the island country.
</P>
<P>
The capture of the causeway is the first step of LTTE's attempt
to regain control of the peninsula, the rebels' former stronghold
until 1996. But there appeared to have been a stalemate due to the
stiff resistance of government troops.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels are fighting for independence for minority
Tamils in the island's north and east since 1983.

LUSAKA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has spent 72 percent of

This represents 132.49 million U.S. dollars of the total

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The defense ministers of China
and South Korea Thursday stressed the importance of further
developing exchange and cooperation to promote the military ties
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian and
his South Korean counterpart Cho Sung-tae exchanged opinions over
the international and Asian-Pacific situation, the development of
bilateral military ties and other issues of common concern.

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chi said China and South Korea are close neighbors
enjoying a long history of friendly contacts and sharing common
understandings, and the continued development of the Sino-South
Korean partnership of cooperation oriented toward the 21st century
is in the fundamental interest of the two countries and helpful to
peace and stability in the Asian-Pacific region.

After the meeting, Chi met South Korean Foreign and Trade
Minister Lee Joung-binn and visited Samsung Electronics Corp. and

<HEADLINE> Japan Convenes Regular Parliament Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A 150-day regular session of
Japan's Diet (parliament) opened Thursday, with debate expected to
focus on the government-proposed expansionary fiscal 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
One focus of the first half of the regular session is on a bill
to reduce the number of House of Representatives (lower house)
seats.
</P>
<P>
Japan's ruling and opposition blocs have been unable to agree
on the bill, which is aimed at cutting 20 seats from the 200
proportional-representation seats in the 500-seat lower house.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Party (LP), one of the coalition partners of
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party (
LDP), has threatened to quit the ruling bloc if the bill is not
enacted at the session's outset.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal 2000 budget, which the government is keen to seek
parliament approval before March 31, the end of the current fiscal
year, will be another important focus of the session.
</P>
<P>
The 84.99-trillion-yen (about 805.5 billion U.S. dollars)
budget, however, is expected to spark Diet debate over the
government's fiscal policy as it has been criticized by the
opposition and some LDP lawmakers who are demanding the government
begin steps to rebuild the country's deficit-ridden finances.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi and three key members of his cabinet, Foreign Minister
Yohei Kono, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Economic Planning
Agency chief Taichi Sakaiya, will deliver speeches to the Diet on
January 28.
</P>
<P>
During the regular session, Obuchi will also engage in face-to-
face debate with opposition leaders once a week.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China's leading pollster
recently revealed that two-thirds of the Chinese people are full
of confidence about their livelihood in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest survey of urbanites in 11 major cities
conducted by the Horizon Social Survey Company, the majority of
Chinese are upbeat about the future, although they have some
jitters over unemployment and economic sluggishness.
</P>
<P>
Horizon's report is being published by the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences (CASS) this month in its annual survey of social
trends in the country.
</P>
<P>
As for the current economic situation, 58 percent of those
polled commented positively; while 64 percent also took positive
attitudes toward economic enhancement in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Most of the people said they cared very much about
environmental quality. And although many hope for private cars,
high-tech electronics, and their own apartments, they view fresh
air and clean water as an ideal.
</P>
<P>
Another survey of 2,599 people over the age of 16 showed that
55 percent said they expect to benefit from pension reform, while
40 percent said they will suffer financial losses from the
restructuring of the medical system.
</P>
<P>
Many expressed concern over the growing gap between rich and
poor in China.
</P>
<P>
"A comparatively fair mechanism for the distribution system
must be established as soon as possible," said Xu Xinxin, a CASS
sociologist, during an interview.
</P>
<P>
Xu led his group's survey of 50 experts in various fields and
115 senior officials who were trained at the Party School of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Most of the experts said that an adjustment of interests among
various groups is urgently needed.
</P>
<P>
Some 74 percent of the surveyed experts said they believe in a
better social and economic future, while 92 percent of the senior
officials held that view.
</P>
<P>
The CASS research also indicated that many Chinese esteem
powerful economic growth, scientific breakthroughs, democratic and
legal advancement, and cultural progress, but are less than
completely sanguine about the country's environmental protection
prospects during the first decade of the 21st century.

HONG KONG, January 20 (Xinhua) - China's accession into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) will re-define Hong Kong's role of
a manufacturing control center and a business services hub, not
just a gateway, said Hong Kong chief economist.
</P>
<P>
The remarks, made by Edward Leung, chief economist of the Trade
Development Council (TDC) of Hong Kong, accompanied the release
Thursday of a TDC research report on China's WTO accession and the

</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the imminent accession of China into the WTO

economy, " said Leung.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The expansion in China's trade and investment
activities with the rest of the world should benefit Hong Kong as

Hong Kong's excellent skills in trading, transportation, financial
services and professional and business services will play a more
active, not diminished, role."
</P>
<P>
The TDC report said that Hong Kong's exports, especially
exports of services, will expand more rapidly. Its trade with the
Chinese mainland is conservatively estimated to increase by an
extra four to six percent by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Income generated from investment and labor in the mainland will
also rise. Involvement in the mainland's services market will
trigger off the next wave of Hong Kong's investment and
professional participation in the mainland. As a result, they are
expected to generate a much greater contribution, in income terms,
to Hong Kong's GNP than that can be captured in its GDP, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Unprecedented opportunities as well as new challenges are being
posed to manufacturers in the textile and clothing, auto parts and
IT equipment industries in terms of Hong Kong's manufacturing
activities in the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
The report said these will stem from the abolition of quotas on
textiles and clothing in 2005, substantial tariff reductions of
China's imports of cars and auto-parts, the availability of auto-
finance in the Chinese mainland, as well as zero-tariffs on IT
related parts, components and products imports.
</P>
<P>
The report also highlighted the opportunities and obstacles
ahead for Hong Kong companies in different services sectors.

<HEADLINE> More Arrested in Turkey's Renewed Operations Against Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Police have arrested more
suspected members of the clandestine Islamist group Hezbollah in
their renewed operations against the terror organization, which was
accused of having kidnaped dozens of businessmen in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Following Monday's roundup of a major hideout of the group in
Turkey's largest city of Istanbul, the police swooped down on
another target Wedneday and discovered 10 bodies of the missing
businessmen in the so-called house of terror, Turkish Daily News
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the anti-terror squads cordoned off a slum in
Uskudar of the city while forensic experts, wearing face masks amid
the stench of rotting bodies, found their way through the single-
storey shantytown house and garden.
</P>
<P>
Police believed that the killers were those Hezbollah members
killed and arrested in Monday's operation. Police raided a villa in
the Beykoz District of Istanbul Monday, killing the group's leader,
Huseyin Velioglu, and capturing two other key figures, who later
confessed the house of terror.
</P>
<P>
In a separate raid in Ankara Wednesday, police detained five
suspected Islamist militants, two of them women, and seized
explosives.
</P>
<P>
The operations against Hezbollah are conducted with great
secrecy and units involved in the operations are kept in the dark
until the last minute and only authorized officials communicate via
special phone numbers, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Police are trying to find out how many people have been
kidnapped by Hezbollah, which, active since its inception in 1986,
is believed to have kidnapped and murdered hundreds of the pawns.
</P>
<P>
The group usually killed the hostages immediately without
holding them to ransom and then buried them in concrete in rural
areas. Police have started to search for more bodies all over
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Hezbollah has no connection with the Lebanese
Hezbollah that has been engaged in a guerrilla war against the
Israeli occupation troops in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Hezbollah used to target mainly the outlawed
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which was seeking to establish a
Kurdish state in southeast Turkey, and other sympathizers of Kurds.
</P>
<P>
Turkish anti-terrorism experts reportedly believe that as the
PKK appears at a low ebb as a result of the arrest of its leader
Abdullah Ocalan, Hezbollah has emerged in an attempt to fill the
vacuum left by the PKK.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Jordan will form
a joint economic committee in the near future to activate trade and
joint venture projects between the two countries, the Khaleej Times
daily reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made following a UAE-Jordanian businessmen's
investment forum held in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The committee of businessmen is expected to step up the
relatively small trade exchange between the two countries, the
paper said. The volume of trade between the UAE and Jordan stood at
only 248 million dirhams (67.6 million U.S. dollars) last year,
which is quite small,it added.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Unmarried Palestinians or married Palestinian men
without children and over the age of 21 will, starting Thursday, be
allowed to enter into Israel to work.
</P>
<P>
Until now, only married Palestinian men aged 23 and over, or
married men over 21 and with at least one child have been allowed
to work in Israel.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Bank of Israel Governor David Klein said Wednesday
that he favors the establishment of a monetary committee to set
interest rates, rather than leaving the task to the governor's sole
discretion.
</P>
<P>
During his first appearance before the parliament's financial
committee, Klein said he favors lowering interest rates in the
future, adding that the present interest rates are higher than
necessary to achieve a 3 to 4 percent inflation target set by the
government.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's mutual funds specializing in shares raised
record sums in December 1999, estimated at some 900 million shekels
(225 million dollars), local media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The date and estimates compiled showed that January 2000 will
surpass the December figures in share-oriented mutual fund sales,
which may already have reached 1 billion shekels (0.25 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The state's actual liabilities for civil servants'
pension plans amounted to almost 200 billion shekels (50 billion
dollars), according the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The figure refers to the state's obligations to state employees
only and does not include other public-sector employees, mainly in
local authorities, for which there is no information as of yet.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The total foreign investments in the Arab countries in
1999 was about 222 billion dollar, with 344 billion dollar
allocated for the Gulf states, down 65 million dollar from 1998.
</P>
<P>
A study prepared by Riyadh-based General Secretariat of the
Gulf Cooperation Council as saying that these investments have
contributed to building 962 projects costing 30 billion dollar and
employing some 124,000 workers.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Grows 8.1 Pct in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Trade Development Board (
TDB) of Singapore announced Thursday that the country's total
external trade rose by 8.1 percent to 382 billion Singapore
dollars (about 228.74 billion U.S. dollars ) in 1999, bouncing
back to the pre-crisis level of 1997 after experiencing a 7.5
percent decline in 1998.
</P>
<P>
A TDB press release said that the growth reflected a strong 17.
3 percent increase in the second-half of 1999 following a marginal
decline of 0.9 percent in the first half.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, the non-oil domestic exports (
NODX) grew by 9.5 percent in 1999, the non-oil re-exports
registered a marginal increase of 0.1 percent, non-oil imports
expanded by 9.5 percent while the oil exports recorded a 12.4
percent rise.
</P>
<P>
The year saw significant improvement in the performance of key
trade components with domestic exports of electronics increasing
by 6.1 percent and domestic exports of non-electronics going up 16.
8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In terms of markets, NODX, which is on top of the five markets,
increased by 7.5 percent while the U.S. market registered a modest
increase of 2.2 percent, the EU markets rose by 7.0 percent, the
Japan market surged up by 27.7 percent, the Malaysia market
expanded by 12.7 percent and the Hong Kong market increased by 2.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference Thursday afternoon, TDB's Chief
Executive Officer Barry Desker said the significant improvement in
the second half of 1999 was boosted by the sustained recovery of
crisis-hit Asian economies as well as the strengthening of the
global demand for certain product segment.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the trade outlook, Desker said Singapore's total
trade is projected to increase by 11 percent to 13 percent for the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the world economy will generally be sanguine,
economic expansion in the U.S. and the EU will go on, growth
momentum in regional economies will remain, global electronics
demand is likely to be sustained, exports of non-electronic
products will do well, and non-oil manufacturing activities will
continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
He also expects a downturn of U.S. economy to be brought about
by a sharp correction of the stock market and weak demand for disk
drives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a monthly bulletin released by the TDB at the press
conference shows that Singapore's total trade volume expanded
strongly by a double-digit rate of 24.5 percent in December 1999
following a 19.8 percent growth in November.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan FM Denies Disagreeing With President on Embassy Closures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Minister of Foreign
Affairs Eriya Kategaya has denied a report that he disagreed with
President Yoweri Museveni on the closure of most its diplomatic
missions abroad.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that he did not write to the president on
that matter as reported in the Monitor newspaper on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Monitor report said that Kategaya wrote to the president,
openly refusing a plan to close 20 of the 26 embassies abroad,
which was backed by President Museveni.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said last year that most of Uganda's diplomatic
missions abroad were in bad shape and in deep debts. The property
of its mission in Tokyo was auctioned after it failed to pay its
debt.
</P>
<P>
The president held that only six missions in New York,
Washington, London, Brussels, Pretoria and Geneva should be
retained.
</P>
<P>
The embassy closures would isolate Uganda at a time when more
missions should be established, Kategaya was quoted as saying by
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's annual budget for the embassies is only two thirds of
what they need, leading to arrears in payment and rent.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- About 600 Sudanese herdsmen and
their families have entered northern Uganda because of severe
drought and famine in southern part of the largest African
country.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Didinga from Lotukei in southern Sudan entered into
Uganda's Kotido district to seek better living conditions for
their cows and members of families, Thursday's New Vision daily
quoted Assistant Resident District Commissioner Edward Eko as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the influx had caused an outbreak of livestock
diseases in the district and that the situation was pathetic as
the district does not have enough staff to vaccinate the Sudanese
cattle.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees and the Red
Cross staff are taking care of the Sudanese refugees, he added.
</P>
<P>
Southern Sudan has seen 17-year civil war between the
government troops and the Sudanese People's Liberation Army, which

<P>
TOKYO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The average stock prices
rebounded in Tokyo Thursday, helped by gains in selected
information and technology issues.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which closed below 19,000
Wednesday for the first time in three days, rose 110.26 points, or
0.58 percent to end at 19,008.01.

<P>
Turnover on the major section increased to 600.75 million
shares from Wednesday's 561.41 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Several information and high-tech issues were boosted by
Wednesday's gain in the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index in
New York, which hit a record closing high of 4,151.29, up 20.48
points, traders said.
</P>
<P>
They said the demand-supply situation in the Tokyo stock market
is good, supported by the upcoming establishment of new investment
trusts and the continuing zero-interest rate policy of the Bank of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government's readiness to express concern about
the yen's strength at the meeting of monetary officials from the
Group of Seven (G-7) major economies in Tokyo on Saturday was
another factor supporting Tokyo share prices, they added.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Light Railway to Use Domestic Trains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Trains made in China will run
on the Beijing light railway, said managing personnel with the
Beijing Subway Train Factory today.
</P>
<P>
The factory, together with the Changchun Passenger Train
Factory and Japan's Toyo machinery company, recently won the
bidding to manufacture the trains for the Beijing light railway
system.
</P>
<P>
The trains jointly manufactured by the three parties have been
running in good condition on the subway line along the Chang'an
Avenue, which was put into test operation on September 28, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that over 200 trains will be needed when Beijing
's light railway becomes operational in 2005, and Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Nanjing will need around 3,000 metro
trains within ten years for their new subway lines.
</P>
<P>
World-known enterprises including ABB, Toyo, Mitsubishi, and
Hyun Dai have shown strong interest in the Chinese subway train
market.
</P>
<P>
All the subway trains in use now in the cities of Shanghai and
Guangzhou were manufactured by foreign companies.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Chinese Encouraged to Promote Reunification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to make an
addition to the law on Overseas Chinese to encourage them to play
a greater role in promoting the reunification of China, according
to a legislative forum concluded here today.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendment was proposed by the meeting attended by
more than 70 officials from the Overseas Affairs Committees of
local people's congresses and related departments.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the National People's Congress Standing
Committee, told the meeting on Tuesday that legislation on
overseas Chinese affairs should better serve to protect their
legitimate rights and interests and those of their family members
in China, and encourage them to promote national reunification.
</P>
<P>
The meeting held by the NPC Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee
has been discussing amendments to the 1990 law on protecting the
rights and interests of returned overseas Chinese and their family
dependents.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu Huizi, vice-chairman of the NPC Overseas
Chinese Affairs Committee, there are 30 million Chinese citizens
living abroad, and another 30 million returned overseas Chinese
and their family dependents.
</P>
<P>
With the country opening wider to the outside world and having
more international contacts, there will be even more Chinese
moving abroad, and they will play a greater role in the
development of the motherland, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Their role in promoting national reunification will become
more obvious," he said.
</P>
<P>
Legally, overseas Chinese are Chinese citizens living abroad,
and they should be entitled to the rights of the Constitution of
China and laws applicable to other Chinese, and be held
accountable for the same responsibilities defined for others.
</P>
<P>
"Their opinions and suggestions should thus be absorbed and
taken into consideration during the course of legislation," the
lawmaker said.
</P>
<P>
According to the meeting, more specific legal consequences for
violating the rights and interests of returned overseas Chinese
and their family dependents have been provided in the draft
amendments to the law.
</P>
<P>
Xu also encouraged local legislatures to explore new ways to
protect overseas Chinese and speed up national legislation in this

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Develop People's Economic Power: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid said the government will develop the people's
economic power as the backbone of the national economic
development while adopting a series of policies to sustain the
participation of people at large.
</P>
<P>
In his written financial note address read out by Vice
President Megawati Soekarnoputri before the House of
Representatives plenary meeting here Thursday, the president said
the government felt it necessary to bring into being more just and
equitable opportunities for all of the people to seize and create
more efficient and shock-proof economy.
</P>
<P>
Hence, the roles of the community, the majority of whom are
still left behind, need to be enhanced by creating opportunities
to progress and empower themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the future's national development, the president said, the
people are the main actors of development and that a series of
policies need to be develop to sustain the participation of people
at large.
</P>
<P>
These include policies of labor, human resources development,
science and technology development and the implementation of the
regional autonomy.
</P>
<P>
As an effort to lessen the people's burden amid the prolonged
economic crisis that has gripped the country for over two years,
the government in its year 2000 budget remains providing subsidies.
</P>
<P>
"Oil, electricity, food, program's credit interest and other
will continue to receive government's subsidies," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
The main strength of the state policy is to make such subsidies
reach those who really need them. Therefore such inefficiency in
the supply of energy which could create bigger spending of
subsidies will have to be overcome, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said the government for the next one or two years will
remain maintaining fiscal stimulus, although it should be
gradually lowered and abolished.
</P>
<P>
If in the following years the people's economic activities
could record a recovery, the fiscal stimulus will no longer be
needed. Gradually the state budget deficit can be abolished in
order to achieve a balanced fiscal condition to stimulate
sustainability.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit for the April-December 2000 is projected to
reach 45.373 trillion rupiah (about 6.5 billion U.S. dollars), as
total government revenues are projected to reach 137.695 trillion
rupiah (about 19.67 billion dollars), while its expenditures are
projected to amount to 183.069 trillion rupiah (about 26.15
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Several macroeconomic indicators, used as assumptions in
drafting the year 2000 draft state budget are economic growth of 3.
8 percent, inflation rate of 4.8 percent, the price of Indonesia's
crude oil of 18 dollars per barrel and the rupiah exchange rate (7,
000 rupiah per U.S. dollar).
</P>
<P>
The president said the government will take comprehensive
institution repairs as the main measure to overcome the economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the short-term, an urgent measure to be taken in the context
of accelerating economic recovery is to maintain economic
stability and restructure the banking and business sectors which
were considered to be the roots of the causes of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, an excessive number of civil
servants would be reduced gradually to improve his administration'
s performance in serving the people.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that two main pillars in creating a good
governance are to nurture and strengthen the handling of
governmental affairs, including the reforms of the government
personnel and to develop and strengthen the system of law and
legislation.
</P>
<P>
Wahid further said that the implementation of the recovery
program and economic reform will lay a strong foundation for a
healthy, just and ethical market mechanism to work.
</P>
<P>
"Should these be attainable, all segments of the society will
have an equal opportunity to develop their own businesses," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 budget is a transitional budget which will only
cover nine months from April to December 2000. The next budget
will cover January-December period. Previously, the budgets
started in April and ended in March.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Horticultural Export Earnings Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's horticultural export
earnings have more than trebled in the past decade, rising from
13.8 million U.S. dollars in 1990 to 68.1 million U.S. dollars in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Horticulture has become the country's second largest farm
product for export after tobacco, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed this robust rise to external demand
of the Zimbabwean produce.
</P>
<P>
It added that competition was, however, increasing in the
global market.
</P>
<P>
On the continent, Zimbabwe was faced with potential loss of
markets to low-cost producers such as Kenya and South Africa,
which the central bank said posed a challenge to the local
industry.
</P>
<P>
The industry, which has been one of the country's
fastest-growing export industries in the past 10 years, could
exploit several methods to its benefit by investing more in
research and facilitating continued production
of high-quality exports at lower costs, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Shilling Gains Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan shilling has made
rapid gains against the hard currencies in strong bullish
sentiments at the exchange market this week, according to the
Central Bank of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the inter-bank foreign exchange trading market
Wednesday was quoting 68.8 shillings to the U.S. dollar compared
to 72 shillings last week, representing a six percent gain, the
East African Standard newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers in the foreign exchange market attributed the sharp
gain to the possibility of resumption of the aid from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The IMF last month made a decision to restart the aid talks
with Kenya on the possible resumption of a 205-million-dollar loan
which suspended in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
An IMF team will visit Kenya on January 24 for preliminary
talks with the Kenyan government officials.
</P>
<P>
Some dealers argued that the shilling might find a support
level at 65 shillings vs dollar if it continues to gain ground at
that pace.

<P>
XI'AN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A batch of flying dragon and
figurines made of lead were discovered in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province recently.
</P>
<P>
Four dragons figurines were found in a tomb dating back to the

<HEADLINE> Great Changes in East China Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Fishermen in the coastal village
of Xixiakou in Shandong Province have launched a website, http://
www.xixiakou.com, to present on-line the glorious achievements
recorded in the remote and little-known hamlet.
</P>
<P>
The village has only 500 families, most of whom live by fishing,
as they have there for generations.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the reform and opening-up policy introduced in China
in late 1970s, earth-shaking changes have taken place in Xixiakou
Village, which is under the jurisdiction of Rongcheng city.
</P>
<P>
The village now has 35 enterprises with assets totaling at 740
million yuan, and these ventures reaped 6.1 billion yuan in
economic returns last year, including 120 million yuan in net
profits.
</P>
<P>
The per capita income of the villagers is now 15,600 yuan a
year, as compared with about 2,000 yuan on average for farmers
nationwide. The amount of savings in the village now averages 21,
000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
China's first category-one port opened by villagers is situated
in Xixiakou, which is also home to the nation's first
international shipping company set up by villagers.
</P>
<P>
Local villages have invested 30 million yuan to build a safari
park, a paradise for more than 40 rare beasts and birds, and as
many as 350,000 travelers visited the park last year,
contributing to the increasing local economy.

<HEADLINE> China's First VCD-Player Conglomerate Formed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China's first VCD-player
conglomerate has recently been formed as a joint effort of the
Shinco Group, a VCD-player manufacturer in Changzhou, Jiangsu
Province, and three Chinese electrical-products companies.
</P>
<P>
These three companies are a VCD-player maker in Guangzhou,
capital of Guangdong Province, the Panda Company in Nanjing,
capital of Jiangsu Province, and the Shanghai Broadcasting and TV
Equipment company.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this alliance, the daily production of Shinco-
brand DVD players has risen to 6,000 from 500 last September,
giving Shinco a 40 percent share of this market nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The cost of producing Shinco DVD players has also been reduced
by 300 yuan per unit, and the conglomerate has so far received
orders for more than one million Shinco DVD players.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1995, the VCD-player industry began mushrooming in
China, and now the production of these products exceeds demand due
to the redundant increase of similar products and unhealthy market
competition.
</P>
<P>
The Shinco Group is expected to usher in a new era with sound
market mechanisms for this sector.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Province to Encourage Labor-intensive Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 20 (Xinhua)-- Labor-intensive industries here
can expect rapid development, as the government of Liaoning
Province in northeast China intends to lend them support in order
to secure employment for more people, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that among the province's population
of 40 million, there are more than 1.4 million unemployed people
idling in this old industrial province. Moreover, the emergence of
new urban laborers and the influx of rural farmers each year are
posing a severe challenge to the local labor market.
</P>
<P>
Taking this situation into account, the provincial government
has decided to create more job opportunities and set the goal of
reducing the urban registered unemployment rate to below five
percent in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Establishment of labor-intensive medium-sized and small
enterprises should keep in balanced step with the development of
high-tech industries, the officials said, and the province will
also support the development of deep processing industries.

<HEADLINE> China to Adopt Real-Name System for Saving Deposits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China is likely to adopt the
real-name system for saving deposits within the year, central bank
governor Dai Xianglong said at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference held by the State Council
Information Office, the governor of the People's Bank of China
said that as the first step, residents must use their real names
when making bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
At the second step, the computer systems of all the banks will
be linked so that the total deposits of any individuals will be
known for the payment of income tax on interest.
</P>
<P>
The governor said the first step is easy and will be taken this
year, while the second step may take some time as it demands a
great input by the banks.
</P>
<P>
When the real-name system takes effect this year, current
saving deposits accounts under false names will be allowed to be
withdrawn and re-deposited using real names, while new accounts
must be opened under real names, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the real-name regulation is consistent with
international practices, adding that he does not expect any
opposition to the move.
</P>
<P>
The governor noted that the new rule could have a healthy
impact on China's distribution system, the protection of depositor
interest, and the collection of individual income tax.

The Jerusalem Post:
</P>

Histadrut Teachers Union's strike on Wednesday night, and called on
teachers and Finance Ministry officials to negotiate a solution to

millionaire Edouard Saroussi deposited money, police suspected.
</P>
<P>
The payment for the car comes in addition to the 453,000 dollars
transferred by Saroussi directly to Weizman through the same trust
fund, as had been exposed earlier by journalist Yoav Yitzhak.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM Repeats Concern over Israeli Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Thursday repeated Tehran's concern over possible
Israeli threat to its security from the neighboring Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"The presence of Israeli regime in the region is a major concern
of Tehran and has great impact on the security of Iran and whole
region," Kharrazi said upon his return from a visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials have always discussed this concern (with
Turkish officials), he was quoted by Tehran Radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi started his three-day visit to Turkey on Monday and
made clear the Iranian concern in his talks with senior Turkish
officials.
</P>
<P>
Iran does not recognize the Jewish state and opposes Muslim
countries' peace-making with it. Tehran was alarmed by Turkey's
signing of military accords with it allowing its warplanes to use
Turkish airspace.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials, on the other hand, expressed their concern
over alleged presence of the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party (PKK)
in Iranian territory, a charge denied by Kharrazi.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting against Turkish government for 15
years for independence in southeastern Turkey. Kharrazi said Iran
will not allow the PKK enter into its territory according to
agreements reached between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Terming his talks with Turkish officials as "very constructive
and positive," he said that his visit opened a new era for Tehran-
Ankara relations.

the manner we have started to dry up the source of Kurdistan
Workers' Party (PKK) in Turkey and the world, we believe that we
shall dry up Hezbollah in short time too."
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, a radical Islamic militant group in Turkey found to
be involved in murders, blackmails and kidnapping, was heavily hit
in these days by Turkish Security Forces.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt to Continue Restructuring Banking System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
resolved to continue the restructuring of banks in order to create
a strong and sound national banking system capable of operating in
accordance with international standards.
</P>
<P>
"The efforts towards mending the business sector by means of
restructuring the private sector's and the real sector's debts are
directed to re-awaken and at the same time strengthen the
capabilities of national business circles," President Abdurrahman
Wahid said in his financial note on the year 2000 Draft State
Budget.
</P>
<P>
The president's financial note was read by Vice President
Megawati Soekarnoputri before the House of Representatives plenary
session here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, all in all only a fraction of the private-sector
debts has been successfully restructured through the Indonesian
Debt Restructuring Agency (INDRA), the president said.
</P>
<P>
The settlement of the private sector's debts needs to be
accelerated to revert the image of, as well as the international
confidence in, the credibility of national business.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the president said, the restructuring of banks has
been felt to be sluggish in terms of handling, among other things,
due to the complexity of the program of the restructuring debts
incurred by companies.
</P>
<P>
The company debt restructuring program involves thousands of
domestic companies as well as creditors in many countries.
</P>
<P>
In solving the private sector's debts, the government
continuously endeavors to create a conducive condition for
reaching an agreement mutually beneficial to the debtors and the
creditors.
</P>
<P>
These endeavors include ensuring that the bankruptcy process
progresses well, namely by enhancing the functions of the
commercial court, by facilitating investment procedures, by
settling tax obligations in cases of confiscating and merging
businesses, the president said.
</P>
<P>
To expedite the process of settling the private sector's debts,
an incentive has been designed, in which a debtor who is
cooperative will be given debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
This measure will be exercised in a very cautious manner, and
debtors who are entitled are only those who have not committed any
fraud such as mark-up and credit abuse, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that up to September 1999, Indonesia's foreign
debts reached 145.2 billion U.S. dollars, a little lower than 1998
's 150.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, the government's share was 84.1 billion dollars,
while the private sector's was 61.1 billion dollars. The private
debts comprised banking debts (5.5 billion dollars) and non-
banking debts (55.6 billion dollars).

</P>

Prior to his flight to Pakistan, Indefurth had just
participated in the 10th round of U.S.-India non-proliferation and
security talks between U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe

<HEADLINE> Estrada Assures Public to Recover Alleged Marcos Loot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada assured Filipinos Thursday that his administration has
enough political will to recover the alleged loot of the family of
former president Ferdinand Marcos.
</P>
<P>
The president said his government is prepared to engage in a
legal battle with the Marcoses for the recovery of all the money
they allegedly flinched from the public coffers and return the ill-
gotten wealth to the people.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said in a radio program that the Presidential
Commission on Good Government (PCGG) is taking all steps to hasten
the resolution of cases lodged against the Marcos heirs so that
the government can finally get its hands on the assets.
</P>
<P>
"My administration has been exerting all efforts to recover the
money in the hands of Marcos family so it can be returned to our
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the government will not only make
sure that the Marcos pay the 23-bilion-peso (575 million U.S.
dollars) estate tax, but get back from them the money and other
assets that rightfully belong to the people.
</P>
<P>
"We want more than the real estate tax. We will recover
everything that they took from the public coffers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the administrations of former
presidents tried to recover the ill-gotten wealth of the Marcoses
but their efforts had been unsuccessful as the family engaged the
government in a protracted legal battle.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, Egypt Agree on New Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- An agreement on new tariffs
between Kenya and Egypt has been effected, Egyptian Ambassador to
Kenya Mohammed Asem has said.
</P>
<P>
Asem made the remarks Wednesday in Kenya's capital Nairobi and
called on investors from the two countries to start joint
industrial ventures in both countries, the Daily Nation newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the implementation of the agreement would
surely improve trade and investment between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the two countries' marketing potential,
highly-trained human resources, good banking systems and
communications would accelerate the trade ventures and investment
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is the biggest exporter to Egypt from the African region
with tea and coffee taking the lead, Asem said, adding that Egypt
imports 80 percent of Kenya's tea.
</P>
<P>
Tax rates had gone down since Egypt joined the Common Market
for East and Southern Africa six months ago, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
This would ensure fair trade between Kenya and Egypt, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya and Egypt were involved in a trade war recently with
Egypt blocking the importation of Kenyan tea after it accused the
latter of charging too much duty on its exports. The dispute has
since been resolved.

<HEADLINE> 29 Injured in Zanzibar's Riot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen civilians and 14
policemen were injured in a riot in Zanzibar on Wednesday when 18
opposition Civil United Front (CUF) members were brought to court
to answer treason charges, local media reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar Assistant Commissioner of Police Juma Mtumwa was
quoted as saying that 40 people had been arrested and would soon
appear in court.
</P>
<P>
Almost all shops, hotels and restaurants in Zanzibar's Stone
Town remained closed for about five hours when groups of youths
armed with stones roamed the streets of this sprawling historical
landmark.
</P>
<P>
A group of riot policemen positioned around the High Court are
said to have thrown more than 10 tear gas canisters to disperse
the crowd who demanded permits to enter into the court to follow
the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Daily activities in town were almost paralyzed especially at
areas near the High Court. However, the police appealed to
residents to remain calm.
</P>
<P>
As the rioters took to the streets forcing a showdown with the
police, all the 18 CUF activists denied the treason charges at the
High Court.
</P>
<P>
This was the first day for the treason suspects to appear in
court in Zanzibar, since they were detained two years ago for
being accused of plotting to overthrow the Zanzibar government led
by President Salmin Amour.
</P>
<P>
The CUF, the main opposition party in the Indian Ocean
archipelago, refused to recognize Amour's 1995 election. Its
Secretary General Seif Shariff Hamad lost by less than one percent
amid allegations of ballot- rigging.

<HEADLINE> Lusaka Resident Wins Compensation for Contaminated Beer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A Lusaka resident who found a
dead lizard in the beer he was drinking was awarded 50 million
Kwacha (20,000 U.S. dollars) as damages by The Lusaka High Court.
</P>
<P>
The resident sued Zambian Breweries for negligence and breach
of contractual duty arising from the contaminated beer he bought
from a retail shop in Lusaka in October 1998, according to Zambia
Daily Mail on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He sought redress by claiming damages for nervous shock,
discomfort and stress because of the contaminated beer.
</P>
<P>
High Court judge Timothy Kabalata said In passing judgement the
law has imposed a duty on any person including manufacturers not
to offer for sale any food that contains foreign matter.
</P>
<P>
He said the presence of a dead lizard in the bottle of beer is
a clear evidence of negligence on the part of the company.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Breweries defence lawyers have, however, applied for
leave of appeal to the Supreme Court against the application the
judge granted.

LONDON -- Visiting Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo said here
Wednesday that the development of long-term, friendly and stable
Sino-British relations and cooperation tallies with the
fundamental interests of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
In talks with British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, Wu
said the past years have witnessed ever-increasing development of
bilateral ties. In 1998, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and British
Prime Minister Tony Blair conducted a successful exchange of
visits, during which the two sides issued a joint statement on the
establishment of a comprehensive China-UK partnership. Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's successful state visit to Britain last
October, in particular, laid a solid foundation for the cross-
century development of bilateral ties, he added. (Britain-China-

BERLIN -- Klaus Reinhardt, commander of the international

towards Kosovo as "extraordinarily stupid," during an interview
published in Wednesday's edition of the German weekly "Die Woche.
"
</P>
<P>
The German four-star general said the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) paid dearly last spring for air strikes on
Yugoslavia and Kosovo to force the Yugoslav leadership to
compromise over the rebel province. But in contrast, they have not
provided much for the rebuilding of Kosovo. This is "
extraordinarily stupid," he said. (Germany-Kosovo-Criticism)

HAVANA -- President of Cuban National Assembly, Ricardo Alarcon,

off indefinitely Elian Gonzalez's return to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
The six-year-old Cuban boy survived a shipwreck of illegal
immigrants during which his mother and step-father drowned.
Lawyers for a relative of Elian in Miami filed a federal lawsuit
on Wednesday, challenging a decision by U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) that the boy should be returned to
his father in Cuba. Alarcon said in a television interview that
this step permits taking the case away from INS jurisdiction. He
also accused the U.S. government of inaction on this matter. (Cuba-

MADRID -- Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon Wednesday requested his

for health reasons.

Spanish juridical sources said that Garzon has also informed
British officials that he would appeal if British Home Secretary
Jack Straw decides that Pinochet, 84, is too ill to stand trial.
In October 1998, Garzon issued a warrant to arrest the Chilean
life-long senator who was in London for medical treatment. He
charged Pinochet with crimes against human rights and insisted on
having him sent to Spain for trial, saying that more than 3,000
people died or disappeared during his 1973-90 rule. (Spain-Britain-

<HEADLINE> Over 800 Internet Users Registered in Lhasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of Internet users in
Lhasa, capital of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, has
increased to 846 since Tibet opened Internet service in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the Lhasa telecom bureau, 60 percent
of the Internet users are individuals, most of them young people.
</P>
<P>
The other users are government agencies, state-owned
enterprises, and private companies, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Less than two years ago, most Tibetans were unfamiliar with
words such as "download" and "e-mail," but now more and more
people are becoming used to these new words of the information age.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the year, the Lhasa telecom bureau offered
a free registration service, attracting 192 new Internet users in
only 15 days.
</P>
<P>
"I feel I am closer to the rest of the country and the world
since I went on line," one young Tibetan man said.
</P>
<P>
Tibet's tourism department now has a website dedicated to
travel routes and programs for people interested in visiting this
mysterious land.
</P>
<P>
Along with the Internet service provided by the telecom bureau,
a computer network on Chinese education and science was also
established recently at Tibet University, aimed at providing more
information for Internet users.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Policy Holders Increase in Chinese Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 40 percent of families
in urban China have bought insurance and the market is expected to
expand further this year, according to a recent sample survey.
</P>
<P>
Among the insurance policy holders, most have bought pension,
life and medical insurance, while a smaller proportion have bought
family property or car insurance.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that in 1999 only 3.8 percent of the
respondents bought private property insurance and 3.2 percent
bought car insurance. In contrast, 4.5 percent of urban residents
bought life insurance. 4.0 percent bought medical insurance and 3.
8 pension insurance.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted by the Beijing-based China Mainland
Marketing Research Company and 13 other information and consulting
service firms in 14 major Chinese cities at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
It was carried out among 40 million people in Beijing, Dalian,
Changchun, Harbin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Jinan, Zhengzhou,
Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Xi'an and Lanzhou.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that the insurance policy holders have a
higher level of education and wealth. About 47.5 percent have
college degrees or above, and the richer a person is, the more
likely he or she will take an insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 25.7 percent of the respondents plan
to buy insurance this year, 11.1 percent higher than last year.
Family property, medical care and accident insurance are expected
to increase considerably this year.

NANNING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region hosted 770,000 overseas tourists in 1999, up 47.
14 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the autonomous region chalked up
201 million U.S. dollars in hard currency earnings last year, a
rise of 28.84 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
Located along the southern coast, Guangxi has plenty of tourism
resources, including a spectacular karst landscape, famous for its
pinnacles and spires, caves and caverns, sinkholes and
subterranean streams, and picturesque rocky hills and strangely
shaped stone formations.
</P>
<P>
Beginning last year, the central government decided to treat
tourism as the engine for fresh economic growth, and invested more
money than ever in this expanding sector.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi was allocated 30 million yuan to develop its tourism
industry last year, and this investment paid off as tourism came
out of an eight-year slump in the region to become a dynamic part
of the local economy.

XIAMEN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The coastal city of Xiamen in
east China's Fujian Province, one of the country's special
economic zones, approved 209 overseas-funded enterprises in 1999
with combined contractual overseas capital of more than 1.28
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This brought the total number of overseas-funded businesses in
the city to 4,731, and the entire amount of contractual overseas
investment to 16.62 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of the overseas-funded enterprises established last year, about
half are financed by existing overseas-funded businesses prompted
by their good performance.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen has taken a series of measures to improve its business
environment over the past few years, including reducing the
economic burdens on overseas-funded enterprises and enhancing
investment services.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 60 percent of the overseas-
funded businesses in the city are operating well.
</P>
<P>
Last year these enterprises achieved more than 47.85 billion
yuan in industrial output, making up nearly 84 percent of the city
's total.

In the past, it took a long time for applicants to get a
passport as they were asked to provide dozens of documents to
government departments.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Civil Aviation Sector Turns Losses into Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China's civil aviation sector
succeeded in turning losses into profits in 1999 as a result of
painstaking efforts, Liu Jianfeng, director of the General
Administration of Civil Aviation, said here today.
</P>
<P>
The sector earned 79.7 billion yuan last year, up 10.2 percent
on an annual basis, with a profit of 790 million yuan, Liu
disclosed at sector's ongoing national work conference.
</P>
<P>
The sector incurred losses of 2.4 billion yuan in 1998 due to
the Asian financial crisis and irrational domestic price
competition, as well as redundant transportation capability, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Liu attributed the 1999 good performance mainly to the
administration's effective measures such as stopping the price war,
standardizing plane ticket agencies, optimizing air routes and
reducing unnecessary flights.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the industry's gross transport
turnover reached 10.5 billion ton-kilometers last year, a growth
of 13.1 percent from 1998. Airlines nationwide carried 60.6
million persons and 1.69 million tons of cargoes and mails in 1999,
up 5.3 percent and 20.8 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Transportation on international air routes and routes
connecting inland areas with Hong Kong and Macao maintained a
robust growth last year, while domestic passenger air transport
also managed to emerge from the red, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The sector's fixed asset investment stood at 19.7 billion yuan
last year, with which 13 airport terminal buildings and expansion
projects completed.
</P>
<P>
The senior civil aviation official also predicted that the
gross transport turnover in 2000 will reach 11.5 billion ton-
kilometers, an annual increase of 9.3 percent. The volumes of
passenger and cargo are expected to grow 5.6 percent and 11.1
percent to 64 million persons and 1.88 million tons, respectively.
</P>
<P>
This year, the sector also will invest 19 billion yuan in
infrastructure construction, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
The administration will continue to control the number of
operational aircraft this year, including delaying the delivery of
ordered new planes and selling or renting redundant planes, as
well as turning old passenger planes into cargo carriers, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Should Prepare Well for WTO Entry: Economic Daily (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China should seize the
opportunity that will come with entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and prepare well for the upcoming challenges,
says a front-page signed article in today's Economic Daily.
</P>
<P>
The correct attitude towards China's accession into the WTO is
to know the situation well, seize the opportunity, and face the
challenge, says the article entitled "WTO Needs China and China
Needs WTO."
</P>
<P>
The article says two attitudes towards WTO entry should be
guarded against -- becoming panicked by the challenges or becoming
blindly self-satisfied by the opportunities WTO entry creates.
</P>
<P>
Officials and entrepreneurs should be well prepared when the
challenges come, and the competitiveness of manufacturing
industries, agriculture, and the service sectors must be improved.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the article says, relevant laws on foreign trade,
overseas investment and the protection of intellectual property
rights should be reassessed and revised, and new laws must be made
so that China can face the challenges while undertaking the
obligations.

<HEADLINE> China Should Prepare Well for WTO Entry: Economic Daily (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article says that the WTO needs China's membership and
China needs to join the WTO. The WTO needs China's membership
because of China's huge market potential and business
opportunities, and because overseas capital, technology, and
market resources will help accelerate the country's economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-US bilateral agreement on China's WTO accession
reached last November, the article says, is a "win-win" deal
satisfactory to both sides.
</P>
<P>
During the negotiations, China insisted on three principles for
WTO entry, saying that the WTO is incomplete without the
participation of China, the world's largest developing country,
that China can only join as a developing country, and that China's
rights and obligations as a WTO member should be given equal
status.
</P>
<P>
The three principles stress that China should take the
initiative and face economic globalization, make use of its
advantages while avoiding harm, seize the opportunity for a better
development environment, and safeguard China's national interests.
</P>
<P>
"China has, in the China-U.S. bilateral agreement ...realized
its set goal," the article says, adding that "The two sides have
reached a win-win deal."

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's economy has now
become service-dominated, as the sector accounted for nearly half
of the metropolis' gross domestic product (GDP) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say this represents Shanghai's transition from China's
leading industrial center to a more modern economic hub.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the service sector achieved more
than 200 billion yuan in added value last year, up 13 percent from
the previous year, and compared with a nine percent growth in the
secondary industry.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, the proportion of the service
industry in the local economy grew from 18.6 percent to 49.6
percent, while that of the secondary industry dropped from 77.4
percent to 48.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai began a massive economic restructuring drive in the
early 1980s, and later set the goal of becoming an international
financial, information, and trade and shipping center.
</P>
<P>
The municipality saw a hefty economic growth of 10.2 percent
last year, outstripping the national growth rate of 7.1 percent.
Shanghai's GDP last year was 403.5 billion yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Anshan Iron and Steel
Company, China's oldest state-owned steel corporation, is now one
of the country's leading steel exporter, selling 670,000 tons of
products overseas in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Local official sources say that the company, in north east
China's Liaoning Province, an old heavy-industry base of China,
took in 130 million US dollars from the exports, second only to
the Baoshan Iron and Steel Company in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the company said that the Chinese government's
control over steel production and the low prices of these products
last year, forced the company to aim at the international market,
where their quality steel earned a solid reputation.
</P>
<P>
During the second half of last year, Anshan's averaged monthly
exports exceeded 100,000 tons of steel products, three or four
times as many as in the same period of 1998.

Since the 1980s, nearly 10,000 students from the county have
gone to colleges and universities nationwide, and 100 of them

Many of these well-educated people from Yushan are now engaging
in a variety of fields at home and abroad, and some of them have
become celebrated in their fields.
</P>
<P>
The large number of intellectuals coming from this small area
is due to the great attention given to education by the local
people, 98.5 percent of whom have gone at least to middle schools,
and fewer than one percent of the local adults are illiterate.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government should
extend all possible support to the local industry in order to
enable the latter to face the global competition, Metropolitan
Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) has suggested.
</P>
<P>
The MCCI leaders called on the government to take effective
measures to curb illegal imports, sort out the banking problems,
reduce interest rates further, improve the electricity supply
situation, launch equity financing facility and ensure access to
regional markets.
</P>
<P>
These suggestions were put forward by the MCCI in a meeting of
its newly-elected committee to Commerce Minister Abdul Jalil for
improving the overall business environment for the country's trade
and industry.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the credit restrictions operationalized through the
Credit Information Bureau posed a major problem to many existing
industries, the MCCI suggested the immediate launching of an
Equity Participation Fund, with possible assistance from the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to help industries
modernize and also to finance new industries.
</P>
<P>
The MCCI also urged Jalil to ensure that his ministry plays a
major role in the implementation of the Pre-Shipment Inspection
which would be able to solve the problem of illegal imports to
some extent.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Unveils Deficit Budget for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
Thursday unveiled to parliament a deficit draft budget for 2000.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget is contained in the Financial Notes of the
draft state budget proposed by President Abdurrahman Wahid and
read out by Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputri before the House
of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit for April-December 2000 is projected to
reach 45.37 trillion rupiah (6.5 billion U.S. dollars) or five
percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), as total government
revenues are projected to reach 137.695 trillion rupiah (19.67
billion dollars) while its expenditures are projected to amount to
183.07 trillion rupiah (26.15 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to Finance Minister Bambang Sudibyo, the deficit in
the 2000 budget was lower than that for the current 1999/2000
financial year ending March 31, 2000, namely 6.8 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The government revenues consist of tax and non-tax revenues.
Tax revenues are projected at 97.78 trillion rupiah, while non-tax
revenues are estimated at 39.92 trillion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The total government expenditures consist of routine
expenditures estimated at 143.68 trillion rupiah and development
expenditures projected at 39.39 trillion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The government's draft state budget predicted that the country'
s economy is expected to grow at a rate of three to four percent
in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The fact that there was an expansion of 3.1 percent in the
second quarter of 1999, which was followed with an increase of 0.
54 percent in the third quarter, showed the fairly good
development in the national economy, the president said.
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of this, in the fiscal year 1999/2000, the
Indonesian economy is estimated to grow one to two percent," Wahid
said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to various government policies such as the prudent
monetary policy, he said, basic commodities are adequately
available and the distribution of goods and services is smooth.
</P>
<P>
Also due to such policies, the exchange rate of the rupiah is
relatively stable and the growth of the consumer price index in 43
cities in the first nine months of the 1999/2000 fiscal year was
adequately under control.
</P>
<P>
During that period, the president said, inflation stood at
minus 2.61 percent, much lower than the 40.70 percent recorded
during the previous corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
The prudent monetary policy strengthened the exchange rate of
the rupiah. In the Year 2000, the exchange rate of the Indonesian
currency is estimated to be 7,000 rupiah per U.S. dollar, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
In line with the initial strengthening of the rupiah's exchange
rate and with the decrease in the inflation rate, the bank
interest rates also began to slide, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said the government will take comprehensive institutional
repairs as the main measure to overcome the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the short-term, an urgent measure to be taken in the context
of accelerating economic recovery is to maintain economic
stability and restructure the banking and business sectors
considered to be the root causes of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that Indonesia will be able to hold a key role in
the world economic growth some time in future... I am optimistic
as I know that Indonesia have a lot of natural resources and full
of good people," the president stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has decided to start the new state
budget based on the calendar year rather than the fiscal year used
in the previous budgets.
</P>
<P>
The first calendar year budget will only be a nine-month budget
because it would start in April 1, 2000 and end in December 31,
2000.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Bambang Sudibyo said the change aims to adjust
it to international standards.

<HEADLINE> Thais Enthusiastic about Buying Government Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Thailand sold out its
five billion baht (135.1 million U.S. dollars) government bonds in
a few hours Wednesday, the Bangkok Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The five-year government bonds will offer an interest rate of 6.
4 percent, paid every six months. After-tax returns are 5.44
percent, still considerably favorable given that bank deposit
rates are now at between 2.75 percent and 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 Thai investors came away from the headquarters
of the central bank Wednesday disappointed.
</P>
<P>
Central bank officials were quoted as saying that they did not
expect the bonds would attract such frantic interest from the
public. A previous batch worth 10 billion baht (270.2 million
dollars) took 17 days to sell out.
</P>
<P>
But with interest rates on bank deposits falling to their
lowest level in Thai banking history and the stock market volatile,
depositors crave safe investments with higher returns to guard
their hard-earned savings, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Investors can sell the bonds to local financial institutions
after six months.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry is expected to approve a second five-
billion-baht issue for individuals, which will carry a term of
seven years and pay an interest rate of 7.25-7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
It has been that the bonds would be used to help finance the
110 billion baht (2.9 billion dollars) budget deficit of the Thai
government expected for the fiscal year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, British Vice-Premiers Discuss Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice-Premier Wu
Bangguo said here Wednesday that the development of long-term,
friendly and stable Sino-British relations and cooperation tallies
with the fundamental interests of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
In talks with British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, Wu
said the past years have witnessed ever-increasing development of
bilateral ties. In 1998, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and British
Prime Minister Tony Blair conducted a successful exchange of
visits, during which the two sides issued a joint statement on the
establishment of a comprehensive China-UK partnership.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's successful state visit to
Britain last October, in particular, laid a solid foundation for
the cross-century development of bilateral ties, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-premier, who arrived here Tuesday for an
official visit, said bilateral economic cooperation has also made
headway with the total volume of two-way trade reaching more than
7 billion U.S. dollars in 1999. The economies of the two countries
are complementary and trade relations have a great potential, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted China's entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
would not only serve the further development of China's economy,
but also contribute to promoting its economic and trade
cooperation with other countries.
</P>
<P>
He said China is now conducting bilateral negotiations with the
European Union (EU) on China's entry to the WTO and he hoped
Britain would play a more positive role in encouraging the EU to
sign an agreement with China as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Prescott said Britain attaches importance to developing
relations with China as it is a country of great potential. He
added that Britain would continue to exert more efforts to further
improve bilateral political and economic ties.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also exchanged views on human rights and other
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Britain is the first leg of Wu's three-nation European tour
which will also take him to Belgium and Switzerland. He will also
visit the EU headquarters in Brussels and attend the annual
meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Yi Reaches Career High at Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MELBOURNE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- It means nothing special for
such big guns as Martina Hingis or Venus Williams but a lot for
the diminutive Chinese Yi Jingqian.
</P>
<P>
Yi, 25, reached a career high on Wednesday after she disposed
of Julie Pullin of Britain 6-3, 2-6, 9-7 to make the third round
of the prestigious Australian Open tennis tournament where she
fell at the first hurdle in all the previous three attempts.
</P>
<P>
Yi, who entered the tournament with a wildcard for her current
141st world ranking, opened her campaign with a hard-won triumph
over Laurence Courtois of Belgium 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I had made up my mind to improve my performance at this
tournament which I failed at the first round for three times. My
aim this year is just to win ranking points as possible as I could
and make preparation for the upcoming Olympics," Yi said.
</P>
<P>
The Asian wildcard was introduced in 1997, offering a main draw
berth for one man and one woman outside the entry cut-off but
within the top 200. Japanese Gouichi Motomura is the other
recipient for the first grand slam event of the new century.
</P>
<P>
What excites Yi, however, is not only the points she won but
also the growing pain behind her progress in the grand slam event.
</P>
<P>
Yi has been put to the test of the grueling international
competition after the Chinese Tennis Association (CTA) made a bold
decision to join the elite women players into the WTA Tour for
more ranking points and international experience.
</P>
<P>
The crowded Tour agenda turned out to be an unpleasant thing
for the professional newcomer.
</P>
<P>
"To play as a professional means you have to play throughout
the year. You have little time to rest or enjoy yourself. There is
a tour competition every week.
</P>
<P>
"So I can only feel happy by winning matches. Only when I won,
I feel the tour is worthwhile, but if I was suffering a losing
skid, it is easy to imagine how I would feel,"said Yi. "I feel the
life is indeed hard and dull."
</P>
<P>
But what makes difference is the more monotonous life is, the
more determined Yi becomes.
</P>
<P>
"I have been hard to beat and like to challenge impossible
since the childhood. I think it is very important to be a tough
guy. I never gave up whoever I plays with."
</P>
<P>
"To fight is the only way to win," noted Yi.
</P>
<P>
Her commitment to tennis has won thumbs-up from her personal
coach Jeff King.
</P>
<P>
"I believe Yi is somebody who possess natural ability and
strong determination,"said King who began to coach Yi in the
summer of 1999 under the invitation of the CTA.
</P>
<P>
"I have a good understanding of Chinese tennis through working
with the Chinese national tennis team and coaching Ms. Li Fang for
almost two years where she achieved a world ranking of 36."
</P>
<P>
Li, who currently ranks 86th in the world, is another Chinese
player competing in the professional circuit and made the last 32
of the Australian Open in 1992. She skipped the Australian Open
for leg injury.
</P>
<P>
As for the performance in the tournament, King felt proud of
her Chinese charge.
</P>
<P>
"I am proud of the way Yi has played in her first two matches.
The two opponents she has beaten, she previously has lost to them.
She has followed a sound game plan, adapted well to the court
conditions and climate and raised the quality level of her game at
crucial stages of the match to win key points."

<HEADLINE> ADB Scales Down Philippine Growth Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has scaled down the growth forecast of the Philippines' gross
domestic product (GDP) to between 3 and 4 percent in 2000, down
from its previous estimate of 4.5 percent, Business World said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a report of the ADB as saying that the GDP
would expand by 2.7 to 3.2 percent in 1999, slightly lower than
the projection of the Philippine government which placed 1999 GDP
growth at 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
While describing the Philippines' overall macroeconomic
condition as "satisfactory," the ADB noted certain indicators show
a slowdown in the recovery process because of lack of economic
activity.
</P>
<P>
"In the short term, although agriculture has revived, the
economy has still to recover from the Asian currency crisis," said
the ADB.
</P>
<P>
"This is evident in continued low industrial activity, high
unemployment, high nonperforming loans and lack of adequate credit
growth, low investment demand, and low foreign private capital
inflows," the bank added.
</P>
<P>
The Manila-based multilateral agency warned that the economic
recovery process "could be halted" by delays in the implementation
of key reforms needed to address specific problems exposed by the
Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Concerns are being raised on inadequate progress in several
fronts, including revenue realizations, quality of public
expenditures, important remaining tasks in banking and financial
sectors," said the ADB.
</P>
<P>
It said the Philippine government should immediately implement
reform programs covering the financial sector and capital markets
to assuage investor skittishness.

U.S. authorities orders which noticed the illegality of the child
documents, the Attorney General's Office (AGO) said.
</P>
<P>
The couple, Ruiz Jr. Reyes and Norma Jan Ratliff McGovern, were
taken to the authorities under the charge of kidnapping an infant
named Marisol, while the child was taken to a shelter of the AGO.
</P>
<P>
During interrogations, the woman confessed to the U.S. Embassy
that she and her husband paid 2,500 dollars for the newborn baby
in the city of Leon, Guanajuato State, 300 kilometers northeast of
Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
The AGO has started investigations about the case and believes
that the child's mother would show up shortly to give her
statement.
</P>
<P>
Authorities from the National System for the Integral Family
Development said that at least 250 disappearances happened in
Mexico City in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, children were kidnapped for adoption out of the
country and in some other cases, the destination of the children
could not be determined, according to authorities.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Judge Plans Appeal if Britain Frees Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon
Wednesday requested his government process his appeal if British
officials free Pinochet for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
Spanish juridical sources said that Garzon has also informed
British officials that he would appeal if British Home Secretary
Jack Straw decides that Pinochet, 84, is too ill to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
In October 1998, Garzon issued a warrant to arrest the Chilean
life-long senator who was in London for medical treatment. He
charged Pinochet with crimes against human rights and insisted on
having him sent to Spain for trial, saying that more than 3,000
people died or disappeared during his 1973-90 rule.
</P>
<P>
Straw said last week that he was considering freeing Pinochet
and the final decision would be made in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected that Pinochet may soon return to Chile
since the British Defense Ministry has authorized a Chilean
government plane to land at Brize Norton, an air base north of
London, on Wednesday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Call for Global Sanctuary for Whales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand would work with
Australia on a global sanctuary for whales and would promote their
protection at the meeting of the International Whaling Commission
in Adelaide, Australia in July, the Dominion Thursday quoted NZ
Prime Minister Helen Clark as saying.
</P>
<P>
Clark criticized public suggestions from a Japanese vice-
minister since the last commission meeting last May that Japan
could use aid to boost the number of countries sharing its views
on whaling.
</P>
<P>
"This sort of approach is deplorable," the Wellington-based
newspaper quoted the prime minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
She added: "New Zealand would be most concerned if its effects
were felt in the South Pacific."
</P>
<P>
New Zealand could strengthen its presence at South Pacific
Forum talks in mid-April if host country Japan shows "any sign of
stacking the meeting" in favor of whaling, Clark said.
</P>
<P>
Japan reportedly argues that all its whaling is for scientific
purposes and is therefore legal.

<HEADLINE> KFOR Commander Criticizes Western Policy Towards Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Klaus Reinhardt, commander of
the international peacekeeping force in Kosovo (KFOR), criticized
the Western policy towards Kosovo as "extraordinarily stupid,"
during an interview published in Wednesday's edition of the German
weekly "Die Woche."
</P>
<P>
The German four-star general said the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) paid dearly last spring for air strikes on
Yugoslavia and Kosovo to force the Yugoslav leadership to
compromise over the rebel province. But in contrast, they have not
provided much for the rebuilding of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
This is "extraordinarily stupid," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reinhardt also revealed that a quarter of the United Nations
total budget for rebuilding Kosovo, about 125 million German marks
(some 64.7 million U.S. dollars), has been "used by NATO to pay
off expenses for its air strikes."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the general criticized the international
community for being sluggish in sending police into the Kosovo
region, and failing to ensure relevant funding, which he blamed on
the absence of a law system there.
</P>
<P>
"They need not be surprised at the slow progress in that region,
" since they have neither supplied enough police forces to Kosovo
nor sufficient funding for those already there, he said.
</P>
<P>
Reinhardt admitted that the job of disarming Kosovo Albanian
armed groups is far from being completed.
</P>
<P>
"It is just impossible for the KFOR soldiers to go door-to-door
and search for all the weapons," he noted. In addition, he said,
the job should be done by the police, a role which KFOR should not
play.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Condemns Delay of Elian's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- President of Cuban National
Assembly, Ricardo Alarcon, Wednesday condemned Miami-based anti-
Cuban forces that mean to put off indefinitely Elian Gonzalez's
return to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
The six-year-old Cuban boy survived a shipwreck of illegal
immigrants during which his mother and step-father drowned.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for a relative of Elian in Miami filed a federal
lawsuit on Wednesday, challenging a decision by U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service (INS) that the boy should be returned
to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon said in a television interview that this step permits
taking the case away from INS jurisdiction. He also accused the U.
S. government of inaction on this matter.
</P>
<P>
The problem lies with the fact that American authorities "have
done absolutely nothing to apply this (INS) decision," Alarcon
said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno last week lifted an INS
deadline for the boy's return to allow Elian's relatives in Miami
time to challenge the INS decision in federal court.
</P>
<P>
Reno, however, also believed that the boy should be returned to
his father.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban boy has been staying with his relatives in Miami,
Florida, since November 25. Although INS recognized his father as
his sole legal guardian, his uncles and great-uncles in Miami have
refused to comply with this decision.
</P>
<P>
The relatives have twice applied for political asylum for Elian,
but the application was turned down by the INS on the grounds that
only his father can speak for him.

<HEADLINE> Michael Jordan Named Wizards President (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan is back in
the NBA for what may be his biggest challenge.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Wizards today named Jordan, one of the most
important sports figures of the 20th century, as president of
basketball operations and gave him an equity share in the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
"It is a new challenge. I don't get to play. I don't get to
wear a Wizards' uniform," Jordan told a packed news conference. "
But I will have influence with the palyers who wear the uniform...
I'm going to try to have my imprint and footprints all over this
place."
</P>
<P>
Jordan becomes only the third minority black owner in the NBA,
with Magic Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers and Edward and
Bettiann Gardner of the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to show our children what it means to be an
executive, a role model," Mayor Anthony Williams said. "It really
is simply going to electrify our city."
</P>
<P>
Jordan said the Wizards deal requires an out-of-pocket
investment, but would not elaborate what percentage he will own.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, 36, brings instant excitement to a moribund franchise
which has not won a playoff game in 12 years. The Wizards are last
in the Atlantic Division with a 12-27 record and have not had a
sellout this season.
</P>
<P>
Worshiped worldwide by young and old, men and women, fans and
athletes, Jordan retired for the second time as a player last
January, seven months after leading the Chicago Bulls to their
sixth NBA titles in eight years.
</P>
<P>
The NBA forbids players from owning teams, thus preventing
Jordan from being a player-owner even if he desired to do so.
</P>
<P>
As head of basketball operations, Jordan would oversee trades,
free agent signings, and the drafting of players as the hiring and
firing of front-office personnel.
</P>
<P>
With the NBA working on his behalf, Jordan has been pushing for
an ownership or front office role in the league. Last year, he
came close to purchasing the Charlotte Hornets, but backed off
when he was unable to gain majority control from George Shinn.

<P>
The Washington Post reported last Friday that Jordan and
Wizards majority owner Abe Pollin reached an agreement in
principle that would make Jordan the head of the Wizards'
basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
The Wizards, without a playoff game in 12 years, are last in
the Atlantic Division with a 12-27 record and have not had a
sellout this season. The mere presence of Jordan in a business
suit could fill the seats at the two-year-old MCI Center, where
the Wizards will host the Dallas Mavericks tonight.
</P>
<P>
"I have an attitude about the way I play," Jordan said. "I have
an attitude about the way I win... It's going to take some time
for me to come in and evaluate what's here, what's going to stay
here and what's going to leave."
</P>
<P>
For now, Jordan said he will retain general manager Wes Unseld
and coach Gar Heard. Wizards players immediately welcomed Jordan's
arrival. Point guard Rod Strickland, who earlier this season said
he wanted out of Washington, said he now wants to stay.
</P>
<P>
"That's very, very fair to say. This changes everything."
Strickland said. Pollin said:"He is one of the greatest athletes
that ever put on a suit. He is a straight, honest, decent,
wonderful human being."
</P>
<P>
Jordan was a 12-time All-Star, 10-time scoring champion and
five-time Most Valuable Players in his 13-year career with the
Bulls.

<HEADLINE> China to Double Forest Cover in 50 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China's forested area is
expected to double by the middle of this century, the China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The State Forestry Administration (SFA) has unveiled an
afforestation program aimed at improving the country's overall
ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
The newly-drafted blueprint outlines four projects in four
regions -- the environmentally fragile upper reaches of the
Yangtze and Yellow rivers, arid northern areas and the key forest
zones in northeast and east China.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhibao, director of the SFA, was quoted as saying that the
administration's top priority will be the construction of
ecologically-sound forests.
</P>
<P>
By the middle of this century, at least 1,100 counties in 24
provinces will be involved in the program which aims at tackling
soil erosion, shrinkage of natural forest and desertification,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
To curb the soil erosion along the Yangtze and Yellow rivers,
the SFA will order more than 700 counties covering two million
square kilometers to protect natural forests there. More than 300,
000 hectares of farmland on ground sloping more than 25 degrees
will be returned to forest, woodland or grass to improve
vegetation.
</P>
<P>
Forest shelters will be built up to halt the progress of
deserts in north China's semi-arid areas.
</P>
<P>
The SFA will also introduce a logging ban in northeast China
and Inner Mongolia in the north, where one-third of the country's
forests grow.
</P>
<P>
China's current forest coverage rate is less than 14 percent,
half the world's average; and its annual timber consumption is 150
million cubic meters, exceeding the world total annual timber
trade volume.

CANBERRA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Canberra Times:
</P>
<P>
-- About 50 Australians have fled the Indonesian resort island
of Lombok after an upsurge in religious violence, prompting a
warning for tourists to avoid travelling there.
</P>

</P>
<P>
-- Weeds, four-wheel-drive vehicles and the pressure of
millions of visitors each year have degraded national parks in
Australia's Queensland state to such an extent that two separate
inquiries have been launched to find ways to improve them.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:

<HEADLINE> Australia Must Examine U.S. Lamb Aid: Farmer Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Australia must examine the
latest U.S. assistance package to its domestic lamb producers to
ensure it did not breach world trade rules, Australia's National
Farmers Federation President Ian Donges said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The United States has injected an extra 160 million U.S.
dollars into its domestic lamb industry to help producers fight
off foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
The boost comes on top of last year's decision to freeze lamb
imports at 1998 levels and to impose a 9-percent tariff.
</P>
<P>
Donges said he suspected little could be done about the
decision, but that Australia should examine the package anyway for
possible breaches of World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.
</P>
<P>
"I guess the WTO is our best opportunity there and I'm sure the
United States would have looked very closely before offering this
package of assistance," he said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
The measures of the United States, announced last year, which
sparked widespread outrage in Australia and prompted farmers to
picket the U.S. embassy in Canberra, had already resulted in a 10
percent decline in Australian lamb exports, Donges said.
</P>
<P>
Donges also said the latest package was likely linked to the
current U.S. presidential race.
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt I'm sure it's got something to do with the
presidential election campaign coming up and pressure from lamb
producers to the Democratic Party to help them out of what they
would claim to be a very difficult situation," he said.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Ambassador Sees Much Debate in U.S. Congress on Colombia Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congress
appears to be having some difficulty in approving an aid package
of 1.6 billion U.S. dollars offered earlier by President Bill
Clinton to help Colombia fight drugs, said Colombian Ambassador to
Washington Luis Alberto Moreno on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be a difficult process. In Colombia we are
aware that it will be a very debated subject by the U.S. Congress,
" Moreno said in Santafe de Bogota.
</P>
<P>
Moreno was accompanying Colombian President Andres Pastrana in
a meeting with four U.S. legislators, who are on a mission here to
examine the anti-drug campaign, the protection of human rights and
peace talks with rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
On her visit to Colombia last Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said financial resources were a necessary part
of Pastrana's four-year plan to fight drugs and promote peace in
the Andean nation.
</P>
<P>
The multi-billion dollar aid to Colombia was announced by
Clinton on January 12. At least 80 percent of the package, which
has yet to be endorsed by Congress, is military aid, including
weapons, radar and intelligence equipment.
</P>
<P>
More than one-third of the package, the largest ever of its
kind for the country, is earmarked to buy 63 helicopter gunships
and to fund three U.S.-trained Colombian army anti-drug units.

<HEADLINE> Michael Jordan Named Wizards President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan is back in
the NBA for what may be his biggest challenge.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Wizards today named Jordan, one of the most
important sports figures of the 20th century, as president of
basketball operations and gave him an equity share in the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, 36, brings instant excitement to a moribund franchise
which has not won a playoff game in 12 years. The Wizards are last
in the Atlantic Division with a 12-27 record and have not had a
sellout this season.
</P>
<P>
Worshiped worldwide by young and old, men and women, fans and
athletes, Jordan retired for the second time as a player last
January, seven months after leading the Chicago Bulls to their
sixth NBA titles in eight years.
</P>
<P>
The NBA forbids players from owning teams, thus preventing
Jordan from being a player-owner even if he desired to do so.
</P>
<P>
As head of basketball operations, Jordan would oversee trades,
free agent signings, and the drafting of players as the hiring and
firing of front-office personnel.
</P>
<P>
With the NBA working on his behalf, Jordan has been pushing for
an ownership or front office role in the league. Last year, he
came close to purchasing the Charlotte Hornets, but backed off
when he was unable to gain majority control from George Shinn.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported last Friday that Jordan and
Wizards majority owner Abe Pollin reached an agreement in
principle that would make Jordan the head of the Wizards'
basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
The Wizards, without a playoff game in 12 years, are last in
the Atlantic Division with a 12-27 record and have not had a
sellout this season. The mere presence of Jordan in a business
suit could fill the seats at the two-year-old MCI Center, where
the Wizards will host the Dallas Mavericks tonight.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was a 12-time All-Star, 10-time scoring champion and
five-time Most Valuable Players in his 13-year career with the
Bulls.

LONDON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The players' union will do
everything within their power to assist Leeds duo Lee Bowyer and
Jonathan Woodgate, but will never condone off-field behaviour
which damages the game's image, according to local reports on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Both players have been released on bail after being questioned
by police in connection with a city centre attack on a youth in a
nightclub in Leeds last week.
</P>
<P>
Professional Footballers' Association deputy chief executive
Brendon Batson is determined to contact the Elland Road club for
full details about the incident and from there intends to be in
touch with Bowyer and Woodgate to offer help.
</P>
<P>
However, Batson made clear players need to be aware their
conduct will be under intense scrutiny away from the pitch as he
outlined the need to educate players at a young age.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Has Fresh Snub in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- American controversial boxer
Mike Tyson has had his request to continue early morning training
in London's Hyde Park turned down, despite asking the Royal Parks
Agency to make an exception.
</P>
<P>
The convicted rapist, who was controversially allowed into
Britain for a fight next week in Manchester, was told the 0330 GMT
runs were illegal under the 1997 Royal Parks and Open Spaces
Regulations.
</P>
<P>
He has already trained there under the cover of darkness three
times since arriving in the UK on Sunday, but said he was unaware
of the rules.
</P>
<P>
He could be served with a formal warning by Royal Parks Police
or even face prosecution and a 200 pounds fine if he carries on
training there.
</P>
<P>
An RPA spokesman said the park was closed between midnight and
5am, and that Tyson could train in openning hours, or go to St
James's and Green parks, which are both open all night.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot make an exception in his case and therefore cannot
grant permission," he added.
</P>
<P>
This is his second rejection in one day.
</P>
<P>
The boxer was reportedly planning to follow in the footsteps of
fellow boxer Muhammad Ali and conduct a walkabout in Brixton in
London on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Boxing legend Ali was given a hero's welcome when he visited
several charity projects in Brixton last year.
</P>
<P>
But Jim Dickson, leader of Lambeth council, which covers
Brixton, said: "Muhammad Ali was welcomed here as an inspiration
and role model to us all.
</P>
<P>
"Tyson is a pariah and definitely is not welcome here. He has
been allowed into the country to train, fight and then leave as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"He has got no business here in Brixton."
</P>
<P>
The boxer has already been told by community leaders to stay
away from Manchester's Moss Side, and that he would not be welcome
there during his time in the city.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's sell-out bout against British champion Julius Francis
takes place on 29 January in the Manchester Arena.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Promises to Abide by Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- American boxer Mike Tyson
promised on Wednesday he would fight by the rules and spectators
would not see any ear-biting, late blows or illegal clinches in
his heavyweight bout against Briton Julius Francis next week.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to follow all the rules...I respect Mr Francis and I
'm just looking forward to putting on a good show," said the
controversial fighter who met reporters and fans in chaotic scenes
at his central London hotel.
</P>
<P>
The "Mr Francis" Tyson was referring to is 64-year-old referee
Roy Francis, who had warned earlier in the week he would suffer no
nonsense on January 29 from either fighter.
</P>
<P>
"If he tries it on, I don't care whether it's the first minute
or the last, I'll send him packing without hesitation," Francis
was quoted as saying of Tyson.
</P>
<P>
The former undisputed world champion, who lost his title in a
huge 10th round upset to James 'Buster' Douglas in February 1990
in Tokyo, offered less respect to Julius Francis than his
officiating namesake.
</P>
<P>
"Oh, he's in a lot of trouble," Tyson replied when asked
whether he also respected Julius, who served time in prison 10
years ago for grievous bodily harm.
</P>
<P>
"I hear he's talking a lot of smack, what he's going to do, how
he's been to prison. Yeah, okay. We're going to see, tough guy."
</P>
<P>
Tyson also took a side-swipe at his compatriots, saying that
everybody in America was money-hungry.
</P>
<P>
"It's a rat race and even when you win you're still a freakin'
rat," he declared.
</P>
<P>
He added a much talked-about meeting with Britain's undisputed
world champion Lennox Lewis, who captured two titles from
Holyfield last November to add to his WBC belt, was "predestined".
</P>
<P>
"He's a tough fighter...by the time I come to fight him I will
prevail. We were supposed to fight since we were 15 years old and
never had the chance to fight in the world championships," said
Tyson.
</P>
<P>
"He's a tough son of a gun. There's no doubt," he said.

<HEADLINE> Police Arrest 9 Turkish Hezbollah Militants in Ankara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Nine people, suspected of being
members of the Turkish Hezbollah, were detained by police in Ankara
Wednesday, reported the Anatolia News Agency on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The arrest is part of a nation-wide crack down on the
clandestine Islamic group, accused of abducting and killing dozens
of businessmen across the country in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Kemal Iskender, director general of the Ankara Security
Department, said that the arrested Hezbollah militants confessed
that they had killed three people in Ankara and six others in
Konya, south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Three bodies were found in a coal storage room and the garden of
a triplex cell house in the Etimesgut District of Ankara on
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Hezbollah, founded in 1980 and grew up in late 1980s
in the turbulent southeastern part of the country, has been seeking
to fill the political vacuum left by the separatist Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) since the PKK fell to the low ebb as a result
of the arrest of its leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the police raids on the Turkish Hezbollah hideouts and the
arrests of its militants have increased in pace.
</P>
<P>
The latest dragnet started on Monday afternoon with an assault
on a villa in the country's largest city of Istanbul. In a fierce
shoot out, police shot dead a man who turned out to be the leader
of the Turkish Hezbollah, and two key members were caught.
</P>
<P>
According to the confessions of the two militants, police dug
out 10 bodies of the missing businessmen under a coal shed.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that with the initial success, police will
continue netting more Hezbollah militants and searching for more
bodies of the murdered businessmen throughout the country..
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Hezbollah does not have any links to the Lebanese
Hezbollah, an organization that has been engaged in a guerrilla war
against the Israeli occupation troops in southern Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Prospects for Cyprus Economy "Optimistic": Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Finance Minister Takis
Clerides Thursday said the prospects for Cyprus' economy in 2000
are "optimistic", with the rate of growth expected to reach 4.5
percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
Addressing to the Parliament on the occasion of the debate on
the budget for 2000, Clerides said the budget envisages expenditure
amouting to 2,007.4 million Cyprus pounds (4,014.8 million U.S.
dollars) and revenue amounting to 1,348.1 million pounds (2,696.2
million dollars) compared to 1,607.9 million pounds (3,215.8
million dollars) and 1,088.4 million pounds (2,176.8 million
dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Development expenditure is expected to reach 287.7 million
pounds (575.4 million dollars) with priority given to the
construction of large infranstructure projects.
</P>
<P>
The public deficit is expected to reach 227.2 million pounds
(454.4 million dollars) or 4.3 percent of the GDP and the public
debt will rise to 61.3 percent, deviating from the relevant
Maastricht Treaty criterion.
</P>

<P>
CAIRO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt received a total of 445 million U.S. dollars in
loans under two World Bank programs for the development of emerging
market.
</P>
<P>
Under a cooperation strategy formulated with Egypt, the World
Bank promised to help Egypt implement a future development plan and
deal with the regional and international challenges.
</P>
<P>
The strategy provides for backing Egypt's social policies on
poverty alleviation and raising the standard of living of the
people as well as improving infrastructure in the communication
sector.
</P>
<P>
It also envisages attracting more foreign investments, boosting
Egypt's foreign trade, increasing Egypt's exports, improving the
country's investment environment, reforming the management sector,
upgrading education and training and creating more job
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
GAZA -- The economic growth rate of the Palestinian self-rule
areas stood at 4.5 percent in 1999 as compared to 4.1 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1999, the number of new jobs went up to 47,
000, thus bringing down the unemployment rate from 15.6 percent in
the first half of 1998 to 13.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, investment and exports underwent a recess.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- Tunisia's foreign trade volume in 1999 stood at 17
billion dinars (13.7 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The volume of exports hit 6.97 billion dinars (5.6 billion
dollars) in 1999, up by 6.9 percent from that of 1998 while the
value of imports went up by 6 percent to reach 10.06 billion dinars
(about 8.1 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Olive oil exports revenue rose by 26.1 percent to reach 382.8
million dinars (307.7 million dollars), leather ware by 11.8
percent, mechanical industries by 7.4 percent and energy industry

</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- Iraq plans to lift its oil production capacity to 6
million barrels a day over five to seven years after the U.N.
lifted its crippling sanctions on Iraq, said Iraqi Oil Minister
Amir Muhammad Rashid.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will tap its gas potential to meet the increasing domestic
demand on liquefied gas.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-1999, Iraq has signed 1,620 contracts for buying spare
parts and machinery for the oil sector. However, about 50 percent
of the contracts are put on hold or under reconsiderations by the
U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Iraq estimates the amount of investments for revamping the oil
sector, that was severely damaged during the 1991 Gulf War, at 30
billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Consider Turkey's Water Offer: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus would consider an offer
by Turkey to supply water to the northern island if it did not
involve recognition of the northern breakaway state, said a Cyprus
official.
</P>
<P>
"We are positive, provided there is not direct or indirect
recognition of the pseudo-state," government spokesman Michalis
Papapetrou said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that an international consortium led by the
Istanbul-based Alsim-Alarko Company will begin building the
underwater pipeline sometime after June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
"We are planning to start construction in six months," said Ishak
Alaton, chairman of Alsim-Alarko.
</P>
<P>
Alaton said his company had been awarded the project in 1998 by
a Turkish cabinet decree.
</P>
<P>
Reports suggest that the pipeline project was part of Turkey's
goodwill gesture to Cyprus to facilitate the Cyprus peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Alaton said the "peace water project" had won U.S. approval for
its potential to promote peace between Greek Cypriots and Turkish
Cypriots under the current climate of rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
The 78-kilometre pipeline would have an annual throughput
capacity of 75 million cubic metres, much more than the amount
needed by the northern Cyprus. The surplus could be offered to the
southern Greek Cypriot area.
</P>
<P>
However, no such an official offer has been made so far either
by Turkey or by the northern Cyprus regime.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Water shortage is a long-standing problem on the island. The
Cyprus government has been taking water rationing measures for
several years.

<HEADLINE> Sino-British Economic Relationship in Its Best Ever  Shape, Says Chinese Vice-Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) - Sino-British economic and trade
relationship is now in its best ever period, said the visiting
Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at luncheon here by China-Britain Business Council, Wu
said, Trade and economic cooperation is an important cornerstone
of the comprehensive partnership between China and Britain.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the Sino-Britain trade only accounts for one
percent of Britain's foreign trade and Britain's investment in
China only 4 percent its total investment abroad.
</P>
<P>
"This makes it possible for us to increase mutually beneficial
economic cooperation," added the Chinese Vice-Premier, who arrived
here Tuesday for an official visit.
</P>
<P>
Referring to China's further development, Wu said China would
soon implement its third-step development strategy to accelerate
the development of China's west, a region vast in size, rich in
natural resources and with a huge market and development potential.
</P>
<P>
It will like the development of eastern coastal areas that has
served as a driving force for the sustained and rapid development
of the whole country, forcefully promote greater prosperity in
China, the Chinese Vice-Premier said.
</P>
<P>
Wu expressed hope that British business community will
participate in this grand project which is a major decision China
has made in the face of the new century.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Wu also expressed his gratitude to Britain's
business community for the active efforts and outstanding
contribution they have made through the years to the promotion of
China-Britain trade and economic relations.

<HEADLINE> Developing Nations Urged to Focus on Diseases of Poor People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Governments of developing
nations must guard against the temptation to concentrate spending
on "rich diseases" and must shift their focus on diseases of the
poor if they aim to best improve the lives of people in the
poorest countries, said a new World Bank report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled The Burden of Disease among the Global
Poor: Current Situation, Future Trends, and Implications for
Strategy, was co-published with the Global Forum for Health
Research.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, health experts have focused on the global rise
of noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and
diabetes. The new World Bank report pointed out, however, that
focus on these noncommunicable ailments is biased against the poor
because the poorest fifth of the world's population suffers
disproportionately from communicable diseases such as malaria,
maternal conditions, and diarrheal ailments.
</P>
<P>
The report said that, on the one hand, the poorest 20 percent
of the global population would gain over ten times as much as the
richest 20 percent, in terms of added life expectancy during the
period from 1990 to 2020, by doubling the rate of decline for
mortality from communicable diseases spread evenly across all
economic groups. Life expectancy in these poorest countries would
then increase by 12.7 years to 66.3 years by 2020.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a comparably-distributed doubling in the
rate of decline for noncommunicable diseases during the same
period would benefit the world's richest 20 percent nearly four
times as much as it would the global poorest 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report observed that seven types of disease were
responsible for nearly three-quarters of the difference in
mortality levels experienced by the world's richest and poorest
population groups. The most important among these were respiratory
infections, diarrheal diseases, and other communicable diseases
that particularly affect infants and children.
</P>
<P>
The study also showed that in general, interventions against
communicable diseases tend to be less expensive than interventions
against noncommunicable diseases, relative to impact.
</P>
<P>
On possibility for closing the gap between the rich and the
poor, the report suggested, would be a global research effort to
develop an inexpensive, easily administered vaccine against
respiratory or other widely distributed infections,.
</P>
<P>
Such an innovation could, in theory at least, be delivered with
relative ease to all population groups worldwide, regardless of
income, the report said. In this case, the intervention could
bring roughly the same degree of health advancement to all
segments of the population.

</P>
<P>
Federal formations, together with the Chechen militia,continued

the central Minutka Square has been put under federal control, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, Chechen military commandant Ina Munayev said several

</P>
<P>
In Moscow, an Interior Ministry general said federal troops
have established control over "a considerable part" of Grozny,
where 700 militants are fighting federal forces, Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Grozny remains tense. Militants are suffering
heavy losses and their defense lines have been broken," said
Lieutenant General Stanislav Kavun, deputy commander-in-chief of
Russian Interior Troops.
</P>
<P>
Four federal servicemen have been reported killed and four
injured over the past 24 hours, Tass reported.

northern federal grouping in Chechnya, went missing in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
But Tass, quoting unofficial sources, said the general was
killed Tuesday when his unit was ambushed by Chechen militants.
</P>
<P>
Malofeyev sustained two gunshot wounds in the spine and one in
the head and died on the spot when his unit was ambushed in

<HEADLINE> New Study Finds Manufacturing Leading U.S. Economic Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The manufacturing sector is
leading America's economic expansion, according to a new study
released recently by The Manufacturing Institute, the research and
education affiliate of the National Association of Manufacturers (
NAM).
</P>
<P>
The study, The Facts About Modern Manufacturing, combated
prevailing myths about manufacturing's role in the economy with
statistics and information culled from impartial sources such as
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Department of Commerce
and the National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
"Once you get beyond the misperceptions about manufacturing,
the facts show that industry remains crucial to the success of the
U.S. economy and our recent strong, non-inflationary growth, which
is fueled in large part by the exceptional productivity gains in
manufacturing," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the NAM and
vice chairman of The Manufacturing Institute.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, manufacturing contributed 29 percent
to economic growth in the United States in the 1990s, more than
any sector. Services came in second at 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
From 1992 to 1997, U.S. economic growth increased at an average
rate of 3.1 percent. During the same period, manufacturing's share
of gross domestic product grew even faster, at a rate of 5.2
percent per year.
</P>
<P>
The productivity in manufacturing leaped by more than 4.7
percent per year during 1996-1999. That's double the rate of
productivity improvement in the rest of the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
Manufactured exports have doubled in the past decade. Today,
nearly 15 percent of the products made in the United States are
destined for markets overseas. In 1985, that figure was seven
percent.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the facts are on our side, and they show that
manufacturing is the most important and dynamic sector of the U.S.
economy in terms of productivity, technology, trade, and the
American standard of living," concluded Jasinowski.

<HEADLINE> EU-S. Africa Trade Deal Could Be in Serious Trouble, EU Official Warns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The 17-billion-U.S. dollar
trade pact between South Africa and the European Union (EU) will
be in "serious trouble" if Pretoria's latest concessions are
rejected by EU members, EU Ambassador to South Africa Micheal
Laidler warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt in everybody's mind that unless we find a
solution in a short space of time, there could be serious
repercussions for the future of this agreement," Laidler told the
South African Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
"We believe we are now at the end of the road as regards
negotiations," the EU envoy said. "Our positions are clear. A
proposal has been made. We will see if it has been accepted and if
it is not, I think we will be in serious trouble."
</P>
<P>
After two days of talks in Pretoria this week, South African
Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin offered EU Development
Commissioner Poul Nielson a compromise over use of the names
"grappa" (made in Italy) and "ouzo" (made in Greece) on South
African wine and alcohol products.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said
Thursday: "We are disappointed with the way in which these
negotiations are going. Nevertheless, we hope that progress will
be made."
</P>
<P>
The trade, development and cooperation agreement between EU and
South Africa, which was signed last October after four years of
tough negotiations and have come effect on January 1 this year,
struck a big hurdle when Italy and Greece threatened not to ratify
the accord if South Africa refused to phase out using of the two
terms of "grappa" and "ouzo".
</P>
<P>
While details of the concessions have not been made public, the
South African media claimed Thursday that Erwin had offered to put
the words "South African" before "grappa" and "ouzo" on labels.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Smashes Smuggling Ring on Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Navy has stopped a
major syndicate smuggling Somalis into the country aboard a
fishing boat, Kenyan police revealed to the press Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Albert Waweru, police chief at Lamu port said that the Navy
patrol personnel intercepted the Kenyan-registered vessel,
Swebrina, on the sea near the Kenyan-Somali border in Coast
Province.
</P>
<P>
Lamu police held 19 people on board who admitted they were
Somali nationals, Waweru said.
</P>
<P>
The police chief said the captain of the vessel was expected to
appear in court on charges of harboring aliens.
</P>
<P>
These Somalis said that they had paid the captain about 100
U.S. dollars to take them to Mombasa, a port city in southeastern
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Waweru said since they are not people seeking refugee status,
they would be shipped back to Somalia which hasn't had a central
government since 1991.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, this was not the first incident and
the vessels have been using illegal ports along Kenya's coast to
sneak the aliens into the country.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Navy has recently intensified security patrols on
its border with Somalia. Late last year, eight Somalis who had
been smuggled into Kenya were arrested at Wilson Airport in
Nairobi.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Mexico Trade up to $178 Billion in 1999. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The figure surpasses the 173.8 billion dollars of 1998,
according to the U.S. Department of Commerce monthly report
received in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
The document underscores that Mexico increased its trade
surplus of 21.992 billion dollars, compared to 15 billion dollars
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
These figures put Mexico as the second United States trade
partner behind Canada, with which it had a 333.476 billion dollar
in the first 11 months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Mexican authorities foresee that their country can be the first
U.S. trade partner in the next 10 years, in agreement with the
full implementation of the North America Free Trade Agreement (
NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
The report says that the United States and Mexico had a trade
exchange that did not go beyond 81 billion dollars in 1993, before
the NAFTA came in force.
</P>
<P>
The document of that U.S. government agency says that Mexico
transformed after 1995 its trade deficits with the United States
into consecutive surpluses, which reached a historical record of
17.5 billion dollars in 1996, 14.5 billion in 1997, and 15.7
billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Expresses Confidence in Peace Talks with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking to reporters outside the White House following the
meeting, Arafat called the meeting "fruitful and productive" and
said the main point of their discussions was how to move the peace
process ahead.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure and we are determined to complete our endeavor of
achieving the goals of comprehensive peace during the tenure of
President Clinton," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting began, Clinton urged the Palestinians and
Israelis to make concessions in order to achieve an agreement.
</P>
<P>
"In any process like this there must be inevitable and
difficult compromise," Clinton said when the meeting began in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"No one can get everything that either side wants but I am
convinced we can get there," the president added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was aimed at speeding up the pace of slow-moving
talks between Israel and the Palestinians. In the morning, Arafat
had a meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Arafat later had a lunch with Albright at her home in the
capital's Georgetown neighborhood. Speaking at a regular briefing,
Albright's spokesman James Rubin said, "We do regard it as a
formidable challenge."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters ahead the meeting, White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart underscored deep differences between the Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious how difficult the challenge is they face," the
spokesman said, indicating that the deadline set for a frame
agreement on final settlement can be postponed.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Arafat last year set
February 13 as the deadline for resolving their disputes over
Palestinian statehood aspirations and the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
After the framework agreement, a full agreement is expected to
be concluded in September this year.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is seeking to establish a state and be given part of
Jerusalem as its capital while the Israelis seem to be agreeable
to having a Palestinian state, but not on the Jerusalem issue.

<HEADLINE> Investigators: All Signs Indicate EgyptAir Crash Was Deliberate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The examination of the shattered Boeing 767, some 70 percent of
which was recovered from the ocean floor, has revealed no signs of
a mechanical failure that would have caused the plane to plummet
40 minutes into its 11-hour flight, according to government
officials close to the investigation who asked not to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
"Everything leads everyone to believe that the plane was
mechanically sound and it was doing what it was supposed to, " one
official said. There is just no "smoking gun" to indicate
mechanical failure, he added.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have said that the cockpit voice recorder
contained some utterance, perhaps a prayer, before the plane went
into its fatal plunge. But Barry Schiff, a TWA pilot for 34 years
who instructed trainees on the Boeing 767 and now serves as an
aviation safety consultant, said the flight and radar data alone
make it clear someone forced the aircraft down on October 31 last
year off Massachusetts State's island of Nantucket, killing all
217 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has been
involved from the start and has uncovered no evidence of terrorism
or conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, EgyptAir Chairman Mohamed Fahim Rayan said in Cairo
that the plane's nearly sonic-speed descent was the result of "
something happening" in the tail apparatus.
</P>
<P>
Walid Morad, chairman of the Egyptian Airline Pilots
Association, said he would not reach any conclusions until U.S.
investigators, aided by Egyptian experts, issue a final report.

<HEADLINE> Study: Economic Prosperity Has Not Cut U.S. Hunger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy is booming
and unemployment is at a 30-year low, but the number of hungry
Americans has not decreased over the past four years, a study
released Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in modern history, the prevalence of
hunger seems stubbornly impervious to economic growth," Larry
Brown, director of the Center on Hunger and Poverty at Tufts
University, was quoted by the Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
"At the peak of the longest economic boom in our history, over
30 million people live in households that experience hunger and
food insecurity -- about the same number as four years ago," Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
He said changes in the structure of the work force and welfare
programs are partly to blame. Some 20 percent to 30 percent of
workers earn little enough that "they're making choices between
rent and medical bills and adequate diet."
</P>
<P>
Minimum wages have not kept up with inflation, Brown said, and
many jobs no longer include paid benefits.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, changes in welfare and food stamp benefits
have resulted in roughly 8.5 million fewer Americans receiving
food stamps over the past few years, while the number of people
living in poverty has declined by just 2 million, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
Children are disproportionately burdened by hunger, the study
showed: 7.2 percent of all households are food insecure; 15.2
percent of households with children are hungry; and 16.3 percent
of households with children under six years old don't have enough
to eat.
</P>
<P>
To alleviate hunger, Brown advocates easing restrictions on
access to food stamps and expanding school breakfast programs.
Longer term, Brown said, lawmakers should index the minimum wage
to inflation and expand the earned-income tax credit.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes 31 Billion Dollars for Higher Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The centerpiece of the proposal is a 10,000 dollars tax
deduction to help millions Americans pay for tuition, books and
university fees.
</P>
<P>
When Clinton's "College Opportunity Tax Cut" is fully phased in
2003, a family earning 120,000 dollars or less annually could
receive a tax deduction of up to 10,000 dollars for tuition, fees
and job-related training. Alternatively, taxpayers could seek a
maximum credit of 2,800 dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Skeptics question whether the policy proposals Clinton has made
before his State of the Union address on January 27 can pass the
Republican-controlled Congress. But White House officials, seeking
to address those concerns, insisted voters want action on
education.
</P>
<P>
The president's proposal included 35 million dollars for the
college Completion Challenge grants, designed to spur college
dropouts to return to class; 40 million dollars for a new
initiative to help minorities pursue five-year dual-degree
programs; and 716 million dollars for Pell grants.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will also seek a combined 400 million dollars rise for
initiatives such as the Gear Up program, which helps disadvantaged
youths stay in the high school.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Exports Over $6 Billion Dollars to Canada in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Mexico exported from
January to November of 1999 to Canada commodities worth 6.092
billion dollars, and the two nations balance of trade registered a
5.178 billion dollar accumulated deficit in Mexico's favor, the
Canadian Statistics said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mexican exports to Canada in the first 11 months of 1999
increased more than 22 percent, compared to the same period of
1998, when they were 4.956 billion dollars, according to the
Statistics report received in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
The institution underscored that the volume of bilateral
merchandise exchanges during that period reached the historical
level of 7.006 billion dollars, to surpass the previous record of
6.426 billion dollars reached in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report says that Canadian exports to Mexico amounted to 914
million dollars from January to November of 1999, while in the
same period of 1998 they amounted to 888 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Both countries agreed that the North America Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) signed by Canada, the United States, and Mexico
in 1994 has permitted these countries to increase by more than 110
percent their trade exchanges and it is expected to improve in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Statistics document underscores that due to the
NAFTA, Mexico has become the third Canadian trade partner. Fifty
percent of the sales of this country to Canada are automotive
industry products, while another 29 percent goes to the machinery
and equipment manufacturing sector.

<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell in the third consecutive
trading to finish down 138.06 at 11,351.30. The index lost 371.68
points in the past three days.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index fell 10.33 at 1,445.57 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index rose 38.22 at 4,189.51, topping the record closing
high of 4,151.29 points set Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index fell as Alcoa announced that it will restart
primary aluminum production to meet growing global demand, causing
aluminum prices to drop. Procter &AMP; Gamble also led the index to
lower.
</P>
<P>
But strong earnings reports from technology companies pushed
the Nasdaq index higher. Apple Computer and International Business
Machine reported separately that they beat Wall Street profit
forecasts. Apple earned 183 million U.S. dollars or 1.03 dollars
per share in the final quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index was also helped to move higher as stock prices
of America Online bounced back from tumbling since the company
announced the acquisition of Time Warner for 165 billion dollars
on January 10. AOL reported today that it earned 9 cents per share
in the fourth quarter, compared with 8 cents in expectations.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 4.86 at 640.51. But the American Stock

<HEADLINE> Clinton Discloses Emotional Fallout of Sex Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
for the first time, disclosed his emotional fallout of the
impeachment scandal, saying that he has sought a "spiritual anchor
" and to forgive those he feels had wronged him.
</P>
<P>
Clinton shared his feelings with others in an interview with
the Christian Science Monitor, which was conducted on Tuesday in
Boston but released by the White House on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton, who was sworn in exactly seven years ago,
ushered in his last year in office Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"What I have gained more than anything else is a certain
humility in recognizing how important forgiveness is, but how it
doesn't count and it can't count unless you can give it as well as
ask for it," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his own "spiritual growth" over the last 18 months,
Clinton said he had sought spiritual counseling following the
revelations about his relationship with former intern Monica
Lewinksy and the ensuing impeachment fight.
</P>
<P>
He said one of his personal challenges has been abandoning
resentment over the investigation into the matter.
</P>
<P>
"The thing that I have really had to work on is trying to gain
some spiritual anchor that will enable me to give up resentments
and disappointment and anger," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was impeached by the House, but won acquittal from the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he had sought advice from former South African
President Nelson Mandela about how Mandela had learned to forgive
those who had jailed him under his country's system of Apartheid.
</P>
<P>
"I've really tried to deal with this in a very serious way and
I think I've learned quite a lot about myself in the process,"
Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Backs Plan of Colombia against Drug Traffic: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
government plan to combat drug traffic and to promote development
and peace has the support of the U.S. Congress, said visiting U.S.
Army Secretary Louis Caldera on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Caldera, who arrived in this country Wednesday for a three-day
visit, said that U.S. congressmen see the project as "an
efficacious tool to fight drug traffic and advance in the
protection of human rights," adding that more efforts are
necessary to protect human rights.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Army Secretary met with Colombian President Andres
Pastrana, with whom he discussed the peace process between the
Colombian government and the rebel groups and the 1.6 billion
dollar assistance asked to the Congress last week by the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
The military official referred concretely to the Plan Colombia,
a program devised by Pastrana for the next four years, that
demands investments for 7.5 billion dollars, which the country is
requesting from the United States, the European Union member
nations and Japan.
</P>
<P>
"This plan is much more than a program to combat drug traffic,
since it has more strategies and goes farther than the simple
combat to drug traffickers. It also foresees economic development
and programs of assistance to displaced persons."
</P>
<P>
Caldera joined a group of U.S. congressmen that is visiting
Colombia, led by Republican Representative Cass Ballenger, a
member of the House International Relations Committee and vice-
president of the House Western Hemisphere Affairs subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
The Army secretary also visited the seat of the Colombian Army
first antidrug battalion in the Caqueta jungle, created last year
with the counsel of the United States, and also met with Defense
Minister Luis Fernando Ramirez and Foreign Minister Guillermo
Fernandez de Soto.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Pay U.N. Back Dues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Denouncing Helms' viewpoint on the United Nations, they said
that the U.N. role is irreplaceable and the prompt U.S. due
payment can lay the sound basis for an effective United Nations.
</P>
<P>
China, Canada, France, Russia, Malaysia and Namibia made the
strong statement after Jesse Helms, chairman of the U.S. Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, justified in a speech to the 15-
member Council the connection of the U.S. due payment and its
stance on U.N. reforms.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, the Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, said, "Like many other U.N. Member States, we are deeply
concerned at and worried about the fact that the United Nations
has been long haunted by financial crisis."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. reluctance to pay its back dues has plunged the 188-
member world body into a serious financial crisis, gravely
stunting the U.N. role in peacekeeping operations and development
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Helms' justification also drew sharp responses from the closest
allies of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Greenstock, the British permanent representative to the
United Nations, said that the United Nations needs to be reformed,
but the U.S. arrears have blocked the reform process.
</P>
<P>
Alain Dejammet, the French ambassador to the United Nations,
told Helms that "We did hear you. But the idea in this house is
that others must be heard as well."
</P>
<P>
Dejammet, denouncing the U.S. delinquency in paying dues, said
that the U.S. stance on dues has prevented the United Nations from
making progress in such fields as peacekeeping operations and
urged the U.S. should pay the dues like other Member States.
</P>
<P>
Robert Fowler, the Canadian permanent representative to the
United Nations, said that the slowness of U.S. payments has "
seriously impaired our cooperative efforts to protect and promote
international peace and security."
</P>
<P>
Peter van Walsum, the permanent representative of the
Netherlands to the United Nations, said that the United Nations
makes a "supreme effort to accommodate the United States," under
the U.N. Charter Washington can not attach conditions on its
payments.
</P>
<P>
In late 1999, U.S. Congress voted to pay 926 million U.S.
dollars in U.N. arrears, saving its face by avoiding the lose of
its vote in the General Assembly this year.
