<HEADLINE> World Cycling Union defends decision to reduce doping bans f </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Cycling
Union vowed to continue the fight against doping in the sport
after softening penalties against three riders who admitted
taking banned substances.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Maastricht, the Netherlands, the
president of the Union Hein Verbruggen said: "For these riders,
90 percent of the season is the Tour de France."
</P>
<P>
The Union cut a month off eight-month bans handed to the
riders by the Swiss cycling federation.
</P>
<P>
The cyclists, Alex Zuelle, Laurent Dufaux and Armin Meier, all
members of the Festina Team that was ejected from the Tour
because of its systematic doping policy, will now be back in
action May 1, 1999 _ in time to prepare for next year's Tour.
</P>
<P>
At the UCI's first international congress since doping
scandals rocked the 1998 Tour de France, Verbruggen told
delegates cycling was still hurting.
</P>
<P>
"No doubt a sport like ours which depends so much on
sponsoring money must feel the negative ramifications from what
happened," he was quoted as saying. "I know that _ we all know
that _ and we have to fight to make things better."
</P>
<P>
The UCI stepped up the battle by forming an anti-doping work
group, funded by national federations, cycling teams and riders.
</P>
<P>
The group, which includes representatives of the UCI, riders
and professional teams, will consider ways of fighting the
acknowledged widespread drug abuse among cyclists.

<HEADLINE> Russia Against Use of Force in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia opposes any use of force
in the Kosovo crisis, especially without U.N. Security Council
approval, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Unless urgent steps are taken to remedy the situation in
Kosovo, NATO may go ahead with its plans to use force against
Yugoslavia," said ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
and First Deputy Foreign Intelligence Service Director Alexei
Scherbakov, who visited Yugoslavia on Sunday, gave a message from
President Boris Yeltsin to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
which warned that NATO may use force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that NATO strikes would be avoided only if
the Yugoslavian army and security units were withdrawn to
barracks, urgent steps taken to resolve the humanitarian crisis
and allow the refugees to return their homes, and impetus given to
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
These steps, vigorously supported by the United Nations and
other international organizations, would lead to a political
solution to the Kosovo crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted that these demands also apply to the
political leaders of Kosovo ethnic Albanians, who must take steps
to end terrorist activities and unambiguously dissociate
themselves from separatist plans.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic expressed thanks to Yeltsin for his efforts in
resolving the crisis and said that Belgrade would do its best to
implement the understandings reached between Milosevic and Yeltsin
on June 16, 1998, and the U.N. provisions.

<HEADLINE> Greece Opposes NATO's Military Intervention in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Greece once again expressed on
Monday its opposition to a possible military intervention by NATO
in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that Greece had serious reservations about
any military action which NATO might conduct in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
While expressing the hope that the consultations currently
under way would yield positive results, he stressed that the
Kosovo crisis must be resolved politically through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He added that there must be no more bloodshed in the Balkan
region.
</P>
<P>
Greece has repeatedly made it clear that it opposes Kosovo's
independence from Yugoslavia but a broad autonomy should be given
to Kosovo where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of its nearly
2 million population and have been demanding independence from
Belgrade.

<P>
BEIRUT, October 5 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was killed and
four others wounded on Monday in a roadside bomb explosion in
south Lebanon, Lebanon's Voice of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was detonated when an Israeli convoy passed by the
Hasbiyeh village in the eastern sector of the Israeli-occupied
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The wounded have been taken to a nearby hospital for treatment,
the radio said.
</P>
<P>
No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen Israeli soldiers have been killed and 86 others wounded
in roadside bomb blasts in south Lebanon so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a so-called security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 to allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border
attacks by Lebanese Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's resistance militants have been fighting to drive the
1,500 Israeli occupation forces out of Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> China Stands for Dialogue on Human Rights, Qin Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Qin made the statement after he signed the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on behalf of the Chinese
Government.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has concluded dialogue and exchanges
with some countries in the field of human rights, he said, adding
that practice has proved that this is very useful for the
enhancement fo mutual understanding and enlargement of common
ground.
</P>
<P>
"As a Member State of the United Nations, China has always
actively participated in the activities of the organization in the
field of human rights," he said, "It attaches importance to its
cooperation with agencies concerned in the U.N. system."
</P>
<P>
"Not long ago, Ms. (Mary) Robinson, the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights had just paid a successful visit to
China," he said, "Her visit has helped both sides understand each
other better."
</P>
<P>
China values the role of international human rights instruments
in promoting and protecting human rights, he said, adding that his
country has acceded to 17 international human rights covenants.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, the Chinese Government signed the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. At
present, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
of China, the Chinese parliament, is deliberating on the
ratification of the Covenant, he said.
</P>
<P>
"All these have demonstrated the firm resolve of China to
promote and protect human rights," he said, "They are also China's
concrete deeds to honor the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and the 5th anniversary of the Vienna
Declaration of Programme of Action."
</P>
<P>
"I would like to reaffirm here the willingness of the Chinese
Government to further its cooperation with U.N. in the field of
human rights in an effort to push forward together the
development of the international cause of human rights," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Covenant was adopted by the General Assembly and opened
for signature in 1996. Together with the International Covenant
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both Covenants entered
into force in 1976.

<HEADLINE> EU Appeals for Bi-Communal Cypriot Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union said on
Monday that its objective to grant Cyprus a full membership
remains a bi-communal, bi-zonal federation on the island state.
</P>
<P>
The European Union foreign ministers, meeting in their general
affairs council, regretted the fact that it had not been possible
to find a political solution to the continuing division of Cyprus
in time for the accession negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The analytical examination by the European Commission could not
cover Cyprus as a whole and the invitation of the Cyprus
government to include representatives of the Turkish Cypriot
community in the accession negotiations had so far not been taken
up.
</P>
<P>
The European Union believed, said Greek Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos, that Cyprus' accession to the union should
benefit all communities and help to bring about civil peace and
reconciliation on the island.
</P>
<P>
A political settlement in accordance with United Nations
resolutions would allow the provisions of the accession treaty to
be implemented throughout the island, and progress toward
accession and toward a just and viable solution to the Cyprus
problem will naturally reinforce each other, he added.
</P>
<P>
The European Union pledged its full support for the search of a
solution for Cyprus under the aegis of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, the European Union invited Cyprus as
well as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia
to start accession talks.
</P>
<P>
The move angered Turkey, a long-time applicant for EU
membership.
</P>
<P>
Turkey thereafter refused an invitation to attend the inaugural
pan-European Conference held this March in London and may still be
absent from Tuesday's second pan-European Conference at foreign
minister level in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers agreed on Monday that starting from
November 10, the accession negotiations will be upgraded to
ministerial level with real substances.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the 11 sets of accession requirements will be
discussed in detail in the November negotiations, according to
Monday's foreign minister council.
</P>
<P>
The Greek foreign minister, however, did not completely rule
out the possibility of granting membership to
partilly-represented Cyprus.

UNITED NATIONS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese diplomat

Tension between Turkey and Syria has reportedly worsened

Greece, which has bad ties with Turkey for decades, also

<HEADLINE> Angola FM: Togo, Burkina Faso's Aid to UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has
warned that it would not tolerate Togo and Burkina Faso's support
to Angola's opposition movement the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Joao Miranda, Deputy Foreign Minister, said at the 53rd
General Assembly of the United Nations Sunday that the fact Togo
and Burkina Faso offer their land for military training of UNITA
men is running against the spirit of the U.N. Charter and the
resolutions of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"We would warn countries like Togo and Burkina Faso that the
Angolan government would no longer tolerate their support to
UNITA military force under Jonas Savimbi," the Angolan News
Agency Angog Monday quoted Miranda as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Angolan government has recognized the UNITA
Renovation Committee, a splinter group, because it is devoted to
reforming UNITA into a civilian party and willing to carry out
the tasks mapped out by the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
He urged that the whole world should recognize the UNITA
Renovation Committee as the sole representative of UNITA, just
like what the Southern African Development Community (SADC) has
done.
</P>
<P>
It is a cautious and realistic way for the Angolan government
to keep Savimbi, a "war criminal" as termed by the SADC, away
from another chance in the countriy's peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government changed its attitude since September as
UNITA refused to disarm all its men, refused to hand over the
main areas under its control to state administration and began to
attack state-owned areas including cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
It it under this situation that the government severed ties
with Savimbi and took on the UNITA Renovation Committee as the
legal negotiator in future peace talks, in a bid to break the
delok in the peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said here Monday Britain was ready to use force in a possible
NATO intervention in Kosovo, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a special meeting of the British defense
committee early Monday, Cook told reporters that the Yugoslav
government had to obey a U.N. Security Council resolution
demanding the cease of all violence in Kosovo, where some 30
ethnic Albanians have been killed over the past week.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to use force but if force is the only measure
(Yugoslav) President Milosevic is going to listen to, Britain is
ready to back force," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Cook noted that Britain has confirmed that "we are united in
our resolve that President (Slobodan) Milosevic must be compelled
to change his behavior in Kosovo and to abide by the terms of the
Security Council resolution."
</P>
<P>
"Britain will now be using this week to build the same unity
and resolve among the wider international community. Milosevic has
only a few days this week to listen to what the international
community is saying to him," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Early Sunday, British Defense Secretary George Robertson
dropped a a hint that NATO may send troops to Kosovo to enforce a
possible ceasefire.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- China signed here on
Monday on the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights. Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, signed the Covenant on behalf of the Chinese Government.
</P>
<P>
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was
adopted by the General Assembly and opened for signature in 1966,
together with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights, both of which entered into force in 1976.
</P>
<P>
The Covenant begins by stating that all peoples have the right
of self-determination. It recognized that everyone has the right
to life, liberty and security of person.
</P>
<P>
It prohibits torture, cruel or degrading treatment or
punishment, and the arbitrary deprivation of life. Anyone arrested
is to be informed of the reasons for the arrest, and anyone
arrested or detained on a criminal charge is to be brought
promptly before a judge or other legally authorized person.
</P>
<P>
The Covenant also provides, among other things, for freedom
of movement, and places limitations upon the expulsion of aliens
present lawfully in the territory of a State party.
</P>
<P>
State parties are required to submit an initial report within
one year of ratifying the Covenant, and periodic reports every
five years thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Before China, 140 States have ratified or acceded to the
Covenant.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Leader Calls for Enhanced Family Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi called Monday, at the opening ceremony of an international
conference of women lawyer here, for efforts to enhance role of
families in African societies in the next century.
</P>
<P>
The 29th bi-annual Convention of the International Federation
of Women Lawyers (FIDA) brings together female jurists, judges
and academics from 70 countries to deliberate and exchange views
on various issues affecting women, including family laws.
</P>
<P>
"There is need for all of us to strengthen our traditional
values and preserve the important role of the family unit of
creating a cohesive society," Moi stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, modern technological developments and exposure
to foreign influences have exposed this important social unit to
severe social test," he sighed.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of a monetary economy has made people
increasingly individualistic -- it is women and children who have
suffered most from these development," said Moi.
</P>
<P>
"The promotion of women's education is crucial toward
enhancing their social economic status as well as that of their
families and the nation," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said his government has invested a considerable amount of
its resources in promoting education nationwide, resulting in the
increase of the percentage enrollment of girls at the primary
school level from 34 percent to 49.3 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
"The (Kenyan) government is determined to put in place
mechanisms to ensure equal access to education opportunities and
to eliminate gender disparities in the provision of education,"
he told women lawyers at the conference.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will go on under the theme of "the Woman of the
21st Century until Thursday in the Kenyan capital.
</P>
<P>
FIDA, founded in Mexico in 1944, is a non-governmental
organization aimed at promoting and defending the rights of women
and children in their legal and social context. The last FIDA
convention was held in Hong Kong in 1996.

<HEADLINE> China Stands for Dialogue on Human Rights, Qin Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Qin made the statement after he signed the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on behalf of the Chinese
Government.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has concluded dialogue and exchanges
with some countries in the field of human rights, he said, adding
that practice has proved that this is very useful for the
enhancement fo mutual understanding and enlargement of common
ground.
</P>
<P>
"As a Member State of the United Nations, China has always
actively participated in the activities of the organization in the
field of human rights," he said, "It attaches importance to its
cooperation with agencies concerned in the U.N. system."
</P>
<P>
"Not long ago, Ms. (Mary) Robinson, the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights had just paid a successful visit to
China," he said, "Her visit has helped both sides understand each
other better."
</P>
<P>
China values the role of international human rights instruments
in promoting and protecting human rights, he said, adding that his
country has acceded to 17 international human rights covenants.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, the Chinese Government signed the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. At
present, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
of China, the Chinese parliament, is deliberating on the
ratification of the Covenant, he said.
</P>
<P>
"All these have demonstrated the firm resolve of China to
promote and protect human rights," he said, "They are also China's
concrete deeds to honor the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and the 5th anniversary of the Vienna
Declaration of Programme of Action."
</P>
<P>
"I would like to reaffirm here the willingness of the Chinese
Government to further its cooperation with U.N. in the field of
human rights in an effort to push forward together the
development of the international cause of human rights," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Covenant was adopted by the General Assembly and opened
for signature in 1966. Together with the International Covenant
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both Covenants entered
into force in 1976.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Urges Syria, Turkey to Ease Tensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia on Monday urged
Syria and Turkey to resolve their disputes through diplomatic
means in a bid to avert a possible armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh hopes that Turkey "as a friendly Islamic country will
continue the dialogue with Syria to resolve the disputes with
peaceful means," Saudi Information Undersecretary Madani Alaki
told reporters after a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Saudi Arabia views Syria and Turkey as two neighboring states
bound with substantial interests," Alaki said, quoted by the Saudi
Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
Tensions are mounting between Syria and Turkey after they
traded accusations against each other, and Turkey has reportedly
massed troops along its border with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors have long been at odds over issues including
Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), water sharing and
the Turkish-Israeli military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Syria of harboring the PKK, which has been
fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish state in the
southeast of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Syria has lashed out at Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country,
for forming a military alliance with Israel, which it says is
targeted against the Arab world, especially itself, and undermines
its bargaining position in negotiations with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Syria has disputes with Israel over the future of the Golan
Heights, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War. Damascus
insisted on its return as a condition for peace with the Jewish
state.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak's Visit to Ankara Aims at Containing Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- President Hosni Mubarak's visit
Tuesday to Turkey envisions containing the current crisis and
building a dialog system between Ankara and Damascus, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on the eve of Mubarak's high-profile
visit to Turkey, Moussa said the Syrian-Turkish question is
complicated but it is not impossible to solve through diplomacy
instead of military escalation.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt looks to Syria as a sisterly Arab country and to Turkey
as a friendly Islamic country," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
"Talks between President Mubarak and his Turkish counterpart
Suleyman Demirel will focus just on the Syrian-Turkish crisis. We
hope that Egypt's good offices would succeed in defusing the
crisis," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa declined to reveal details about the proposals Mubarak
will be carrying to Ankara. He pointed out, however, that the
recent Syrian statement calls for dialog with Turkey to solve the
pending problems between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who held talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
during a whirlwind trip to Damascus Sunday aimed at heading off a
military confrontation, has called on both sides to restrain from
any provocative actions.
</P>
<P>
"President Mubarak will go to Turkey as representative of the
Arab side and chairman of the Arab summit that calls for peace in
the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Egypt is intervening to partially solve the problem or
take it by the root, Moussa chose the second option and added that
Egypt is seeking to establish a positive relationship between the
two neighbor countries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is endeavoring to set up a "mechanism for dialogue"
between Ankara and Damascus, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Strained ties between Syria and Turkey deteriorated in recent
weeks. Turkey accused Syria of aiding Kurdish rebels fighting for
autonomy in southeast Turkey, while Syria bridled at Turkey's
growing military links with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Turkey said on Saturday that it plans a military exercise along
the Syrian border after the end of the current exercises of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the area.
</P>
<P>
It also announced fresh naval maneuvers in the eastern
Mediterranean and joint air exercises, which Syria says are
directed against itself.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Says No Concession over Missile Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Defense Minister
Yiannakis Omirou said on Monday that Cyprus will go ahead with the
plan to deploy Russian-made anti-aircraft missiles and not make
any concessions over the issue.
</P>
<P>
"No concessions will be made regarding the Cyprus Republic's
sovereign right to proceed with the necessary armaments to boost
its defense," Omirou said on the sidelines of a meeting in Athens
on cooperation with Greece in the arms industry, the Cyprus News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on reports that the deployment of the
missiles would be delayed for a second time until the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot official blamed the reports for creating "a danger
of diverting the attention of the world public opinion from the
Cyprus problem, which needs to be solved in accordance with
international law."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus ordered the S-300 missiles last year in a bid to boost
its air defense. The move was opposed by Turkish Cypriots and
Turkey, which has threatened to take pre-emptive measures if they
are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Under pressures from the United States and Britain, which were
also against the missile plan, Cypriot government has decided to
postpone the delivery of the missiles from August till November.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey maintains more than 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus to
allegedly protect the Turkish Cypriot minority, who declared
unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway state recognized only by Ankara.

<P>
MOSCOW, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on Monday evening had a telephone conversation with German
chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder on situation in Kosovo,
according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told Schroeder that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic had accepted his proposals, including to invite an
mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) to Kosovo, that the Yugoslav parliament and government had
decided to invite a OSCE mission to the warring region.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder appreciated Yeltsin's efforts to ensure a negotiated
settlement in Kosovo and expressed hope that they will yield
positive results.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders were satisfied with the establishment of regular
contacts even before a new German government has been formed, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president afterward had a long and substantive
conversation with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to discuss the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Annan favored Russia's efforts to resolve the crisis which are
consonant with the U.N. stance and hoped that they will help
stabilize the situation in Kosovo by political means, the Russian

</P>
<P>
Annan stressed the need for Belgrade to take concrete measures
to stop violence, create conditions for the return of refugees and
promote cooperation with international humanitarian organizations.

<P>
On Monday evening, Yeltsin also discussed Kosovo situation with
U.S. President Bill Clinton by a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
According to the press service, Clinton spoke favorably of
Russia's efforts and voiced hope that the Yugoslav leadership,
being aware of the whole seriousness of the situation, will adopt

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM for Riyadh over Syria-Turkey Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri Monday night left here for Riyadh to discuss with Saudi
leaders the mounting tensions between Syrian and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Orient Radio here said reported that during his two-day
stay, Hariri will hold talks with Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz
and senior officials on the issue and other regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Harir said in an interview with Lebanese
daily An Nahar that Lebanon stands by Syria, especially in its
calls for resolving disputes with Turkey through peaceful dialog.
</P>
<P>
"We are worried by the Turkish threats and military buildup
and hope that (Egyptian) President (Hosni) Mubarak's endeavor
would defuse the current combustion," he added.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to ease tension that many fear could spill over
to the entire region, Mubarak made a trouble-shooting mission
which has taken him to Saudi Arabia and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The often tense relations between Turkey and Syria have
deteriorated in recent weeks as they traded accusations. Turkey
alleged that Syria harbors its Kurdish rebels, which Damascus
denied.
</P>
<P>
Syria was worried about Turkey's growing military alliance with
Israel that threats Arab security, and its building of a string of
dams on the Euphrates River, which could reduce Syria's already
short supply of water.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Turkey has massed some 10,000 troops along the
Syrian border, and threatened to resort to military means if
Damascus continued to aid the Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said that Turkey's threats are the products of the
newly-concluded Turkish-Israeli strategic pact. Turkish Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz has recently concluded an official visit to
Israel in which the two countries agreed to expand military
cooperation, including holding a joint military maneuver.
</P>
<P>
The move was described by Arab countries, especially Syria, as
the formal launch of a military alliance between Israel and Turkey
aimed at encircling them.

<P>
BUCHAREST, October 5 (Xinhua) -- As many as 59 percent of Gypsy
women living in Romania and 44 percent of their male counterparts
are illiterate, a specialist study commissioned by the Romanian
Ministry of Education showed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Only a meagre 4.5 percent of the whole community are high
school graduates. Of the total number of 7-to-10-year-olds, only
half of them are regular school goers. 40 percent of the under-8s
do not attend either kindergarten or school and 7 percent of them
do not have birth certificates, the study said.
</P>
<P>
Romania is currently the most heavily-Gypsy inhabited European
country, and the Gypsy community here, also known as Rroma, is the
youngest and most boosting in terms of births. Members of the
community are commonly seen as inadaptable, self-exclusive and
hard to integrate with the wider community.
</P>
<P>
Official figures at the last 1992 population census in Romania
put the Gypsy community at 409,723, that is 1.8 percent of the

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific PC Market Down Slightly in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, October 5 (Xinhua) -- China and Australia have
become increasingly important to the growth of the Asia-Pacific
region as PC vendors struggle to remain buoyant in this part of
the world, a U.S. market analysis firm said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries contributed 37 percent and 25 percent
respectiively of the total PC shipments in the region in the
second quarter this year, according to the California-based
Dataquest. Shipments in China came to almost 810,000 units between
April and June, up 48 percent from the quarter a year ago, while
Australia's shipments totaled 549,000 units.
</P>
<P>
As a whole, Dataquest said in a report, the region's PC
shipments in the second quarter of 1998 declined 0.2 percent from
the quarter a year ago. Overall shipments in the 10 major markets
in the region totaled 2.2 million units.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and Malaysia posted the
largest declines in the quarter. However, there were some positive
signs in Thailand, as the quarter revealed the first
quarter-to-quarter growth in shipments at about two percent since
the economic crisis began.
</P>
<P>
The industry in Hong Kong has slowed down, with a growth of
less than one percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Singapore and Taiwan are the latest casualties in the Asian
crisis, Dataquest said. In Singapore, the industry posted its
first negative year-to-year results, with a decline of 18 percent
in unit shipments. PC shipments in Taiwan registered a decline of
three percent.
</P>
<P>
India posted a year-to-year growth of 25 percent, with a
shipment of 133,000 units in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
"The performance of the second half of the year will be
dependent on the success of the reforms of the government to
stabilize the market," said the Dataquest report, referring to the
Asia-Pacific region's PC market.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Teachers Start Strike, Clash with Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of teachers
in support of the teachers.
Some 500 students blocked a main road 30 kilometers west of
Nairobi with fires, stoning passing motorists and the police. The
latter responded with tear-gas and rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
In Migori District, southwestern Kenya, scores of teachers
were injured and one policeman was badly beaten in violent
clashes, Kenya News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The strike by teachers at public schools also affected the
operation of private schools. Sources told Xinhua that more than
half of the pupils were absent at Nairobi's private schools which
had canceled all scheduled extra curricula due to the strike.
</P>
<P>
Striking teachers demonstrated outside private schools,
causing disturbances among the pupils there. Local analysts
predicted that the situation will be tenser in the coming couple
of days.
</P>
<P>
In the Braeburn Primary School, one of the leading private
schools in Nairobi, the teachers have asked parents to take their
children in and out of school themselves instead of using school
commuters.
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Joseph Ngutu charged in a statement Monday that
the striking teachers were in breach of a no-strike agreement,
warning that they "must take full responsibility for their
actions."

possible," Sheng told the General Assembly which was debating on
the annual report of Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the work of
the U.N..
</P>
<P>
He said the world body continued to play an active role in
maintaining world peace and security during the past year.
</P>
<P>
The organization has paid much attention to exploring and
wiping out the root cause of the conflicts, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council held two meetings at the level of foreign
ministers on the causes of the conflicts and the promotion of
lasting peace and sustainable development in Africa, he added.
</P>
<P>
Shen suggested that the U.N. work even harder to solve the
problems facing developing countries, especially in the fields of
boosting investment and growth, dealing with the challenges of
globalization, making necessary readjustment and avoiding the
breakout of economic and social crisis.

MAPUTO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- A Boeing 747 passenger plane
belonging to Air Mozambique managed an emergent landing Monday
with no injuries after one of its four engines exploded in
mid-air.
</P>
<P>
It is said that a total of 97 passengers were on the plane

<HEADLINE> Annan: I Have No Means to Verify Yugoslav Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday blamed Yugoslav forces for most of the
atrocities in the Serb province of Kosovo and said that he didn't
have the means to verify whether Belgrade had complied with the
Security Council demanding an end to hostilities.
</P>
<P>
In a written report to the 15-member Security Council, Annan,
who decried the "appalling atrocities in Kosovo," said that the
Kosovar Albanians have also engaged in armed action.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear beyond any reasonable doubt that the great
majority of such acts have been committed by security forces in
Kosovo acting under the authority of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (FRY)," he said, "But Kosovar Albanian paramilitary
units have engaged in armed action also, and there is good reason
to believe that they too have committed atrocities."
</P>
<P>
Annan said that, unlike situation where the United Nations had
a presence on the ground, he did not "have the means necessary to
provide an independent assessment of compliance" with the Security
Council resolution by the FRY.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the Council may wish to make its own judgement in
this respect on the basis of the present report," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted on September 23, the Security Council
demanded a ceasefire, the withdrawal of special forces from
Kosovo and a negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
In his widely anticipated report, the U.N. chief said that in
the week following the September 23 resolution, the Yugoslav
government forces "intensified their operations, launching another
offensive in the Drenica region" and other areas.
</P>
<P>
As a result, another 20,000 people were displaced, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for a thorough investigation, under
effective international control or with international
participation, of all reported cases of atrocities and
violations of human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
Serbia is the larger of the two republics comprising the FRY.
Ethnic Albanians, who form a majority of Kosovo's population of
2 million, have been battling Serbs for independence.
</P>
<P>
Annan's report came as NATO forces prepared for possible
military intervention in Kosovo, which has been seen as an
internal affair by Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
He said that conditions must be created to allow the return of
a significant number of displaced persons, including a "radical
change of policy and behavior and the introduction of
confidence-building measures -- such as withdrawal of police
units, a declaration of amnesty of and a release of
prisoners."

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Parties Agree to Consider SADC Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Rival Lesotho political
parties Monday agreed to consider a Southern African Development
Community (SADC) proposal for setting up a transitional structure
to ensure free and fair elections in the mountain kingdom.
</P>
<P>
"We will take it to the people... and if they say yes to it,
we will also say yes," South African Press Association (SAPA)
quoted opposition alliance spokesman Vincent Malebo as saying in
Maseru.
</P>
<P>
He said if they did not get a mandate from their supporters,
they would resort to other ways of overcoming the political
impasse.
</P>
<P>
Deputy chief of the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy
(LCD), Kelebone Maope, said his party did not in principle have
problems with the proposal.
</P>
<P>
He said he was pleased that his party would continue to rule
until the election takes place in 15 to 18 months time.
</P>
<P>
SADC presented the proposal to the Lesotho government and
opposition parties at Monday's talks after the two sides
disagreed on who should govern the country before fresh elections
in 15 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
The government said it was legitimately elected and should
remain in power, while opposition parties insisted a government
of national unity should be formed.
</P>
<P>
The SADC proposal suggested that while the present government
would continue to rule the country, the structure should prepare
the nation for the elections.
</P>
<P>
The structure would consist of one or two members from each of
the political parties, announced South African safety and
security minister, Sydney Mufamadi, who chaired Monday's meeting
of the Lesotho government and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The structure would ensure equitable treatment of all
political parties by state-owned broadcasting and information
services in the period leading up to the elections.
</P>
<P>
It would have the power to access all information held by
government relevant to the elections and the power to adopt and
enforce a code of conduct for all political parties.
</P>
<P>
It would take decisions on all electoral matters including the
role of the police, military services, intelligence services,
foreign affairs, media and publications, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The structure would also appoint a new independent electoral
commission to review Lesotho's electoral system, with a view to
empowering to perform its functions.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on fresh elections was reached by government and
opposition parties on Friday after an military intervention of
the political crisis resulted in bloody conflict between mutinous
Lesotho soldiers and South African and Botswanan troops.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties claim that the May 23 general election was
rigged in favor of the LCD, which won 79 of 80 seats in the
National Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Negasso vows to Do Everything to Safeguard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- President Negasso Gidada
said Monday that his Government is committed to preserving the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ethiopia and will do
everything to safeguard the nation's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the first joint meeting of the 4th year working
term of the House of People's Representatives and the House of
Federation, Negasso said the main task facing the government is
the liberation of territory occupied by neighboring Eritrea -- by
force if peace efforts failed.
</P>
<P>
"The Government of Ethiopia still views war as a last resort
to settle interstate disputes and is committed to exhausting all
possible avenues of peace,'' he stated, adding that however, "the
chance for a peaceful resolution of the conflict is dimming by
the day because of the intransigence of the Eritrean regime."
</P>
<P>
The President told the two houses that "we will not allow
anything to sidetrack us from our chosen path of development and
social transformation."
</P>
<P>
speaking about the economy, he said the country will make
headways in the implementation of all socio-economic development
projects.
</P>
<P>
"We have managed to attain self-sufficiency in food production
and there is a good prospect to ensure food security at the
household level," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He further said the other challenges for Ethiopia during the
current year would be to exert efforts to improve the quality and
quantity of the country's cash crops, such as coffee, and to
boost foreign exchange earnings.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Debating Impeachment Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 5 (Xinhua) - The U.S. House of
Representatives Judiciary Committee Monday opened a debate on
whether to launch a formal impeachment inquiry against President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The committee, where Republicans have a 21-16 majority, was
expected to vote later in the day or on Tuesday to conduct an
open-ended, unrestricted investigation of the president and his
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
"We are not here today to decide whether or not to impeach Mr.
Clinton. We are not here to pass judgment on anyone," committee
chairman Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican, said in opening the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to ask and answer this one single question --
based on what we now know -- do we have a duty to look further or
to look away?" Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
Chief Republican investigator David Schippers told the
committee he believed Clinton had committed 15 potentially
impeachable acts, four more than independent counsel Kenneth Starr
had alleged in his report to Congress last month.
</P>
<P>
He split some counts and added others involving conspiracy and
aiding the filing of a false affidavit, but dropped abuse of power
charges stemming from White House privilege claims and Clinton's
refusal to voluntarily testify.
</P>
<P>
Democratic chief investigator Abbe Lowell said Schippers was
adding charges by "subdividing" the existing facts and citing a
"laundry list of laws" Clinton might have violated.
</P>
<P>
The Judiciary Committee has a reputation as one of the most
partisan groups in Congress.
</P>
<P>
Republicans said it was their constitutional duty to pursue the
allegations forwarded to Congress by Starr, while Democrats
questioned if the charges amounted to the "high crimes and
misdemeanors" spelled out in the Constitution as a basis for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
"This is not Watergate, it is an extramarital affair," said
Representative John Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on
the committee.
</P>
<P>
Both sides warned that partisanship could destroy the process
and ruin what remains of Congress' reputation.
</P>
<P>
The Republican resolution of inquiry would not set a deadline
for ending the investigation and would allow it to move beyond the
Lewinsky matter to such issues as Whitewater, campaign finance
abuses or the White House travel office firings.
</P>
<P>
Democrats will offer an alternative resolution limiting the
probe to the Lewinsky matter and forcing it to end by Thanksgiving
on Nov. 26.
</P>
<P>
Once approved by the committee the resolution of inquiry would
have to be voted on by the full 435-member House.
</P>
<P>
Polls have shown the public continues to give Clinton high
marks as president even though they disapprove of his affair with
Lewinsky. The majority of polls have shown many Americans would
like to see an end to the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
A CBS News poll released on Monday showed that by a margin of
56 to 38 percent, respondents said the committee should not begin
an impeachment inquiry and disapproved of the way the panel was
doing its job by a 53 to 34 percent margin. The poll, which
sampled 902 adults on Saturday and Sunday, had a margin of error
of three percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Hyde acknowledged the public was getting tired but said
Congress still had to perform its constitutional duty.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Yeltsin Talk About Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday told Russian President Boris Yeltsin by phone of U.S.
concern that Yugoslavia was making "false" promises to stall
military strikes by the West.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the latest Serb troop movements in Kosovo, White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said that Clinton stressed the idea
that "we've been down this road before and that only full
compliance" would prevent allied strikes in the province.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who opposes NATO plans to use air strikes to halt the
violence in Kosovo, spoke with Clinton about the efforts of a
high-level ministerial delegation he sent to Belgrade during the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said Clinton told the Russian leader "he was concerned
that Milosevic was playing the classic game of making false
promises designed to remove international pressure.
</P>
<P>
"He made the point that we don't wish to use force but what
happens next depends upon President Milosevic," Lockhart told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke was in Belgrade Monday to
warn the Yugoslav president that air strikes were inevitable
unless U.N. demands were met.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Serb movements, State Department spokesman
James Rubin said that the United States sees clear signs that Serb
troops are pulling back in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. plans to maintain a threat of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) force against Yugoslavia until the
withdrawal is irreversible and peace talks are launched.
</P>
<P>
"But what we're looking for is that this is a comprehensive
pullback and that it's not reversible.... This can't be just a
temporary step," Rubin told reporters flying with Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Albright spoke to European allies by telephone Sunday and is
likely to visit NATO headquarters later this week as the alliance
moves towards a decision on launching air strikes to end Serb
attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In her conversation with the foreign ministers of Italy,
Britain, France, Austria and Russia, Albright argued that "it is
only the credible threat of the use of force... that will ensure a
genuine strategic change by (President Slobodan) Milosevic," Rubin
said.

LONDON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Shares across Europe continued to
fall on Monday amid disappointment at the inability of G7 finance
ministers to adopt clear policy moves at the weekend and another
slump on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
London share prices crashed in late trading as fears of a
global recession gripped the market and Wall Street shares plunged
when the U.S. stock market opened.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index of leading shares ended the day down more
than 2 percent, or 101.7 points at 4648.7. The index is now at its
lowest close since June 30 1997.
</P>
<P>
Disappointment over the lack of concrete action at the weekend
by financial officials of the G7 group of leading industrial
nations knocked investors' confidence in the markets.
</P>
<P>
Growing concerns that Japan's banking problems are worse than
first thought also contributed to the market malaise.
</P>
<P>
Even the prospect of a cut in U.K. interest rates on Thursday
failed to stem the decline in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
"International factors have again set the tone. I'm not even
sure a U.K. interest rate cut will be enough to prop up the equity
market at the moment," said one U.K. dealer.

Treasury bond yields fell to a record low, as the flight to

<HEADLINE> Turkey Softens Tone over Tension with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- As most Arab countries urged
Turkey and Syria to exercise self-restraint and solve their crisis
through diplomatic means, Turkey softened its tone on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Air Force Commander Ilhan Kilic said in the
southeastern city of Diyarbakir that Turkey is a supporter of
peace, and believes bilateral disputes can be solved through
crisis management.
</P>
<P>
"If the problem is not solved through diplomacy, other methods
will follow, but the nation does not want war," he said.
</P>
<P>
Military Academies Commander Necati Ozgen said here that war
is not desired, and "we will make efforts to reach our national
goals through diplomacy, crisis management or deterrence."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and
other high-ranking officials discussed the latest developments of
the on-going tensions with Syria at a meeting, which lasted one
hour and a half. But no details were available.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Suleyman Demirel talked on telephone with
Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan on ways to ease the tensions between
Ankara and Damascus.
</P>
<P>
On Monday evening, Demirel met with Cem to discuss the
situation, which threatened to escalate to a military
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
But the essence of the crisis seemed to have united Arab states
against Turkey. Demirel has accused Syria of trying to provoke
the Arab world against Ankara by using Turkey's close ties with
Israel as a pretext.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a predominantly Muslim but politically secular country,
has been attacked by Arab countries for forming a military
alliance with Israel, which is regarded as a threat to Arab
security.
</P>
<P>
Syria, for one, said the Turkish-Israeli alliance is targeted
against the Arab world, especially itself, and accused Turkey of
betraying the interests of the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Turkey accused Syria of harboring its
Kurdish rebels, who have been waging a 14-year-old armed campaign
on for independence in southeast Turkey. But Syria denied the
charge.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan called Monday, the World Habitat Day, for international
</P>
<P>
"Urban violence around the world is estimated to have nearly
doubled in the last 20 years," Annan said in a message issued by
the Nairobi-based U.N. Center for Human Settlements (Habitat).
</P>
<P>
"Cities do seem to be breeding grounds for a wide range of
lawless acts," Annan said, citing unemployment, easy availability
of guns, worsening urban environments, the huge gap between the
rich and the poor and a breakdown of traditional value systems as
among major factors behind the rampant city crimes.
</P>
<P>
"I urge all (U.N.) member states, local governments and
citizens of cities around the world to mark Habitat Day his year
by taking action to make their cities and communties safer and
better places to live in," Annan said in his message.
</P>
<P>
Habitat chief Claus Topfer Monday urged local governments
worldwide to find ways to help communities tackle problems that
determine community safety and result in crime, according to a
report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"Local governments have to promote personal security and
reduce fear by improving police services, making them more
accountable to the communities they serve, and by encouraging the
formation of community-based crime prevention measures and
systems," he was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reiterates Demand to Punish Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Monday reiterated its
demands to punish the killers of Iranian nationals in Afghanistan,
return the bodies of the other three victims and release other
Iranians held by the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
"Iran's demands are the same of the international community
and the Taliban should submit to the international demands,"
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said during a meeting with United
Nations envoy on Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi called on the world community to pressure the Taliban
into abiding by international will, particularly the U.N. Security
Council resolution 1193 urging the Afghan militia to stop
genocide, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia killed nine Iranian diplomats and a
reporter last August in northern Afghanistan. The bodies of six
diplomats and the reporter have been returned to Iran last month,
but those of the three others have not yet been found.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that Iran is making efforts to solve the
problems with the Taliban through diplomatic means, but its
tolerance is limited.
</P>
<P>
"We hope we will not be forced to resort to other means," he
said, hinting at the military option.
</P>
<P>
Angered by Taliban's killings, Iran has massed some 270,000
troops along its border with Afghanistan and threatened
retaliation against the Taliban, which now control most of the
country.
</P>
<P>
In a separate meeting with the U.N. envoy, Iranian Defense
Minister Ali Shamkhani said the least service expected of the
international community is to arrest and bring to justice the
killers of the Iranian nationals.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani reiterated the "full readiness" of Iranian armed
forces to defend against any crimes on the country's borders.
</P>
<P>
He voiced Tehran's readiness to offer every possible help to
the U.N. in a bid to control the current turmoil in neighboring
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi expressed appreciation of Iran's restraint over the
slaying of its nationals, saying that attacks against diplomats
should be condemned under every condition.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the need for the Taliban to release other Iranian
citizens as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban admitted that it held more than 30 Iranian drivers
and aid workers.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy arrived here on Sunday for a four-day visit.
After wrapping up his visit here, Brahimi will travel to Pakistan
to explore ways of easing the tensions between Iran and the
Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Iran is viewed as a close ally of the Afghan opposition
Northern Alliance while Pakistan is believed to have been
supporting the Taliban, which now imposes a strict version of
Islamic rule in Afghanistan.

WASHINGTON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on

contained in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1199," said Foley.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Resolution demands Belgrade to stop
the fighting in Kosovo, withdraw all the Serbian forces and launch
negotiations with the ethnic Albanians who are seeking
independence of the province.
</P>
<P>
A report by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan released on
Monday on whether Belgrade complied with the resolution blamed
Serbia for most of the recent atrocities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Foley said that Serbia should shoulder the major responsibility
although both sides have taken actions of killing civilians.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that such actions have taken place on both sides,
however, and that we condemn atrocities and killings of civilians,
no matter who perpetrates them, wherever they occur," said Foley.
</P>
<P>
"And we believe they have to be investigated thoroughly and
those guilty brought to justice," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the "overwhelming evidence indicates that the
atrocities and the killings of civilians have occurred
overwhelmingly on the Serb side."
</P>
<P>
Foley indicated the the 16-member NATO will make a decision on
military action in Kosovo soon.
</P>
<P>
"We're not far from such a decision. But that decision will
have to be taken by the political authorities of the 16 NATO
nations, based on the evidence that is in front of them at the
time they meet to decide that," he said.
</P>
<P>
"That day is not far off, unless we see what would have to be a
strategic and definitive and irreversible change on the part of
the Serb authorities' attitude and behavior," Foley told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the decision will be made by political leaders
of NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
While the alliance is threatening military actions, U.S.
special envoy Richard Holbrooke were trying in Belgrade to
persuade the Yugoslav leader to change their minds in order to
avert a confrontation in Kosovo between NATO and Serbia.

<HEADLINE> Annan, Aziz to Meet Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan and Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz would hold
the third round of talks at the United Nations Wednesday, U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Annan and Aziz held two rounds of talks last week. But Iraq has
not reversed its decision to suspend cooperation with the United
Nations weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will coincide with or immediately follow a
half-year report from the United Nations Special Commission in
charge of dismantling Iraq's ballistical, chemical and biological
weapons and the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency
responsible for Iraq's nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
Aziz has been here for a week, during which he consulted with
Annan and members of the Security Council on what a new
comprehensive review of Iraq's relations with the United Nations
would contain. Aziz is not expected to make a decision on whether
to rescind Iraq's ban on most U.N. arms inspections until he
leaves New York and speaks to Iraq's President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced suspension of cooperation with the United
Nations arms inspectors in early August. The Security Council
decided to suspend its regular review on U.N. sanctions against
Iraq until it resumes cooperation with the United Nations. The
council offered a comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with
U.N. relevant resolutions once it resumes cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM: Syria Blocks Way to Diplomacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem said Monday that Syria blocks the way to a diplomatic solution
to the disputes between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to local media, in the central province of Kayseri
Cem said that nothing can be an excuse for incidents of violence
and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Every country has the right to defend herself against
terrorism, and Turkey will certainly do what is necessary, as she
has the power, experience, belief and courage to do that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of harboring its Kurdish rebels,
who have been fighting since 1984 for an independent homeland in
southeastern Turkey. It even threatened to use force to destroy
Kurdish bases inside Syria.
</P>
<P>
Cem said Turkey continues to take necessary diplomatic
initiatives to make Syria stop giving money, weapons and logistics
support to the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
However, he said Turkey's diplomatic initiatives in the past
did not get any result, adding that this time Syria tries to
connect the Turkish position to elements like Israel in a bid to
mislead and provoke other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a predominantly Muslim but politically secular state,
has been attacked by most Arab countries for forming a military
alliance with Israel, which is regarded as a threat to Arab
security.
</P>
<P>
Syria denied it is sheltering Kurdish rebels, and said that the
Turkish-Israeli alliance is targeted against the Arab world,
especially itself, and betraying the interests of the Muslims.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Denies Harboring Kurdish Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon Monday denied there are
bases or militants of Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) in its territory or in Syria.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz told a news conference
here that Turkey's accusations about PKK's "continuing activities"
in Lebanon and Syria are "not justified."
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish authorities knows that Lebanon and Syria took
measures to stop any activities of PKK members at least one and a
half years ago," Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has accused Damascus of harboring PKK rebels, who have
been fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish state in the
southeast of Turkey. It has massed troops on its border with
Syria, threatening to destroy Kurdish bases inside Syria.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Milliyet daily said on Sunday that Turkish troops
might pinpoint targets in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley controlled by
Syrian forces. Turkey claims that PKK rebels maintain camps there.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that his country is studying the possibility of
calling for an Arab summit to discuss the Turkish threats which
target the Arab countries' interests.
</P>
<P>
Syria maintains 35,000 troops as peacekeepers in Lebanon. The
two countries agree to coordinate stances on key issues.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi traveled to Damascus Monday for
talks with President Hafez al-Assad on means of defusing tension,
while Prime Minister Rafik Hariri flew to Riyadh to solicit
support from King Fahd for a diplomatic approach to the crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations on
Tuesday observed fifty years of peacekeeping operations by paying
tribute to all peacekeepers who have served since 1948, and
especially those who have died while serving under the United
Nations flag.
</P>
<P>
At a special meeting of the General Assembly, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan presented the first Dag Hammarskjold
Medals to the families of three United Nations officials who lost
their lives while pursuing peace missions.

The first medal was presented to the family of Dag
Hammarskjold, the second United Nations Secretary-General, for him
the prize is named -- who lost his life in a plane crash on
September 18, 1961 while on a mission to bring an end to fighting
in the Congo.
</P>
<P>
The second medal was received by the family of Commandant
Rene de Labarriere, the first peacekeeper to lose his life in a
United Nations peacekeeping operation. A French officer serving
as a Military Observer in the Untied Nations Truce Supervision
Organization in Palestine, Commandant de Labarriere was killed

</P>
<P>
The third medal was presented to the family of Count Folke

<HEADLINE> Russia to Tighten Control Over Alcohol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under the new decree, licenses may be stripped for failing to
guarantee government control over alcohol production and trade.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik said the presidential
decree and government resolution on alcohol production and sales
do not imply any "nationalization" of this industry.
</P>
<P>
He said that the main purpose of these documents is to
tighten control over this sphere at all stages.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with these documents, alcohol will be produced
by enterprises whose controlling block of shares is held by the
state, or by unitary enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Kulik noted that enterprises possessing state licenses will be
in charge of supplies of alcoholic drinks stronger than 28 proof.
</P>
<P>
He said prices on alcohol and alcoholic drinks will not
increase. On the contrary, the opportunity will arise to lower
prices on these products.
</P>
<P>
In the estimate of the Finance Ministry, the measures
stipulated is expected to add 30 to 35 billion rubles (about 4.8
to 5.6 billion U.S. dollars) to the state budget, Kulik said.

<HEADLINE> Bad Medicines Discovered Among Chinese Flood Relief Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Three pharmaceutical plants and
another company have been found guilty of providing false and
sub-standard medicines as relief materials for flood-damaged parts
of China, the State Bureau of Pharmaceutical Supervision and
Management announced today.
</P>
<P>
On August 26, the Hebei Provincial Medicine Company sent 2,278
boxes of medicines worth 1.46 million yuan (about 180,000 U.S.
dollars) to Anhui Province as disaster relief materials.
</P>
<P>
When the medicine arrived in Anhui, the local pharmaceutical
control department found that some of the packaging had been
seriously damaged and tests conducted by local laboratories showed
that some of the medicines, whose function was to prevent insect
bites, reduce inflammation, or treat colds and flu, had serious
quality problems.
</P>
<P>
An investigation by the State Bureau of Pharmaceutical
Supervision and Management revealed that the medicines had been
produced by three different factories in Hebei and Sichuan
provinces and that they were all either sub-standard or were fake
products.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has closed one of the factories and ordered the
other two to stop production and correct their problems and has
confiscated the money they made from the materials. The Hebei
Provincial Medicine Company was fined and ordered to stop
production to correct its ways.
</P>
<P>
All the false and sub-standard medicines in Anhui will be
destroyed by the local medical administration, the bureau says,
adding that such medicines, if found, in other areas will be
treated in the same way.

LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said Tuesday that European Union (EU) agreed that force must
be used if the Yugoslav government refused to comply with U.N.
Security Council resolutions on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to BBC radio from Luxembourg, Cook dismissed
suggestions that some EU members wanted further authorization from
the United Nations before force could be used to persuade Belgrade
to withdraw his security forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We want (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic to comply with
the United Nations resolution, to stop the hostilities, withdraw
his forces and allow the refugees to get home," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Cook, who is in Luxembourg attending a meeting of EU foreign
ministers, pointed out:"If he (Milosevic) will not do that without
the use of force, Britain is ready to back force. I got a very
clear message yesterday from that meeting that we are agreed on
the two important issues."
</P>
<P>
"First of all we are absolutely determined that Milosevic must
adhere to the Security Council resolution," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"And secondly we are all agreed that if necessary, and none of
us wants to do it, force must be used to make him comply with the
Security Council resolution."

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Have to Make 'Hard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERICO, WEST BANK, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Both Israel and the
Palestinians have to make "hard choices" in order to put the
peace process back on track quickly, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat after almost two hours of talks, Albright
said the time "is not on our sides" and therefore Israel and the
Palestinians have to move forwards the peace negotiations
quickly.
</P>
<P>
She declined to go into details about her meeting with Arafat
and the previous one held Tuesday morning with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but said these meetings were
"useful."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state is on a mission trying to bring the
two sides closer to an agreement over the Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank, which would pave the way for a four-day Middle East
summit in Washington in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
Progress has been reportedly made during the talks last week
in Washington between Arafat, Netanyahu and U.S. President Bill
Clinton, but Albright said it is still too early to say that
there will be an agreement when the three leaders are scheduled
to meet in Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who arrived in Israel Monday night, held more than
two hours of inconclusive talks Tuesday morning with Netanyahu,
but there was no report of progress. She will meet Netanyahu
again in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said after his meeting with Albright that Israel had
met its obligation and now it was up to the Palestinians to
fulfill their commitments on fighting terrorism. But Arafat said
at the news conference in Jerico that "peace means security and
peace means freedom."
</P>
<P>
While the diplomatic shuttles are going on, clashes broke out
between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers again Tuesday in the
flashpoint West Bank town of Hebron, which has witnessed several
days of chaos since more than a dozen Israeli soldiers were
injured by a grenade attack last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a move which may worsen the situation, the Israeli
government decided Tuesday to build permanent houses on a Jewish
settlement in Hebron where a settler was killed in his mobile
house late August.
</P>
<P>
This was Albright's first trip to the region in over a
year. She is accompanied by Middle East envoy Dennis Ross and
Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk.

OAU resolution and the U.N. Security Council decision, and
cooperated fully with them in order that peace may prevail," the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
After the border conflict erupted in May, the United States
and Rwanda formulated a proposal which requested withdrawal of
the Eritrean forces from the occupied Badme area near the border.
However, the proposal was refused.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea have squabbled for years over disputed
territory along their border. But the dispute turned violent in
May this year with each side accusing the other of invasion.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Political Settlement to Turkish-Syrian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Amid mounting tensions between
Turkey and Syria, Egyptian President Hossni Mubarak arrived in
Ankara Tuesday in a bid to seek a way out to settle the crisis
politically.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is to brief Turkish President Suleyman Demirel on the
outcome of his talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad last
Sunday. After his discussion in Ankara, he will fly back to
Damascus to convey the viewpoints of Turkey to al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe despite harsh accusation exchanges
between the two countries and Turkish military buildup along the
Syrian border, diplomatic efforts still have the room of maneuver
to avoid a military confrontation between two neighboring Muslim
states.
</P>
<P>
Angered by Syria's alleged sheltering of Turkish Kurdish
rebels, Turkey took a tougher stand against Syria, but did not
reject political settlement to their disputes.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the Turkish private Star TV late Monday night,
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz termed Syria the center of terrorism
in the Middle East, sheltering all terrorists in the region that
harbor the attempt to destroy peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
This is the latest accusation against Damascus by Turkish
leaders since Ankara massed heavy troops last week along its
border with Syria, for the first time, for military exercises,
which fueled their dispute.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of sheltering the PKK rebels, who
have been fighting since 1984 for autonomy for the Kurdish
minority in southeastern Turkey and frequently wage cross-border
raids on the Turkish military and civilian targets from their
camps in Iraq, Syria and Iran.
</P>
<P>
But Syria, together with Iran, has denied the charges, and
criticized, in return, Turkey for forming military alliance with
Israel that threatens the Arab security and undermines Syria's
bargaining position in the peace talks with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Many of the Arab states have voiced their concern over Turkey's
close military ties with Israel and deemed such a relationship a
threat to regional security.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel accused Syria last Thursday
of trying provoke the Arab world to confront Ankara by using
Turkey's close ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a friendly attitude. I declare to the world that
our patience is running out and we retain the right to retaliate
against Syria," Demirel said, threatening to use force to destroy
the alleged Kurdish bases within Syrian borders. .
</P>
<P>
The growing tensions aroused great concern among the Arab
countries, many of whom favor to keep Turkey, a predominantly
Muslim and politically secular state, as a friend, rather than
estranging it despite its close military ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
They called on the two neighbors exercise restraint and settle
their disputes by political means.
</P>
<P>
To react to the Arab concerns, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem said Monday that Turkey will continue to take necessary
diplomatic ways to make Syria stop giving money, weapons and
logistics support to the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Necati Utkan said Monday
that the hope for a diplomatic solution to the crisis has not come
to an end. "we will listen to President Mubarak. We expect
Mubarak to bring us information or at least impression," he added.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources here hold that Turkish side will ask Mubarak
to persuade Syria to make close cooperation with Turkey in
fighting the PKK while Syria will expect Turkey to make
compromises in sharing the water in the Euphrates River, which
originates in Turkey and flows down to Syria and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish-Syrian question is a complicated one, but it is not
impossible to solve through diplomacy," Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa has put it. The world as whole is expecting good news
from Mubarak's shuttle diplomacy.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Give Strict Responses to Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Defense Minister Ismet
Sezgin said Tuesday that Turkey would give very strict responses
to other countries supporting the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency quoted Sezgin, who is
visiting Izmir city along the Aegean coast, as saying that Turkey
preferred to solve problems with Syria in friendship and in peace
and within reciprocal dialog for years.
</P>
<P>
"Endurance and patience have limits, we say that we have
reached the limit", said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has massed heavy government troops along the border
with Syria to conduct military exercises, which fueled the
tensions between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Sezgin said that Turkey warned Syria once again to save it
from the danger it is facing, adding that "we used diplomacy
again. We are trying to fulfill the requirements of
diplomacy. Whatever possible will be done if there is no
diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of harboring the PKK, which has
been fighting since 1984 for autonomy for the Kurdish minority in
southeastern Turkey. But Syria denied the charge.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Does Not Plan to Stay in Power for Long </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai said Tuesday that he did not plan to stay in power until
the end of the present Parliament term in 2000 although his
coalition has received additional political support.
</P>
<P>
He said he would try his best to prepare the country for the
new election under the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Chuan made the remarks shortly after Monday's cabinet reshuffle
which brought in the National Development Party (NDP), although
known as the Chart Pattana Party, following a series of corruption
scandals that shock the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The NDP, the third largest political party in Thailand, has 51
seats in the 389-strong Parliament, and its entry into the
government strengthens Chuan's cabinet, which leads a comfortable
majority over the 132-seat opposition.
</P>
<P>
Some 17 positions of ministers and deputy ministers were
involved in the reshuffle, the first of its kind by the Chuan
government since it came to power last November.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the reshuffle, Chuan denied that his coalition was
planning to secure its control on the House after recruiting the
support from the NDP.
</P>
<P>
"I have stressed to all (cabinet members) that we have a
limited time (before the current Parliament term expires)," said
Chuan, quoted by the Thai News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Political sources said Chuan's remarks indicated his intention
to hold elections ahead of schedule to ensure his Democrat Party's
long-term rule.
</P>
<P>
Chuan vowed to guarantee the unity in the government so as to
ensure efforts to implement its economic policies.
</P>
<P>
The political situation would not pose a problem if there was
good cooperation and coordination in the government, Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government now consists of the Democrat Party,
Chart Pattana Party, Chart Thai Party, Social Action Party,
Solidarity Party, Seritham Party and a 12-MP group that defected
from the Prachakorn Thai Party.

</P>
<P>
Russia's position was announced here Tuesday by the country's
Ambassador to Cyprus, Georgi Mouradov, after a meeting with the

with Israel, which it says poses a threat to the Arab world as a
whole, especially itself.

<HEADLINE> China Tightening Controls On Shipping Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice-minister of
foreign trade and economic cooperation Sun Zhenyu said that China
will tighten controls on international shipping agents to create a
better environment for imports and exports because shipping is an
important link in foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Sun told a national conference on international shipping agents
that 1,542 enterprises in China have qualified as international
shipping agents since 1984 and that more than 80 percent of
China's imports and exports are now handled by these enterprises.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the international cargo business in China is now
chaotic because of a lack of supervision and that some foreign
representatives in China do not have government approval and a few
enterprises are trying to attract clients with high commissions or
rebates.
</P>
<P>
Some enterprises have even tried to make a profit with special
invoices or by helping illegal businesses ship goods or clear
customs, he said.
</P>
<P>
These have seriously disturbed normal international cargo
operations, increasing costs and causing losses of state revenues,
he said, adding that foreign trade and economic cooperation
offices in various provinces and cities need to tighten controls
on the local shipping agents' business.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation is also
planning to establish a national cargo shipping association to
regulate and standardize the business, he said.
</P>
<P>
From January to August, China had 205.9 billion U.S. dollars
worth of exports and imports, a 5.5 percent growth over the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Sun said, the rate of increase has been slipping month
by month, and the export situation is serious.

<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Chen Yunlin, the director of the
State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, said that Taiwanese
authorities need to make a positive response to the central
government's call for political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Cross-Straits relations are currently at a critical historical
point, Chen told a plenary session of the First Council of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) here
today, and whether there will be sound relations in the 21st
century depends on whether the two sides can start political
negotiations as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Taiwanese will actively respond
to the mainland's proposal to hold cross-Straits negotiations,
which he said are in line with the Taiwanese people's aspirations
for peace, stability, and better relations.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope that the Taiwan authorities can give up their
various attempts to hinder the development of cross-Straits
relations and prove their sincerity in improving relations and
seeking reunification of the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to ARATS President Wang Daohan, his association is
now looking forward to an early political dialogue with its
counterpart in Taiwan, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), to
make preparations for cross-Straits political negotiations.

BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's Mayor Jia Qinglin said
today that the Chinese capital has a solution to its worsening air
problem and that is: plant more trees.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental way to deal with air pollution is increased
greenery, he said, while admitting that the amount of greenery in
urban areas is still low and that pollution has become a big
problem endangering the city's healthy development.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government is encouraging the planting of more
greenery around new buildings, and replacing old buildings with
trees.
</P>
<P>
Rapid urbanization and the construction of new roads and
buildings have been done at the expense of greenery, and there are
increasing complaints about the air problem caused by automobiles
and dust storms.
</P>
<P>
Forest coverage in Beijing is less than 40 percent and not more
than 35 percent in urban areas.

MOSCOW, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Federal Security
Service is facing restructuring under a decree issued by President
Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The security service will consist of a chairman, two first

A 17-member board will be formed by the chairman, his deputies

General Nikolai Patrushev, who was recently appointed chief
of the presidential department controlling regional officials, has

BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- About 100 journalists from the
Xinhua News Agency, People's Daily, and other news media were
singled out and commended today for their outstanding performance
in covering the country's recent fight against the worst floods in
decades.
</P>
<P>
Ding Guangen, the head of the Publicity Department of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, told a meeting
at Beijing's Great Hall of the People today that the coverage of
the recent floods by Chinese journalists displayed their political
awareness, sense of responsibility, affection for the people, and
excellent work style.
</P>
<P>
During two months of summer flooding that hit the entire
Yangtze River basin and the Nenjiang and Songhua rivers in the
Northeast, Chinese national news organizations sent over 1,000
journalists to report on the fight and to record the heroic
efforts of civilians and soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"You have written a glorious chapter in our country's
journalistic history," Ding told the group and urged journalists
nationwide to make an effort to reflect the same fighting spirit
that emerged in the battle against the floods and to encourage
people to work harder for this year's reforms and development.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting also recognized the efforts of 33 departments
of news organizations for their major contributions to the flood
work.

<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese version of the Starr
Report on President Bill Clinton's sexual activities has been
banned in China, today's Beijing Morning Post reported.
</P>
<P>
At 3:40 p.m. Monday, the Office Against Pornography and
Illicit Publications of the Municipal Press and Publications
Administration confiscated a number of Chinese copies of the Starr
Report, the newspaper said in its story.
</P>
<P>
According to Beijing Morning Post, the report was published by
a weekly newspaper as a "special issue" on September 28. It took
the newspaper only two days to translate the report from an
Internet copy.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a State Press and Publications
Administration official as saying newspapers can not publish a
book and release it nationwide and that the Chinese version of the
Starr Report should be regarded as an illicit publication.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that although the State Press and
Publications Administration has issued a circular banning the
publication of a Chinese version of the Starr Report out of some
"diplomatic reasons", a dozen publishing houses are now still
translating and compiling the report.
</P>
<P>
One vendor told the paper: "I started selling this book from
October 2, and it was selling extremely well. I had no problem of
selling 100 to 200 copies a day."

<HEADLINE> Britain Backs Egypt in EU Anti-dumping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has British support in its
bid to abort the proposal by some European Union countries to
impose anti-dumping tariffs on Egyptian textile exports, a
British diplomat said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Head of the trade mission at the British Embassy in Cairo David
Rider told the Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) that his
government was trying to convince other EU countries to vote in
favor of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"Britain believes that imposing additional tariffs is not the
ideal way of dealing with dumping cases. We hope that other EU
members would respond favorably to this viewpoint and consider
other alternatives to resolve this issue in the near future,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, EU foreign ministers Monday rejected
a European Commission proposal to impose five-year anti-dumping
duties averaging 12 percent on imports of unbleached cotton
fabrics from five developing countries, including Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Officials attending the Luxembourg meeting said ministers from
the 15-nation bloc decided not to go ahead with the European
Commission's proposal for duties on "grey cloth" imports from
China, Egypt, India, Indonesia and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to impose anti-dumping tariffs on Egyptian textile
exports made on July 29 has soured the trade climate between Egypt
and the EU, particularly at talks on a partnership accord on trade
liberalization and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
EU ambassadors in Cairo last week met Egypt's Supply and Trade
Minister Ahmed Goweili, who had warned them that Egypt would
retaliate if the EU adopted the proposed duties, backed by cotton
producers in Italy, France, Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade between Egypt and Britain amounts to 5
billion Egyptian pounds (1.47 billion U.S. dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian exports to Britain rose by 19 percent in the last
seven months compared to the corresponding period last year. They
included crude oil and its derivatives, fresh vegetables and
fruits, textiles and ready made clothes.
</P>
<P>
The EU is Egypt's main trading partner and accounts, along with
the United States, for about 60 percent of exports. Egypt's annual
imports from the EU averages 5 billion dollars, while exports are
about 1.7 billion dollars.

<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- "British Law Week" opened in
Beijing today and will run through Saturday.

<P>
Liu Yang, Vice-Minister of Justice, said at the opening

relations important and the successful resolution of the Hong Kong
issue paved the way for new development of relations.
</P>
<P>
Britain originated the Anglo-American legal framework and its
legal system is well organized, Liu said, and China seeks to learn
from the experiences of others in establishing a system of rule of
law under the principle of mutual respect, equality, mutual
benefit, seeking common ground while reserving differences, and
common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Lord Justice Otton, who is head of the British delegation to
"Law Week," said that the legal systems of Britain and China have
sharp differences. However, both systems have shown flexibility in
adapting to new concepts and different ways of thinking, he added.
</P>
<P>
"British Law Week" will have a simulated criminal trial,
British style, as well as discussions of commercial law, criminal
procedures, administrative law, relations between domestic law and

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government Tuesday
called on Turkey and Syria to settle their differences through
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, government spokesman
Christos Stylianides stressed that each country's territorial
integrity should be respected.
</P>
<P>
"Countries should not resort to threats of force or the use of
force. Any differences should be resolved through
U.N. procedures," Stylianides said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "there are peaceful procedures and we believe
Turkey should act within this framework."
</P>
<P>
Tensions are mounting between Damascus and Ankara after they
traded accusations against each other, and Turkey has reportedly
massed up troops along its border with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors have long been at odds over issues including
Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), water sharing and
the Turkish-Israeli military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Syria of harboring PKK rebels, who have been
fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish state in the
southeast of Turkey. Syria has denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
Syria has lashed out at Turkey, a predominantly Muslim
country, for forming a military alliance with Israel, saying that
it undermines its bargaining position in negotiations with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Syria has disputes with Israel over the future of the Golan
Heights, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. Damascus
insists on its return as a condition for peace with the Jewish
state.

<HEADLINE> Singapore, Second Fastest Aging Country in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE October 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior Singapore official
said here Tuesday that his country is in fact the second fastest
aging country in Asia after Japan.
</P>
<P>
Robert Loh, president of the National Council of Social Service
of Singapore, said at a press conference Tuesday, "It is estimated
that in the year 2030, about one million Singaporeans will be 60
years and older."
</P>
<P>
In mid-1996, Singapore's population was officially estimated at
3.04 million with an increase of about 1.9 percent over the
previous year and the proportion of residents aged 60 years and
over amounted to ten percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
In light of the rapidly growing aging population, the Retired &AMP;
Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) will be officially launched by
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong at the end of October as a
kick-start event for the U.N.-sponsored International Year of
Older Persons in Singapore, RSVP Singapore President Philbert Chin
announced at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
The launch of RSVP Singapore will be proceeded by a public
symposium under the theme "The age of challenge, the Challenge of
Age," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chin emphasized that "RSVP seeks to challenge the view that
older people are a liability in the community, always on the
receiving end of service from others, unappreciative and unable to
move with change."
</P>
<P>
He noted that RSVP Singapore, formed under the auspices of the
National Council of Social Service and supported by the Ministry
of Community Development, is a non-profit and privately financed
organization which offers older men and women the opportunity to
share their lifetime experiences, time and talents to enhance
their community through volunteer service.
</P>
<P>
Under its action plan, RSVP Singapore has four programs in
place, including Cyberguide Program, Mentoring Program, Senior
Executive Program and Club Service Program.
</P>
<P>
Chin said RSVP aims to add more vibrance to the lives of senior
citizens by providing them with opportunities to share their lives
with dignity through volunteer service and its projects have been
designed with the view of encouraging senior citizens in Singapore
to continue contributing to the community.

<HEADLINE> EU Talks With Non-European Car Makers on Emission Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
started talks with non-European car makers on carbon dioxide
emission reductions in future exports to the union.
</P>
<P>
European Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock said Tuesday talks
were underway between the EU and Japanese and South Korean
manufacturers after the the European council of transport
ministers approved the European Commission's agreement with the
European Automobile Manufacturers Association (EAMA) on
voluntarily reducing carbon dioxide emissions from new passenger
cars to 140 grams per kilometer by 2008.
</P>
<P>
The level will be further cut to 120 grams per kilometer by the
year 2010, Kinnock added.
</P>
<P>
So far, the agreement applies only to European car makers
affiliated with the EAMA which includes BMW, Fiat, Ford of Europe,
GM Europe, Daimler-Benz, Porsche, PSA Peugeot Citroen, Renault,
Rolls-Royce, Volkswagen and Volvo.
</P>
<P>
Kinnock said that details would be worked out for the talks
with non-EAMA car makers including those in the United States.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the agreement as a major contribution toward the
European Union's realization of its commitment to the Kyoto
Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The protocol, adopted in Japan on December 1997, sets legally
binding targets for developed countries for the post-2000 period
on reducing the emission levels of key greenhouse gases, such as
carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
The protocol called on developed countries to reduce their
combined emissions of six key greenhouse gases by at least five
percent below 1990 levels by the period 2008 to 2012.
</P>
<P>
Kinnock said that further discussions with non-EAMA
manufacturers would be held in December.

<HEADLINE> First Share Certificate in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Feile Audio
Technology Company does not stand out among the 800-some companies
listed on China's stock exchanges, but it was Feile who issued the
first share in the Chinese mainland more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
That was in 1984. A piece of blue paper with the company's
name, face value, seal of the general manager, and the signature
of the stock holder on one side and tables for recording transfers
on the other.
</P>
<P>
In October of 1986, it was presented to the Chairman of the New
York Stock Exchange during his visit to Beijing. For the first two
days, few people came to the office on Wuyi Street where stocks
were sold.
</P>
<P>
But on the third day, crowds of people suddenly lined up
outside the office, one employee recalls, and in one day, 500,000
certificates selling for 50 yuan (about 6 U.S. dollars) each were
sold.
</P>
<P>
At that time, Chinese were still arguing about whether stocks
were capitalist and about why China didn't have any corporation
laws. But the first group of shareholders smelled the golden
opportunity and made the plunge.
</P>
<P>
Shares were similar to bonds at the beginning and shareholders
only got profits from the company before the stock exchange was
set up in November of 1986.
</P>
<P>
Feile was one of the first two companies listed and the funds
raised in the stock exchange have promoted its development. Its
capital has increased from 500,000 yuan to 150 million yuan and
the value of its shares has increased by more than 1,600 yuan.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, China had 810 companies listed on the
Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. The total value of stocks
was 210.9 billion yuan and market capitalization last year was
2.17 trillion yuan, or 23 percent of China's GDP.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Calls Chirac on Settlement of Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
convinced French President Jacques Chirac on Tuesday that the
Kosovo conflict could be resolved without use of force through
Russia's efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency reported Yeltsin informed Chirac by
telephone of Russia's latest attempts to ensure a political
settlement of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Russian president stressed the
agreements reached between the Russian delegation and Yugoslav
authorities in Belgrade on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslavian leadership began on October 5 to take concrete
steps towards normalizing the situation in Kosovo, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also noted the decision of the Yugoslavian government
to invite observers from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to monitor troop withdrawals from the
province.
</P>
<P>
It allowed the international community "a real chance to take
part in the monitoring of the situation in that territory", he
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the plans to settle the crisis by force would
not only fail to normalize the situation, but would bring about
grave international consequences.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, on his part, positively assessed the changes in the
stand of the Yugoslav leadership and expressed hope that it would
fulfill the resolution of the U.N. Security Council and ensure the
prompt opening of negotiations with the Kosovo Albanians on their
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders agreed to keep up close contacts and coordinate
their efforts to settle the situation.
</P>
<P>
The Tuesday telephone conversation was one of a series of
contacts by Yeltsin with world leaders in an effort to head off
the threat of NATO action against Serbian forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president held telephone talks with German
Chancellor Elect Gerhard Schroeder, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov held
telephone talks on Kosovo with his German and Italian counterparts
Klaus Kinkel and Lamberto Dini, and NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Students Studying Abroad Encouraged To Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- China will create more favorable
conditions for Chinese students studying abroad to encourage them
to come back to China, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing told a visiting
group of 36 students studying abroad today.
</P>
<P>
Rapid economic growth and social development in China have
meant a great need for talented people and of students who have
gained a great deal of knowledge in the world, he said, and that
the nation's policy of sending students abroad, about 300,000 by
now, has proven fruitful over the past two decades. Many of them
have returned and have made contributions to the country.
</P>
<P>
Today's group of 36 students studying in 11 countries was
organized by the Ministry of Education last month. They have
finished a research project on environmental protection in the
city of Chongqing and in the Three Gorges Dam area.

<HEADLINE> No Permit for Malaysia's Ruling National Front Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Police said Tuesday no
permit would be issued for the ruling 14-party Barisan Nasional
(National Front) rally planned for Saturday at the National
Stadium in Bukit Jalil here.
</P>
<P>
Police decided not to issue the permit for reasons of security,
the Malaysian national news agency Bernama reported, quoting Kuala
Lumpur Police Chief Kamaruddin Md Ali.
</P>
<P>
"The police wish to advise members of the public not to go to
the stadium at the stipulated time as the police had not issued a
permit for the gathering," the police officer was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The organizers have been informed of the police decision, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The gathering's coordinating committee chairman Najib Tun
Razak, who is education minister, said Monday that some 150,000
people were expected to attend the rally which Najib said was to
express support for Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and would last
two hours.
</P>
<P>
United Malays National Organization (UMNO), the backbone
component of the National Front, was to be represented by more
than 50,000 members, the Malaysian Chinese Association, the second
largest component party of the Front, by up to 30,000 members, and
the Malaysian Indian Congress by 10,000 of its members, while the
other National Front component parties and the public will make up
the rest.
</P>
<P>
Kamarudin said police had also not issued permits to organizers
who had planned gatherings at the Merdeka Stadium, Merdeka Square,
Jalan Tunku Abdul Rahman and other venues in the capital city on
the same day.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim had
been distributing pamphlets announcing gatherings in the various
venues on October 10.
</P>
<P>
The police officer said, "Any attempt by anyone including the
organizers and members of the public to attend illegal gatherings
or rallies is an offense and action will be taken against them
under the Police Act."

<HEADLINE> Albright: Much to Be Done for Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said here Tuesday that there is still much work
to be done to push forward the peace talks between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after her meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Albright said that both Israeli and
Palestinian leaders have to make hard decisions to break the
current deadlock over the Israeli troops' second redeployment in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived here Tuesday morning in an attempt to narrow
differences between the two sides ahead of a mid-October
Washington three-way summit to try to clinch a deal on the
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu told reporters that if the Palestinians
fulfilled their commitments to ensure the security of the Jewish
country, there will be an agreement.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the possibility of a three-way meeting
between Albright, Palestinian National Authority President Yasser
Arafat and him on Wednesday is being checked.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian sources have told Israel Radio that the
three-way meeting will be decided only after the meeting between
Albright and Arafat later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been stalled for 18
months and their dispute over the troops redeployment is the major
obstacle in reactivating the peace process.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. has put forward a proposal calling for an Israeli troop
pullback from 13 percent more of the West Bank in exchange for a
tougher Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants. Palestinians
have accepted it.
</P>
<P>
Israel has initially rejected the formula and later promised to
hand over 10 percent of the land and set aside 3 percent as a
nature reserve under joint security control by both sides.

<P>
Two suspects, named Riza Y. and Habip Y., were detained in

<HEADLINE> EU Hails Environmental Agreement With Car Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) transport
ministers Tuesday welcomed the environmental agreement between the
European Commission and the 11-member European Automobile
Manufacturers Association (ACEA).
</P>
<P>
The agreement limits carbon dioxide emission from new passenger
cars to 140 grams per kilometer in the EU by 2008 with a further
reduction to 120 grams per kilometer by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The transport ministers described the European Commission's
agreement with car makers as a substantial contribution to the
EU's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Under the protocol, developed countries are bound to reduce
their combined emissions of six key greenhouse gases by at least
five percent below 1990 levels by 2008 to 2012.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, had to submit the agreement to the European council of
transport ministers and the European Parliament before it is
finalized.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's council meeting expressed satisfaction at the
agreement which was designed to make a major contribution to
reducing the average carbon dioxide emissions of newly-registered
passenger cars to 120 grams per kilometer by 2010 at the latest as
called for by the council.
</P>
<P>
The council requested the commission in its scheduled 2003
review to evaluate progress toward reaching the emission target.
</P>
<P>
The EU transport ministers said after the meeting that the
emission accord was only one element of EU efforts to control
carbon dioxide emissions from the transport sector.
</P>
<P>
They underlined the need for a comprehensive policy approach
and confirmed their intention to progress with the commission's
agreement on a community policy to be worked out by the council.
</P>
<P>
The ACEA members include BMW, Fiat, Ford of Europe, GM Europe,
Daimler-Benz, Porsche, PSA Peugeot Citroen, Renault, Rolls-Royce,
Volkswagen and Volvo.

NAIROBI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Fighting is reportedly raging
in Kindu, capital of Maniema Province in the east of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), according to a Rwanda News
Agency report reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rebel-held radio Bukavu, monitored in Rwanda this morning

all supplies to the town by troops loyal to Laurent Kabila," the
radio announced.
</P>

The radio quoted a rebel spokesman as saying that intense
fighting is taking place around that town considered key to the
outcome of the Congolese war.
</P>
<P>
"Kindu shelters an important arsenal for the Kinshasa army,"
it said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Lee Says Asian Countries to Recover in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Senior Minister Lee
Kuan Yew has said economic growth would resume in Asian countries
and their recovery from the current economic crisis would vary
from country to country.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in an interview with The Australian, the
transcript of which was released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Growth would resume but the price of restructuring must be
paid, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He added that the economic crisis had thrown Asian confidence
temporarily off balance and it would take a couple of years for
every one to sort his position out.
</P>
<P>
But the basic virtues such as hard working, the willingness to
learn and welcoming foreign investments had not disappeared, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The senior minister said recovery from the crisis that has been
reeling Asia for more than a year would depend on political
stability and a return of confidence following fundamental
restructuring of their financial institutions and major
corporations.
</P>
<P>
Referring to currency and capital controls exercised by
Malaysia, he said Malaysia's experience would be closely watched
by other countries.
</P>
<P>
If Malaysia's economy improved, he said, other countries would
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Taking the case in Japan, Lee said the region will not see a
reform of Japanese banking system, the kind the Americans believe
is necessary.
</P>
<P>
Japanese culture was dictating why reform and recovery in Japan
would take longer, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the pace would be that of the slowest in their convoy
system.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The New York times
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton Monday urged a select group of the world's
top financial officials to develop a unified attack on the global
economic crisis, after nearly three days of debate here have
produced a near stalemate over immediate cures.
</P>
<P>
-- After a long day that veered from sober constitutional
disclosure to bitter partisan scrapping, the House Judiciary
Committee voted along party lines Monday night to recommend that
Congress open a formal impeachment investigation into a president
for only the third time in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Officials attending the annual meeting of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank were working Monday on a plan to
tame the movement of capital across borders and to increase the
transparency of such investments.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States measures other countries against a lofty
ideal when it comes to human rights, but it frequently violates
these standards within its own borders, Amnesty International
contends in a new report to be released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Four Long-Term Capital partners personally borrowed a total
of nearly 43 million U.S. dollars to make equity investments in
the hedge fund, according to people familiar with the situation.
</P>
<P>
-- A government shutdown could result from the current clash
over spending priorities between the administration and Congress,
but the White House dismissed suggestions Clinton is using the
tactic to gain an advantage.

<HEADLINE> Swissair Offers Compensation for Victims' Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The families of the 229
passengers and crew who died on Swissair Flight 111 will each be
offered about 137,000 U.S. dollars in compensation in the coming
months, the Globe and Mail reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They will be the first beneficiaries of an agreement made last
year by several major air carriers, including Swissair, to raise
the liability limit to about 137,000 dollars from the 75,000
dollars cap on damages that was set in 1966.
</P>
<P>
Since the Swissair jet crashed in the Atlantic Ocean off
Canada's coast on September 2, the airline has been under pressure
from some lawyers to announce that it would make the payments
regardless of any legal action planned by family members.
</P>
<P>
But Eric Amman, Swissair legal affairs manager for North
America, said the airline has been preoccupied with addressing the
aftermath of the tragedy and paying about 20,000 dollars per
family to cover the cost of travel and other expenses incurred
after the crash.
</P>
<P>
To date Swissair has paid out about 2.9 million dollars to 133
families and has received requests for assistance from 24 others.
</P>
<P>
The compensation under the international liability agreement
will cost Swissair's insurer about 31.3 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Flies to Ankara on Mediation Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
left here Tuesday on a lightning visit to Ankara in a bid to
mediate in the escalating row between Syria and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader is accompanied by a delegation including
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, Minister of Information Safwat
al-Sherif, Presidential Political Advisor Osama al-Baz and head of
the presidential cabinet Zakarya Azmy.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Mubarak is carrying to Ankara a plan on
gradual reconciliation between Turkey and Syria.
</P>
<P>
This plan might lead to holding a series of Turkish-Syrian
ministerial meetings, probably to be followed by a quadrilateral
summit that would include the leaders of Egypt and Saudi Arabia,
according to the Egyptian and Turkish press reports Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The trip followed talks between Mubarak and Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad in Damascus Sunday. Mubarak has called on both
sides to restrain from any provocative actions.
</P>
<P>
"President Mubarak will go to Turkey as representative of the
Arab side and chairman of the Arab summit that calls for peace in
the region," Moussa told reporters Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt is seeking to establish a mechanism for dialog
between the two neighbor countries and is going to "take it (the
problem) by the root."
</P>
<P>
Strained ties between Mideast neighbors Syria and Turkey have
deteriorated during the past weeks with Syria bridling at Turkey's
growing military links with Israel and Turkey threatening Damascus
for allegedly aiding Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in
southeast Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But both sides appear to have pulled back from the brink in
recent days with separate announcements that they seek diplomat
means to resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said on Saturday that
Turkey plans a military exercise along the Syrian border after the
end of the current NATO exercises in the area.
</P>
<P>
Ankara also announced plans for fresh naval maneuvers in the
eastern Mediterranean and joint air exercises.

MOSCOW, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Some Russian weightlifters may

</P>
<P>
The rest of the Russian team would have to find their own
funds to pay for their participation in the World Championships -
some 1,000 U.S. dollars per person - because a cash crisis meant
the Russian Olympic Committee was unable to finance the entire
team, Maslyayev added.

counterpart Suleyman Demirel held talks at the Canakaya
presidential palace on how to defuse the mounting tensions.
</P>
<P>
Strained ties between Turkey and Syria deteriorated in recent
days. Turkey accused Syria of aiding Kurdish rebels fighting for
autonomy in southeast Turkey, while Syria bridled at Turkey's
growing military links with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Turkey said on Saturday that it plans a military exercise
along the Syrian border after the end of the current exercises of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the area.

SOFIA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's international striker
Lyuboslav Penev is planning to quit his national team spell,
leaving the place for younger players.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old veteran, who returned to Sofia on Monday for

"fresh" squad.

HANGZHOU, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A farmer in China's Zhejiang
Province recently signed a one-year contract with the local civil
aviation bureau to operate a regional passenger airline at a cost
of 10.8 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chen Tianming, a farmer in the city of Yongkang, will operate
two roundtrip flights each week between the city of Quzhou in
southern Zhejiang, and Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong
Province, beginning October 20.
</P>
<P>
Chen is practically alone in this business. He established a
decorating company in 1995 and made quite a profit from it. Later
he built a chartered airplane service and then decided to get
involved in civil aviation because he saw an increasing number of
local businessmen travelling to and from Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
"We'll work heart and soul for passengers and improve our
services steadily," he explains.

HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- "More Beauty, More Business,"
says a theme advertisement of Asia's largest trade exhibition for
beauty industry, which opened at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition center here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The three-day event named Cosmoprof Asia '98 has attracted
about 500 exhibitors from over 30 countries and regions, featuring
their most fascinating and updated products.
</P>
<P>
"Cosmoprof Asia is well established as Asia's foremost event by
providing the best possible business-to-business access to the
international beauty trade. It is an efficient and effective
environment for trade members to meet and to do business, and
preview the latest innovative and refined products," said Michael
Duck, the general manager of the organizers Cosmoprof Asia Ltd.
</P>

"In spite of the recent economic disturbance in Asia, Hong Kong
being the trade fair center in the region continues to be the
focus of the world attention. In fact, the number of
pre-registered buyers of this show is actually higher than the
same time last year, showing international buyers still rest their
confidence in the region as the major market for the cosmetics
industry," Duck added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, British Prime Ministers Hold Talks (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blair expressed the hope that his current China visit will
further promote UK-China relations, and said UK-China ties have
entered a new era, which serves the interests of the people of
both countries and benefits the entire world.
</P>
<P>
Britain and China are taking concrete measures to step up
bilateral relations, Blair noted.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that President Jiang Zemin's visit to Britain next
year will be the first such trip by a Chinese head of state, and
that this will certainly have a far-reaching impact on
Sino-British ties.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement issued by the two countries today is a
significant document, guiding the direction of the development
of Sino-British ties across the century, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the establishment of a Sino-British
Forum will enable personnel from all walks of life in both nations
to express their ideas on bilateral ties, helping the sound growth
of Sino-British relations.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister said that President Jiang Zemin's
visit to Britain next year will serve as a "landmark" in the
bilateral relationship, and that the British side eagerly awaits
the visit, which will promote UK-China relations.
</P>
<P>
Today's joint statement signals that the two countries will
engage in cooperation in a variety of areas, according to Blair,
and the bilateral forum will provide more opportunities for
increased exchanges of views.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers briefed each other on the political and
economic situations in their respective countries and discussed
the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Blair highly praised the Chinese government for not devaluing
its currency and for its role in helping those countries
affected by the financial crisis, both deserving of high
respect worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Zhu expressed his appreciation for the contribution made by
Blair and his Labor Party to the smooth return of Hong Kong. He
reiterated that the central government of China will adhere to the
principle of "one country, two systems" and will not interfere in
Hong Kong's affairs, which belong to the scope of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Blair said that Hong Kong has had remarkable success since its
return, though it now faces economic difficulties because of the
Asian financial crisis. In fact, Hong Kong is doing a better job
than expected, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of human rights, the two prime ministers agreed
that the two countries will continue dialogues.
</P>
<P>
Zhu praised Blair's efforts to help the European Union (EU)
improve its attitude toward China on human rights. Blair hailed
the fact that the Chinese government signed the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, calling it an important
step.
</P>
<P>
After their talks, the two prime ministers met with Chinese and
British enterpreneurs.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Predicted to Be First Out of Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Board of Investment
(BOI) Secretary General Staporn Kavitanon Tuesday voiced optimism
that his country was well on its way to being the first out of the
economic crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Staporn, in a speech to the 4th meeting of the British-Thai
Business Group being held here, said Thailand's macroeconomic
indicators showed "significant light at the end of the tunnel"
despite the fact that the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
growth was likely to decline by around 8 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
"While the value of Thai exports is likely to decline in U.S.
dollar terms, the volume of exports has risen by an estimated 14
percent through the first seven months of 1998," he said. "Exports
of products such as computers, canned seafood, rubber products,
and automobiles and components are showing double-digit,
dollar-denominated growth and traditional exports such as rice and
garments are ahead of last year's pace."
</P>
<P>
The BOT chief said Thai exports to the European Union, which
account for some 16 percent of all Thai exports, increased 12.1
percent during the first half of 1998, and exports to the U.S. are
also up sharply.
</P>
<P>
He said the BOT estimates that full-year exports will exceed 53
billion U.S. dollars, which, when combined with declines in
imports, will result in a healthy trade surplus of about 11.5
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Staporn said that by year-end, the current account will show a
surplus of some 15 billion dollars, roughly 14 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed to the healthy flows of foreign direct
investment (FDI). For the first five months of 1998, Staporn
indicated that "BOT reported that FDI was roughly equivalent to
the full-year total of about 104 billion baht (2.67 billion
dollars) in 1997".
</P>
<P>
"After a period of unprecedented growth, Thailand is undergoing
a cyclical adjustment, from which we will soon emerge, and they
(foreign investors) are investing now in order to reap the rewards
when we do," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said many foreign-funded projects are investing needed
foreign currency into Thailand and are contributing to a more
stable baht, which has traded in a relatively narrow range,
between 28-42 to the U.S. dollar, for the past eight months,
despite concerns about the yen, the ringgit and other regional
currencies.
</P>
<P>
This stability, he said, had made it possible for the Bank of
Thailand to relax monetary policy, and interest rates have
declined dramatically and appear likely to continue to do so until
year-end.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, inflation in September was 7 percent and it is
quite likely that full-year inflation will be less than 9 percent,
well bellow the forecast by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
As a whole, Staporn noted, these macroeconomic statistics
provide "reason for cautious optimism that we are working our way
out of the economic crisis".

<HEADLINE> Kashmir Not Internal Matter of India: US Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to India
Richard Celeste said Tuesday that the United States did not
consider Kashmir issue an internal matter of India.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Pune city about 1,500 km
southwest of New Delhi, he said it not only had regional but also
global ramifications.
</P>
<P>
He said that the fallout of nuclear tests performed by the two
countries in May this year is the mounting tension across the Line
of Control along the Kashmir area. With both countries now
possessing nuclear weapons any miscalculation could spell
disaster.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the only way in which the vexed problems
between the two countries could be sorted out is through bilateral
talks," he said adding that such talks would pay the way for
better understanding.
</P>
<P>
Since their division in 1947, India and Pakistan have had three
wars and two of them were over the Kashmir issue. Even today the
two countries still have a big gap over the issue. India maintains
that Kashmir is an integral part of its territory while Pakistan
says it is a disputed issue which is a root cause of tension
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have held various talks in the past in a bid
to improve their soured relations, yet their talks have failed so
far mainly because of their different perceptions on the Kashmir
issue.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, India has time and again said the Kashmir
issue is a bilateral issue and it should be solved through
bilateral talks between India and Pakistan. It opposes the
involvement of third force in it. Pakistan, however, has called
upon the world community to help solve the Kashmir issue. It said
that history shows that without third force, only Pakistan and
India could not solve the issue.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Endorses Imelda's Acquittal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Tuesday endorsed the acquittal of Imelda Marcos by the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
"I hope she will be happy about it. One thing I could see
there, according to the charges, there was conspiracy. But when
one is acquitted, the other one must be acquitted," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
Imelda, the 69-year-old widow of former president Ferdinand
Marcos, was accused of illegally entering into five contracts
unfavorable to the government during her husband's 20-year rule of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the third division of the Supreme Court upheld
the 1993 ruling by an anti-graft court, sentencing her to a jail
term of 12 years. But her alleged accomplice, former
transportation minister Jose Dans, was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the two projects involved in the charge against
Imelda "really benefit the people."
</P>
<P>
However, he said the acquittal will not hamper the government's
efforts to recover Marcos' ill-gotten wealth hidden abroad. His
government is eyeing the resolution of the illegal wealth cases by
the end of this year, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Supreme Court Tuesday acquitted Imelda of the
graft charge, overturning the only case in which Imelda had been
found guilty of graft.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled 8-5, with one judge abstaining.
</P>
<P>
Marcos was ousted in a popular revolt in 1986. He fled to
Hawaii, the United States, and died there three years later.

<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- China will ban the use of
plastic food containers along main railway lines and rivers and in
tourism regions to control the serious blight known as "white
pollution," an environmental official said here today.
</P>
<P>
A circular, jointly released recently by the State General

containers into and along rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
The local governments in provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions have been asked to clean up plastic bags and
containers floating in the Yangtze River and Taihu Lake, and piled
up at tourism regions within three months.
</P>
<P>
And all the other refuse piles accumulating in the regions must
be treated within six months, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, tourism sites are required to provide enough garbage
cans, and garbage treatment stations are forbidden to be located
along rivers and lakes.

<HEADLINE> Committee to Be Set Up for New Elections in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho political parties
have agreed to a proposal from the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) for the formation of a transitional structure to
creat conditions for a new general election in the country.
</P>
<P>
The proposed transitional committee will comprise one or two
members from each party taking part in forthcoming election to be
held within 15 to 18 months, said a press report here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will take it to the people... and if they say yes to it,
we will also say yes," opposition alliance spokesman Vincent
Malebo said Monday after a seven-hour meeting in the capital
Maseru.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the opposition alliance did not get a mandate
from its supporters, it would resort to other ways of overcoming
the political impasse in the country, Johannesburg-based
newspaper The Citizen reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD)'s
deputy leader Kelebone Maope, said that his party did not in
principle have problems with the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the LCD and opposition parties in Lesotho
Monday held their second round of talks, chaired by South African
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi, in a bid to
stabilize the political situation in the mountain kingdom.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the proposal announced by Mufamadi, the
transitional committee would help create conditions conducive to
the holding of free and fair elections for all parties.
</P>
<P>
The committee would also ensure equal treatment for all
political parties by state-owned broadcasting and information
services in the period leading up to the election.
</P>
<P>
It would make decisions on all electoral matters including the
role of the police, military services, intelligence services,
foreign services and media.
</P>
<P>
The committee would appoint a new independent electoral
commission to review Leostho's electoral system.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho, fully surrounded by South Africa, has been in
political crisis resulted from the allegations from opposition
parties that the May 23 general elections were rigged in favor of
the ruling LCD.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the Lesotho government, South Africa and
Botswana have deployed their troops in the country since
September 22 to help restoring law and order and to support the
legitimate government.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, British Prime Ministers Hold Talks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and
his British counterpart Tony Blair announced plans to establish
a Sino-British comprehensive partnership during their talks here
today.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed that Chinese President Jiang Zemin
will pay a state visit to Britain in the latter half of 1999 at
the invitation of British Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers also announced plans to establish a
Sino-British Forum.
</P>
<P>
Zhu voiced his conviction that Blair's China tour, in which he
is accompanied by dozens of leaders of major British firms, will
forcefully push forward Sino-British cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
To increase Sino-British dialogue, consultation and cooperation
not only conforms to the fundamental interests of the two peoples,
but also benefits world peace, stability and development, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
Sino-British relations have witnessed a new chapter since the
smooth return of Hong Kong, Zhu said, adding that bilateral
cooperation in every area has seen remarkable progress with
frequent exchanges of high-level visits.
</P>
<P>
Five cabinet members of the British government, including the
vice prime minister and foreign minister, have visited China in
turn since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Sino-British economic and trade cooperation has also seen a
steady growth in recent years, with Britain becoming China's
second largest trading partner among European Union (EU) nations,
Zhu noted. Britain has become the EU's largest investor in China
this year, he added.
</P>
<P>
China and Britain are cooperating quite well in the fields of
chemicals, energy, telecommunications, education, culture,
science, technology, military, and sports, Zhu said.

KUALA LUMPUR, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange closed higher Tuesday on strong buying from

<HEADLINE> S. African Car Sales Drop in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- High interest rates in
South Africa are taking heavy toll of new vehicle sales, which
dropped by 27 percent in September this year against last year.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South
Africa (Naamsa) disclosed recently that the total new vehicle
sales, seen as an indicator of the economy's performance, plunged
to their lowest level in the year.
</P>
<P>
Only 22,882 units were sold, down 8,360 units compared to
September last year, the association reported.
</P>
<P>
Naamsa Director Nico Vermeulen said that the slow sales
reflected the effect of the restrictive monetary policy measures
implemented in response to the global financial instability.
</P>
<P>
The uncertain economic outlook and the exceptionally high
interest rate environment would result in continuing tough
conditions in the months ahead, said the Naamsa director.
</P>
<P>
One analyst here predicted that car sales would not recover
until the second quarter next year.

<HEADLINE> Former Tanzanian Minister Returns to Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's former
minister of industries and trade, William Shija, has come
back to political arena after he recaptured the Sengerema
parliamentary seat in a by-election.
</P>
<P>
Shija, a candidate for the ruling party Chama Cha Mapinduzi
(CCM), defeated his major opponent, Fortunatus Masha of the
United Democratic Party (UDP) in the by-election in Sengerema
constituency in the northern region of Mwanza last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports Tuesday, Shija scooped 29,345 votes
against Masha, who won 21,549 votes. Another candidate, Clement
Kamadi of the Civic United Front (CUF), got 789.
</P>
<P>
A total of 52,792 out of 61,156 registered voters cast their
votes in the by-election held on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Shija was ousted from the cabinet in July this year after the
High Court declared that his 1995 general elections results in
the constituency null and void.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Shija won over Masha with 19,917 against 13,080
votes. But Masha accused Shija of having irregularities in the
elections, saying that the latter did not resign his post as the
Mwanza Regional Commissioner before contested in the Sengerema
constituency, and that many polling stations were not opened in
time, making 17,489 registered voters fail to vote.
</P>
<P>
Based on these charges, the High Court unseated Shija who
automatically lost his ministerial post, which is currently held
by the Ilala MP, Iddi Simba.
</P>
<P>
The court also rejected Masha's plea of directly appointing
him as the member of parliament for Sengerema.
</P>
<P>
Following the nullification of the 1995 elections results,
Shija said that he did not intend to appeal against the High
Court judgement and would opt to contest the seat in a
by-election.
</P>
<P>
Shija said that he wanted to give voters in Sengerema a chance
to chose a candidate they wanted. As a result, he won again.
</P>
<P>
The UDP agents refused to sign the results form, apparently
alleging irregularities in the counting in the by-election.

<HEADLINE> Former Philippine First Lady Imelda Acquitted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Supreme Court
Tuesday acquitted former First Lady Imelda Marcos of corruption,
saving her from a 12-year jail term.
</P>
<P>
The ruling also overturned the only case in which Imelda had
been found guilty of graft during her late husband's 20-year rule
of the country.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled 8-5, with one judge abstaining, to acquit the
69-year-old widow of the late president Ferdinand Marcos.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, her motion for reconsideration is granted. Imelda
Marcos is acquitted," the Supreme Court said in its decision.
</P>
<P>
Imelda and her lawyers were not present when the decision was
released by the Supreme Court. But she received a telephone call
informing her of her acquittal.
</P>
<P>
An anti-graft court found Imelda guilty on two corruption
charges in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, a Supreme Court division acquitted her on
one charge but upheld her conviction on the second charge which
carried a maximum prison term of 12 years.
</P>
<P>
According to the charge, Imelda and former transportation
minister Jose Dans illegally entered into five unfavorable
contracts involving a government-run commuter railway and the
private Philippine General Hospital Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Imelda, who has been free on bail, appealed the ruling to the
entire Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
In a 23-page ruling, the Supreme Court said that Imelda did not
personally sign the lease and it was not proven that the lease
price was "grossly and manifestly disadvantageous" to the
government as prosecutors had argued.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court said the anti-graft court also violated rules
of due process in reaching its verdict.
</P>
<P>
"That is the last word on the matter. The Supreme Court has
spoken and that's it," said Francis Garchitorena, the chief judge
of the anti-graft court.
</P>
<P>
Marcos was ousted in a popular revolt in 1986. He fled to
Hawaii, the United States, and died there three years later.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Absent From 2nd European Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkey, for which the
European Conference was conceived as somewhat a consolation for
its not being included in the formal group of the European Union
(EU) membership applicant countries, did not attend on Tuesday the
second such conference.
</P>
<P>
The absence of Turkey indicated that problems still lingered in
the relations between the 15-nation union and the country that is
a long-time aspirant for a union membership and has been for long
a full member of NATO.
</P>
<P>
The EU-Turkey relations went sour after the EU extended
accession invitation last December to Poland, Hungary, the Czech
Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus, and put Bulgaria, Romania,
Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia on hold for later on, leaving but
Turkey out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the EU soon announced the creation of the
European Conference as a soothing compensation for its anguish,
Turkey declined the invitation to attend the inaugural conference
held in March this year in London at the level of heads of state
and government.
</P>
<P>
Matters turned worse for Turkey as the general affairs council
of the EU foreign ministers received Monday an accession progress
report on only the Greek Cypriot part of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers regretted the fact that the European
Commission's analytical examination of the pre-accession screening
could not cover Cyprus as a whole and that the invitation of the
Cyprus government to include representatives of the Turkish
Cypriot community in the negotiations had so far not been taken up.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing held after Monday's general affairs council
meeting, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos did not rule
out the possibility of starting the ministerial level accession
negotiation in November with the partially-represented Cyprus and
of even taking it as such into the fold of the union.

issue, and refrain from transferring the Theater Missile Defense
(TMD) system and related technology and equipment, and selling
advanced weapons to Taiwan, in order to avoid any damage to
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the statement here this afternoon at the beginning of
his regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the 1999 fiscal year National Defense Department
Authorization Act passed recently by the U.S. House of
Representatives and the U.S. Senate, contains some anti-China
clauses, and this act also calls for the integration of Taiwan
into the TMD and a continuation of arms sales to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"This practice wantonly violated the basic norms of
international law and seriously violated the principles set out in
the three joint communiques between China and the U.S.," Zhu
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that if this act becomes law, it will create
obstacles to the improvement and development of
Sino-U.S. relations, and will also be detrimental to the security
and stability of Taiwan and the Asia-Pacific region, stressing
that "the Chinese side hereby expresses a deep concern and strong
opposition to this."

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Fall by Nearly one Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Falls in major stocks,
particularly global media giant News Corp, pushed the Australian

its lowest close since September 11.
</P>
<P>
"Concerns on overseas markets are still lingering and to the
extent that further falls are there, we will fall into line with
them," Jack Moss from Shaw Stockbroking said.

</P>
<P>
The company's exposure to the British economy and a decision to
float just 13 percent of its Fox assets rather than the previously
mooted amount of up to 20 percent were seen as explanations for
the fall.

Among Australia's major banks, Westpac's 21 cent fall to 8.80
Australian dollars and National Australia Bank's 37 cent drop to
19.07 Australian dollars were the major moves.

turnover of 5.6 million shares while Commonwealth added 2.5 cents
to 18.52 Australian dollars.
</P>

strong rise in resources giant BHP offset the gold sector's
reversal of fortune.
</P>
<P>
BHP jumped 28 cents to 11.98 Australian dollars on a view it
had been oversold of late, and the rise again prompted thought the
company had found a new chief after a search of more than six
months.
</P>
<P>
The gold index dropped 37.6 points to 1207.0, losing more than
three quarters of Monday's rise, as the spot bullion price fell

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Denies Amassing Troops on Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Defense Headquarters
has denied Cameroon's allegation that Nigeria is amassing troops
on the disputed Bakassi Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Acting Defense Director of Information Sam Tella said
Monday that Cameroonian Defense Minister Amadou Ali had advised
the country's soldiers "to be on the alert as Nigeria amasses
troops on the disputed peninsula."
</P>
<P>
Tella described Cameroon's allegation as untrue, stressing
that "Nigeria has not and is not contemplating a military
build-up anywhere around Bakassi."
</P>
<P>
"In fact, we see no reason for such action," Nigeria's Daily
Times newspaper Tuesday quoted Tella as saying.
</P>
<P>
He noted Nigeria still believes that the Bakassi issue could
be solved peacefully.
</P>
<P>
According to a Cameroonian newspaper Herald report,
Cameroonian Defense Minister Amadou Ali said that "the Bakassi
Peninsula is so strategic and belongs to Cameroon till the
International Court of Justice proves the contrary."
</P>
<P>
Last month, Nigeria accused Cameroon of amassing troops at the
border and also accused Cameroonian gendarmes of attacking
Nigerian fishing towns in the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the Bakassi Peninsula between Nigeria and
Cameroon has been brought to the International Court of Justice
in a bid to seek a peaceful solution.

<HEADLINE> China's Textile Industry Market to Become Broader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese textile expert
predicts China's demand for textile machinery will increase in two
years when the national drive to cut down outmoded spindles is
complete.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yankai, a ranking official of the China Council for the
Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), said the spindle-cut
move does not mean a decline for the country's textile industry.
</P>
<P>
"The retrenchment in China's textile industry mainly covers the
spinning sector, while other sectors such as weaving, dyeing and
garment-making will maintain a steady growth," Zhang said during a
news conference at the Sixth China International Textile Machinery
Exhibition (CITME) held here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang went on to say that rural enterprises and joint-ventures,
accounting for two-thirds of China's textile industry, will have a
great demand for new textile equipment and techniques.
</P>
<P>
China's textile industry is the largest in the world. However,
it has suffered losses for years because of poor management and
outmoded equipment.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing structural adjustment of the textile industry
constitutes a significant reform of the losing state-owned
enterprises in China, Zhang said, adding that the CITME '98 offers
a good chance to revitalize China's textile industry and upgrade
the technology of Chinese enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The CITME '98 will be held at the International Exhibition
Center in Beijing from October 13 to 17. It will be the largest
textile machinery exhibition ever held in China and the fourth
largest in the world, Zhang noted.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 manufacturers from 22 countries and regions will
attend the exhibition, including state delegations from major
textile machinery manufacturing countries including Germany, Japan
and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Chinese manufacturers will make up one-quarter of all
participants and their products represent the highest quality in
China.

<HEADLINE> World Habitat Day Observed in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Tuesday pledged to continue rehabilitating the capital
city's slum areas to turn them into a suitable place to live in.
</P>
<P>
"One way of doing this is to build simple apartment buildings,"
Habibie said in observance of World Habitat Day 1998 as he opened
a seminar on housing at the State Palace here.
</P>
<P>
"This effort should involve not only the government but the
private sector and the people as well, because without them, it
would be difficult to create a comfortable and peaceful city for
us to live in," the president added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that improving the city's physical appearance needs
expertise and urban planning.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's cities naturally evolved from villages into small,
medium and big ones, he said.
</P>
<P>
Because there was no urban planning, the village turned into a
crowded city, he said, adding that improving such kind of place
would cost a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that rehabilitation is a must.
</P>
<P>
Citing a 1985 United Nations resolution, Habibie also reminded
of the need to increase the people's awareness of preserving their
environment.
</P>
<P>
In his address, State Minister for Housing and Settlement Theo
L. Sambuaga said his ministry is planning to build 100,000 units
of simple and very simple houses this fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> 10 Banking Institutions in Malaysia to Be Recapitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Ten more banking
institutions in Malaysia will undertake recapitalization exercise
in a bid to enhance their resilience, Danamodal Nasional Bhd
announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Danamodal, set up on August 10 for bank recapitalization in the
country, signed Tuesday conditional agreements with the
institutions -- Arab-Malaysian Bank, Arab-Malaysian Finance,
Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank, MBf Finance, BSN Commercial Bank,
Oriental Bank, United Merchant Finance, Perdana Merchant Bankers,
Sabah Bank and Utama Merchant Bank Bhd, its Managing Director
Mohamad Daud Hj Dol Moin announced in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Based on preliminary estimates, Danamodal was expected to
invest about 3.3 billion ringgit (about 868.421 million U.S.
dollars) in the institutions, Mohamad Daud said, adding the
investment may be in the form of various capital instruments,
including but not limited to equity, debt or a hybrid of equity
and debt.
</P>
<P>
He said the injection of fresh capital would help the
institutions to refocus on intermediation activities and the
recapitalization of these 10 institutions is a pre-emptive move to
enhance the resilience of the institutions which are basically
sound.
</P>
<P>
The recapitalization of Malaysia's banking system is a key
recommendation in the National Economic Recovery Plan recently
released by the National Economic Action Council which is of the
view that recapitalization, rather than intermittent regulatory
interventions, will restore public confidence in the safety and
soundness of the banking system.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Economy Projected to Shrink 1.8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Economic Planning Agency
(EPA) revised Tuesday its initial projection of 1.9 percent growth
for the country's economy in fiscal 1998 to an inflation-adjusted
1.8 percent contraction, the biggest shrinkage on record.
</P>
<P>
The contraction, tallied on gross domestic product (GDP), or
the total value of goods and services produced in the country,
would mark two straight years of negative growth for the first
time since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a showdown for the Japanese economy's
regeneration from the second half of fiscal 1998 through fiscal
1999," EPA chief Taichi Sakaiya told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The EPA's latest projection for fiscal 1998, through March
1999, is roughly in line with others of the kind by private
economists that reflect the current economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese economy should be able to post positive growth in
the next fiscal year," if various stimulus plans are fully
executed, the top government economic planner predicted.
</P>
<P>
The latest revision of the economic-growth projection, the
ninth downward since fiscal 1959, uses latest available data.
</P>
<P>
Slack domestic demand contributes minus 2.4 percentage points
to the projected 1.8 percent contraction, including minus 0.5
point from consumer spending, minus 0.5 point from housing
investment and minus 1.8 points from corporate capital spending.
</P>
<P>
External demand contributes plus 0.6 point, while government
outlays contribute plus 0.6 point.
</P>
<P>
The latest revision assumes no more collapses of major
financial institutions, no major global financial turmoil and an
exchange rate of 142 yen to one U.S. dollar, the average of the
past two months.
</P>
<P>
The EPA forecast personal consumption will slide an
inflation-adjusted 0.9 percent instead of the initially projected
2.5 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
The agency said corporate capital spending will likely shrink
an inflation-adjusted 10.1 percent, the biggest fall since fiscal
1993, when it dropped by 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate in fiscal 1998 is projected to surge to 4.2
percent, a new record since the end of World War II. The jobless
rate was initially envisaged at 3.3 percent for the fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Says October War Paves Way for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 6 (Xinhua) -- On the 25th anniversary of the
1973 October War against Israel Tuesday, Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak termed the Egyptian victory in the war as a gateway to
peace.
</P>
<P>
"The October War was, undoubtedly, a bright mark in Egypt's
military history, it was not a war for the sake of war, but a war
to pave the path for peace," Mubarak said in an interview with
Good Morning Egypt television Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian army launched a surprise attack on October 6, 1973 and
crossed the Suez Canal into the Israeli-occupied Sinai
peninsular. Israel captured the peninsular in the 1967 Middle East
War.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians were later pushed back, but the Arab hailed the
crossing as a victory that avenged the shame of the 1967 defeat.
</P>
<P>
Egyptians believe the rebuilding of Arab pride form the war led
to peace with Israel six years later, when Egypt signed the Camp
David peace accord with Israel, becoming the first Arab country to
make peace with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Egypt recovered all of its occupied Sinai lands in exchange for
living in peace with the northeastern neighbor while some Arab
lands still remain occupied by Israel, Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
But Mubarak used the war anniversary to criticize Israel in a
series of interviews, terming what he called Israel's growing
arsenal as a cause of concern in the Mideast, stressing the need
to render the region free of weapons of mass destruction and
maintain a balance of power.
</P>
<P>
"This is the greatest guarantee to peace in the region," he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua ) -- As the official newspaper of
the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, the People's Daily
will accelerate its reform, hoping to become more popular among
Chinese readers.
</P>
<P>
"In a time of heated media competition, the People's Daily must
become more reader-oriented, while maintaining its authority as a
Party newspaper," said the paper's president Shao Huaze here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the People's Daily is expanding its retail network
nationwide, and readers will be able to buy it at newsstands in
all of China's major cities.
</P>
<P>
Shao said the paper will increase on-the-spot reporting,
focusing on timely information instead of the more boring
conference coverage.
</P>
<P>
The president also revealed that the paper will soon introduce
a new column monitoring government activities at different
levels. Also, the People's Daily's columns Theories Seminar and
Letters to the Editor will offer more space for reader discussions.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the People's Daily,
which ranks sixth among the ten most influential newspapers
worldwide, according to a 1993 UNESCO evaluation.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily has long been an authoritative newspaper in
the eyes of Chinese readers, having delved deeply into social
realities during the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, during the Cultural Revolution, the People's
Daily was manipulated by the "Gang of Four," a group of political
conspirators who used the paper as their propaganda tool.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily played an important role in the 1980s,
calling for the redress of many cases mishandled during the
Cultural Revolution and clarifying several theoretic
controversies, thus regaining a steady rise in circulation.

noted Yu Youxian, director of the Press and Publications
Administration.
</P>
<P>
The number of Chinese newspapers has now reached more than
2,000, compared with about 100 in 1978, and the current
circulation of the People's Daily is about 3 million daily.
</P>
<P>
Currently, most of the People's Daily income comes from
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
Shao stressed that the paper is prepared to fair compete with
other news outlets such as the Xinhua News Agency and China
Central TV Station.
</P>
<P>
News reform is underway in China's mass media at all levels in
response to the market economy, and in the hope of attracting a
wider audience with a new and less formal style.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, Chinese newspapers will have formed some
conglomerates and some of these will join in the international
news competition, according to a Press and Publications
Administration plan.
</P>
<P>
Shao went on to say that the People's Daily as a party organ
will not fully depend on the market, because the paper's most
important characteristic is its incomparable authoritativeness.
</P>
<P>
After 20 years of reform and opening up, a versatile newspaper
network, with the party organ at the core, is coming into being in
China, and this will have a significant impact on the social
development of China in the 21st century, according to Yu Guoming.

<HEADLINE> Buddhist Monks in Famous Tibetan Temple Win Victory Over Rats (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Buddhists are taught not to kill
any living creature. Yet monks at the famed Jokhang Temple in the
Tibet Autonomous Region have waged a protracted crusade against
rats in the past four years that has resulted in annihilating
thousand upon thousand of rodents.
</P>
<P>
"Rats bite power lines, Tangkas (traditional Tibetan paintings)
and sutra scriptures," said Lhaba Lama who is in charge of
security work at the 1,300-year-old temple in Lhasa, the Tibetan
autonomous regional capital. "They drag Hada (silk ribbons) and
jump up and down among the oil lamps, often causing fires."
</P>
<P>
"The rodents even climbed onto the statue of Sakyamuni and bit
a hole into his face and took away one of his ears," said Kecu
Qingpa, 72, with obvious resentment." They gnaw bits of gold from
the statues and carry them to caves."
</P>
<P>
The Jokhang Temple was first built by Songtsan Gambo, the
chieftain of the Tubo Dynasty, when he married Princess Wencheng
of the Tang Dynasty in the year 641. The holy statue of Sakyamuni
was said to be brought by the princess from Chang'an, capital of
the Tang Dynasty. It is now under first-class state protection for
cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
The widely held religious belief in Tibet of not killing any
living thing turned Lhasa into a paradise for pests like rats and
flies, and rich and sumptuous tributes in the temples attracted
and fed a large number of rats,
</P>
<P>
The rodents were often seen strolling in temples during the day
or walking side by side playfully with monks in the middle of
rituals and ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
When residents in Lhasa were aroused to wipe out rats in the
early 1990's, the creatures took shelter in temples in growing
numbers, and their annoying presence finally made the monks
resolved to get rid of them.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Banks Tighten Control of Foreign Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese banks have as of
Tuesday bought foreign currencies on "managing and keeping"
accounts of economic organizations that are supposed to sell
foreign currencies to banks in case the latter do not obey the
obligation, Vietnam News Agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This measure, aimed at tightening the control of foreign
currencies, was taken in line with a government decision on
economic organizations' obligations to sell and their right to buy
foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
Under the decision, the economic organizations have been
allowed to use current outstanding balances in their accounts for
the settlement of due transactions.
</P>
<P>
If their outstanding balances are not sufficient for
transactions, they are permitted to pay for the rest by available
foreign currencies in their "managing and keeping" accounts.
</P>
<P>
They are entitled to sell foreign currencies in "managing and
keeping" accounts to other banks after submitting signed foreign
currency trading contracts.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Pardons 2,300 Prisoners for War Celebrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 6 (Xinhua) -- As part of the celebrations
marking Egypt's victory in the 1973 war against Israel, 2,300
prisoners have been released on parole on a presidential decree,
the Egyptian Gazette reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
President Hosni Mubarak has ordered the parole to the prisoners
who have served half of their sentence and demonstrated good
behavior, discipline and commitment to the prison rules.
</P>
<P>
Political prisoners will not, however, be freed. Prisoners who
committed violent crimes and arms smuggling were also excluded
from the amnesty.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily newspaper quoted an official source
of Prison Department of the Interior Ministry as confirming that
fortunate prisoners would directly be sent to their families.
</P>
<P>
Leniency has been usually granted to prisoners on important
national or religious occasions in Egypt. This time is the 25th
anniversary of the October 6 war, when the Egyptian armed forces
took Israeli forces by surprise and crossed the Suez Canal, which
Israel had held since capturing Egypt's Sinai peninsula in the
1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians were later pushed back, but Arab's first and
initial victory erased the shame of the 1967 defeat and allowed
Egypt to move toward peace with the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Relatives to Visit Jordanian Prisoners in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel has allowed relatives of 14
of the Jordanian prisoners held in Israel to visit the inmates,
the semi-official Jordan Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Minister of Information Nasir Judeh as saying
that every prisoner's family can send two members to the Ashkelon
prison on October 20.
</P>
<P>
The visit was arranged by the Jordanian Embassy to Israel, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's consul to Israel will come back to accompany the
relatives to Israel, Judeh said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, having a peace treaty signed with Israel in 1994,
enjoys the closest relationship with the Jewish state in the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the treaty, Israel has released 20
Jordanian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Jordanian Ambassador to Israel Omar Rifai said
that in addition to the 14 Jordanians in the Ashkelon prison,
there are more Jordanians being held in Israeli jails for criminal
offenses. But he did not give the exact figures.

<TEXT>
<P>
At first, monks at the Jokhang Temple did not kill the rats,
but simply caught them by placing meat in large and deep boxes and
then set them free outside the temple.
</P>
<P>
However, this method proved futile, said Lhaba Lama. The rats
would return soon after and continue to make trouble, eating
tributes and damaging Buddhist statues.
</P>
<P>
"We had to take their lives since they kept harming the
temple," said Dainba Cuse, deputy director of the Temple
administration committee.
</P>
<P>
A consensus was soon reached and rat poison was spread in
places most frequented by the rodents. More than 1,000 rats were
killed in 1995 alone, the first year of the four-year campaign.
</P>
<P>
The dead rats were put into sandbags, and before burying them
the monks chanted sutras, praying they would not be born as rats
in their next lives.
</P>
<P>
The monks finally won a victory over the rats -- only six or
seven were found poisoned in the temple this year.
</P>
<P>
"Killing rats does not directly contradict our doctrine of not
killing any living creatures," said Kecu Qingpa. "We are doing the
killing for the sake of our temple and in the interest of thousand
upon thousand of our followers or worshippers, as well as for the
protection of invaluable cultural relics."
</P>
<P>
"Killing rats should be on no account regarded as a big sin,"
said the old lama.

<HEADLINE> Road Construction Investment to Reach One-Billion Yuan Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- China will invest one-billion
yuan (120.48 million U.S. dollars) per day on average to build
highways in the remaining months of this year, the Ministry of
Communications has announced.
</P>
<P>
The 180-billion-yuan (21.69 billion U.S. dollars) target for
1998 road construction is only half complete, and the pace of
highway-building must be speeded up, an official said.
</P>
<P>
The last quarter of this year will see a historic peak for
highway construction in China, as the country is set to add 33,000
kilometers of highways in 1998, including 1,560 kilometers of
expressways and 7,947 kilometers of high-grade roads, all
historic highs.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's highest governing body,
recently added another 20 billion yuan (2.41 billion U.S. dollars) to
road construction investment, which had already risen to 160
billion yuan (19.28 billion U.S. dollars) from the initial figure
of 120 billion yuan (14.46 billion U.S. dollars) early this year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Communications has called for consolidated
efforts to build major national highways, upgrade road networks,
improve rural road conditions, repair flood-ravaged roads in the
valleys of the Yangtze, Nenjiang, and Songhua rivers, and
begin the construction of 20-billion-yuan (2.41 billion
U.S. dollars) worth of new projects.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has vowed to ensure high-quality road
construction in spite of the arduous task.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini Tuesday called for a unified European Union (EU) policy on
aid to countries often as origins of illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
Addressing in Luxembourg a meeting of EU foreign ministers,
Dini urged the regional bloc's 15 member states to work out a
joint response to the swelling tide of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
"At least a part of the development aid should be directed
towards projects which can help limit the flow of immigration
across the Mediterranean," he said.
</P>
<P>
Preferential treatment should be granted to the countries who
"have shown a greater awareness of the importance of regulating
the phenomenon," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The EU should also consider "specific support for countries
most affected by the need to protect the union's external
borders," Dini said, short of giving details whether the support
in his mind was of finance or of any other nature.
</P>
<P>
He said determined, joint action by the 15 members was as
important for the immigrants themselves as it was for the EU.
</P>
<P>
Dini also gave a report on Italy's extensive efforts over the
last year to stem the influx of immigrants into Europe via its
long coastline.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Arrives on Thursday to Reduce Iran-Afghan Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Secretary General's
Special Envoy on Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi arrives here Thursday
on the second leg of his visit to the region to try to reduce
prevailing tension between Afghanistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi will hold talks with Pakistani officials on Friday.
During his week-long stay here, he is also scheduled to meet Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif and Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz, the
Associated Press of Pakistan reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The visit is aimed at further strengthening the U.N. efforts
towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The decision to send Brahimi to the region after the Six Plus
Two (Afghanistan's six immediate neighbors plus the U.S. and
Russia) meeting held in New York last week called for renewed U.N.
efforts to broker peace in the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, China,
Russia and the U.S. agreed at the meeting that the U.N. should
send its representatives to address the Afghan conflict in a
peaceful manner.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, who has also been to the region earlier as part of his
mission to restore peace in the conflict-torn country, comes at a
time when Tehran has threatened to take military action against
the ruling Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban now control over 95 percent of Afghanistan and the
international community has called for a broad-based government in
Kabul.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Sets Deadline for Illegal Foreign Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Foreign workers without valid
permits in Jordan have been given two weeks to one month's time to
correct their status, or to leave.
</P>
<P>
The country's on-going campaign to regulate the foreign labor
market since last Wednesday target those "who entered the country
as visitors or tourists but remain in the country for work," the
semi-official Jordan Times Tuesday quoted Minister of Information
Nasir Judeh as saying.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Interior Nayef Al Qadi said the Iraqis will be
accorded special treatment in the campaign for a humane point of
view because of the difficult situation in their country.
</P>
<P>
Qadi added that the government is determined to regulate the
foreign labor market, because there are "frightening numbers" of
foreigners in the kingdom who add to the current economic
difficulties and increase the unemployment rate among the
Jordanians to some 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
Up to 1 million foreigners now stay in Jordan, the bulk of whom
are Egyptians, Syrians and Iraqis, said Qadi.
</P>
<P>
Only 62,000 of them have residence permits and work permits
and many more are working illegally, he added.
</P>
<P>
Police have rounded up hundreds of Asian workers to check their
status during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Similar actions on the Arab workers in Jordan will be carried
out later.
</P>
<P>
The non-Jordanian workers are easy to find jobs as employers
often pay them low wages and do not have to undertake their
insurance.

LUSAKA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambia exported 5,500 tons of
horticultural products in 1997, earning for the country 40
million U.S. Dollars, according to the Zambia Export Growers
Association (ZEGA).
</P>
<P>
The weekly Financial Mail published Tuesday quoted ZEGA Chief
Executive Mable Mandela as saying recently that "This year, the
volume of exports is expected to rise further as acreage has
expanded by over 30 percent for the current 1998/1999 export
season."
</P>
<P>
"So we are talking about 52 million Dollars which translates
to 104 billion Kwacha," she said.
</P>
<P>
The sector is also a provider of employment to approximately
800 Zambians in the season.
</P>
<P>
The association together with eight other horticultural trade
associations from five African countries agreed last month to
constitute a steering committee with a view to harmonizing trade
codes in the region and ultimately opening more export doors for
the sub-continent.

HAIKOU, October 6 ( Xinhua ) -- Some 10,000 people are
now surfing the Internet in Hainan Province, accounting for 0.14
percent of the province's population, a proportion higher than
the country's average.

Considering that 80 percent of the province's people are rural

<HEADLINE> Syria to Allow Army Commander to Run for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Syria, a power broker in Lebanon,
has thrown its weight behind Lebanese army commander Emile Lahoud
as Lebanon's next president.
</P>
<P>
At a marathon eight-hour summit in Damascus on Monday, Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad and his Lebanese counterpart Elias Hrawi
agreed to amend the third clause of Article 49 of the Lebanese
constitution to allow the army commander to formally run for the
post, the Daily Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The clause stipulates that the country's first-rank civil
servants wishing to stand in a presidential election should quit
their current posts two years in advance of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz, the outgoing president's
son-in-law has publicly confirmed the scenario which was leaked to
the press shortly after Hrawi's return to Beirut.
</P>
<P>
"The president will propose very soon an amendment of Article
49 involving only the clause that bans first-rank civil servant,"
Boueiz told reporters after meeting with Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the 68-year-old incumbent president, who will
end his nine-year term by October 24, is expected to propose the
amendment at the next cabinet meeting scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet will endorse the proposal and then refer to the
parliament which, if it ratifys the bill, will vote for the
country's 11th president since its independence in 1943.
</P>
<P>
Syria, with 35,000 troops deployed in Lebanon as peacekeepers,
is regarded as the king-maker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud, 62, a close ally of Syria, was appointed as the
country's army commander in November, 1989, on the eve of the end
of the country's 15-year-old sectarian civil war.
</P>
<P>
He has gained popular support from Lebanese, including most of
politicians, due to his landmark achievements in rebuilding the
country's army into a cohesive fighting machine after its tragic
disintegration during the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Many people believe that he is a reform-minded leader and will
introduce drastic changes into political life which is described
by the country's opposition as full of corruption.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Banks Assets Shoot Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Combined resources of banks in
the Philippines reached 2.84 trillion pesos (71 billion U.S.
dollars) in the first half of this year, outpacing the whole 1997
record of 2.82 trillion pesos (70.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Data released Tuesday by the central bank showed that the
increase in the assets was due to the rise in the number of
commercial bank branches in the country.
</P>
<P>
The data showed that the commercial banks' branches rose from
3,411 in December 31, 1997 to 3,491 in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of commercial banks grew to a total of
41, contrary to central bank governor Gabriel Singson's earlier
statement that there were 54 commercial banks, including 14
foreign bank branches in the country.
</P>
<P>
Deeply concerned about the overcrowding of local branches, the
central bank has frozen new applications for opening branches in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges Syria-Turkey Dialog Over Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez
Tarawneh has urged Turkey and Syria to exercise restraint and
settle their disputes by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Continuous dialog is the only way for them to defuse their
tension, Tarawneh said upon his return from the United States late
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
"There is time to discuss the root of all problems" and the
crisis is expected to be over soon, he said.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Jordan will spare no efforts to help them
conduct dialog and maintain stability and security of the whole
region, Tarawneh said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's military officials said last week that their country
is in a state of undeclared war with Syria due to Damascus'
alleged support for Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of sheltering PKK rebels, which
have been fighting since 1984 for autonomy for the Kurdish
minority in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Syria denied the charges, but accused Turkey of forming
military alliance with Israel that threaten Arab security and
undermine Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Tensions built up after Turkey massed troops along the Syrian
border to conduct military exercises. Turkey claimed that it is
ready to use force against Syria if diplomacy fails.
</P>
<P>
It is widely deemed that Jordan is facing difficult situation
on this issue because it enjoys close military and political ties
with Turkey while having strained relations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria, one of the Arab states that have territorial disputes
with Israel, opposes Jordan's making peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan are the only two Arab countries that signed
peace treaties with Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Assembly of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Monday adopted a resolution on the
Kosovo issue, saying it backed the government's related position.
</P>
<P>
The resolution attributed the Kosovo crisis to the separatist
motives of the Kosovo ethnic Albanians, who want to break away
from the Yugoslav Federation, Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav armed forces have taken measures of "needed depth and
scope" to curb "criminal activities" of the ethnic Albanians and
"terrorist gangs" in Kosovo, the resolution said, giving full
affirmation of the efforts in this regard by the Yugoslav armed
forces and Serbia's Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The assembly strongly condemned countries which offered "Kosovo
Albanian gangs" training bases, money and weapons, and criticized
Albania by name for doing so.
</P>
<P>
The assembly noted that the Yugoslav Federation has halted
activities in Kosovo, pulling its troops back to their base, and
opening all parts of Kosovo to humanitarian groups, journalists
and diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Such measures have created conditions necessary for dialogue
with Kosovo Albanian leaders, the assembly said, adding it has
fully met the requirements under the U.N. Security Council
resolution on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
The assembly supported the Federal government's stand on the
Kosovo issue and called on the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to make a fact-finding trip to the
troubled Serbian province.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Take Action Against Garment Quota Manipulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
take stern action against garment quota manipulation in a bid to
achieve export target despite the devastating floods, media
reports here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The action will be taken against the backdrop that certain
dishonest people are manipulating the quota to the United States
and the GSP (Generalized System of Preferences) in the European
Union, the reports quoted sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The garment export target of 5.83 billion U.S. dollars for the
July 1998-June 1999 fiscal year could be exceeded if some
pragmatic steps are taken, Commerce and Industries Minister Tofael
Ahmed observed at a high-level meeting Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the fifth Five-Year Plan, the garment export for 1998-99
was originally set at 5.63 billion dollars, and it was re-fixed
upward after some non-traditional items were included in the
export list.
</P>
<P>
The government will closely monitor the entire system to check
manipulation and protect the interests of the real exporters,
Ahmed told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The garment sector, which has been growing at an annual rate of
over 20 percent over the past few years, is the country's largest
foreign exchange earner.
</P>
<P>
There are about 2,500 garment factories in the country with
around 1.3 million workers in the sector. Exports of garments
stood 2.845 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 55.09 percent of
the total export earnings of 5.16 billion dollars in the previous
fiscal year ending on June 30, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Asia's First Test-Tube Triplets Thriving in Guizhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Asia's first test-tube triplets
are growing up healthily in China's southwestern Guizhou Province
as they begin their education at a local kindergarten this fall.
</P>
<P>
The three test-tube girls, named Zhang Jingjing, Zhang Xinxin
and Zhang Sensen, were born in a Beijing hospital on January 30,
1995. Their father and mother belong to China's ancient ethnic
Gelo and Tujia groups.
</P>
<P>
Their parents had no child seven years after their marriage,
and their mother, Tang Huixian, became infertile after an
operation excising her tubal fimbria because of three ectopic
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
With the help of professor Zhang Lizhu, considered the mother
of China's test-tube babies, Tang managed to give birth to her
test-tube triplets.
</P>
<P>
Their parents said the three sisters have all been healthy and
have seldom needed to go to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
The triplets have different characteristics, but all three have
IQs higher than those of most children their age. They could recite
ancient poems of the Tang Dynasty (618-907) when they were only 18
months old, their parents said, adding that now they can recite 15
popular Tang Dynasty poems.
</P>
<P>
Since the first test-tube baby was born in 1978 in Britain, the
world has seen some 200,000 test-tube children, over 500 in China.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Killed in Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were
killed and six others wounded in a roadside bomb attack by
Hezbollah guerillas in southern Lebanon Monday afternoon, Israel
Radio reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A number of bombs were detonated one after another as a convoy
of four Israeli military vehicles were driving in the eastern
sector of the so-called "security zone," the reports said. Two
vehicles were hit in the explosions, apparently detonated by
remote control.
</P>
<P>
The deaths have brought to 14 the number of the Israelis who
were killed in southern Lebanon since the beginning of the
year. Dozens have been wounded.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, whose guerrillas are fighting to oust Israeli
troops from a 1,200-kilometer border zone set up by Israel in
southern Lebanon in 1985, has claimed responsibility for the
attack Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army has been looking for ways to deal with the
renewed use of roadside bombs by Hezbollah guerillas in the
security zone. In late August, three Israelis -- two soldiers and
one civilian working for the army -- were killed by bombs in less
than 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Israel is seeking to withdraw from southern Lebanon on
condition that the Lebanese government makes necessary security
arrangement, but Lebanon and its main ally Syria have rejected
the Israeli offer, insisting that the U.N. Resolution 425 calls
for "unconditional withdrawal."

<HEADLINE> Star Shining Over Oasis in Northwestern Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-seven-year-old Erna Grimm
of Switzerland never imagined that teaching English at the Hotan
Oasis in the Taklimakan Desert would make her so popular among the
local Uygur people.
</P>
<P>
"We all know the foreigner. She is a star here. Many people
are following her to learn English, and she can speak Uygur
well, too," a taxi driver told a Xinhua reporter on the way to
Erna's home.
</P>
<P>
Erna is now the only foreigner at the Hotan Oasis on the
ancient Silk Road through the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, as
a wave of English-learning sweeps over the oasis.
</P>
<P>
The oasis is considered one of the poorest areas in China, and
has long been isolated from the modern information society. Nearly
98 percent of the local residents are Uygurs.
</P>
<P>
Erna now teaches English at a local teacher-training school,
the highest academic institution in the locality. She can speak
and teach in Uygur. However Erna can be easily distinguished from
local women because of her blonde hair and foreign accent.
</P>
<P>
Erna was granted bachelor's degree in the Uygur language in
1994 after five years of study at a teacher-training college in
Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
She went back to Switzerland after graduation, but returned to
Xinjiang in 1996 after a year back home. She then started teaching
English at her present school, where she conducts 17 lessons a
week.
</P>
<P>
In her spare time, many people gather at her house to learn
English, including civil servants, middle-school students, nurses,
businesspeople and even housewives.
</P>
<P>
"I learned Arabic before coming to China, so I planned to work
in an Arab country after graduation. But considering the low
social status of Arabian women, I changed my mind," Erna said.
</P>
<P>
Erna came to Xinjiang in 1989, where the Uygur language has
existed for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
In her eyes, the once-isolated oasis is changing due to the
country's market-oriented economic reform and opening-up. In
recent years, more and more overseas tourists are flooding into
the oasis, a "lonely island in the desert."
</P>
<P>
On both sides of the local streets advertising signs with
English words can been seen occasionally, along with Chinese and
Uygur characters.
</P>
<P>
Erna was given a beautiful Uygur name, Ayinur, which means
"moonlight." She is now teaching herself Chinese, and is
able to speak a little with her Chinese neighbors.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope that what she will help the local
farmers appreciate the importance of schooling for their children.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the day will come when local people overcome the
desert and shirk off poverty, and they will become well off soon,"
Erna said.

ZHENGZHOU, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan
Province, the nation's leading wheat producer, is busy preparing
to plant winter wheat.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to raise its summer grain output in 1999 to
23 billion kg, with wheat yields accounting for the bulk of total
output. Henan wheat currently accounts for more than 17 percent of
the total wheat output in China.
</P>
<P>
Local agricultural departments have stockpiled some 510 million
kg of wheat seed strains, 5.65 million tons of chemical
fertilizers, 220 million cu.m. of farmyard manure and 15,000 tons
of pesticides. Prices for related materials have dropped to the
lowest levels in a number of years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Henan has introduced a unified seed distribution
system and is currently going all out to spread intensive
cultivation and interplanting techniques in order to further raise
output.
</P>
<P>
Some 3.49 million farmers in the province have attended
short-term training courses covering new techniques.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Provincial Silk Producers Threatened By Restaurant Patrons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Shandong Province, one of
China's leading silk producers, is faced with diminishing silk
output because the silkworm chrysalis is being favored by more
and more local eaters.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Morning Post today blamed this newly developed
taste for silkworms in the coastal province as one of the reasons
for its declining silk trade.
</P>
<P>
Shandong used to be known as one of the top three silk
producers in China, but since the beginning of the 1980s more and
more locals, benefiting from the economic boom, have begun to
demand the flavor of silkworms, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Currently, restaurateurs are paying 14 yuan for one kilo
of silkworm cocoons, while silk companies pay only six to eight
yuan a kilo, said the newspaper.

HARBIN, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province has pledged to complete during the winter-spring period
the repair of all water-control projects destroyed by torrential
rains and summer flooding.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has mobilized 3 million people to drain
water from farmlands, dig silt, and rebuild damaged water-control
projects. Leading officials at all levels have gone to the
construction sites to organize this province-wide campaign.
</P>
<P>
According to local authorities, floods washed out 637 levee
sections with a total length of 1,988 kilometers, 124 large and
medium-sized reservoirs, and 45,300 pumping wells, causing direct
economic losses estimated at 2.4 billion yuan.
</P>

Taiyang Island, a noted scenic spot in the provincial capital
of Harbin, reopened recently following renovation after being

<HEADLINE> Jordan: Progress of Peace Process Expected Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 6 (Xinhua) -- United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's visit to the region is expected to bring
tangible progress to the long-stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks, said Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh here late
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
"It is expected that the mission will be followed by meetings
between the two sides (the Palestinians and Israel) in Washington
during this month to finalize an agreement and start serious work
for negotiating the final status (issues)," said the prime
minister upon his return from the U.S..
</P>
<P>
There are great expectations that the agreement about Israeli
troops withdrawal from the occupied West Bank will be achieved
between the Palestinians and Israel in the coming days, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there is a sense of optimism that things have
reached "a mature stage" not only on the Israeli troops
withdrawal, but on a host of other issues, he said, while not
elaborating in details.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, Albright's visit will "put the peace process in
a better framework," he added.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister started his visit to the U.S. last Friday
and later met Albright and King Hussein, who is there to treat his
cancer.
</P>
<P>
His meetings with the two leaders focused on the latest
developments of the peace process on the Palestinian-Israeli
track, said Tarawneh.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been deadlocked
since March last year, due to the Jewish settlement expansion in
Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. earlier this year put forward a proposal, which calls
for Israel to withdraw from 13.1 percent of the occupied West
Bank. The current mediation efforts have been focusing on the
proposal.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Cotton Producer Lowers Purchasing Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, the nation's major cotton producer, recently
lowered cotton prices in response to slack domestic and foreign
demand.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang, which currently produces 25 percent of China's cotton
output, has suffered from sluggish cotton sales due to oversupply
on the market in recent years.
</P>
<P>
This year's cotton output is projected at 1.2 million tons,
up substantially due a 10 percent increase in land dedicated to
cotton.
</P>
<P>
The local government cut cotton prices by 10 percent on 1997
levels and has adopted various other measures to increase cotton
sales. The Agricultural Development Bank also granted credit loans
totalling 5.5 billion yuan (660 million dollars) to facilitate
cotton purchases.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Turkey Terms Syria Center of Terrorism in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz has said that Syria is the center of terrorism in the
Middle East and it shelters all the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the Turkish private Star TV late Monday night,
Yilmaz said that Syria is the country that not only shelters the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), but also many other
terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of harboring the PKK, who has
been fighting since 1984 for autonomy for the Kurdish minority in
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The PKK frequently wages cross-border raids on Turkey from its
camps in Iraq, Iran and Syria, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which sent 10,000 troops late last week into northern
Iraq to wipe out the Kurdish bases there, has threatened to use
force to destroy the Kurdish bases within Syrian borders.
</P>
<P>
It has also recently massed heavy troops along the border with
Syria to conduct military exercises, which fueled the tensions
between the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, asking Syria to extradite the heads of the PKK
organization for trial, said that since 1980s, Syria has
sheltered PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan and provided training camps
on its territory.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which has denied the charges, accused Turkey, in return,
of forming military alliance with Israel to target against the
Arab world, especially Syria, and betray the interests of the
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a predominantly Muslim but politically secular country,
has been criticized by many of the Arab states for forming a
military alliance with Israel, which is regarded as a threat the
regional security.

BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey reveals that
young people with higher educations but low salaries comprise the
majority of readers of literary works, according to today's
Shanghai-based Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by People's Literature, one of the
country's leading literary magazines.
</P>
<P>
The result shows that 56 percent of these readers are between
16 and 29 years of age, and most have higher degrees or have
completed high school.
</P>
<P>
The majority are salary earners whose monthly incomes is below
700 yuan (about 84 U.S. dollars). They seem to have more spare
time than businesspeople, but they lack the money to buy all the
books they would like.
</P>
<P>
When asked why they like works of literature, 82 percent of the
respondents said they believe good literary works are artistic
treats, while another 14.7 percent expressed the wish to follow
topics of general interest by reading novels.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that novels describing the bitterness and
happiness of common people in their daily lives are most popular
among readers.

Recent statistics for Beijing, the Chinese capital, show that
the 16.5 tons of dust deposited per kilometer during 1997
represented a drop of 4.5 tons on the 1986 level.
</P>
<P>
Today's People's Daily (overseas edition) reported that Beijing
has experienced an average of only 3.8 dusty days annually since
the mid-1990s, down dramatically from 20.5 days in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Silt accumulating in the Miyun Reservoir, the capital's
main source of water located in northeastern part of the city, has
dropped by 60 percent on levels common in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The afforestation project, approved by the State Council in
1986, calls for planting trees and sowing grass over 3.73 million
hectares around Beijing and Tianjin by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Related projects were completed on 1.87 million hectares in
1997, according to the State Administration of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
A Xinhua News Agency story released in late 1970s described
Beijing as a windy and dusty "gray and yellow" city. "The sky in
the middle of the day is often as dark as at dusk," said the
story, adding that "strong winds and blowing dust often prevent
people from opening their eyes."
</P>
<P>
Experts affirmed the notable achievements of the afforestation
project. However, they stressed that the Beijing and Tianjin area
has a fragile ecosystem and called for greater afforestation
efforts.

ZHENGZHOU, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Generating units with a total
installed capacity of close to 2.08 million kw will go on stream
this year in central China's Henan Province to fuel the current
efforts on the fulfillment of the province's nine-percent economic
growth target for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Investments in medium-sized and large power projects during
1998 will exceed four billion yuan, according to the provincial

<P>
Power shortage continues to affect over five million people in
the province and great efforts are needed to develop the power
industry in rural areas, a company executive said.
</P>
<P>
The province added 4.21 million kw. to its generating capacity
between 1990-1995, with the total capacity hitting 10.07 million
kw at the end of 1995. Another one million kw was added to
generating units by the end July this year, helping lay a solid
foundation for fulfilling the year's target of economic growth.

investment for the period between 1996-2000 will hit than 77
billion yuan, with the total generating capacity expected to grow

<HEADLINE> Chinese Painter Wants Every Country To Know Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese painter plans to have
the whole world become familiar with his work in several years.
</P>
<P>
Xu Dongdong, 39, announced here today that he will donate an
album of his paintings to every major library and museum
throughout the world to help eliminate Western indifference to
Chinese art.
</P>
<P>
"Some thousands of years ago China developed its fine arts,
which are unique and superb. But the world still does not fully
appreciate its beauty," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu, well-versed in Chinese traditional and water-ink painting,
has been awarded the title of the First Grade Painter of the State.
</P>
<P>
He said that European and American works occupy the most
eye-catching places in museums, while Chinese works are usually
displayed in the corners.
</P>
<P>
Xu has spent his savings printing the albums of his work, and
has already donated them to the top 500 libraries in the world,
some of which have accepted his paintings.
</P>
<P>
Xu has received support from the Chinese government for this
effort. "What Xu is doing is of great significance, and these
international cultural exchanges will help the world understand
China better," said Sun Jiazheng, China's cultural minister.
</P>
<P>
Xu's plan has already aroused public attention.
</P>
<P>
"He is one of a few painters who are taking actions to
challenge the dignity of Western academia, and this reflects the
fact that with the growth of the Chinese economy, more people are
hoping that Chinese culture will be appreciated by the
world," said Chen Wei, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Vows to End Capital Controls With Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Tuesday committed
itself to ending capital controls on condition that greater
discipline is enforced on the international currency market.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to ending capital controls, but only if the
world financial community instills greater discipline into the
international currency market," Malaysian Special Functions
Minister Tun Daim Zainuddin said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has introduced capital control "as a means of
insulating ourselves from the chaotic international currency
markets and predatory speculators," Daim, who is also the
executive director of the National Economic Action Council (NEAC),
said at the opening of the National Congress on Economic Recovery:
The Way Forward" here.
</P>
<P>
But the regime of controls that Malaysia has adopted is
"selective" and "The exchange control measures do not hinder
long-term foreign investment in the economy, it is the movement of
massive short-term capital that we seek to control," Daim said.
</P>
<P>
"Our capital control measures may be controversial and could
have negative implications in our sovereign profile, but lower
credit rating must surely be less damaging to the economy than the
risk of tailspin effects from a high interest rates strategy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Defending the measures, Daim said Malaysia's attempt to control
capital flows has surely stirred international debate and world
opinion now "favors a new financial architecture to govern capital
flows."
</P>
<P>
He said the selected exchange controls introduced to insulate
the domestic economy from the global financial crisis provided the
economy some breathing room to recover.
</P>
<P>
They allowed the government to ease interest rates and raise
domestic demand without destabilizing the ringgit, the country's
currency, further, he said, adding, "Foreign exchange stability is
crucial for us to implement the other policy reforms including
bank and corporate restructuring."
</P>
<P>
The new exchange rate of 3.8 ringgit to the U.S. dollar lowers
the cost of imported capital goods by nearly 10 percent and it
also reduces the cost of servicing foreign debt not only for the
government but also for the private sector, Daim said.
</P>
<P>
Daim noted that more experts were saying Malaysia did the right
thing in introducing new exchange control and economic measures
recently to defend the ringgit against speculation and stimulate
the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that ensuring sufficient liquidity in the economy forms
a crucial piece of the government's policy package for recovery.
</P>
<P>
For the economic recovery, Daim said, Malaysia needs some 60
billion ringgit (15.879 billion U.S. dollars) between now and the
year 2000 to finance economic recovery plan recommendations.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the amount is too much for the federal
government to bear alone and thus a variety of funding sources
have been identified, mostly local institutions.
</P>
<P>
Daim expressed his confidence that although the current slow
growth is expected to prevail until next year given the continued
sluggishness in the region, Malaysia's economy would recover in
early 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Assembly of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Monday adopted a resolution on the
Kosovo issue, saying it backed the government's related position.
</P>
<P>
The resolution attributed the Kosovo crisis to the separatist
motives of the Kosovo ethnic Albanians, who want Serbia to break
away from the Yugoslav Federation, Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav armed forces have taken measures of "needed depth and
scope" to curb "criminal activities" of the ethnic Albanians and
"terrorist gangs" in Kosovo, the resolution said, giving full
affirmation of the efforts in this regard by the Yugoslav armed
forces and Serbia's Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The assembly strongly condemned countries which offered "Kosovo
Albanian gangs" training bases, money and weapons, and criticized
Albania by name for doing so.
</P>
<P>
The assembly noted that the Yugoslav Federation has halted
activities in Kosovo, pulling its troops back to their bases, and
opening all parts of Kosovo to humanitarian groups, journalists
and diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Such measures have created conditions necessary for dialogue
with Kosovo Albanian leaders, the assembly said, adding it has
fully met the requirements under the U.N. Security Council
resolution on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
The assembly supported the Federal government's stand on the
Kosovo issue and called on the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to make a fact-finding trip to the
troubled Serbian province.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Implements Agri-Rehabilitation Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
been implementing agricultural rehabilitation programs in phases
providing support to 1 million families of poor, landless and
marginal farmers in the districts severely-affected by the recent
floods.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural rehabilitation programs involving 346.4
million taka (about 7.37 million U.S. dollars) will continue up to
December, and more programs in the form of development projects
are in the offing, The Independent daily Tuesday quoted official
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the first phase, the Department of Agricultural Extension
had distributed 52 tons of rice seeds free of charge among the
affected farmers. The Agriculture Ministry has also taken up the
first rehabilitation program to produce rice seedlings in
government farms for free distribution among the farmers.
</P>
<P>
The second rehabilitation program, at a cost of 81.2 million
taka (about 1.73 million dollars) was initiated in August to
support the farmers by providing them with seeds, fertilizer and
some cash.
</P>
<P>
In view of the huge damage caused by the flood, the government
has come forward with the third rehabilitation program involving
121.9 million taka (about 2.6 million dollars), under which, the
Agriculture Ministry has started distributing cash to the farmers
for procuring fertilizer, equipment and seeds for winter crops
like wheat, maize, pulses and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The fourth program involving 142.5 million taka (about 3.03
million dollars) would start soon to extend support to more
deserving farmers in the affected districts.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a number of development projects involving 3.12
billion taka (about 66.4 million dollars) have also been planned
for the agricultural sector to produce more food.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, international organizations and bilateral donors
have come forward with assistance to the tune of 100 million taka
( 2.13 million dollars) for agricultural rehabilitation in the
affected areas.
</P>
<P>
The 10-week-long floods had destroyed crops on 580,000 hectares
of land in the country's 52 severely-affected districts, causing a
loss of about 40 billion taka (about 851.1 million dollars), while
farmers lost 3.5 million tons of crops including 2 million tons of
rice, according to the Department of Agricultural Extension.

<HEADLINE> Re-Elected Cardoso to Face up to Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President
Fernando Cardoso has won re-election according to initial results
received Monday, and it is anticipated he will have to deal with
more challenges in the second term to battle the nation's
worsening economy.
</P>
<P>
With 51.47 percent of the ballots counted, the 67-year-old
president garnered more votes than all his rivals together,
winning the election without requiring a second round.
</P>
<P>
Brazilians went to the polls on Sunday to elect their
President, governor, legislators, and state legislators. A total
of 27 state governorships, all the 513 seats in the lower house of
Congress, and one third of the seats in the Senate (27), and all
27 seats in the state assemblies were disputed.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso's second four-year term, which will start on January 1,
1999, is going to have a clear "human focus," the president's
advisors said, adding there will be ambitious projects to boost
the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso promised to invest 110 billion U.S. dollars in the
construction of harbors and telecommunication infrastructure so as
to create favorable conditions for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
As for exports, the re-elected president plans to seek an
increase from the current level of 52.9 billion dollars to 100
billion by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
He guaranteed that he would wipe out the current 7.8 percent
unemployment, which is affecting 5.7 million Brazilians out of the
economically active population of 70.3 million.
</P>
<P>
Also under reform plans are social health and education
systems. Cardoso will enlarge the health system to cover 80
million people, and the new education system will benefit 2.7
million youths and guarantee elementary schooling for 98 percent
of all the children in Brazil.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Britain, China Should Work Closely Together: Blair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, who arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a five-day official
visit, said that Britain and China should "work closely and
effectively together."
</P>
<P>
In an article written specially for China's People's Daily,
Blair noted that he is going to Beijing at a time when relations
between the two countries "have never been better."
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily Tuesday carried translated excerpts of the
article.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong's successful transition has opened the
door to a new partnership between Britain and China and that "the
pessimists have been proved wrong" as Hong Kong continues to be
one of the world's leading commercial and financial centers.
</P>
<P>
Citing trade ties as the base for Britain's strongest bilateral
relations, he said the two countries are "already cooperating more
closely, on more issues, than ever before."
</P>
<P>
British trade with China increased by 15 percent in 1997 and
Britain is Europe's leading investor in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a group of senior British business executives in
his delegation, Blair said they "personify the rapidly expanding
commercial relationship" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned other aspects of the bilateral relations,
including growing cultural links and new partnership in sport.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister listed several appeals his country
holds, ranging from its commercial advantages to London's flair
for the cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
He said he wanted to build a "modern relationship" with China
and to consolidate a partnership which "looks forward, not back."
</P>
<P>
On the Hong Kong issue, he said that the "one country, two
systems" concept is now a reality and that Hong Kong has become a
"bridge" between the countries rather than a barrier that divides
them.
</P>
<P>
In his capacity of chairman of the Group of Eight Western
countries, Blair expressed welcome for Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji's advice on handling the global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He lauded China's "responsible and coherent economic policies,
particularly regarding its determination not to devalue the
Renminbi," China's currency.
</P>
<P>
Describing China as "one of the great economies of the 21st
century," Blair said it will increasingly be called upon to share
the responsibilities of international leadership.
</P>
<P>
He urged cooperation on a wide range of issues: from terrorism
to nuclear proliferation; from international crime to global
poverty; from climate change to drugs.
</P>
<P>
Blair also acknowledged "very different backgrounds and
traditions" of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He wrote of the need to discuss the human rights issue, noting
that "persuasion and dialogue achieve more than confrontation and
empty rhetoric."
</P>
<P>
He cited the peace process in Northern Ireland as an example to
prove that "there are no differences so great that they cannot be
overcome."
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister called on the two countries to
tackle the challenges of the present together in order to forge a
new partnership for the future.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that, with China's support, the
international community can face the challenges of globalization.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of
the China/UK Joint Statement issued here today:
</P>
<P>
The Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of
China, Mr. Zhu Rongji, and the Prime Minister of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Mr. Tony Blair,
held talks in Beijing on October 6, 1998. They exchanged views on
bilateral relations and international issues of common concern in
a friendly atmosphere and issued the following joint statement:
</P>
<P>
China and the United Kingdom, as permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council, share extensive international interests and
responsibilities. The two countries will step up cooperation both
bilaterally and multinationally including within the framework of
the UN for the maintenance of world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The two Governments welcome the positive development of
bilateral relations during recent years, and particularly since
the successful handover in Hong Kong. Both sides consider that the
time is right for the opening of a new chapter in relations
between China and the United Kingdom. They agree to expand
political, economic, cultural and technological links. In this
context, it is agreed that President Jiang Zemin should pay a
State Visit to the UK at the invitation of Her Majesty Queen
Elizabeth II in the second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The two sides note that the Joint Declaration of 1984 and the
successful handover in Hong Kong in 1997 were historic
achievements. The peaceful resolution of the question of Hong Kong
is something in which the people of both countries, and especially
the people of Hong Kong, can take pride. Both sides reiterate that
the implementation of the Joint Declaration and the principles of
"one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people administering Hong
Kong" and a high degree of autonomy will ensure the maintenance of
the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The two sides note that growing economic ties and trade between
China and the UK are not only of mutual benefit, but also serve to
enhance overall cooperation and understanding. They agree on the
need to put new energy into the bilateral economic relationship
and trade through enhanced business promotion activities and
improved market access, matching the skills and needs of the two
economies. They agree to take positive measures to expand
bilateral trade and investment. They note with satisfaction both
the launch of the restyled China Britain Business Council and the
continued high level of UK investment in China.
</P>
<P>
Both sides reaffirm their commitment to continue working for
China's entry to the World Trade Organization on terms which will
reinforce the world trade system and on the principle of balancing
rights and obligations. Both sides agree to explore options for
practical cooperation in support of this.
</P>
<P>
The two sides note the growing global interdependence of
national economies and financial structures. In this context, they
will strengthen the China/UK Financial Dialog, conduct regular
exchanges on strategic economic and financial issues and foster
wider regional and global discussion of these issues, with the aim
of ensuring a stable environment for development.

<TEXT>
<P>
While recognizing that the social and economic context in the
two countries is different, both sides are committed to meeting
the continuing challenges of modernization. Through an expanding
program of development cooperation, they will strengthen
cooperation between the two countries in the following areas: the
development and restructuring of State-owned enterprises; the
provision of training and small business creation for unemployed
workers; the provision of financial sector training, including in
the field of regulation; poverty elimination and promotion of
development of the interior provinces.
</P>
<P>
Both sides note the vital importance of protecting the
environment at the national and global levels and, in particular,
addressing the issue of climate change. They agree that the
developed countries have a responsibility to set an example in
this area. At the same time, it is noted with appreciation that
China is intensifying efforts to address the environmental
challenges it faces. China and the UK also share concerns about
more local environmental issues, particularly in relation to water
resources.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agree to strengthen environmental cooperation. This
will embrace practical cooperation, including scientific exchanges
as well as informal dialog. Both sides agree that the UK should
work particularly closely with China as a Partner country. Future
China/UK cooperation on the environment will build on the
Memorandum of Understanding signed in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will strengthen and expand their
political/military dialog. In addition to annual senior official
level talks, they will pursue a program of senior military visits,
including ministerial-level exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Both sides welcome the development of practical exchanges
between police forces in China and in the UK, which have served to
promote the interests of justice and to protect the victims of
crime. China and the UK will work to strengthen cooperation aimed
at tackling international crime.
</P>
<P>
The two sides note with satisfaction the growing range and
volume of contacts between the Chinese and British people. They
will work to increase the number of focused parliamentary,
academic, scientific and professional exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Both sides believe that the China/UK Forum, launched by the two
Heads of Governments, will play an important part in providing a
clear focus for non-Governmental high level contacts between China
and the UK and ensuring that the development of such contacts
contributes positively to the overall bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
Both sides note that cultural and artistic contacts will help
to strengthen understanding and awareness between China and the UK
and to provide a positive atmosphere for bilateral
cooperation. They welcome the Britain in China initiative as a
means of promoting cultural as well as commercial activities. They
will explore options and ways to further expand the
above-mentioned exchanges and cooperation in both countries. They
welcome the China/UK sports authorities' protocol providing for
practical cooperation. They note the value of sporting links in
building bridges between the two countries, and particularly
between their young people.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Internet Users to Double by 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Mexico will have two million
Internet users by the end of 1999, coupled with a growth in
electronic commerce and a great potential need for
Internet-related professionals.
</P>
<P>
Given the fact that one million people are connected to the
Internet in Mexico now, the number will grow five-fold by the year
2003, said Eduardo Adame Goddard, chief executive officer (CEO) of
the Tecnofin company, citing market studies.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the state news agency Notimex, Adame said
that there is "an enormous potential" for Internet expansion and
there will be a great need for highly qualified professionals.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that trade through the Internet will result in a
change in labor structure. For instance, he noted, stores
connected with the Internet need less sellers and more stage coach
services.
</P>
<P>
He said that currently there are some 300 companies in Mexico
that have links or promotion programs with the Internet, and new
web sites offering products and services appear everyday.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that the number of jobs created by the
Internet is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
With the dynamic expansion of the Internet, Adame said that
there will be readjustments in labor market soon just as in other
sectors around the world.
</P>
<P>
Mexican entrepreneurs will face major challenges because
foreign products are advertised through the Internet, he said.

<HEADLINE> Half of Romanian Gypsies are Illiterate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half the Gypsy
population in Romania cannot read or write, according to a report
issued Monday by the Ministry of National Education in Romania.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that only 4.5 percent of Romania's Gypsies
finish their high school education, while 44 percent of the male
Gypsy population and 59 percent of the female population of the
country receive no education at all.
</P>
<P>
At least one in two Gypsy children between the ages of 7-10 is
away from school and most of the gypsy children in their
pre-school years do not go to kindergarten, the report shows.
</P>
<P>
Gypsies tops the birth rate of Romania's ethnic peoples,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The Gypsies do not pay much attention to education for their
children, sociologists point out, while public discrimination
against Gypsies is another reason that keeps Gypsy children away
from school.
</P>
<P>
Romania has the largest Gypsy population in European
countries. A 1992 national census shows that Gypsies number
410,000 and make up 1.8 percent of Romania's total population.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Panel Votes to Open Clinton Impeachment Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Judiciary Committee of
the U.S. House of Representatives Monday approved opening an
impeachment inquiry into President Bill Clinton stemming from his
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry, approved on a 21-16 party-line vote, would be the
third in U.S. history and the first since President Richard
Nixon's Watergate scandal in 1974.
</P>
<P>
The full 435-member House has yet to approve the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
The resolution approved by the Judiciary Committee would allow
a broad, open-ended investigation of Clinton that could be
expanded to include Whitewater land deal, campaign fund-raising
abuses and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday Republicans had rejected a Democratic proposal
to limit the length and scope of the inquiry, confining the probe
to the Lewinsky matter and concluding it by late November.
</P>
<P>
A vote by the full House is expected later this week, before
Congress adjourns for the year and members scatter to campaign for
the November 3 mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
During the Judiciary Committee debate earlier Monday, the
Republicans' top investigator alleged 15 potential impeachable
offenses by Clinton, four more than independent counsel Kenneth
Starr had cited in his report to Congress last month.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's traditional
export earnings dropped 11 percent in the first eight months over
a year earlier despite a 13.3 percent growth in export tonnage.
</P>

During the period, the department said, oil shipments rose by
21.7 percent, ferro-nickel by 12 percent and coal by 7.2

Non-traditional exports, except gold and emeralds, posted a 4.3

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Minister Criticized for Denial of Rapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
again come under fire as Minister of Defense and Security Wiranto
denied that scores of women were raped during the mid-May riots in
the country, the Jakarta Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of a government-sponsored fact-finding team
investigating the riots, Marzuki Darusman, on Monday slammed the
latest denial as "premature."
</P>
<P>
It was also a "shock," he said, given an earlier consensus that
officials would no longer issue such statements ahead of the
team's October 23 report deadline.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki was asked to comment on Wiranto's statement during a
news conference on the Armed Forces (ABRI)'s 53rd anniversary on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto, who is also commander of the Armed Forces, had said,
"The government and ABRI have made various efforts to find the
victims of the rapes reported to have taken place during the May
13 to May 15 unrest. These efforts have not yielded results. ABRI
has also not obtained concrete and convincing replies, data or
proof from parties that have claimed to possess important
information."
</P>
<P>
Wiranto made a similar statement in September along with other
senior officials, including the national police chief and the head
of the state intelligence agency, to the protest of human rights
groups.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki reiterated that a preliminary report, including data on
the rape cases, had been given to ABRI two weeks ago. There was a
consensus that sexual violence had occurred during the May riots
and that the government would no longer issue denials.
</P>
<P>
He said the denial may have been made because the ABRI
leadership might have felt frustrated for failing to successfully
reach out to victims, mostly Chinese-Indonesians, to verify
reported cases. But this should not have led them to conclude that
no rapes had taken place.
</P>
<P>
"I want to emphasize again that the rapes did occur. Now we are
investigating their magnitude," Marzuki said.
</P>
<P>
The government established the Joint Fact-Finding Team in July
to investigate reports that the May 13-15 riots were masterminded.
More than 1,200 people were killed and thousands of buildings and
vehicles damaged during the riots in Jakarta and other cities.
</P>
<P>
Activists have reported that 168 women were gang-raped or
otherwise sexually assaulted during the riots and 20 of them died
or committed suicide.

least three weeks to sign players, make trades and hold
abbreviated training camps. So unless a deal can be completed a
few days after the sides reconvene, there appears to be no way
the season can start on time.
</P>
<P>
The owners offered a new proposal 10 days ago to the players.
But the players union said the core issue of the dispute remained
unchanged in the 16-page proposal.
</P>
<P>
"Our proposals would result in an average player salary of
more than 3.1 million dollars and a minimum salary for 10-year
veterans of 50,000 dollars," said Granik Monday. "Unfortunately,
the union leadership has been unwilling to give any serious
consideration to what we have offered."
</P>
<P>
The union plans to send players to about a dozen arenas
tomorrow to try to gain public support for their position.
</P>
<P>
Both sides are waiting a ruling from arbitrator John Feerick
on the union's grievance over whether players with guaranteed
contracts should be paid during the lockout. Feerick's decision
could come at any time before October 19.

<HEADLINE> Chain Store Giant in China's Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Seven years ago, the people of
Shanghai didn't think much of the future of chain stores and
several went bankrupt in a very short period of time. But all that
has changed.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now has about 1,000 of them, and the Lianhua
Supermarket Corporation was a pioneer. It is a giant in the chain
store business, one that changed the fate of chain stores.
</P>
<P>
Lianhua was set up by the Shanghai Trade Corporation in May
1991, and succeeded with the first chain store in the Quyang
Residential District, mainly by providing daily use items.
</P>
<P>
By 1994, it had a dozen shops. It did encounter a few problems
but refused to give up, and instead improved management by
introducing computers and expanding the range of goods from
daily-use articles to fresh food and better vegetables.
</P>
<P>
It also set up 13 joint ventures and opened a large supermarket
with the French company Carrefour.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, Lianhua's capital had grown from 1.2
million yuan to 190 million yuan, with its sales revenue reaching
2.4 billion yuan that year.
</P>
<P>
It now has stores in more than 30 cities in neighboring
Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Loses Battle to Keep Record Private </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson tried to keep his
psychological reports from being made public, but the former
heavyweight boxing champion lost his fight on Monday in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
A judge rejected a request for a stay pending an appeal to the
Nevada Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Tyson was left with only an option of a direct appeal to the
Supreme Court. That would almost certainly delay a tentative
October 19 hearing in which Tyson will try to regain his boxing
license.
</P>
<P>
Tyson is eager to gain his license because he wants to earn
money from the fight this year. So an early hearing date is very
important for Tyson.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't look real good for them for an appeal to the
Supreme court so they just might have to face the music and
release the reports," said Kirk Hendrick, a deputy attorney
general for the Nevada Athletic Commission.
</P>
<P>
Tyson adviser Shelly Finkel said today he believes the report
from doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston will be
good enough to show Tyson if fit to fight.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's anything to hide," Finkel said. "But if
you were going to go through five days of questioning from
psychiatrists, I don't think you would want all your answers made
public."
</P>
<P>
Nevada commissioners have said they want at least four working
days to review the reports before the hearing.

The Sydney Morning Herald:

The Age:
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Strengthened Financial Architecture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Monday called for a strengthened worldwide financial structure
to handle emerging financial troubles and prevent global recession.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting here with world financial officials,
Clinton pledged that the United States would contribute money to
help replenish the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) coffers.
He also urged Japan to move quickly to address the current global
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Every leading industrial economy has a role to play, including
the United States, by providing full support for IMF funding,
while Japan can also help by moving quickly to address its
economic and financial challenges," Clinton said at the start of a
Group of 22 meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Group includes the Group of Seven (G-7) leading industrial
nations as well as key emerging market countries and regions.
There were originally 22 economies in the group, but four more
joined this year.
</P>
<P>
The Monday evening meeting, attended by finance ministers and
central bank governors and other high-level financial officials,
was convened by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. It coincided with the IMF-World
Bank annual meeting in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Discussions were held among the G-7 and IMF Interim Committee
and other world financial bodies during the weekend, focusing on
the worsening financial turmoil in Asia, Russia and Latin
America. There was little progress in formulating major steps to
end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
For the U.S., the Clinton administration has to work hard to
win from the Republican-dominated Congress an approval for 18
billion U.S. dollars in money for the IMF.
</P>
<P>
"We must ensure that the international financial architecture
is prepared for the new challenges of our time, especially the
challenge of building a system that will lessen and manage the
risks in the global market to allow countries to reap the benefits
of free flowing capital in a way that is safe and sustainable,"
Clinton told the officials.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president is also scheduled to address the opening
session of the IMF-World Bank meetings on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Supports Debt Relief for Poorest Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Sweden plans to support a
special initiative of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
the World Bank to make debt relief available to the poorest
countries in the world, the Swedish Foreign Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision, announced at the annual meeting of the IMF and
the World Bank now underway in Washington, means that Sweden will
make a second contribution amounting to 125 million Swedish kronor
(15.7 million U.S. dollars) to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Debt Initiative.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, Sweden decided to set aside 445 million
Swedish kronor (55.9 million dollars) for debt relief and budget
support in seven poor and heavily indebted countries -- Bolivia,
Cape Verde, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Tanzania, Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 40 of the world's poorest countries may be
considered for the debt relief under the HIPC initiative, which
was launched two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Technics Brings Prosperity to Tibetan Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Tibetan farmers continue to
exhibit ever greater confidence in the use of technology to battle
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Dawatserin, a farmer from Tingri County in Xigaze Prefecture,
the Tibet Autonomous Region, once invited Lamas to
chant sutras to protect against devastating hail and insect
infestations. Today, however, Dawatserin realizes that
technology provides answers to most related problems.
</P>
<P>
Technological applications helped raise the grain output on
Dawatserin's two hectares from less than 10,000 kg in previous
years to over 12,500 kg. in 1997, with his net income for the year
surpassing 12,000 yuan (1,400 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Local officials note that Tibetans continue to maintain strong
faith in their religion. However, they also point out that more
farmers are relying on science and technology to solve problems.
</P>
<P>
The local government has adopted a series of measures to
promote the use of advanced farming techniques, and offers
training courses for some 80,000 farmers each year. The effort has
also included the establishment of a group of pilot villages and
households focusing on the use of scientific and technological
findings.

JAKARTA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The number of poor families in
Indonesia last month increased to 17.9 million from 17.5 million
in August, Antara News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the number of poor families was based on 23

food, assistant to the coordinating minister for people's welfare
and poverty eradication A. Mongid said.
</P>
<P>
To promote the poor families' welfare, the government has
provided them with a working capital of 20,000 to 320,000 rupiah
(32 U.S. dollars) to run a business of their own, he said.
</P>

Newcastle lost to defending champions Arsenal at Highbury on

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations Monday urged Iraq to respond quickly to its
call and resume cooperation with the United Nations arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the council was briefed by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on his recent contacts with Iraq's
Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Annan held two rounds of talks with Aziz last week. But no
results were yielded. The third round of talks between them will
take place Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Aziz has been here for a week, during which time he consulted
with Annan and members of the Security Council on what a new
comprehensive review of Iraq's relations with the United Nations
would contain. Aziz is not expected to make a decision on whether
to rescind Iraq's ban on most U.N. arms inspections until he
leaves New York and speaks to Iraq's President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced suspension of cooperation with the United
Nations arms inspectors in early August. Security Council decided
to suspend its regular review on U.N. sanctions against Iraq until
it resumes cooperation with the United Nations. The council
offered a comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
relevant resolutions once it resumes cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- English Premier soccer club
Newcastle United chairman Freddie Shepherd has given advise to
manager Ruud Gullit he can sell players before he can bring any
new stars to St James' Park.
</P>
<P>
Gullit was angry after seeing his team lost to Arsenal 3-0 on
Sunday and told his board of directors they desperately need to
hand over the cash if he is to turn around his side's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
"This just shows we need to buy new players, and that's why
Newcastle hired me. They know I can get them," said Gullit.
</P>
<P>
"In fact I already know the players I want. It is like I have
them in the fridge ready to come out. I just hope I have the
money to buy them - but only the board can answer that.
</P>
<P>
"I hope I won't have to sell too many players to get new ones.
I don't really want to do that. But we need something new and I
have already been knocking on the board's door about this," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But Shepherd highlighted the size of the playing staff and
refused to declare how much Gullit has to spend.
</P>
<P>
"There are no spare lockers left at St James' Park and there's
no room left on the team bus.
</P>
<P>
"We never talk about how much we have to spend or how much we
do not have to spend. But what we will say is that we will give
Ruud Gullit every support we can," the chairman added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Panel Defeats Democrats' Alternative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Republicans on the U.S.House
of Representatives Judiciary Committee Monday voted down a
Democratic attempt to limit the time and scope of any impeachment
inquiry of President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The committee on a party-line vote of 21-16 rejected the
Democratic effort and moved toward passage of a Republican
proposal for a wide-ranging, open-ended impeachment inquiry into
the president's actions.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats' alternative would have limited the scope of the
impeachment inquiry only to any wrongdoings Clinton may have
committed in his affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
It also asked for early hearings on what would be standards for
impeachment. It called for a timetable whereby the committee would
complete its impeachment work by November 17 and the entire House
would vote by November 25.
</P>
<P>
But Republicans argued such restrictions would be an invitation
for delay and said there was no precedent for them in previous
impeachment inquiries.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic alternative was the first vote in a day-long
hearing looking into the first possible presidential impeachment
inquiry since Watergate in 1974.

<HEADLINE> World Bank-IMF Joint Committee Endorses Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Development Committee of
the World Bank and the IMF Monday agreed on a concerted strategy
for restoring sustainable growth and reversing the dramatic
increase in poverty in the crisis-stricken East Asia.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued following the 58th meeting of the joint
committee of the two world financial institutions highlighted some
key elements of the strategy which includes maintenance and
acceleration of progress on structural reforms, including
governance structures required for the efficient working of
markets and restructuring of the banking system and corporate
sectors and, in the short term, restoration of credit to viable
businesses.
</P>
<P>
The strategy also includes mobilization of necessary resources
to finance growth, regeneration of demand as well as protection of
the environment.
</P>
<P>
"Crucial to all these elements is a focus on social concerns
and the need to mitigate the most harmful effects of the crisis on
the poor," the document stressed.
</P>
<P>
The ministers attending the meeting recognized that the
economic and social aftershocks of the crisis were "more severe
than earlier anticipated." The crisis had now "spread beyond
Indonesia, (South) Korea, Thailand and Malaysia, and its global
ramifications had increased the vulnerability of all countries,"
the communique noted.
</P>
<P>
If the situation was allowed to continued, "financial turmoil
could result in major setbacks to the global economy, and
particularly to the progress most developing countries had
achieved in the 1990," the ministers warned.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the committee agreed that actions were needed to
help restore confidence and prevent contagion in the event of
market pressure. Emerging market countries should strengthen their
policies and institutions at an early stage to minimize their
vulnerability to adverse shifts in investment sentiment.
Meanwhile, industrial countries should take early and decisive
actions to help regain or maintain growth momentum and global
financial stability. "All countries should continue the process of
market opening and resist protectionism. All countries and the
international financial institutions need to attach high priority
to the promotion of good governance and the elimination of
corruption," the communique underlined.
</P>
<P>
The ministers were encouraged by the progress made in carrying
out the Debt Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries during
the initiative's first two years. It was noted that nine countries
have so far reached the decision point, and total commitments to
the seven requiring assistance under the initiative amount to some
6.1 billion U.S. dollars in nominal debt service relief, or 3.1
billion dollars in net present value terms.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government Monday

</P>
<P>
The project aims to reduce malaria menace among communities
involved in large-scale agricultural activities, tourism and
textile manufacturing around Lake Victoria and the coastal
region, said chief of the African Medical and Research Foundation
(AMREF) John Batten at the launching ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"This will b?f;hachieved through strengthening industry, local
institutions and building communities' capacity to prevent and
control malaria," Batten told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Britain will play a critical role in the project with a
donation of about 1.4 million U.S. Dollars through the Department
of International Development, the private sector and local
communities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Health Minister Jackson Kalweo, who presided over the
launching ceremony, said an estimated 26,000 Kenyan children died
of malaria very year, which translates to 72 deaths daily.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Voters Start Registration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigerians throughout the country
started registering as voters Monday for elections that will end
military rule in the most populous African nation in May next
year.
</P>
<P>
In registration centers visited by our reporter in Lagos,
Nigeria's commercial center and largest city, no long queues were
sighted but people keep coming to register for the elections.
</P>
<P>
An automobile mechanic, however, said he will not register
because he is not interested in the vote.
</P>
<P>
The Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) has advertized on
major national media, urging people to register and support "this
patriotic task."
</P>
<P>
"This is golden opportunity for all of us to realize our long
cherished yearning for democratic governance," the advertizement
said.
</P>
<P>
The INEC has increased the number of registration centers and
polling stations from 75,000 in the last exercise to 111,430 this
time.
</P>
<P>
It will also create more electoral wards to bring ballot boxes
closer to voters.
</P>
<P>
The exercise will take two weeks.
</P>
<P>
About 56 million people out of Nigeria's 104 million
population were registered as voters during the transition to
civil rule program of late military leader General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Abacha was set to transform himself into a civilian president
in a election with himself as the sole candidate of the four
political parties registered by his government, before he died of
heart disease suddenly in June.
</P>
<P>
General Abdulsalam Abubakar, former Chief of Defense Staff was
chosen by the armed forces to lead the West African country.
</P>
<P>
Since June when he took office, Abubakar has taken bold
measures in both political and economic fronts that won him
backing by Nigerians and Western nations, who have offered to
ease and lift sanctions imposed on Nigeria during the Abacha
time.
</P>
<P>
In his efforts of national reconciliation, he had freed all
political detainees and held wide dialog with opposition groups
as well as exiled dissidents.
</P>
<P>
He also announced massive privatization program in an effort
to revitalize Nigeria's ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
And most of all, he scrapped Abacha's discredited transition
program, including the parties registered by the former leader.
</P>
<P>
He announced a new transition program that will return Nigeria
to civilian rule by May 29, 1999. He declared publicly that he
will not contend and will retire from the armed forces at the end
of transition program.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has witnessed eight military leaders since
independence from British rule in 1960, with only two civilian
presidents.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's last successful presidential election was held in
1979. The election on June 12, 1993 was deemed to be free and
fair but was annulled by the then military leader of General
Ibrahim Babangida.

<HEADLINE> World Habitat Day Marked with Focus on Safer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan called Monday, the World Habitat Day, for international
efforts against urban crimes to build up safer cities.
</P>
<P>
"Urban violence around the world is estimated to have nearly
doubled in the last 20 years," Annan said in a message issued by
the Nairobi-based U.N. Center for Human Settlements (Habitat).
</P>
<P>
"Cities do seem to be breeding grounds for a wide range of
lawless acts," Annan said, citing unemployment, easy availability
of guns, worsening urban environments, the huge gap between the
rich and the poor and a breakdown of traditional value systems as
among major factors behind the rampant city crimes.
</P>
<P>
"I urge all (U.N.) member states, local governments and
citizens of cities around the world to mark Habitat Day his year
by taking action to make their cities and communities safer and
better places to live in," Annan said in his message.
</P>
<P>
Habitat chief Claus Topfer Monday urged local governments
worldwide to find ways to help communities tackle problems that
determine community safety and result in crime, according to a
report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"Local governments have to promote personal security and
reduce fear by improving police services, making them more
accountable to the communities they serve, and by encouraging the
formation of community-based crime prevention measures and
systems," he was quoted as saying.

<P>
MAPUTO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- About 200 people saw the film
"Chinese Wedding Customs" Monday afternoon, indicating the start
of the Chinese Film Festival in the country.
</P>
<P>
About 10 films, featuring the life style in China's Tibet
region, and the picturesque scenery of the Three Gorges etc. are
to be showed during the film festival, which is co-sponsored by
the Chinese Embassy in Mozambique and the Mozambican Association
for Friendship with Foreign Countries.
</P>
<P>
Shao Guanfu, Chinese Ambassador to Mozambique said at the
opening ceremony of the film festival, that he was very glad at

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Teachers Start Strike, Clash with Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of teachers
started strike Monday in confrontation with the police across
Kenya in a desperate bid to press the government to implement its
pledges of teachers' pay rise.
</P>
<P>
The 250,000-strong Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT),
which called the strike -- their third in a year, said that all
its 5,000 members in the capital participated in the strike
today.
</P>
<P>
"So far the strike has been very successful... The schools are
not operating," said Mureu Kamau, chief of KNUT's Nairobi branch.
</P>
<P>
Anti-riot police quelled a demonstration of some 1,000
teachers taking to streets in downtown Nairobi on the day. At
least five people were said to have been detained.
</P>
<P>
College students also protested in support of the teachers.
Some 500 students blocked a main road 30 kilometers west of
Nairobi with fires, stoning passing motorists and the police. The
latter responded with tear-gas and rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
In Migori District, southwestern Kenya, scores of teachers
were injured and one policeman was badly beaten in violent
clashes, Kenya News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The strike by teachers at public schools also affected the
operation of private schools. Sources told Xinhua that more than
half of the pupils were absent at Nairobi's private schools which
had canceled all scheduled extra curricula due to the strike.
</P>
<P>
Striking teachers demonstrated outside private schools,
causing disturbances among the pupils there. Local analysts
predicted that the situation will be tenser in the coming couple
of days.
</P>
<P>
In the Braeburn Primary School, one of the leading private
schools in Nairobi, the teachers have asked parents to take their
children in and out of school themselves instead of using school
commuters.
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Joseph Ngutu charged in a statement Monday that
the striking teachers were in breach of a no-strike agreement,
warning that they "must take full responsibility for their
actions."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Assistant Minister in the Office of the President
Simon Kiptum Choge also warned that all striking teachers will be
sacked.
</P>
<P>
"If teachers insist on taking the government head-on, they
will end up the losers," he said.
</P>
<P>
In response, KNUT officials vowed to "stay on strike" until
the government carry out the second phase of a 150-200 pay rise
deal it agreed on in July last year.
</P>
<P>
At least 21 opposition members of parliament have openly
supported the strike.
</P>
<P>
Teachers' salaries range from 2,700 Shillings to 29,000
Shillings (45 to 480 U.S. Dollars) a month, relatively higher
than most other civil servants in this east African country. The
government said the economy at present cannot afford to meet the
demands of the teachers.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Market Stable, Trading Well: Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong market is now
stable and trading well thanks to a "surgical incursion" for 10
trading days in August, a senior official from the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (KHSAR) of China said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Donald Tsang, KHSAR financial secretary who is here attending
the annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund (IMF), told a press conference that the exceptional incursion
was introduced to remove a "contrived, artificial and manufactured
situation" which was causing major disruption and threatening to
undermine the confidence of the people.
</P>
<P>
To dispel foreign doubts about the move, Tsang said that the
measures are "totally transparent and rule-based" and not at all
amounting to capital control.
</P>
<P>
The secretary has met with several finance ministers and other
officials here since his arrival last Saturday. Their talks
focused on greater transparency and disclosure of interests in
Market activities and discipline on monitoring international fund
flows.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we are in a very crucial juncture in economic
evolution of modern history," Tsang said, citing as a proof the
fall of four major currencies in Asia, the continuous instability
in Russia, the critical lack of activity and sense of rapid
recovery in the Japanese economy, the major correction in the Wall
Street and the potential serious problems emerging in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
"It is no exaggeration that if these problems are not quickly
addressed, and addressed properly, we are facing up to a global
recession," the official warned.
</P>
<P>
He called for due attention to the negative impact of
exceedingly large-sized capital flow and for efforts to stem
irregularity in the banking sector in particular.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, Tsang added, it is necessary to enhance
transparency and disclosure of activities as well as supervision.
He urged the world countries to work together to address the
problems in Japan, Russia and Brazil without further delay.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of China's determination to keep its currency
renminbi strong. "The renminbi, as I say, is a very strong
currency... there is a firm political commitment from the
leadership of China that the currency should not be devalued."
</P>
<P>
Secretary Tsang is on a three-week mission to Europe and the
United States designed to exchange views with other financial
leaders on the restoration of order and stability in the
international financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The trip has taken Tsang to Frankfurt, Munich, the Hague and
Amsterdam, and will lead him to Now York, Boston, London and
Edinburgh. He planned to deliver about 10 keynote speeches during
his visit.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said he wished to be able to gather first-hand knowledge
on the development of the Euro dollar and its implications for
Hong Kong, while trying to dispel any misunderstanding or doubts
about Hong Kong's recent counter-activities in the stock and
futures markets.
</P>
<P>
"I am glad to say that misunderstanding has now been largely
removed, from what I have discussed with people in Europe and here
over the last 10 days about what Hong Kong has done," Tsang told
reporters at the press conference.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Delivers Fewer Jets in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Boeing delivered 123
commercial jets in the third quarter ending September 30, a 10
percent decline from the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The company said in a report that at the end of the quarter
there were 36 undelivered commercial airplanes in storage, waiting
for customer-financing arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Boeing delivered 137 jets in the second quarter and had hoped
to deliver more in the third quarter. The reduced deliveries will
cut into Boeing's third-quarter profit and put a lot of pressure
on the company in the last quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the company delivered 89 jets in the third quarter
as production problems delayed their completion. Those problems,
which plagued the company for more than a year, now are abating
after costing Boeing nearly two billion U.S. dollars. Last month
the company ousted the chief of its commercial airplane operation.
</P>
<P>
The third-quarter shortfall is believed to reflect financial
problems Asian carriers are now having. Only last week Thailand
ordered Thai Airways to cancel orders for two 777s and delay
deliveries of other planes.
</P>
<P>
Another factor, according to Seattle Times, is the lack of
available financial aid from the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Several
purchasers, including Turkish Airlines, have sought aid from the
bank, which is awaiting federal funding as the new fiscal year
gets under way this month.
</P>
<P>
Boeing plans to deliver 550 commercial jet this year. The
third-quarter deliveries bring the total in the first nine months
to 370, leaving 123 deliveries if the company is to meet its goal.
