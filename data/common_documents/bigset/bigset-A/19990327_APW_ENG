<HEADLINE> Technology Changing Medical Ethics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	On entering medicine, young doctors still affirm the Hippocratic  
oath. But some believe the ancient Greek ethical code needs 
updating after a century of research advances that have blurred 
once-sharp lines of right and wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Could Hippocrates have imagined cloning or machines that  
maintain breathing and heartbeat in brain-dead patients? The oath 
deals with euthanasia and privacy, but what about fertility 
treatments that produce eight babies, transplants of animal organs 
into humans, genetic engineering? What about Dr. Jack Kevorkian? 
</P>
<P>
	``Much of the challenge of our era is bringing our ethical  
compass up to date to match our technical expertise,'' said Dr. 
Linda Emanuel, director of the American Medical Association's 
Institute for Ethics. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate begins even before conception. Fertilizing an egg in  
a test tube has become almost commonplace. Sperm taken after death 
and frozen can be used to produce a child years later. A woman old 
enough to be a grandmother can bear a child. Fertility treatments 
recently produced septuplets in Iowa and octuplets in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we as a society have made a value judgment in the  
reproductive area. We've made a choice not to interfere. We just 
choose to allow it all to happen,'' said Arthur Caplan, director of 
the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	But Richard McCormick, a professor of Christian ethics at the  
University of Notre Dame, warned that in such cases, science 
already may have gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all matters touching life, the problem is that there have  
got to be limits,'' he said. ``We have responsibilities. The 
question is drawing the line at the proper place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Transplanting organs -- heart, lungs, kidney -- is now common, but  
the manner in which they are distributed has come under increased 
scrutiny, since some 4,000 people die each year in the United 
States while awaiting a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, organs are offered first to patients near where they  
become available, but the federal government wants to distribute 
organs to the sickest patients first, no matter where they live. In 
response, some states have passed laws to keep donated organs 
within their borders, regardless of urgent need elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Another solution, another ethical problem: Researchers  
responding to the shortage use organs and cells from pigs and other 
animals, even hearts from baboons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you squeamish but it beats being dead,'' said Robert  
Levine, chairman of the institutional review board at the Yale-New 
Haven Medical Center. ``Progress in medicine is an optional goal. 
If you don't want to pursue it, you don't have to. We don't force 
it on people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, historians cite notorious exceptions, when the century's  
quest for medical answers was hellbent, unchecked by Hippocrates' 
ethical brakes. Nazi doctors conducted horrific tests in 
concentration camps, and researchers in Tuskegee, Ala., withheld 
syphilis treatment from 399 black men to see how the disease 
progressed. 
</P>
<P>
	Most research, of course, aims to preserve life, and 20th  
century medicine's strides have done that dramatically -- with life 
spans in the United States now at 76 years, an increase of almost 
30 years over the 1900 figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet even this progress casts an ethical shadow. With the  
introduction of respirators, ventilators, and other devices doctors 
have learned to sustain life at its most tenuous. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1976, a young woman named Karen Ann Quinlan fell into a coma.  
After much soul-searching, her family went to court to seek and 
finally win the right to have her respirator removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Their fight ignited the death-with-dignity movement, which in  
recent years has taken shape as the right-to-die movement, largely 
centered on Kevorkian, a retired Michigan pathologist who has said 
he assisted about 130 people in committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces a murder charge in a September 1998 death. Murder  
charges have been thrown out twice previously, three times he has 
been acquitted of assisted suicide, and a fourth trial ended in 
mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kevorkian is actually forcing people to discuss the issue, and  
I would say the trend line is toward greater acceptance,'' said Dr. 
Stanley Korenman, associate dean for ethics and medical sciences 
training at the University of California at Los Angeles School of 
Medicine. ``I think that this is an evolving issue and it will 
evolve toward permissiveness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some ethicists find the idea reprehensible and argue that  
medicine's advances offer palliative care to ease suffering in 
virtually every case. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happens when we devalue whole sections of society, old  
people, sick people? It's a slippery slope,'' said Dr. Edmund 
Pellegrino, director the Center for Clinical Bioethics at 
Georgetown University. 
</P>
<P>
	Some ethicists worry that an ongoing government project to map  
the human genome, the common genetic blueprint, could give rise to 
other forms of discrimination, based on a person's genes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing to insert a gene to prevent fatal illness. It's  
another thing to select genetic makeups,'' Korenman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cloning research has raised even broader questions. Two years  
ago, Scottish researchers cloned a sheep named Dolly. Last year, a 
physicist in Chicago said he would attempt to create the first 
human clone. 
</P>
<P>
	Where does medical research go from here? Ethicists say it will  
continue to press the limits, prompting debates that will only get 
sharper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medicine has gone far. I think it has crossed into areas where  
we often feel we have no handrails to hold on to,'' Caplan said. 
``But to say it's gone too far is to ignore the incredible 
benefits.''

<HEADLINE> Spears Happy To Be a Role Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Teen singing sensation Britney Spears says she's  
happy being a role model. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to be a good example for kids out there and not do  
something stupid,'' Spears says in the current edition of Rolling 
Stone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids have low self-esteem and then peer pressures come and  
they go into a wrong crowd. That's when all the bad stuff starts 
happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old Spears, whose debut album ``Baby One More Time''  
is flying off the racks, believes the key to success for kids is 
finding a niche. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they find something that keeps them happy -- writing,  
drawing, anything like that -- then they'll have confidence.''

	Pilot of Downed U.S. Jet Rescued  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said  
the unidentified pilot from a U.S. stealth fighter lost over 
Yugoslavia tonight had been rescued and was safe at an ``allied air 
force base.'' He said the cause of the crash wasn't known and 
refused to provide details of the rescue. The downed plane was the 
alliance's first loss in the four-day air campaign to prevent 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic from carrying out ``ethnic 
cleansing'' in separatist Kosovo province. Television stations in 
the Yugoslav capital broadcast footage showing flames rising from a 
tangled wreck that bore U.S. Air Force markings and the words ``Air 
Combat Command.'' The official Tanjug news agency said the 
radar-evading F-117 fighter was shot down 9 p.m. local time near 
Budjenovci, 35 miles northwest of Belgrade.

	Savage Killings Reported in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	MORINI, Albania (AP) -- As thousands of ethnic Albanians fled  
Kosovo today, Western officials said there were unconfirmed reports 
of a savage new campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' that has escalated 
dramatically since NATO attacks began. Ethnic Albanian sources 
remaining in the Serbian province made allegations of killing, 
kidnapping, and looting by paramilitary gangs, some targeting 
civilians in door-to-door raids. Across the Albanian border, a line 
of refugees stretched for a mile watched by about 10 Yugoslav army 
soldiers holding machine guns.

	NATO Protests Staged Across Europe

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Protests against NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia  
drew thousands of demonstrators today in cities throughout Europe 
as alliance missiles and warplanes again pounded the Balkan nation. 
In Russia, about 2,000 protesters staged rallies outside the 
American and British embassies in Moscow. In Ukraine, 
demonstrations continued as two government ministers traveled to 
Belgrade to offer mediation in possible peace talks. In Vienna, 
Austria, more than 4,000 protesters gathered in front of the U.S. 
Embassy, shouting ``Viva Serbia.'' There were also protests in 
Norway, Romania, Cyprus, the Czech Republic and other countries.

	Bush Said To Have Raised $3 Million  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking an early edge in a crowded GOP field,  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush has raised at least $3 million so far 
this year for a possible presidential bid, according to Republicans 
familiar with his fund raising. Bush's take for the first three 
months of 1999 is expected to put him ahead of several potential 
rivals for the Republican presidential nomination when their first 
fund-raising reports come out April 15. The race for campaign funds 
is considered the first primary of the 2000 presidential election. 
Politicians and strategists say a candidate needs to raise $20 
million by the end of this year to properly finance a campaign in 
2000.

suspicions and form a coalition government this week. ``Both of us 
stand ready to meet the parties to devise a way out of the current

Connecticut. Elton Brand dominated with 17 points and 14 rebounds, 
but he picked up his fourth foul with 10:12 left on a charge drawn 
by Mateen Cleaves in the open court. Guards Trajan Langdon and 
William Avery sandwiched 3-pointers around a layup by Michigan 
State's Morris Peterson and then Avery's drive with 6:14 to play 
had Duke's lead at 59-50.

<HEADLINE> White-McCarty Is Revered in Indiana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- In the crowded Purdue locker room,  
Stephanie White-McCarty holds a video camera to record her team's 
trip to the Final Four. If White-McCarty has anything to do with 
it, the video diary will include a national championship 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great experience,'' she beams, the camera in her  
hands. ``A once-in-a-lifetime experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty is usually on the other side of the lens. The  
center of attention since high school, her popularity has reached 
new heights this season as Purdue makes a run for the title. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because White-McCarty's story has everything, from  
triumph to adversity to triumph again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people say her name is in the same category as Bobby  
Knight, Larry Bird and God in Indiana,'' Purdue coach Carolyn Peck 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The legend began in tiny West Lebanon, Ind., population 760.  
Stephanie White was a hometown hero at Seeger Memorial High School, 
scoring 66 points in one game and grabbing 30 rebounds in another. 
With an average of nearly 40 points per game her senior year, she 
was lauded as the one of the best high school players in the 
country, alongside Chamique Holdsclaw. 
</P>
<P>
	She was true to her home state and decided to attend Purdue. But  
just before she arrived, Leslie Johnson and Danielle McCulley left 
the Boilermakers, signaling the start of the near disintegration of 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
	It got worse. Although White-McCarty was a starter as a  
freshman, she fell far below her own standards by averaging just 
10.8 points a game. Then coach Lin Dunn was fired. 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty and her best friend, guard Ukari Figgs, considered  
bailing on the Boilermakers, as some other players had. Best 
friends Nicole Erickson and Michele VanGorp went to Duke, where 
Purdue assistant Gail Goestenkors had gone years before. 
</P>
<P>
	Figgs and White-McCarty held on, but there were more rough times  
ahead. After their sophomore season, coach Nell Fortner left to 
coach the USA Women's National Team. The two friends had their 
third collegiate coach, Peck. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Peck, the turnaround began, culminating with this moment:  
the national championship game Sunday against Duke -- and old 
teammates Erickson and VanGorp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sweet just being here, period, whether what we've been  
through or not,'' Figgs said. ``We haven't dwelled on the past. 
We've just come out here and we're going to make our senior year 
special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty echoed the sentiment: They're just happy to be  
here. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not playing against those two players. We are playing  
the whole team,'' she said. ``They have done a great job of playing 
together, and their team is a very good team. We just have to be 
prepared to go against them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty has certainly done her share to make sure the  
Boilermakers made it to this point. 
</P>
<P>
	She has averaged 20.4 points and 5.5 rebounds this season. After  
Friday night's 77-63 victory over Louisiana Tech, she had 2,170 
career points. 
</P>
<P>
	She has school bests with 126 consecutive starts, 183 career  
3-pointers, and 38 consecutive games with double figures in 
scoring. She has 695 points this season, breaking her own record of 
679 set last year. 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty also has the first triple-double in the program's  
22-year history with 22 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in a 
Jan. 22 game against state rival Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, there's little White-McCarty doesn't have. She married  
her high school sweetheart, Brent McCarty, last May, with Figgs as 
a bridesmaid. She's been profiled in Sports Illustrated and ESPN 
Magazine. Hoosier coach Knight sent her an autographed picture as a 
fan. 
</P>
<P>
	But she doesn't have a national championship.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy where we are, but we're not satisfied,'' she said.  
``We want more. That's been our attitude all season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When compared to Bird, Knight and God on Saturday, White-McCarty  
put her face in her hands then leaned over to Figgs. ``So 
embarrassing,'' she whispered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't see myself like that,'' she said. ``I see  
myself like any other person. It's important for me to be a role 
model, and I take that very seriously. But I'm just Steph.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Sunday's game, Peck is headed for the Orlando Miracle of  
the WNBA. Figgs and White-McCarty could choose to play 
professionally either here or overseas. But for now, the focus is 
on one game, one night. 
</P>
<P>
	And, in at least one small town in Indiana, one player. West  
Lebanon's own. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could go through all the players on the team and ask  
`Who's your best friend? Well, Steph,''' Peck said. ``She has the 
best personality that I could describe as a hug. She embraces 
everything and everyone around her.''

<HEADLINE> Appalachian Jews Embrace Faith </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BECKLEY, W.Va. (AP) -- The snow outside Temple Beth El was  
knee-deep, but the two dozen Jews who gathered recently for a 
Friday night service didn't bother to heat the building. They use 
it only once a month. 
</P>
<P>
	They sang and prayed in Hebrew and English, reading from  
photocopies of a prayer book they're thinking of buying. Purchases 
are not made lightly when a congregation has just 30 members and 
each visit from a student rabbi costs $500. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, they will gather at home instead of at the temple,  
celebrating the eight days of Passover with elaborate seder feasts. 
The holiday marks spiritual freedom, as well as God's delivery of 
the Jews from slavery in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a time when they really take possession of their  
Judaism in their individual families,'' says student rabbi Margot 
Crowson. ``It's one of the few times of the year they all feel 
confident in their own ability to express their Judaism. They 
realize they don't need me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Passover is also a time for Jews to actively embrace their faith  
instead of taking it for granted, says Crowson, a student at Hebrew 
Union College in Cincinnati who travels eight hours roundtrip from 
her home in Georgetown, Ky., to lead monthly services. 
</P>
<P>
	``But in small communities like Beckley, every Friday night that  
they do something for Shabbat, every time they bring in a student 
rabbi, they are doing something. They are not taking it for 
granted,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a miracle this place exists,'' Crowson marvels.  
``Ordinarily, in any congregation there is a core group that does 
things. Here, the core group is exhausted because they're all it. 
There is nobody to pinch-hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Across the nation, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations  
says, about 500 Jewish communities too small to support full-time 
clergy rely on student rabbis like Crowson for guidance. And while 
many of those communities have stabilized, some in West Virginia 
are being lost to history. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1930s, more than 7,000 Jews lived in West Virginia.  
Today, just 2,000 remain in a state of 1.8 million -- an 
overwhelmingly Christian, Bible Belt state. 
</P>
<P>
	Jews helped develop the state's economy, arriving as pack  
peddlers and setting up shops in coal-camp towns in the early 
1900s. They flourished for a half-century until the mines were 
mechanized and jobs lost. Then people left in droves for easier, 
more lucrative work in other states. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike other Appalachian states, though, West Virginia had no  
big cities where Jews could migrate. Its two largest towns, 
Charleston and Huntington, have populations of about 60,000. The 
Jewish communities, small to begin with, were hard-hit by the 
exodus, which continued in the '80s when the coal industry fell on 
hard times. And still the numbers dwindle. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last month, remnants of a Fairmont congregation left their  
quarters in a hotel basement to merge with Morgantown's Tree of 
Life, leaving the state with just 10 active congregations. There 
are two in Charleston and one each in Wheeling, Clarksburg, 
Huntington, Williamson, Bluefield, Beckley, Parkersburg and 
Morgantown. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Julie Spitzer, now director of the Greater New York  
Council of Reform Synagogue, once led the Williamson congregation, 
driving five hours each way to get there from Hebrew Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a wonderful spirit that you might think would be  
beaten down with so many seeming hardships -- maintaining the 
community both financially and in terms of numbers,'' she says. 
``In spite of all of that, there really is a commitment. It's much 
harder to find in a large city, where you can take a Jewish 
community for granted, where you can choose to belong or not 
belong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Beckley, a town of about 20,000 some 300 miles southwest of  
Washington, D.C., the Yellow Pages list more than 100 churches -- 
and one temple. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowson conducts her services largely in English, reserving  
Hebrew for most of the songs and about half of the prayers. ``In 
Hebrew, the sound of it makes them feel part of something,'' she 
explains. ``In English, they do more than feel. They understand 
what they're saying, and they're connected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Julie Schwartz, who oversees Hebrew Union's student rabbi  
program, says students like Crowson travel to their congregations 
every other weekend for a stipend of about $350. The other $150 
covers travel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``They cram a lot into a weekend,'' Schwartz says. They attend  
Shabbat dinners and services on Fridays and havdallah suppers 
welcoming the new week on Saturdays. They run Hebrew lessons for 
children and religion classes for adults. They visit shut-ins. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's painful for students to leave,'' she says. ``You do fall  
in love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assigned to Beckley, Crowson heard it was a dying congregation.  
``But I don't believe it's dying. Yet. And don't think it's going 
to die anytime in the foreseeable future,'' she says. ``It's not 
dedication to Judaism; it's dedication to the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Golden has lived in Beckley for more than 20 years. ``There  
are stages in the vibrancy of this temple,'' he says. ``It's not a 
battle. It's a rebirth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The congregation found new vitality when some of its younger  
members began classes for children in 1991. Student rabbis were 
brought in around 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as it dwindles down, there's this sudden influx of  
people,'' agrees Stan Selden, a lifelong member. ``They're just 
here. ... If you have one person who seems to be the only one who 
can do something and then he disappears, someone else always steps 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selden grew up listening to Rabbi Isadore Wein, now retired to  
Florida, and has had to adjust to the student rabbis. ``I got used 
to a set way of doing things,'' Selden says. ``The student rabbis 
changed all that. They make you think about the meaning as opposed 
to just the environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Sopher, whose family helped found Temple Beth El, says  
services were limited to two or three times a year before student 
rabbis came. Now, there are 10 a year. Still, there are some Jews 
in Beckley who don't attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're like Christians who think they don't have to go to  
church every Sunday,'' he says. ``If you don't go to temple for 10 
years, you're still Jewish... . They say 'It'll be there. Where's 
it going?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even in the face of apathy and adversity, some communities  
thrive. In Charleston, the conservative B'nai Jacob synagogue is 
booming with 240 families, and the B'nai Israel temple boasts of 
145. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Victor Urecki, who leads B'nai Jacob, says the number of  
children attending Sunday school has doubled to more than 70 since 
he arrived in 1986, largely because of outreach to interfaith 
couples. 
</P>
<P>
	That outreach is critical to the survival of West Virginia's  
remaining Jewish communities, he says. In Beckley, for example, 
only one couple were born Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a larger Jewish community, you can set your own  
agenda. You can exclude people for whatever reason,'' Urecki says. 
``If you're too small, you don't have any numbers to play with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appealing to interfaith families through their children is a  
natural. ``The Jewish spouse probably would like to raise their 
children in the Jewish faith. The non-Jewish spouse assumes that 
the Jewish community is a very cloistered, cliquish group,'' Urecki 
says. ``The feeling is she would be treated as an outsider. No, we 
want him. We want her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's the young adults without children who are hard to attract.  
People in their 20s and 30s are looking for love, Urecki says, and 
rarely seek or find a Jewish spouse. Often, they leave the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Subit, 22, of Wheeling, would like to stay in West  
Virginia. He'd also like to marry a Jew. But he has dated only two 
Jewish women. He recently broke up with a Catholic because she 
wasn't willing to convert -- and neither was he. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judaism is more a part of my life than anything else right  
now,'' he says. ``I like being Jewish so much that I don't see any 
other way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Ruben, a 22-year-old senior at West Virginia University  
in Morgantown, is dating a Jew for the first time in her life. ``I 
knew who all the Jewish boys were,'' she recalls of her teen-age 
years, ``and I knew I wasn't going to date them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Urecki understands the dilemma and is hard-pressed to advise  
young people. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mind tells me they need to look elsewhere because the pool  
of people is just not there. My heart wants to keep them here,'' he 
says. ``So I tell them to go on sabbatical to New York, get married 
to a Jew and then come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In small towns, he says, the Jewish experience can be more  
profound. 
</P>
<P>
	Urecki was born in Argentina, grew up in Portland, Ore., studied  
in New York and moved to Charleston after he married. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hated the oppressiveness of New York. It was too  
overwhelming a Jewish community,'' he says. ``I wanted to be in a 
place where I could live as a Jew but be part of a community and 
share in their lives, the ups and downs. I know every single Jew in 
Charleston -- and beyond, probably. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here, a bar mitzvah is a community event. When a child is  
born, it's a community event. When we do a naming for a child, the 
whole community comes out,'' Urecki says. ``You don't get that in a 
big city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same is true in Beckley, where one line of a song means so  
much to the congregation that it often opens and closes the monthly 
service: ``How good it is and how pleasant when we dwell together 
in unity.''

<HEADLINE> No Agreement on Medicare Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the issues get toughest, the habit in  
Congress and the White House is to hand them off to commissions, 
special panels that are supposed to bridge political differences 
and come up with answers both sides can buy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes it works. Not now.  
</P>
<P>
	Not on Medicare, which could be broke in less than a decade  
without an overhaul or new funding, or both. 
</P>
<P>
	After a year on the case, a bipartisan commission on the future  
of Medicare couldn't agree on a recommendation, and President 
Clinton rebuffed a proposal from its majority. 
</P>
<P>
	That puts the future of the government health care system for  
senior Americans back into the political mix, and it may stay 
there, unresolved, until after the next election. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans suspect that is what the Democrats want, since they  
have used Medicare to advantage in past campaigns, and could try it 
again in 2000, in the contest for the White House and for the 
six-seat gain it would to capture control of the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats' well-rehearsed theme is that Republicans want to  
use money best earmarked for Medicare and Social Security for tax 
cuts instead; the GOP retort is that the surplus budget can afford 
both, and that they are more reliable reformers. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where it all stood before the commission got its delayed  
start on the problem, after a political hassle over who would run 
it. The White House wanted a Democrat, and got one, Sen. John 
Breaux of Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	But the plan Breaux shepherded to approval by 10 commission  
members, one short of the super-majority required to make it a 
formal recommendation, wasn't to Clinton's liking. Breaux, a 
Clinton ally, had a hard time getting the president even to talk 
about the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux and his commission partner, Republican Rep. Bill Thomas  
of California, recommended that Medicare be transformed into a 
system more like private health insurance, with the government 
providing allowances beneficiaries would use to buy their own 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	That's like the system that covers federal employees, and  
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, which Breaux and Thomas are proposing to Congress on  
their own now, includes limited coverage for prescription drugs and 
a gradual increase in the eligibility age, from 65 to 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants more extensive prescription coverage and insists  
on keeping the basic benefit system in place. He wants 15 percent 
of projected budget surpluses over the next 15 years, an estimated 
$700 billion, earmarked for Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before the commission's final session, on March 16, Clinton  
said its approach ``falls short,'' taking on an issue he hadn't 
said much about. In successive State of the Union messages, he had 
proposed opening the Medicare system to people as young as 55, 
letting the uninsured among them buy into the government coverage, 
covering prescriptions and reserving the surplus to keep it all 
solvent. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, and Breaux, are wary that the surplus plan would  
paper over the underlying problems in Medicare and ease the 
pressure for reform in the system. 
</P>
<P>
	That draws the lines for another season of arguments. Clinton  
said that with hard choices, there can be reform this year. He said 
Medicare is too important to let partisanship prevent progress. 
</P>
<P>
	But it has before, and may again.  
</P>
<P>
	None of this is new business. The projections of a go-broke year  
were made long ago. An earlier commission on entitlement reform 
pointed to the problems but divided on the solutions in 1994, 
telling Clinton then that ``tough action is needed sooner rather 
than later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted in 1997 to raise the Medicare age to 67 and to  
base premiums on income so that the well-to-do would pay more for 
health coverage. That was dropped from the budget bill that year, 
which instead included stopgap steps to keep Medicare solvent for a 
decade -- and set up the commission to work on long term changes. 
</P>
<P>
	That was supposed to insulate the issue against the politics of  
the 1998 campaign. Now it will bump into the politics of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people want an issue out of Medicare rather than solving  
the problem,'' Breaux said. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> New York Street Crime Unit Revamped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The police department announced major changes in  
its elite crimefighting unit on the heels of reports that four of 
its white members were indicted for murder in the killing of an 
unarmed black immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers in the Street Crime Unit will now wear uniforms instead  
of plainclothes, and 50 slots at the predominately white division 
will be reassigned to minority police officers, under changes 
announced Friday by Police Commissioner Howard Safir. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes are partly in response to concerns voiced by  
political and community leaders as well as city residents, Safir 
said. The changes may take place as early as Sunday, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Safir, Mayor Giuliani and the unit have been under intense  
criticism and scrutiny ever since four of the unit's officers fired 
41 bullets at Amadou Diallo on Feb. 4 in the vestibule of his Bronx 
home. He was hit 19 times. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the case told The Associated Press on Thursday  
that a grand jury had decided to indict all four officers for 
second-degree murder. The indictment remains sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers have yet to say publicly what happened, but a  
lawyer representing one of them has said they believed the 
22-year-old street vendor from Guinea was reaching for a gun. 
Critics have said Diallo -- who was black -- may have been acting 
strangely because he was approached at night by the four white 
officers in plainclothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Safir said clothing has apparently caused confusion in some  
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was explained to me a number of times that an individual  
would be followed by a nondescript car, three people in 
plainclothes would get out of the car, and a couple of people said 
to me: 'I just kept going because I didn't know who they were,''' 
Safir said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Diallo's killing, federal and state officials launched  
probes into the department, and more than 1,000 people have been 
arrested in civil disobedience demonstrations outside police 
headquarters in the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jesse Jackson was among 216 people arrested Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Safir said he plans to promote about 300 of the 380 Street Crime  
members to the rank of detective specialist, reassign 50 of them to 
robbery and apprehension units and earmark their Street Crime slots 
for minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	He said since Diallo's death, there has been a drop in 67  
percent arrests made by the Street Crime Unit. Safir blamed the 
media for the decrease, saying its members have been ``relentless 
in vilifying the Street Crime Unit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unit, whose motto is ``We Own the Night,'' was formed in  
1971, and expanded in 1997 by Giuliani. Because the unit works in 
high-violence areas, its officers have always worn plainclothes to 
fit into the neighborhoods they patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	The unit commander, Inspector Bruce Smolka Jr., said he'll take  
a ``wait and see'' attitude about the potential impact of putting 
his employees in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani lent his support to the plan.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am certain these changes will result in positive  
improvements,'' he said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Women's Final a Reunion for Some </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Two left, two stayed behind and now,  
three years later, here they are facing each other for the national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue's Stephanie White-McCarty and Ukari Figgs will meet  
former teammates Michele VanGorp and Nicole Erickson when the No. 
1-ranked Boilermakers play Duke Sunday night in a title game that 
will produce a first-time champion. 
</P>
<P>
	All four played on Purdue's 1995-96 team, which was torn apart  
when coach Lin Dunn was fired after the season. VanGorp and 
Erickson headed for Duke, White-McCarty and Figgs remained at 
Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	In an incredible coincidence, they're all ending their college  
careers in the same game. But VanGorp and Erickson weren't talking 
about that Saturday. Coach Gail Goestenkors wouldn't let them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been asked so many questions about that,'' Goestenkors  
said. ``It kind of takes away from our team, Duke University. This 
is not about the past. It's about the present. Everybody is happy 
now. Everybody is to the Final Four. I think we just need to let 
well enough alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue made the Final Four because Figgs and White-McCarty stuck  
it out, even after a second coaching change. Dunn's replacement, 
Nell Fortner, left after one season to coach the U.S. national team 
and was succeeded by her top assistant, Carolyn Peck. 
</P>
<P>
	That's three coaches in their first three years, but with one  
more solid effort on their part, the two seniors could reap the 
ultimate reward for their perseverance: an NCAA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be gratifying to cut down the nets no matter  
what, not just because we've gone through a lot,'' said 
White-McCarty, a unanimous All-American. ``Because it's such a 
great honor and we've done a lot in this team. We've stuck together 
all year long. It's just a very special team to be around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game also will mark the end of Peck's career at Purdue. The  
second-year coach is leaving to become coach and general manager of 
the WNBA's new franchise in Orlando and she has to be ready for the 
league's expansion draft on April 6. But that can wait, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The focus right now is we've got to play for 40 minutes,''  
Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the top 16 seeds in the NCAA tournament all advanced to  
the regional round, March madness will end with a most 
untraditional championship game, the first since 1993 not to have 
Tennessee or Louisiana Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (29-6) eliminated Tennessee, winner of the last three  
titles, in the East Regional final, then beat Georgia 81-69 in the 
national semifinals Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue (33-1), which has won 31 straight, beat Louisiana Tech  
77-63 Friday night. So not only will there be a first-time 
champion, it's the first time these two teams have ever reached the 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	They've done it with much the same strengths: sound, smart team  
play, excellent guards, offensive balance and solid defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very similar,'' said Goestenkors, who once was an  
assistant at, you guessed it, Purdue. ``I think honestly it's going 
to come down to defense and to rebounding. Because I think both 
teams can score a lot of points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to take something away from them and I  
know they're going to have to take something away from us, either 
our inside game or our outside game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue, however, is tough to defend because its players are so  
versatile and have a knack for picking each other up. Friday night, 
for example, White-McCarty was 1-for-7 in the first half. But Figgs 
scored 18 points in the opening half and the Boilermakers led by 
13. She finished with 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's kind of been a secret all year long,'' Peck said. ``I  
haven't minded because some teams haven't been ready for her and 
then she comes out and plays like she did last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Figgs isn't going to catch Duke by surprise.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our biggest things is we're just going to limit her touches on  
the ball and try to make somebody else beat us,'' Duke guard Hilary 
Howard said. ``We know we're not going to stop her. But we want to 
stop her from having a game like last night where she did 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue doesn't have anyone as big as the 6-foot-6 VanGorp  
inside. If Erickson and Howard can get the ball to VanGorp for her 
turnaround jumpers and hit a few outside shots, the Blue Devils 
could be hard to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	They haven't been stopped so far in this tournament and they're  
confident they can keep it going one more game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just feel like we belong here,'' Goestenkors said. ``And  
you know, we've charted this path from day one. So it's not 
something that we feel is unexpected. Because of that, I think we 
feel pretty comfortable.''

<HEADLINE> Three Mile Island Timeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Twenty years ago, America witnessed its worst nuclear accident:  
a partial meltdown of a reactor core at Three Mile Island in 
Middletown, Pa. Here is a chronology of key events: 
</P>
<P>
	--September 1974: Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear reactor begins  
running. 
</P>
<P>
	--December 1978: Unit 2 comes into operation.  
</P>
<P>
	--March 28, 1979: A predawn breakdown in a pumping system sets  
off an automatic shutdown of Unit 2. Later equipment problems and 
operator mistakes allow cooling water to drain away, causing the 
radioactive core to overheat and start to melt. About one-third 
eventually melts. 
</P>
<P>
	--March 30, 1979: An exodus from the local community begins with  
Gov. Richard Thornburgh's advice that pregnant women and young 
children clear away from within five miles of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	--March 31, 1979: President Carter visits the plant -- the only  
one in U.S. history to face an accident known as a general 
emergency. Regulators, scientists and industry personnel debate 
potential for a hydrogen bubble to explode and spew radioactive 
gases into the surroundings. But it never happens. 
</P>
<P>
	--April 9, 1979: The evacuation advisory is lifted.  
</P>
<P>
	--August 1979: Cleanup of Unit 2 begins with the shipment of some  
low-level radioactive waste to Richland, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	--July 1980: A limited amount of radioactive krypton is vented  
from the reactor building. 
</P>
<P>
	--October 1985: Workers standing over the Unit 2 reactor begin  
using long-handled tools to remove fuel and core debris. Unit 1 is 
restarted. 
</P>
<P>
	--April 1990: The last canister of Unit 2 uranium fuel is shipped  
to an Idaho research center, accounting for more than 98 percent of 
the fuel. The rest remains galvanized in the metal and concrete 
that surrounded the reactor core. 
</P>
<P>
	--September 1990: Columbia University researchers report finding  
no excess cancer from radiation releases forced by the accident. A 
National Cancer Institute study reaches a similar conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	--January 1991: An evaporator installed at Unit 2 begins to clean  
up 2.3 million gallons of slightly radioactive water. 
</P>
<P>
	--December 1993: Unit 2 is placed in monitored storage after its  
$980 million cleanup. It is expected to remain in that state until 
Unit 1 closes and both units are decommissioned. 
</P>
<P>
	--June 1996: A federal judge dismisses all 2,100 lawsuits  
claiming injury from the accident, citing slim proof. 
</P>
<P>
	--March 1997: Plant operators fail an emergency test when they  
are not able to recognize that simulated accident conditions had 
reached levels requiring declaration of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	--July 1998: AmerGen, a partnership of PECO Energy, of  
Philadelphia, and British Energy of Edinburgh, Scotland, offers to 
buy Unit 1 for $100 million. Government approval of the sale is 
expected in mid-1999. 
</P>
<P>
	--April 2014: Unit 1's license is scheduled to expire.

<HEADLINE> Fraschilla Named New Mexico Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Brooklyn-born Fran Fraschilla will  
finally get to go West as the next coach at New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Fired last year at St. John's after developing an interest in  
the coaching vacancy at Arizona State, Fraschilla was hired 
Saturday by the Lobos. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a basketball junkie and the chance to coach in one of the  
best environments in college basketball is just a dream come 
through,'' Fraschilla said during a telephone conference call from 
the Final Four in St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraschilla, 40, has been a frequent shopper for coaching  
vacancies throughout the country in recent months. His name has 
surfaced in coaching job openings at Georgia, San Diego State, 
Pittsburgh, East Carolina and Southwest Missouri State. 
</P>
<P>
	His hiring at New Mexico came four days after Dave Bliss  
resigned to take the head coaching job at Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico athletic director Rudy Davalos called Fraschilla  
``one of the best recruiters in the country,'' and a coach with the 
ability to take the Lobos to a higher level of national prominence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is I want the best for New Mexico  
basketball,'' Davalos said. ``I'm excited as heck about a guy that 
can give us a different aspect. The guy I hired is a high, high, 
high energy coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Associate athletic director Bill McGillis, a member of the  
advisory committee that helped in the search, said Fraschilla was 
the leading candidate from the start on a list that started out 
long and was trimmed to about six candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once Bliss started looking at the Saint Louis and Baylor jobs,  
we came up with a list,'' McGillis said. ``Fran was always at the 
top. He has a national profile and the focus was always on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bliss left as the winningest coach in New Mexico history with a  
record of 246-108 in 11 seasons. He led the Lobos to seven NCAA 
tournaments in the last nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico was 25-9 this season and lost to Connecticut at the  
West Regional. In Bliss' final four seasons, the Lobos won 102 
games, but Bliss became the target of increasing criticism from 
fans and the media for the Lobos' inability to advance further than 
the second round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraschilla, who coached St. John's to its first NCAA tournament  
bid since 1993, said he was ready for the mania and fish bowl 
atmosphere in Albuquerque, where the Lobos are the only game in 
town and annually rank among the top 10 schools nationally in home 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to be going into a place where people expect you to  
win,'' Fraschilla said. ``Coming from New York, I'm used to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Fraschilla left St. John's, the school said it had reached  
an agreement with Fraschilla to end their relationship because of 
``fundamental differences over the management of the basketball 
program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school said the decision had nothing to do with any unlawful  
conduct, violations of NCAA regulations or financial improprieties, 
and that none of those things had been reported or alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can say it was based on the opportunity to look at the  
Arizona State job and it ruffled some feathers back at St. 
John's,'' Fraschilla said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rejects Adidas Logo Size Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) -- A federal judge on Friday denied a  
bid by Adidas America Inc. to keep the NCAA from limiting the size 
of commercial logos on uniforms, the NCAA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Portland, Ore., subsidiary of the European apparel and  
footwear company filed suit last Nov. 12 in U.S. District Court in 
Kansas City, Kan., saying the NCAA's bylaw on commercial logos 
violated antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The bylaw restricts member schools to selling space for only a  
single manufacturer's logo or mark on apparel and limits it to 2 1/4 
square inches in area, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Adidas' logo consists of three parallel stripes down the arms  
and legs of apparel and won't fit in the area set out by the rule. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Van Bebber on Friday denied the  
company's motion for a preliminary injunction. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a news release Friday night from the NCAA, the  
judge said in his order that Adidas had failed to show there was a 
likelihood it would eventually win on the merits of its claim, or 
that it faced irreparable harm without a preliminary injuction. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone calls to Adidas America Inc.'s headquarters in  
Beaverton, Ore., seeking comment were unanswered Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Bebber said the bylaw was not subject to antitrust laws  
because it ``has neither the purpose nor the effect of giving the 
NCAA or its member institutions an advantage in any commercial 
transaction,'' the NCAA said, quoting from the judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
	Further, the judge said, the bylaw supports the NCAA's principle  
of maintaining amateurism in intercollegiate sports ``by preventing 
member schools from turning their student-athletes into billboards 
in the pursuit of advertising revenues,'' according to the NCAA 
release.

	The judge also noted that the bylaw helps avoid advertising that  
could interfere with the function of uniforms in identifying 
players to teammates and referees.

	Elsa Cole, general counsel for the NCAA, said the regulatory  
body for college athletics was pleased by the ruling, especially 
Van Bebber's finding that antitrust laws do not apply to the logo 
bylaw.

	Adidas and other manufacturers spend millions of dollars a year  
on sponsorship agreements with top college teams and coaches. They 
get players to wear their merchandise as a way of generating demand 
for their shoes, apparel and equipment, Adidas had said in the 
lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Imus Water Plan Faces Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Don Imus has encountered a wave of  
opposition over water use at his proposed ranch for sick children. 
</P>
<P>
	The nationally syndicated radio personality has raised millions  
of dollars for the children's ranch, which he hopes to open this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Imus' water plans call for pumping up to 100 acre-feet of water  
per year from four proposed 900-foot-deep wells. One acre-foot, the 
amount needed to cover an acre a foot deep, is about 326,000 
gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're concerned about the impact on the wells around here of  
any deep pumping,'' said Nicasio Romero, a commissioner on the El 
Ancon Acequia, an irrigation association. 
</P>
<P>
	``For something like this even to be proposed is ridiculous,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Imus has declined to discuss the project, and there was no  
answer Friday at his New York office.

<HEADLINE> Wrongly Convicted Woman Sues N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A woman wrongly convicted of murder in  
1973 is seeking $12.5 million from New York state to compensate her 
for spending 25 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Betty Tyson, 50, maintains she was robbed of her freedom, her  
wages and her ability to bear children. She underwent a 
hysterectomy in prison and claims she would have gotten better 
medical treatment in a regular hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's ``psychological injuries and her lost ability to bear  
children are permanent,'' according to a lawsuit filed earlier this 
month in the New York Court of Claims. 
</P>
<P>
	A former prostitute, Tyson was sentenced to 25 years to life in  
prison for the slaying of Philadelphia businessman Timothy Haworth, 
52, a consultant to Eastman Kodak Co. He was apparently soliciting 
a prostitute when he was strangled in an alley the night of May 25, 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had no physical evidence linking Tyson to the killing.  
She was found guilty based on a confession she said police beat out 
of her and the testimony of two teen-agers who told of seeing her 
with Haworth. 
</P>
<P>
	Her conviction was dismissed last May after a judge ruled  
evidence had been unlawfully suppressed. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, the city of Rochester agreed to pay Tyson $1.25  
million to settle a wrongful conviction lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time she was freed, Tyson had become New York's  
longest-serving female inmate. She declined Saturday to discuss the 
lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Tractor-Trailer Reflectors Required </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government has moved to require  
that tractor-trailer trucks carry reflectors that outline the 
bottom edge of their trailers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Highway Administration said Friday the change should  
reduce the chances that vehicles will smash into or drive beneath 
trailers. The agency estimated the change will save more than 100 
lives and prevent 1,700 injuries in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Since January 1, 1993, the government has required the bottom  
edge on all new trailers be rimmed with red-and-white reflective 
tape or with so-called reflex reflectors, like the red plastic 
devices used on bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the rule announced Friday takes effect in two months,  
truckers using trailers made prior to 1993 will have two years to 
install similar warnings. Truckers who have outlined their rigs 
with tape of a different color must switch to the new color scheme 
within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The order marked the first time the Federal Highway  
Administration has required trucking companies to retrofit older 
vehicles to meet a new-vehicle standard. 
</P>
<P>
	The change was welcome news to Beth Hall, of Allentown, Pa.  
</P>
<P>
	Her father died in 1993 on Route 313 in Pennsylvania when a  
tractor-trailer jackknifed and blocked all lanes on a highway. 
Driving at night, Carl Hall apparently spotted the lights on the 
cab and swerved left to avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he smashed under the darkened trailer he could not see  
and died instantly. 
</P>
<P>
	Beth Hall began a campaign to put reflective tape on truck  
trailers manufactured before the 1993 rule change. She estimated 
the cost per truck at $50. 
</P>
<P>
	In a previous interview with The Associated Press, Hall recalled  
meeting with then-Transportation Secretary Federico Pena to push 
for the new federal rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought reflective tape would be easy. I'd meet with (his  
deputies) every few months. They kept saying, `Yes, reflective tape 
is going.' They thought it would be out by this spring,'' Hall said 
during the summer of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, members of the Hall family were on Capitol Hill with  
Rep. James Greenwood, R-Pa., to announce the new rule. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the federal Office of Motor Carriers, which  
oversees truck safety, said the delay was due to negotiations over 
what turned out to be a nearly 90-page rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the parties to the negotiations was the American Trucking  
Associations, which represents major trucking firms in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of comments and different points of view on  
how to do it,'' said OMC spokesman David Longo. ``Everyone agreed 
that it should be done, but there was discussion about the 
timing.''

                           *Michael Aris    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Michael Aris, the husband of Myanmar opposition  
leader Aung San Suu Kyi, died on his 53rd birthday Saturday after 
being blocked by Myanmar's military government from visiting his 
wife in his final days. 
</P>
<P>
	Aris had prostate cancer that had spread to his spine and lungs.  
Myanmar's military government had rejected a visa request this 
month from the ailing Aris, who taught Tibetan studies at Oxford 
University's St. Anthony's College. 
</P>
<P>
	Aris had not been allowed to meet with his wife since the 1995  
Christmas season. The ban on his visits was apparently in 
retaliation for his carrying out a public statement from Suu Kyi. 
</P>
<P>
	The military government said Suu Kyi ought to leave the country  
and visit her husband in Britain, but the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize 
winner refused to leave Myanmar, also known as Burma, for fear the 
military would not allow her to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Suu Kyi and Aris were married in 1972. She met him while she was  
a student at Oxford. 
</P>
<P>
	Suu Kyi's father, Gen. Aung San, helped Myanmar win independence  
from Britain. He was assassinated in 1947. In 1988, after Suu Kyi 
had returned to Myanmar to nurse her dying mother, a nationwide 
uprising against military rule erupted and she emerged as the 
movement's leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The military crushed the uprising and placed Suu Kyi under house  
arrest from 1989-95. 
</P>
<P>
	The military government allowed Aris and their children to visit  
Suu Kyi several times but has refused him a visa for at least the 
past two years.

<P>
	CAREFREE, Ariz. (AP) -- Howell T. Conant Sr., who was the  
unofficial palace photographer for Princess Grace of Monaco for 
nearly three decades, died at his home March 11. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1955, Conant was hired by Photoplay magazine to shoot a cover  
photo of Hollywood actress Grace Kelly. She liked his modest style, 
and after she married Monaco's Prince Rainier III a year later, 
Conant spent the next 26 years as the palace's unofficial 
photographer. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, he published a book of photographs he took called  
``Grace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conant had been a photographer for Adm. Chester Nimitz during  
World War II. He later became a fashion photographer for Life, Look 
and Paris Match.

	Conant is survived by his wife, Dorothy; a son, three daughters,  
12 grandchildren and a great-grandchild.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Lawrence ``Dan'' Duke Sr., the former chief judge  
of the State Court of Fulton County who once waved a whip in the 
face of former Gov. Eugene Talmadge to prove a point about racism, 
has died. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke who was known for his work defending blacks and prosecuting  
those who carried out racially charged crimes, died Wednesday of 
pneumonia at Fayette Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke was best known for his confrontation with Talmadge in 1941.  
As an assistant solicitor for the state, Duke successfully 
convicted several members of the Ku Klux Klan for the flogging 
death of a black man. 
</P>
<P>
	After Talmadge threatened to grant the men clemency, Duke waved  
the whips used in the crime in the governor's face. Talmadge 
relented. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include Mrs. Fletcher, sons Lawrence Duke Barnes of  
Denver, Daniel Duke Jr. of Alpharetta, and Tarleton C. Duke of 
Tyrone; sister Myra Duke Coulon of Barnesville; and four 
grandchildren.

	Serb TV Reports Downed NATO Plane  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbian television reported early  
Sunday that a NATO plane had been shot down in Yugoslavia. Footage 
showed flames rising from a tangled wreck. ``I cannot confirm it,'' 
a NATO spokesman in Brussels, Belgium, said. The Pentagon refused 
to comment. Signs of possible escalation of the Kosovo conflict 
continued. Earlier, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the 
stepped up assault, which he said had the approval of every 
government in the alliance, was needed ``to bring a halt to 
violence in Kosovo and prevent further humanitarian catastrophe.''

dramatically since NATO attacks began. Ethnic Albanian sources 
remaining in the Serbian province made allegations of killing, 
kidnapping, and looting by paramilitary gangs, some targeting 
civilians in door-to-door raids. Across the Albanian border, a line 
of refugees stretched for a mile watched by about 10 Yugoslav army

<HEADLINE> Three Mile Island Marks Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ONOFRE, Calif. (AP) -- Surfers have been riding the  
thundering breakers of this beach since the days of the steam 
automobile, long before anyone cracked an atom to make electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Higgs adopted this beach as his second home even before  
bulldozers scraped away 1.5 million cubic yards of sandstone bluff 
for the first of three nuclear reactors. He and the San Onofre 
nuclear plant are uneasy neighbors to this day, peering at each 
other through barbed-wire fencing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've learned to live with that. I love surfing, and I love the  
ocean so much,'' he said, looking up at the plant's three 
protective domes designed to seal in radioactivity during an 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	But then he added: ``I wish it wasn't here, to be truthful.''  
</P>
<P>
	The way the nuclear industry is declining, his wish may yet come  
true. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Three Mile Island accident in Middletown, Pa., 20  
years ago March 28, American attitudes toward nuclear power have 
been characterized by paralyzing ambivalence and mood swings. Under 
public pressure, the industry and government have profoundly 
reworked safeguards at tremendous effort and cost. Warily, the 
public has watched 51 commercial reactors hum to life in the years 
since the accident. But all of them had been planned before Three 
Mile Island; none has been ordered since. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually no one in the industry can imagine building a plant in  
the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not runaway chain reactions but exploding costs that have  
jeopardized this $43 billion a year business. With barely a 
whimper, the nation has let 21 atomic reactors shut down. That's 17 
percent of its total of 125. They are victims of the intertwined 
costs of safety changes and heavy staffing; building debt; and 
mounting expense to replace parts, clean up abandoned sites, and 
store radioactive waste. 
</P>
<P>
	Cranking up pressure, some states are making nuclear power stand  
on its own as they drop guaranteed electric rates for power 
monopolies to inject competition into energy production. 
</P>
<P>
	The nuclear industry still supplies about one-fifth of the  
country's power -- second only to coal. But the U.S. Department of 
Energy predicts it could wither away almost entirely over the next 
20 years. By just about any standard of policy or politics, atomic 
power is looking like a lesson in energy wasted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We over-promised and under-delivered. We created fears that  
are not appropriate, and the industry handled it all in a very 
defensive, closed way,'' said consultant Roger Gale, president of 
the Washington International Energy Group. ``We took a good 
technology, and we blew it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a remarkable turnaround for a technology that began with  
such hope. When the lights flickered on at Moorpark Nov. 12, 1957, 
the country was electrified. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS television captured the moment for history. The town of  
1,146 people went black when it was cut off from Southern 
California Edison Co.'s conventional power grid. A few seconds 
later, thanks to the company's little atomic reactor in the Santa 
Susana Mountains, Moorpark and the nation awoke to the age of atoms 
for peace. 
</P>
<P>
	National leaders were eager to redeem the research and  
destructive power of the atom bomb. They promoted and helped 
finance the first round of nuclear energy plants and dreamed aloud 
of electricity so cheap it would hardly be worth metering, maybe 
1,000 reactors by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s, public worries about air pollution, the Arab oil  
embargo and the limits of fossil fuel supplies boosted the inherent 
high-tech appeal of nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
	The backbone of the new industry's work force came from the  
ranks of the nuclear Navy -- a gung-ho breed that later proved inept 
at dealing with a doubting public. 
</P>
<P>
	Decades of environmental and economic bruises have now  
thoroughly rubbed off the veneer of atomic technology as the wonder 
boy of energy. 
</P>
<P>
	Public support for nuclear energy has slipped from 70 percent  
before Three Mile Island to 43 percent in 1997, according to Roper 
Starch Worldwide, the polling company. Though some still view the 
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission as too cozy with the industry, 
the agency sees itself primarily as a safety enforcer, not a 
booster. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is going to order a new nuclear plant: too much  
political pressure and environmental pressure, and your capital is 
at risk for so long,'' says Chris Neil, an industry consultant with 
Resource Data International. ``Nobody wants to take that risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Southern California Edison is deciding whether to sell its two  
big 1,100-megawatt reactors still active at San Onofre south of Los 
Angeles. California's 30 million people draw about one-quarter of 
their electricity from atomic plants, more than any other state. 
But that could change as California regulators complete the 
transition to competitive energy making. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think nuclear has changed that much. I think the world  
around it has changed,'' says Harold Ray, the utility's chief of 
generation. 
</P>

<P>
	``They have to be safe,'' she said. ``If they weren't, I don't  
think they'd put it in a public place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even strong critics say the industry has greatly bolstered  
safety since the partial meltdown of a reactor core at Three Mile 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's worst nuclear accident released little  
radioactivity into the environment, but it exposed dangers that 
shook government regulators into ordering expanded training of 
nuclear operators. Plants were redesigned to give operators better 
information on the state of reactors. Training control rooms were 
built identical to the real ones, down to the carpeting. Emergency 
command centers sprang up and connected to hot lines at the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	While basically on target, the government's reaction may have  
sometimes been overzealous, according to William Travers, the new 
director of the watchdog agency, who oversaw the Three Mile Island 
cleanup through much of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, he said, the agency is ``looking to reduce the  
unnecessary burden.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators are stripping back some rules, saying they do not  
really bear on safety. Using downgraded risk predictions, the 
agency is allowing more limited testing of some plant materials and 
setting up a fast track for re-licensing of old plants to help the 
industry compete. 
</P>
<P>
	In reaction, critics are again fretting over safety. A January  
report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of 
Congress, says ``safety margins may be compromised'' as markets 
turn competitive.

	``I've got the lights on all the time,'' she said. ``I've got  
the stereo cranked. I've got the microwave and the dishwasher on. 
Everything! I don't care how much the bill is! I don't even really 
pay attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her nonchalance sounds quaint is a world where ``energy  
efficient'' and ``energy conservation'' long ago entered common 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s, the national appetite for power grew about 7  
percent annually, but the growth rate has shrunk to about 2 percent 
a year -- even with the strong economy. That makes it harder for 
utilities to pay off nuclear construction debts. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, big debt paid for little but frustration. The  
$5.5 billion Shoreham plant on Long Island, crippled by safety 
fears, never opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two operating plants so far have asked to renew their  
40-year licenses. The licenses of 56 reactors expire in the next 20 
years, but industry officials acknowledge some likely will close 
long before. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, it often takes more than twice as many workers to  
run a nuclear plant as an equivalent one with fossil fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	For another, aging nuclear plants increasingly need big-ticket  
replacement of generators, turbines and even reactor cores made 
brittle by decades of neutron bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
	San Onofre has been installing new turbines for its two active  
units at about $30 million each. Owners of Yankee Rowe in 
Massachusetts, the granddaddy of plants, shut it down in 1992 after 
32 years instead of buying a new $23 million reactor vessel to 
cradle its radioactive core. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in states like Pennsylvania, regulators are expected  
to bar utilities from recovering much of their nuclear construction 
debt through consumer rates during the changeover to competitive 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in the industry are embracing two plant sales in the works  
as a sign of hope. An international partnership has even arranged 
to buy the Three Mile Island reactor that did not melt down and 
later came back on line. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is going for just $23 million. It was built for $400  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears to me the way to sell a nuclear plant is to pay  
someone to take it off your hands,'' says Kennedy Maize, editor of 
the Electricity Daily trade newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office says up to 26 plants appear  
vulnerable to shutdown simply because their production costs are 
higher than the projected price of electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry is banking heavily on an expanding market for  
American nuclear technology in Japan, Taiwan and other Asian 
countries over the next 20 years. France depends on nuclear plants 
for 78 percent of its power. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental distaste, though, has dimmed nuclear prospects in  
Germany, Sweden and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the future growth is predicted in developing nations  
without the centralized grids of power lines to accommodate big 
nuclear plants. Fear of spreading material and know-how for nuclear 
weapons is also braking nuclear energy in other lands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those things that seems to be good for a while,  
and then something else comes along,'' says nuclear physicist 
Thomas B. Johansson, who oversees international energy development 
at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	In a final indignity, even the costs of walking away from  
nuclear power have soared. Taking apart Zion unit 2 in Zion, Ill., 
is estimated at $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of San Onofre 1, which closed in 1992, decided this year  
to take it out of cold storage and dismantle it quickly, before it 
gets even more costly. They project decommissioning at $460 million 
over seven years for the small 450-megawatt reactor. 
</P>
<P>
	Around the country, more than 42,000 tons of potentially lethal  
radioactive waste fuel await federal pickup under a legally binding 
government promise. Government officials say it is safest to store 
centrally under federal control. It is now kept mostly in cooling 
pools not designed for permanent safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
	A permanent national repository is proposed deep underground at  
Yucca Mountain, Nev. But it won't be ready until 2010 at the 
earliest, according to government officials. It is projected to 
cost $36 billion to build, license, supply with used fuel, run, and 
seal by the year 2116. 
</P>
<P>
	Once promised for 1998, the project has stumbled over  
not-in-my-backyard politics and fears about whether the geology is 
stable enough to isolate radioactive waste for 10,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate Energy  
Committee, says the government should set up a temporary waste site 
at Yucca to relieve utilities. But that idea has met strong 
opposition, too. ``The industry is strangling on its waste,'' 
Murkowski said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts say the nation could weather a slow death of  
nuclear power fairly well. 
</P>
<P>
	They say natural gas, which now supplies about 10 percent of  
power, can and will do much more. Dozens of gas generators are 
under construction. 
</P>
<P>
	But renewable resources, like solar and wind power, have  
progressed slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers of nuclear power say the nation can't attain  
international limits on greenhouse gases without atomic energy. 
</P>
<P>
	James Hewlett, an economist with the Energy Department says coal  
might be needed to pick up some slack. But Daniel Becker, an energy 
expert at the Sierra Club environmental group, says that's like 
``giving up smoking and taking up crack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe nuclear power was fundamentally flawed: steeped in danger  
and, as environmentalists sometimes suggest, the most expensive way 
ever devised to boil water. Maybe nuclear plants are just too big 
and centralized to thrive in an era of smaller-is-better. 
</P>
<P>
	But others say a potentially enduring technology was simply  
mishandled: too many companies, designs, and bonds to adapt to the 
new world of private competition. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	A large, low ball of fire radiates the day's last sunbeams on  
San Onofre and the Pacific surf. Plant staffer Ray Golden, who has 
worked at five nuclear plants in 17 years, muses on the 
unthinkable: 
</P>
<P>
	``If the industry goes down the drain, it's just a very sad  
testament,'' he says. ``Maybe it was a technology before its 
time.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Acquitted of Drunk Driving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WRENTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- A woman was acquitted of drunken driving  
after claiming she failed four sobriety tests because she feared 
she would be beaten by her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	The battered woman's syndrome defense is often used in murder  
cases, but Kathleen Barrett is one of the first defendants to use 
the strategy against a drunken-driving charge, said her attorney, 
Victor Sloan. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury found Barrett, 35, innocent of driving while under the  
influence. Instead, she was fined $35 for failing to stay in her 
lane. The jury deliberated less than two hours earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Sloan said Barrett and her husband, who were married 9 years,  
had a physically and emotionally abusive relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, her driving was impaired, but it was not because of  
alcohol,'' Sloan said. ``It was because of the effect the abusive 
relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She told police she drank three beers Jan. 23 over a four-hour  
period, but claimed she was not intoxicated. Barrett refused to 
take a Breathalyzer test and failed parts of four sobriety tests. 
</P>
<P>
	She had been looking for her husband who had stormed off after  
an argument. Sloan said Barrett feared she'd be beaten if she 
didn't find him.

<HEADLINE> Players Championship Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Three days ago, Skip Kendall  
needed help getting out of bed. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Beth, had to help him put his socks on. She started  
teasing him, saying their nine-month-old son Noah could get around 
better than he could. 
</P>
<P>
	So while everybody else complained about the weather Saturday at  
The Players Championship, Kendall was simply happy to be playing -- 
then contending. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall overcame a bad back to shoot a 2-under-par 70 to finish  
at 3-under-par 213, just two strokes back of David Duval after 
three rounds at the windswept Tournament Players Club at Sawgrass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thinking more about if I can play the next day rather than  
where I am in the tournament,'' said Kendall, who is seeking his 
first career PGA tournament victory. ``Maybe that is a blessing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble began at the first practice hole Wednesday, when he  
bent over to pluck his ball out of the hole. He wrenched his back, 
could barely walk and quit the round before even getting to the No. 
2 tee box. 
</P>
<P>
	After an evening of intense therapy, he practically crawled out  
of bed and decided to head out to the course to see if he could 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Billy Ray Brown, the first alternate, he was watching me like  
a hawk,'' Kendall said. ``But it loosened up enough to where it 
hasn't really affected me on the golf course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His first two rounds of 70 and 73 were barely notable. But when  
the wind kicked up and the field tightened, Kendall was there to 
take advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the troubles involving heavy winds, thick roughs and  
slick greens, Kendall said it was almost a relief to have another 
distraction, the nagging pain, to keep him occupied. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts more when I miss-hit because when you kind of clank  
it, the vibration goes up the shaft,'' he said. ``It makes me work 
harder on hitting it solid.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	TERRIBLE TWOSOME:@ Davis Love III played 16 holes well. The  
other two were complete disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	His playing partner, Bruce Lietzke, left the course envying the  
day Love had. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of those rounds -- with no help from the weather, of  
course -- for the twosome playing behind the lead group of Duval and 
Joe Ozaki. 
</P>
<P>
	Love had a pair of 7s, a triple bogey on the par-4 first and a  
quad on the par-3 17th island hole, to finish the day at 6-over 78 
and 2-over for the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was two holes, I made two 7s, that says it all,'' Love  
said. ``It was one of the worst days of golf on this course that 
I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lietzke's day was even worse, although maybe less dramatic.  
</P>
<P>
	He three-putted No. 1. He missed 5-foot putts to save par on  
Nos. 3 and 5. He started at 5-under and shot 8-over par 80 to join 
Love in falling from the second group on Saturday to anonymity 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``With both me and Davis, some of it was self-inflicted,''  
Lietzke said. ``But some of it was well-struck golf shots that 
ended up in places where it was impossible to recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	JOE'S BAD DAY:@ Ozaki also melted down, shooting a 9-over 81 to  
fall from the lead into a five-way tie for 20th at 2 over. 
</P>
<P>
	It was reminiscent of last year, when he held the lead after two  
rounds and sunk to 18th place by the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozaki, who speaks little English, fielded questions through  
translator Robert Turner. When a reporter asked if thoughts of last 
year crept into Ozaki's mind, Turner refused to relay the question. 
</P>
<P>
	The discussion then turned to the conditions and the double  
bogey Ozaki had to open the round, immediately dropping him behind 
Duval for the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough getting control of my emotions,'' Ozaki said  
through the translator. ``Then, it was hard to maneuver the ball. 
You put it all together and it was a bad day.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	PHIL'S ODDITY:@ The winds dried out the greens and subjected  
Phil Mickelson to something he had never seen before. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the first hole, I had a putt that was just trickling up,  
just going by the hole,'' he said. ``It hit a spike mark and came 
backwards. That was when I knew it was going to be a long day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson was one of the survivors, however. He shot 1-under 71  
to finish at 3-under, tied with Kendall for second place. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	NOT FRIENDLY:@ Things were so bad for Bob Friend that he left  
the course not knowing what he shot. 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, it was a 15-over 87, ruining a good first two  
rounds in which he finished at 1 under. 
</P>
<P>
	His analysis was succinct.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hit the ball poorly,'' he said. ``I put the ball in every  
poor spot you possibly could on every single hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	DIVOTS:@ First-round leaders Bob Estes and Brian Watts fell  
further back. Estes shot 80 to balloon to 6 over; Watts shot 78 to 
finish at 4 over. ... No. 18 played at a healthy average of .759 
strokes above par. There were only three birdies out of 79 rounds 
played. ... The highest winning score in the tournament is a 1-over 
par 289 by Mark Hayes and Jack Nicklaus, back in 1977 and 1978. 
That's when the tournament was played at Sawgrass Country Club. ... 
Scott Hoch finished in a tie for fourth place at 1-under 215. He is 
looking for his third consecutive top-5 finish at the Players. ... 
Duval hit first on the 11th hole, even though he had a bogey on No. 
10 and Ozaki had a par. ``It was a slip, that's all,'' Duval said.

<HEADLINE> Deer Crossing Causes Fatal Wreck </HEADLINE>

<P>
	GERMANTOWN, Wis. (AP) -- A deer darted onto a six-lane highway,  
causing a series of accidents that left a husband and wife dead and 
six other motorists injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The accidents began about 10:30 p.m. Friday on U.S. 41 north of  
Milwaukee when the couple flipped their sport utility vehicle after 
either hitting the deer or trying to avoid it, police said.

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Gonzalez Changes His Ways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Like a lot of other young superstars-to-be,  
Jeremi Gonzalez was smart enough to know he had a real gift, and 
hardheaded enough that he didn't need anyone to tell him what to do 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Cubs would tell the right-hander to lose weight, and  
he'd eat another hamburger. Hey, he was winning ball games, lots of 
them. What did an extra pound or two matter? 
</P>
<P>
	But when his right elbow gave out in the middle of a game last  
July and doctors told him to forget about playing for the rest of 
the season, Gonzalez grew up in a hurry. Suddenly, that advice that 
had gone in one ear and out the other started making sense. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing I thought was, `What am I doing? Don't play?'  
I know I'm young, but (a year) is a long time,'' he said. ``When 
the doctors told me it would only be six or seven months, I 
thought, `I'm going to work hard to come back.''' 
</P>
<P>
	And the hard work is paying off. Originally expected to be out  
as long as a year after having ulnar nerve surgery last August on 
his pitching elbow, Gonzalez is on track to pitch for the Cubs in 
mid-May. He might even have been ready for opening day, but a case 
of the flu set him back two weeks, trainer Dave Tumbas said. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw batting practice Friday for the first time since  
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was nervous a little bit,'' he admitted. ``But after I threw  
the first pitch, it was like before. Everything's coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's some of the best news the Cubs have had this spring. With  
Kerry Wood out with a season-ending elbow injury, Chicago is 
looking for help, and Gonzalez has the talent to make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
	As a rookie in 1997, he was the club's winningest pitcher (11-9)  
despite spending the first two months of the season at Triple-A 
Iowa. He pitched a four-hit shutout in his sixth start, and had a 
five-game winning streak in the middle of the summer. In a 
four-start span early last year, he went 3-1 with a complete game 
shutout and a 1.86 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a problem with Gonzalez: his work ethic.  
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, he's always been a real fun guy to be around,''  
manager Jim Riggleman said. ``But I think he realizes he was taking 
some things for granted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez smiles when he hears this.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first time working so hard,'' he said. ``Extra  
work. Every day. Before, it was tough. Now I love it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he's not just talking. Riggleman had been telling him for a  
couple of years he needed to drop a few pounds from his 6-foot-2, 
218-pound frame. It never happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like, `I'm fat. I'm getting people out, so I'll stay  
fat,''' Riggleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gonzalez hit the weights and changed his diet while he was  
rehabilitating. Hamburgers became a thing of the past. Now he 
munches on salads. 
</P>
<P>
	He lost so much weight -- he's down to 204 now -- he had to buy  
new clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	His breaking ball and fastball are better, he said, and he's got  
a changeup now, too. After watching his batting practice workout, 
pitching coach Marty DeMerritt couldn't praise him enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marvelous. Absolutely outstanding,'' DeMerritt said. ``This is  
kind of a minor miracle considering he was supposed to be out for a 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez will likely stay in Mesa for extended spring training,  
and then do a rehabilitation assignment in the minors. Finally, 
after that, it should be back to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good, I feel proud of me,'' Gonzalez said.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Talk Heats Up in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Marcelo Sanchez is getting more steamed by the  
minute. Shouting so loudly his '70s-style White Sox cap almost 
falls off, he takes on all comers, shaking his finger in the faces 
of those who dare to dispute him. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to the Esquina Caliente, the so-called ``Hot Corner'' in  
Havana where Cuban baseball fans love to quarrel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The arguments here are very strong,'' the 69-year-old Sanchez  
said Saturday. ``We have been doing this for many years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From a block away, it's easy to hear them. More than 250 people,  
crammed into a plaza in Parque Central in the city's Old Havana 
section. They come out daily, debating from 9 a.m. to midnight 
beneath the palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the personality of the Cuban people,'' said Louis  
Zamora, 32, of Havana. ``They talk in a loud voice. They argue, but 
never fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the soldiers and policemen who walk past barely bat an  
eye. Office workers, hotel employees and store owners, men from all 
occupations cluster. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only hombres,'' Zamora said. ``I have never seen a woman take  
part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And on this day, there is plenty of ``pelota'' -- baseball -- to  
talk about. The main topic is this: Which is more important, the 
Baltimore Orioles' game Sunday against a Cuban national team or the 
ongoing playoff series between the Havana Industriales and Santiago 
for the Cuban championship? 
</P>
<P>
	``They both mean a lot,'' said Jose Bereuguer, 34. ``The  
championship is big to us, but tomorrow is history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is quickly surrounded by a circle of fans, screaming that the  
Orioles game is nothing more than an exhibition. They challenge him 
Earl Weaver-style, yelling nose-to-nose and nonstop -- there may be 
more important, more pressing issues on this Communist island, but 
not to these guys. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Cubans are curious about the Orioles, mainly because  
no big league team has visited the country in 40 years. Many fans 
feel the Cuban club, hurt by defections and missing several stars 
involved in the current playoffs, stand little chance against 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am eager to see how big they are. I am eager to see how  
their uniforms look,'' said Omar Ramirez, 32. ``We have never seen 
anything like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Major league games are not broadcast on television or radio in  
Cuba, meaning magazines and bootleg tapes sent by relatives are 
often the only contacts. It creates an odd mix of information, some 
of it up to date and some of it far behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know plenty about the Orioles,'' Felix Sansirena announced,  
waving a copy of Sports Illustrated that featured a story on Roger 
Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	He knew, for example, that Cal Ripken had broken Lou Gehrig's  
record for consecutive games played. He also knew Ripken was not 
coming to Cuba because his father died Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he asked, ``What about Palmeiro? Is Rafael Palmeiro going  
to play?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmeiro left the Orioles in December, signing with the Texas  
Rangers as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter. The debates rage on about strategy, the Cuban style  
and other subjects, such as should Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez 
be considered a traitor for defecting and whether the New York 
Yankees will ever visit. 
</P>
<P>
	All at a heated pitch in the Hot Corner.  
</P>
<P>
	``They will never solve the arguments, not today or any day,''  
Zamora noted with a smile. ``They will be out here tomorrow 
again.''

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Cemetery Advertises Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- FOR SALE: Lots in quiet gated community  
overlooking James River. Residents include two former U.S. 
presidents and several war heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overlooking the James River, it has one of the most  
spectacular views in Richmond,'' the radio commercial says. ``Since 
the turn of the century, it has been a favorite spot for family 
outings. In the 1920s, it became one of the city's most popular 
Sunday drives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sales campaign sounds like a come-on for a ritzy new real  
estate development. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it's for the 150-year-old Hollywood Cemetery.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a big misconception we keep hearing that Hollywood  
must be full because it's so old, but that's not true,'' said David 
L. Gilliam, the cemetery's general manager. ``Some people also 
think that you have to have relatives buried here or be rich to be 
buried in Hollywood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, anyone can choose the same final resting place as  
presidents James Monroe and John Tyler, Confederate President 
Jefferson Davis and several Confederate generals, most notably 
J.E.B. Stuart. And it's on the National Register of Historic 
Places. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have quite a few spaces left in our new section, and a  
considerable selection remaining in our mausoleum,'' Gilliam said. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional 1,200 to 1,500 spaces will be available next year,  
too. Burial plots can be had for $1,500; mausoleum space runs from 
$1,500 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Such aggressive advertising by a cemetery is not as unusual as  
it used to be, said Kelly Smith, spokesman for the National Funeral 
Directors Association, based in Brookfield, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Businesses that provide funeral goods and services are  
learning that they have to rely more on conventional business 
advertising and less on their longevity, reputation and name 
recognition,'' Smith said.

<HEADLINE>  Russian Tops Kwan for Skating Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Maria Butyrskaya of Russia, thought to  
be too old and too skittish to be figure skating world champion, 
took the title from Michelle Kwan Saturday with a dynamic and solid 
performance that left her younger and usually steadier rival with 
the silver. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya, 26, had stumbled in previous high-pressure finals,  
but she was clearly in command from the opening moments of her 
free-skating program, leading off with a soaring triple lutz to a 
piano concerto by Raul di Blasio. 
</P>
<P>
	The serious music and pure white dress were a distinct contrast  
to her short program Friday, when she wore hot red and skated to a 
moaning blues. But the common factor in the two routines was her 
energy and assurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I skated like a woman and showed I can control my nerves,''  
said Butyrskaya, who became the oldest-ever women's champion. ``Age 
isn't very important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the nine judges gave her 5.9s for presentation, the other  
marks were 5.8s. She landed seven triple jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan, the defending champion, lacked her usual sparkle, and  
seemed tentative technically, converting a planned double axel into 
a single and landing her opening triple lutz a bit awkwardly. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlining the contrast between the two, Butyrskaya's final  
jump was a clean and vigorous double axel. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old Kwan had caught a cold en route to Helsinki, and  
although she'd overcome it by the end of the week, it had 
undermined her earlier practices -- and her confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, ``I felt OK ... but my cold probably hit me harder  
psychologically,'' she said. ``I was fighting inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan's long program, to Jules Massenet's symphonic piece  
``Lamento d'Ariane,'' was distinctly stronger than Friday's short 
program, when she fell on a double axel. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the performance, I fought,'' Kwan said. ``And that's  
why I'm satisfied now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she had ended the short program in fourth place, while  
Butyrskaya was in first. Under this year's new scoring system, 
Butyrskaya would have had to place third or lower in the free 
skating for Kwan to have a chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
	From the moment Butyrskaya ended her routine with a triumphant  
arm raise, her face working with emotion, it was clear that Kwan 
was out of contention. 
</P>
<P>
	Julia Soldatova of Russia, the bronze medalist, completed a  
triple salchow-triple toe loop, the only skater to do that 
combination in the final program. 
</P>
<P>
	American Sarah Hughes, at 13 the championships' youngest  
entrant, finished seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya's victory completed a sweep for the Russian team.  
</P>
<P>
	Alexei Yagudin won the men's title with a brilliant free skating  
display of a quad and eight triple jumps. In all, there were 14 
quads done by men at the world championships, the most ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze took the pairs title  
amid a controversy where two judges appeared to be seen to be 
conversing and exchanging signals during the competition. A 
technically superior but less artistic Chinese pair was second. 
</P>
<P>
	In ice dancing, Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov won on a  
5-4 decision over a French couple.

<HEADLINE> Video Attacks Stereotypes of Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Maryanne Reed didn't realize how  
pervasive the stereotyping of Jews had become until she heard 
Hebrew spoken with a twang. It caught her off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, a West Virginia University journalism professor and a Jew,  
was researching Jewish communities for a documentary about their 
struggle to maintain a cultural identity. While filming at Temple 
Beth El in Beckley, Reed met Tom Sopher, a member of the temple's 
board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect to hear somebody speak Hebrew with a West  
Virginia accent. It just seems weird,'' Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor did she believe Sopher looks Jewish. He has red hair, pale  
skin and freckles. ``He's Opie!'' Reed said, referring to Ron 
Howard's character on ``The Andy Griffith Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was the point of the video. In helping others rid  
themselves of stereotypes, Reed unexpectedly confronted her own. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 30-minute film, ``Righteous Remnant: Jewish Survival in  
Appalachia,'' won a community history award last year at the Jewish 
Video Competition in Berkeley, Calif. It led to a lesson plan that 
a handful of middle and high school teachers around the state are 
now using. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean Hammersmith, a teacher at University High School in  
Morgantown, used the film in her social studies class to probe the 
idea of family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's an example of where family values are very important,  
and people are willing to sacrifice a lot for them,'' Hammersmith 
said. ``So much of what we do as Christians is in a church setting. 
Jewish people do it in a home setting, so it really is an exercise 
in the family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Reed, the project was an exploration of her heritage. Her  
great-grandfather Simon Fox was an immigrant from Lithuania who 
moved to Tucker County in the 1890s. His family -- 10 children, two 
parents -- was the only Jewish one in Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to experience some kind of religious community,''  
Reed said. ``So they would all split up... and they would go to 
church. But they still maintained their Jewish identity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox and his family eventually left West Virginia, moving to Ohio  
around 1910 so the children could find Jewish spouses. 
</P>
<P>
	When she began her project, Reed, a former TV news writer and  
producer, assumed Jews had faced prejudice. So she was taken aback 
by the intermingling of Jews and Christians. In some towns, 
churches and temples help each other raise money and open their 
services to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``You buy into the stereotype of Appalachians being unfriendly  
to outsiders, clannish,'' she said. So what she discovered about 
the Jews surprised her. ``They were accepted -- in some cases, 
tolerated -- but mostly accepted as being important members of the 
community.''

<HEADLINE> Social Security Reforms Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans last week pushed through Congress  
a budget blueprint that would set aside for Social Security the 
bulk of coming government surpluses, much as President Clinton 
wants. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawmakers are no closer to agreement on an overall plan to  
strengthen the nation's retirement system. Some even are doubting 
that Republicans and Democrats can reach agreement this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say there's less than a 50 percent chance,'' said Rep.  
Nick Smith of Michigan, a leading Republican advocate of Social 
Security reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and congressional Republicans generally agree that the  
portion of government surpluses that comes from Social Security 
taxes from workers' paychecks -- rather than from income taxes -- 
should not fund other programs or tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Both also propose the money could go toward paying down the  
government's public debt. 
</P>
<P>
	That is a good start, say prominent economists including Federal  
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Paying down the debt to private 
bondholders likely would help the economy grow and make it easier 
for the nation to support increasing numbers of senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greenspan, at a private meeting with a handful of House  
members last week, repeated warnings that a difficult choice still 
looms: whether to devote more money to programs for the elderly in 
the future, both Social Security and Medicare, or to cut retirement 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got to be somewhat more than taking some of the surplus  
now and setting it aside,'' said Smith, who attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before they get to such difficult choices, however,  
Republicans and Democrats already face political tensions over 
their differences on the first step, what to do with the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those differences: how much of the surplus immediately  
would be off-limits and whether to make specific commitments to 
Social Security and Medicare in conjunction with debt reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have attacked Clinton for seeking to spend about $50  
billion of the Social Security surplus on other things in his 2000 
budget, which includes increases in education and defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's wrong, and this will put a stop to it once and for  
all,'' Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., said of the competing GOP budget 
proposal. It passed the House and Senate on mostly party-line votes 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP hopes to gain political advantage with that message. The  
Republican National Committee, testing it in a recent poll, found 
that most Americans agree ``it would be reckless and wrong to spend 
the money on anything other than Social Security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials say, however, the money spent on other  
things would be made up to Social Security later in the president's 
15-year budget plan, when surplus income taxes are expected to 
become available. In 2000, the budget surplus will come solely from 
Social Security taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Democrats note that in the long run, Clinton would devote  
an additional $700 billion to Medicare from the surpluses expected 
to come from income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republican lawmakers instead favor income tax cuts once  
those income-tax surpluses become available. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republicans want it both ways. They promise big tax cuts,  
and they say they are keeping money for Social Security and 
Medicare,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Further, Democrats say the preliminary GOP budget outline makes  
no specific financial commitments to Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``It still does not do enough,'' President Clinton said.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans counter that Clinton makes only paper promises to  
the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, which eventually will 
have to be made good with tax dollars or borrowing. They want 
cost-control changes first. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan ``does nothing more than throw new IOUs at the  
problem and avoids tough choices,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP budget plan includes a ``safety deposit box'' provision  
designed to protect government surpluses coming from Social 
Security taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	With the huge baby boom generation still working, those taxes  
now exceed what is needed to pay benefits each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Republican plan, the surplus could be used in an  
overhaul of Social Security or Medicare. But if lawmakers cannot 
agree on changes, it would go toward reducing the public debt. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, under Clinton's plan, the Social Security surplus  
would go to debt reduction, no matter what. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Clinton would try to give Social Security and  
Medicare a tangible claim on the economic benefits resulting from a 
lower public debt: IOUs giving the programs a claim on income-tax 
dollars after baby boomers retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Any retirement program changes would be on top of that.

<HEADLINE> Women's Final Four Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- After dishing out seven assists to help  
Duke shock three-time defending champion Tennessee in the East 
Regional final last Monday, Hilary Howard expected a heroine's 
welcome back home in Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she encountered a group of kids who found it hard to  
believe the 5-foot-6 point guard was about to lead the Blue Devils 
into the NCAA tournament Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	The day after that upset, Howard went to the local YMCA to watch  
her boyfriend play in a game. Someone came over to congratulate 
her, leading to questions from a group of young onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
	When the boys asked why she was being congratulated, Howard said  
she was Duke's point guard. The youngsters refused to believe her. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I am,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, you must ride the bench,'' the boys replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Howard tried to convince the youngsters she indeed was the  
starting point guard, '' but after about 30 seconds I gave up and 
said I'm not on the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PECK'S ROLE:* Purdue coach Carolyn Peck will be only the second  
black woman to coach in an NCAA basketball national title game when 
her Boilermakers face Duke on Sunday night. She joins Vivian 
Stringer of Cheyney State in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Peck, who will be coaching her final game at Purdue and moving  
on to the coaching job with the Orlando Miracle of the WNBA, 
downplayed that distinction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say it's because of the color of my skin that I am  
where I am, it's because of this team,'' she said Saturday on the 
eve of the national championship game. ``I hope I can be a good 
role model for all women, little girls, little boys, not gender 
specific.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her players were not as willing to downplay the importance of  
Peck's achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a tremendous honor for her,'' center Camille  
Cooper said. ``She's definitely a role model for everyone, 
especially African-American females. It lets others know they can 
do the same thing she did with the same amount of work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Michelle Duhart said she also was personally inspired  
by Peck. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a role model for everyone, but for me being an  
African-American woman she's exceptional,'' Duhart said. ``She 
might downplay it, but it's important for any woman to see the 
success that she has achieved. She's a remarkable woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *A SPECIAL KISS:* After scoring 22 points Friday night against  
Georgia to lead Duke into the national championship game, Nicole 
Erickson got hugs and congratulations from her teammates and fans. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was a simple gesture from her younger brother,  
18-year-old Kirk Erickson, that meant the most to the Blue Devils' 
shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a kiss on the cheek from my younger brother. I thought I  
was going to pass out,'' she said. ``It was amazing to see him show 
that emotion.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MISCELLANEOUS:* Purdue, ranked No. 1 in the final poll this  
season, has history on its side. The top-ranked team has reached 
the championship game six previous times, and has won each time. 
The other No. 1 teams that went on to win the NCAA title were 
Louisiana Tech (1982), Southern California (1983), Texas (1986), 
Tennessee (1989 and 1998) and Connecticut (1995).

	--''He definitely did not accomplish his goal. What he did was  
bring about his own self-destruction ... not the goal of continuing 
to make advancements to protect the freedom of all of us against 
government interference.'' -- Geoffrey Fieger, Kevorkian's former 
attorney. 

</P>
<P>
	-- ``We believe the verdict should have been premeditated murder,  
but we're very elated by the second-degree verdict. We want to see 
Jack Kevorkian imprisoned for life. It's clear he has no respect 
for the law, but even less respect for people with disabilities.'' 
-- Diane Coleman, president of an organization called Not Dead Yet.

<HEADLINE> Stephen Got Even Wins at Turfway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ky. (AP) -- Stephen Got Even, trained by Nick Zito,  
circled the field on the far turn and pulled away in the stretch to 
win the $750,000 Gallery Furniture.com Stakes at Turfway Park 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Straight Man, trained by Bob Baffert, went off the 2-1 favorite.  
He set a slow pace and led to the top of the stretch. Then jockey 
Shane Seller made a big move on the outside with Stephen Got Even 
and pulled away through the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning time for the 1 1/8-mile race was 1:49 on a fast track --  
well off Hansel's track record of 1:46 3-5 in this race when it was 
called the Jim Beam Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Got Even finished 2 1/2 lengths ahead of K One King. Epic  
Honor was third, and Straight Man faded to fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert had spent most of the day in airplanes to see Straight  
Man's Triple Crown potential in person. 
</P>
<P>
	From Dubai, where Silver Charm is running in the $5 million  
Dubai World Cup Sunday, Baffert spent eight hours on a plane to 
London, caught another flight to New York, then took a private jet 
to Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, which is 
nearly adjacent to Turfway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived on the grounds about 45 minutes before post time.  
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Got Even paid $16, $7 and $5.20. K One King returned  
$4.60 and $3.80. Epic Honor was $5 to show.

<HEADLINE> Dad Sentenced in Kid's Heat Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- A man who left his daughter and another  
baby to die in his stifling car while he searched for arrowheads 
and mushrooms has been sentenced to 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Crisp, 24, could have been sentenced Friday to 40 years.  
He was convicted of second-degree murder in the deaths of his 
daughter, 16-month-old Vicky Crisp, and her cousin, 4-month-old 
Sidney Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls died of heat exhaustion and dehydration after the  
temperature in the black car reached at least 130 degrees last 
April. Prosecutors have said the pain was so severe that Vicky 
pulled out her hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Tom Keith followed the recommendation of jurors, who had  
been asked by Crisp's mother to be lenient. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ricky has already been punished,'' said Virginia Crisp. ``He's  
been punished for life. He says he doesn't like to go to town 
because he might see some babies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Brad Butler asked for the maximum. ``I encourage you  
to speak for these children,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crisp's friend, Justin Griffith, 28, pleaded guilty this month  
to manslaughter and awaits sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith said he and Crisp didn't plan to look for arrowheads  
and mushrooms for long, but lost track of time because they had 
taken drugs and alcohol.

<HEADLINE> Kasparaitis' Surgery Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Penguins defenseman Darius  
Kasparaitis underwent knee surgery on Wednesday and is expected to 
return to the team sometime early next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The defenseman injured his knee in the preseason but managed to  
play 48 games until his skate caught in a rut March 5 during a game 
against Edmonton and did more damage to the knee ligaments. He 
hasn't played since. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's operation was the second reconstructive surgery on  
Kasparaitis' right knee in four years. He underwent surgery in New 
York and expects to rehabilitate over the summer at his Long Island 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasparaitis said earlier this month he would go to Russia to  
avoid watching the team in the playoffs without him. He is eligible 
to become a restricted free agent after this season.

<HEADLINE> Gore Swings Through New Hampshire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore on Saturday took his  
presidential campaign to a living room that helped launch Jimmy 
Carter and Bill Clinton into the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore greeted about 70 people in the home of Democratic activist  
and former Mayor Martin Gross. As he did throughout his two-day 
stay in New Hampshire -- site of the first presidential primary in 
2000 -- Gore stressed saving Medicare and Social Security, the 
environment, and education. 
</P>
<P>
	``No Democratic presidential candidate who has campaigned in  
this house has failed to get elected president at some point,'' 
Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton visited the residence before placing a welcomed second  
in the 1992 state primary, and Carter came here before winning the 
1976 primary. Gore visited in 1988, when he failed to win the 
Democratic nomination, and now has a second chance, Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore addressed a forum on home health care in Portsmouth and  
spoke at a Democratic dinner in Conway on Friday. He spent Saturday 
meeting with voters in homes in Concord, Manchester and Nashua. 
</P>
<P>
	During most of the trip, Gore did what his advisers have been  
wanting him to do: shed his stiff image and talk to people 
one-on-one. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what he needs to do,'' said Bill Shaheen, his state  
campaign manager and Gov. Jeanne Shaheen's husband. ``He's going 
into real parlors, meeting real people, hearing real questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recent polls have shown that while most Americans are pleased  
with Gore's performance as vice president, they don't see him as a 
strong leader. He has trailed two Republicans, former American Red 
Cross President Elizabeth Dole and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, in 
head-to-head matchups. 
</P>
<P>
	But several voters who met Gore this weekend, including lawyer  
Sean O'Connell, said they found Gore more exciting than his 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think he's a little wooden, but it's not true,''  
O'Connell said. ``He really can connect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After jogging five miles through Concord -- he runs at least  
three miles a day, according to the Secret Service -- Gore surprised 
customers with a Saturday stop at the Capitol City Diner. He joined 
some diners in their booths and told them he wants to raise the 
minimum wage and help the homeless.

<HEADLINE> Some Help Homeless on Spring Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Florida hot spots reel from close to a  
million spring break visitors, a dozen students from Chicago spent 
the week in Washington sleeping in a homeless shelter, painting 
buildings and helping unemployed women prepare for job interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	For Naureen Choudhury, a freshman at Chicago's DePaul  
University, the choice was simple: ``I can go to Cancun and get 
drunk with my friends, which is meaningless, or I can go broaden 
the scope of what I know about other people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many students still prefer to party. Panama City Beach, Fla.,  
alone estimates 500,000 people will flood in this year during 
spring break time. 
</P>
<P>
	But last year, 20,000 students from across the nation did some  
type of alternative break activity, estimates Break Away, an 
8-year-old group at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	And more and more campuses, uneasy about the binge drinking and  
violence associated with the annual break from school, are 
encouraging and helping students to skip the revelry for higher 
pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``This generation does want to make a difference,'' said Thomas  
Greene, a spokesman for Norwich University, a central Vermont 
school that sent several students to Washington to work in soup 
kitchens and build houses. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who participated last year in volunteer or charity  
work during spring break were students who tutored migrant farm 
workers in Florida, built homes in Appalachia, registered voters in 
rural Mississippi and worked with the homeless in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Among examples this year:  
</P>
<P>
	--University of San Diego students will tutor grade school  
children in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	--About 20 students from Siena College in Loudonville, N.Y., near  
Albany, will spend a week helping a Navajo community in Tohatchi, 
New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	--A choir at the University of Cincinnati spent its break on a  
tour that included historically black colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	Marquette University in Milwaukee has sponsored service spring  
breaks for more than 20 years and the University of Dayton, in 
Ohio, for about 10. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last couple of years, a string of drinking-related deaths  
and accidents at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
Louisiana State University and at other campuses and spring break 
spots have led officials and student leaders to increase efforts to 
deter drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	States and communities have set up task forces to work with  
local bars and restaurants to prevent underage drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	The alcohol industry also has curbed its spring break  
advertising to some degree. Budweiser has moved promotions off 
beaches and into bars to keep them away from underage drinkers, 
said Jack Dougherty, Anheuser-Busch's director of consumer 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	Community service is a natural replacement, said Nancy Schulte,  
coordinator of drug education services at George Mason University 
in Fairfax, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``The temptations are removed,'' Schulte said. ``The students  
are doing something worthwhile, and they can see the benefits of 
their activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some students don't stop with spring break. Sarah Holthouser, a  
junior at Salem College in Winston-Salem, N.C., spent the semester 
organizing an April 16 event during which about 200 college 
students will spend the night in a park to raise money for homeless 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	It's best to start volunteering when you're young, said  
Holthouser, 21. ``By the time they are older, it's become a habit 
to volunteer,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	DePaul sponsored 10 trips for 120 students this year, ranging  
from helping physically disabled children in Montgomery, Ala., to 
the homeless trip to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Choudhury, who is 18, and her fellow students weren't having  
much luck with their survey of the city's homeless. Many people 
sitting in a park near the White House simply refused to answer the 
students' questions about their health and housing history. 
</P>
<P>
	But the effort wasn't wasted, said Rebecca Amend, a 22-year-old  
senior who's always chosen such spring breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get to meet a quality level of people,'' said Amend.  
``Besides, I don't like the beach.''

<HEADLINE> Duke's Langdon Let Game Find Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- He did what the good ones always do  
when things go bad. Trajan Langdon let the game find him. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first two-thirds of Saturday night's semifinal, Duke's  
best player was more a rumor than a fact. He passed up his own 
shots and defended like a devil in blue instead. He crashed the 
boards and chased loose balls into the seats. He threw passes that 
split the seams in the Michigan State zone like a man freed from a 
yearlong diet. 
</P>
<P>
	But in that split-second when the game was there for the taking,  
Langdon never hesitated. He stepped forward and grabbed it by the 
throat. 
</P>
<P>
	With eight minutes left and the Spartans surging to within  
51-48, Langdon caught the ball on the right side behind the 3-point 
arc and let fly a jump shot. It was the same one that he'd taken a 
thousand times on frozen playgrounds in Alaska, except then he was 
still a schoolboy, stuck wearing gloves and a coat. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't matter. The result was the same.  
</P>
<P>
	``That,'' Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said once he had the chance  
to catch his breath, ``was the biggest shot of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State, playing a more physical brand of defense than  
Duke's football team was likely to encounter in the fall, pulled 
within 51-48 after Charlie Bell drained two free throws and some of 
the color out of Krzyzewski's face. 
</P>
<P>
	There were eight minutes to go, no easy shots to be had, and  
Duke's dominating big man, Elton Brand, was on the bench with his 
fourth foul. The huge rebounding edge the Blue Devils enjoyed in 
the first half while building a 32-20 lead was melting even faster 
than their confidence. A trio of Spartan defenders had taken turns 
stuck to Langdon like his shadow. 
</P>
<P>
	But when he peeled off his defender on a screen near the  
free-throw, Langdon squeezed out all the room he needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach told me to stay aggressive and my teammates did, too,''  
he said. ``That's a move I made a lot of times. At that point, I'm 
not worrying about my shooting. It's the national championship. I 
waited five years for this. I'm excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would be nice to report that the biggest basket of the game  
restored Duke's swagger and sent them cruising toward Monday 
night's match with Connecticut. But it would be incorrect. Langdon 
and then Corey Maggette missed the front end of one-on-ones at the 
free-throw line and the Spartans kept climbing back into the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the most magical of seasons can be undone by the smallest  
doubts, and what Langdon had done by stepping up in the biggest 
moment suddenly became contagious. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never saw any worry in their eyes,'' Michigan State's A.J.  
Granger recalled afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	And in short order, Langdon slipped into the background as Blue  
Devil guards William Avery and then Chris Carrawell, and then 
Brand, inserted back in the game, took turns taking over. Slowly, 
the rest of the Blue Devils got back into sync and Duke once again 
began to look like Duke. In the closing seconds, with the game 
already decided, Langdon went after a loose ball on the sideline, 
trying to protect a chronically hurt ankle without cheating on the 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't pretty, but it captured Langdon's effort on the night  
even better than the 3-point basket could have. 
</P>
<P>
	The ankle has been a problem since junior high school and he  
reinjured it as recently as the Atlantic Coast Conference 
tournament several weeks ago. It was so bad that for days, Langdon 
kept a compress sent to him by a Tlingit medicine man taped to the 
ankle, hoping to cut into his recovery time. 
</P>
<P>
	That he would risk reinjuring it again in the closing minutes of  
a game the Blue Devils already owned says everything about how much 
Langdon was determined to take the next step. 
</P>
<P>
	``Expect it? This is what I wanted to do the first day I got to  
Duke,'' he said. ``This is what I always wanted. But expect it? 
Never.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Driver in Wis. Van Crash Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JANESVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- The driver of a speeding van that  
crashed and killed seven young people has been charged with 
vehicular homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremy Holmes, 20, was charged Friday with seven counts of  
negligent vehicular homicide and five counts of causing great 
bodily harm. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes, of Clinton, Iowa, is accused of causing the van to roll  
over Thursday when he tried to switch places with a passenger after 
passing a police officer. Police said Holmes had so many tickets 
for speeding and other violations that he was not supposed to be 
driving in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Six people were killed at the scene; a seventh died Friday at a  
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The van, which police said was going at least 80 mph, was full  
of salespeople between the ages of 15 and 25 who were from as far 
away as Florida. They were heading to a Janesville motel where they 
had stayed for two weeks while they went on sales outings. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the young people were selling magazines for an  
organization called Yes, which in ads promised ``Absolute Fun.'' 
The Capital Times of Madison, one of the newspapers that ran the 
ads, reported that the phone number on the classified ad bill was 
that of Subscriptions Plus Inc. of Bethany, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor officials in Wisconsin and Oklahoma, along with federal  
labor investigators, said they are looking into the work practices 
of Subscriptions Plus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The information we're getting from the employees' families and  
friends, well, `startling' is a good word,'' Oklahoma Labor 
Commissioner Brenda Reneau said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	She claims the company and its associates have illegally hired  
minors as independent contractors. Ms. Reneau said workers are paid 
in cash and aren't given tax forms, and that their wages are based 
on commissions from the subscriptions they sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it comes to pay day, they're not getting anything at all.  
All the food and lodging is being deducted from their pay. It 
appears, on the surface, to be in violation of the 
employee-employer relationship,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Subscriptions Plus President Karleen Hillery said her company  
has done nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``They get to eat, whether they sell or whether they don't,''  
she told The Daily Oklahoman of Oklahoma City. ``They're 
responsible for their own taxes, and they're given a 1099 form at 
the end of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yes officials have not responded to repeated messages left  
seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Riley Drives Heat to Top of League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Pink panties. Metaphysical doctrine. Pat Riley even  
broke his toe once when he kicked a garbage can during one of his 
motivational speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, even the most jaded Miami Heat players couldn't help but  
watch in disbelief as their coach soaked his head in a tub of icy 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't see that every day, see a man put his head in a cold  
bucket of water which must have been 20 degrees,'' forward P.J. 
Brown said, chuckling. 
</P>
<P>
	Heat opponents often don't come up for air, either.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite a 1-3 start and the loss of starters Jamal Mashburn and  
Voshon Lenard to injuries, Miami has zoomed to the top of the NBA's 
Eastern Conference, tied with the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat followed their opening stumble by winning 17 of their  
next 19, including 11 in a row at home. Opponents failed to reach 
90 points 11 straight times, an NBA record since the shot clock was 
introduced in the 1954-55 season. Miami and Utah are the only teams 
this season to hold every opponent under 50 percent shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable what (Riley) does down there,'' Indiana  
coach Larry Bird said. ``He gets his guys to play at a level no one 
else in the league can compete with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The secret, say the Heat, lies not in Riley's madness but his  
method. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the system here,'' said guard Tim Hardaway, who along  
with Alonzo Mourning, form Miami's cornerstones. ``We don't change 
nothing for nobody. Our offense and defense runs the same. When 
somebody gets hurt, it's your turn to step up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The system is built on a three-pronged foundation: relentless  
conditioning, stifling defense and a knowledge of opponents that 
would rival any NFL team's film study. 
</P>
<P>
	As with any Riley-coached team, it all starts with defense. Even  
when Riley was guiding the Los Angeles Lakers, Magic Johnson and 
James Worthy were quick to acknowledge many of those fast-break 
points came off steals or defensive stops. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not as pretty in Miami, but no less effective.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense is based on the ``help'' concept, making sure nobody has  
to defend a great player alone. Players must know exactly where to 
funnel opposing players, and know whem weakside help will be 
arriving. There are always two scouts on the road, and reports are 
extensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going into games, you know what your opponent's going to do,''  
said guard Terry Porter, a newcomer to Riley's system after 13 
seasons in Portland and Minnesota. ``He's very prepared for what's 
going to occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A prime example came March 17 at Atlanta. With Miami clinging to  
an 86-85 lead and 19 seconds left, Hardaway and Dan Majerle quickly 
recognized the Hawks' favorite pick-and-roll play with Mookie 
Blaylock and Steve Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Majerle stepped up to jam the play. Hardaway fought through  
Smith's screen to stay in Blaylock's face. As time expired, 
Blaylock's awkward 19-foot jumper clanged off the rim. 
</P>
<P>
	Succeeding despite injuries is nothing new for Riley's Heat.  
Last season, Miami went 15-7 with Mourning out after knee surgery 
and 23-8 while Mashburn recovered from a broken thumb. One year 
earlier, Miami was 9-2 while Mourning recovered from a torn arch. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no reason to expect anybody not to do what they're  
capable of doing,'' said forward Keith Askins, a defensive 
specialist. ``We want guys to do the job they're supposed to do and 
things will take care of themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pieces fit together well. Porter, signed as a backup, is  
Miami's third-leading scorer and plays alongside Hardaway in crunch 
time. Clarence Weatherspoon, another free-agent pickup, ranks third 
on the team in rebounding. Askins clamps down on opposing big 
guards. Guard Rex Walters provides ball handling and timely 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's Mourning and Hardaway, each averaging nearly 20  
points per game. Mourning is the NBA's top shot-blocker and has 15 
double-doubles. Hardaway leads the league in 3-pointers and ranks 
among the top 10 in assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley remains a master at inspiring the troops. But for all of  
his high-minded, new-age talk, he's not beyond using crude 
motivational ploys. He once threw a pair of pink panties among 
players in the locker room to suggest they weren't playing hard 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Not long after the Heat began turning things around, the team  
was in Detroit when Riley told the story of a youngster who asked 
his coach for advice on how to win. The coach dunked the kid's head 
in a pond, holding it under for several seconds. When the gasping 
youngster emerged, the coach said: ``You will win when winning is 
as important as that next breath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami beat the Pistons, sweeping a stretch of three games in  
three nights. Afterward, Riley came into the locker room and knelt 
beside a bucket of icy water used by players to soak their ankles. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley asked his players if they wanted to dunk his head  
underwater. Hearing no takers, he submerged his head and stayed 
there so long that players got concerned. He finally came up, 
looked at them and said, ``Until your last breath. Until your last 
breath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown called the act ``an emotional booster.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I was shocked and bewildered a little, but also excited,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mashburn, recovering from a knee injury, will soon rejoin the  
Heat. Lenard's stress fracture in his leg should be healed by the 
playoffs. And more people now mention Miami as a favorite to become 
the first champion of the post-Michael Jordan era. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley wants to throw cold water on that talk.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're leading the Eastern Conference right now. The only thing  
we can do is surrender it,'' he said. ``How do you stay one step 
ahead of the posse and one step away from the street?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Count on Riley to go to extremes to figure it out.

<HEADLINE> Friend: Ark. Shooter Mad at Teacher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JONESBORO, Ark. (AP) -- One of the boys involved in last year's  
Jonesboro school shootings told an officer that the other shooter 
was mad at a teacher, according to an investigator's report. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by Craighead County Deputy Sheriff Terry McNatt was  
part of a case file on the shootings that was released last week by 
Deputy Prosecutor Mike Walden. Four students and a teacher died in 
the March 24 violence at Westside Middle School, and 10 other 
people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	McNatt said in his report that he heard one of the arresting  
officers ask Mitchell Johnson, then 13, and Andrew Golden, then 11, 
why they fired the shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``The suspect (Mitchell) said, `Andrew was mad at a teacher,''  
the report said.	   Mitchell and Andrew were sentenced to held until age 18 at the 
state Division of Youth Services for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no indication in McNatt's report of which teacher was  
the target of Andrew's anger. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew was in the class of sixth-grade teacher Shannon Wright,  
who died in the shooting. But the case file included ballistics 
reports indicating that the bullet that killed her was fired by 
Mitchell.

<HEADLINE> Turnovers Hurt Ohio State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Turnovers and transition were the  
reasons Ohio State made it to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday night, they were the reasons they lost.  
</P>
<P>
	In a 64-58 semifinal loss to Connecticut, Ohio State's guard  
trio of Scoonie Penn, Michael Redd and Brian Brown weren't able to 
take care of the ball nor could they take the ball away from the 
Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
	They couldn't say coach Jim O'Brien didn't warn them.  
</P>
<P>
	``Before the game, he said if we make mistakes that they would  
punish us,'' backup guard Boban Savovic said. ``He knew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a change, the Buckeyes ran into players who were just as  
fast and just as aggressive in the backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Hamilton had 24 points, Khalid El-Amin 18 and Ricky  
Moore six points for UConn (33-2), while Redd had 15 points, Penn 
11 and Brown five for the Buckeyes (27-9). 
</P>
<P>
	With its three guards, Ohio State made its run to the Final Four  
using quickness and speed. In victories over Murray State, Detroit, 
Auburn and St. John's, the Buckeyes never faced a team with a 
muscular front or a dominant big man. 
</P>
<P>
	And in those four wins, Ohio State had fewer turnovers than the  
opposition each game, totaling 38 and forcing 56. That difference 
more than offset a slight disadvantage in rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Buckeyes found out they didn't have an edge in quickness  
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just played a perfect game tonight and we didn't,''  
forward Jason Singleton said. ``They're a very good defensive team, 
very quick and very athletic and they matched up with us at every 
position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State finished with 11 turnovers -- nine in the first half.  
Even though they forced the Huskies into 14 turnovers, the Buckeyes 
seldom were able to capitalize. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made stupid, stupid mistakes,'' Savovic said. ``They played  
such great defense and such great transition basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a night when UConn's offense wasn't in perfect synch, either,  
the Huskies took control by shutting the Buckeyes down. 
</P>
<P>
	With El-Amin and Moore in charge, UConn didn't pick up its first  
turnover until the second half was more than half over. But it did 
pick up points, off long passes, particularly to El-Amin, for easy 
layups. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a way of making you uncomfortable,'' O'Brien said.  
``We gave up so many baskets in transition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Their transition game is the best we've seen,'' Penn said.  
``When we would make a mistake or miss a shot, they were leaking 
out. ... They got a lot of fast breaks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun said defense was the difference.  
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight came down to their ability to guard us, particularly  
in the second half,'' O'Brien said. ``And their explosiveness on 
offense -- every poor shot and turnover translated into easy baskets 
by them.''

<HEADLINE> Holyfield Files for Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAYETTEVILLE, Ga. (AP) -- Heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield  
has filed for divorce, six months after a public admission that he 
fathered two children out of wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield filed papers Friday in Fayette County Superior Court  
to dissolve his 2 1/2-year marriage with Janice Holyfield. The filing 
comes two weeks after Holyfield's boxing stature was tainted in a 
disputed draw with Lennox Lewis in a title unification bout. 
</P>
<P>
	The court document said the marriage ``is irretrievably broken  
and there exists no possibility of reconciliation. The boxer seeks 
joint custody of the couple's 6-month-old son, Elijah, and a 
judgment that would allow him to keep `all of his separate 
property' and `an equitable portion of the marital property.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield has nine children, including three with his first  
wife, Paulette, and five others with four women out of wedlock. 
Paulette Holyfield received a divorce settlement of about $4 
million in 1991 after six years of marriage. Infidelity was the 
basis of that divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield has grossed $205 million in ring purses during his  
professional career, including $92 million for his past five fights 
during his marriage to the former Dr. Janice Itson, whom he met at 
a religious crusade in Philadelphia in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple also built a $15 million, 54,000-square-foot mansion  
in Fayette County south of Atlanta. Holyfield has been living in 
the mansion while his wife and the baby have lived in the boxer's 
older home next door since his public admission of infidelity last 
year.

<HEADLINE> Wife of Hornets Owner Wants Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- The wife of Charlotte Hornets owner George  
Shinn has filed for divorce in the wake of two women accusing her 
husband of sexual assaults. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolyn Shinn cites as grounds for the divorce that the couple  
have lived apart for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents filed in Mecklenburg County do not include terms  
of a possible financial settlement. The couple recently reached an 
agreement after months of negotiation, The Charlotte Observer 
reported today, quoting unnamed sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shinns recently have been dividing real estate holdings,  
titling property in Myrtle Beach, S.C., and two homes in Charlotte 
in Carolyn Shinn's name. George Shinn retained a house in Jupiter, 
Fla., and a waterfront home in Tega Cay, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tega Cay home was described as the scene where two women  
said they were sexually assaulted by Shinn in separate incidents 
before he and his wife separated. Shinn said the sex with both 
women was consensual. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shinns, who married in 1972, could not be reached Friday.  
Their attorneys declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	A property settlement with Carolyn Shinn was not a major factor  
in George Shinn's recent efforts to sell a substantial interest in 
the Hornets, The Observer reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The franchise, which Shinn won for Charlotte in 1987, is valued  
at more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina's equitable-distribution law directs that nearly  
all assets accumulated during a marriage are considered marital 
property. The assets should be divided equally unless the parties 
agree to some other distribution, the law states. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple raised two sons and a daughter while George Shinn  
built a financial empire of real estate, business colleges and car 
dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Leslie Price, 29, of Matthews, accused Shinn of  
sexually assaulting her at his Tega Cay home. Prosecutors filed no 
criminal charges after an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Price sued Shinn for damages. The civil trial could begin this  
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	This month, a former Hornets cheerleader alleged a similar  
sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Tommy Pope said this week he is reconsidering his  
decision not to file charges in the Price case, in part because of 
the new allegation.

<HEADLINE> 'Baywatch' To Film in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- G'day, ``Baywatch.''  
</P>
<P>
	The long-running syndicated television show is heading to  
Australia after a Teamsters official rejected a contract proposal 
to bring production to Hawaii from California, the show's creator 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Bonann said Teamsters Local 399 director Leo T. Reed would  
not agree to an 11 percent salary cut for Hawaii's movie and 
television industry drivers. That would have reduced minimum 
salaries from $1,840 a week to $1,641. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would not agree to any reduction in rates whatsoever, not  
one penny,'' an angry Bonann said from California. ``So the whole 
house of cards falls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similar concessions were accepted by unions representing actors,  
directors and stage hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonann said Reed's decision cost Teamsters a potential $7  
million for six upcoming years of production on a new version of 
the show to be called ``Baywatch Hawaii.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teamsters in Los Angeles have earned $10 million during the  
show's production there, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed did not return a telephone message left at his North  
Hollywood, Calif., office. 
</P>
<P>
	The show, which features David Hasselhoff and a crew of buff and  
busty lifeguards, is relocating from Los Angeles after nine years 
because of increasing costs and declining ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	It was headed to Queensland, Australia, until Hawaii made a  
pitch to bring the show to Honolulu and Haleiwa on Oahu's North 
Shore. 
</P>
<P>
	The state offered an incentive package including free airfare,  
hotel rooms and cars, other perks such as tax incentives and free 
location access, and $1.7 million to improve the Hawaii Film Studio 
and renovate the Haleiwa Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonann favored bringing the show here because it would have kept  
production in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The new show likely will be called ``Baywatch Down Under.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I wish it was `Aloha,' but it's `G'day,''' Bonann said.

<HEADLINE> Pastor Suspended for Gay Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOWNERS GROVE, Ill. (AP) -- There were tears and expressions of  
pain on all sides when a jury of United Methodist ministers decided 
to suspend one of their own for blessing the ``holy union'' of two 
Chicago men. 
</P>
<P>
	Now church leaders must decide what to do about a divide that  
some say only grew deeper when the guilty verdict against the Rev. 
Gregory Dell was read late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	After two long days of testimony, 10 of 13 pastors -- many of  
them friends of Dell -- found him guilty of disobeying a church law 
that bans same-sex unions in the United Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	His suspension goes into effect July 5, putting Dell's 30-year  
career as a Methodist minister on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell, who hadn't expected such a harsh sentence, said he was  
disappointed by a ruling he thinks was based on ``a kind moralistic 
rigidity and legalism that shuts people out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The church has made a statement today, but it has not made the  
final word,'' Dell said outside the Methodist church in the Chicago 
suburb of Downers Grove where the trial took place. 
</P>
<P>
	Methodist pastors in several states, including California,  
Nevada and Iowa, are facing similar charges. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dell's case was the first to test the church's same-sex  
union ban, which went into effect in August -- one month before Dell 
presided over the commitment ceremony of Karl Reinhardt and Keith 
Eccarius, an eight-year member at Dell's Broadway United Methodist 
Church on Chicago's North Side. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury said Dell's suspension could be lifted if he signs a  
statement promising to obey the ban or if church officials decided 
to rescind the ban. Dell said he wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not abandon the gay, lesbian, bisexual and  
transgendered persons in my pastoral care ... or any other group 
that our society decides to marginalize out of fear or ignorance,'' 
said Dell, whose congregation is a third gay or lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell said he'll find a different job.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Stephen C. Williams, a Methodist minister who served as  
church prosecutor, said Dell's continued unwillingness to obey 
church law left jurors little choice but to suspend him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tragedy is not just what this is doing to the church and  
the people of the church. The greater tragedy is what our divisions 
are doing to the world that is crying for the gospel that we are 
set apart to proclaim,'' C. Joseph Sprague, bishop of the Northern 
Illinois Conference of the Methodist Church, said early Saturday 
after the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Sprague who brought the charge of disobedience against  
Dell last October -- not because he wanted to, but because he felt 
he had to, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all knew that if I didn't bring the charge, someone  
would,'' Sprague said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like some in the church, he supports a Methodist pastor's right  
to decide if a same-sex union is appropriate for his or her 
parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
	But others say pastors have no choice but to obey a law that was  
recommended by the majority of Methodists attending the church's 
1996 conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who don't like the law should attempt to get the majority  
to change it at the United Methodist conference in 2000, said Paul 
Lewis, a lay member from a Methodist church in suburban Aurora.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Misses Practice Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Los Angeles Lakers forward Dennis Rodman,  
benched during the final 16 minutes of a 111-109 loss to the 
Sacramento Kings on Friday night, missed practice Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Rodman met with coach Kurt Rambis for about 30 minutes  
afterward, according to team spokesman John Black, who said Rambis 
told him he ``felt good after their talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black said Rodman showed up about 20 minutes before practice  
ended, and didn't participate. 
</P>
<P>
	Black also said Rodman will play against the New York Knicks on  
Sunday, and wouldn't comment when asked if there would be a fine 
levied. 
</P>
<P>
	``As per team policy, that will be handled internally,'' Black  
said. ``We don't discuss that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, the seven-time NBA rebounding champion who joined the  
Lakers last month, left the team for personal reasons March 13, and 
missed the first four games of their six-game road trip that began 
the following night in Sacramento. The Lakers lost three of the 
four games without Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	He rejoined the Lakers in Orlando last Sunday, when they rallied  
from a 24-point deficit to beat the Magic 115-104. A 96-93 victory 
at Dallas the following night made the Lakers 11-0 with Rodman in 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Lakers have lost their last two games -- to Phoenix  
106-101 Wednesday night and to the Kings, when they blew a 16-point 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman made his first start of the season against Sacramento,  
replacing Travis Knight, but played only 24 minutes, and just eight 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I have to take the blame for that, even though I'm not  
going to say what happened,'' Rambis said following the game. 
</P>
<P>
	When pressed for details, Rambis said, ``Let's not start with 20  
questions trying to get it out of me. That's just the end of it, it 
was just a coach's decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, Rodman wasn't available for comment after the game,  
but in comments he issued through the team, he made mention of his 
limited playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you need to ask the people around here what is going  
on,'' said Rodman, who had two points and a team-leading nine 
rebounds. ``This is just completely ridiculous. I'm not used to 
this. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am in the starting rotation and I only played 24 minutes  
tonight. But I can't say nothing about that. That is a coach's 
decision so don't ask me about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if Rodman would remain a starter, Rambis replied,  
``I'm not sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers are 11-2 with Rodman and 8-9 without him. He is  
averaging 10.6 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said backup center Sean Rooks also missed Saturday's  
practice, but unlike Rodman, his absence was excused. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers (19-11) enter Sunday's game having lost five of their  
last eight games. The Knicks (16-13) snapped a three-game losing 
streak with a 94-87 victory at Phoenix on Friday night.

<HEADLINE> Silver Charm Chases $3M in Dubai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Silver Charm, the 1997  
Kentucky Derby winner, will try for a second straight victory in 
the Dubai World Cup Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the seven horses out to stop the strapping gray horse in  
the $5 million race at Nad al-Sheba Racecourse will be Victory 
Gallop, the 1998 Belmont Stakes winner, and High-Rise, winner of 
last year's English Derby at Epsom Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Silver Charm succeed, it would be without the presence of  
trainer Bob Baffert, who was at Turfway Park in Kentucky Saturday 
to watch Kentucky Derby hopeful Straight Man finish fourth in the 
Gallery Furniture.Com Stakes. Silver Charm and Straight Man are 
owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Eoin Harty, a Baffert assistant, will saddle Silver Charm.  
</P>
<P>
	Joining Silver Charm and Victory Gallop in representing the  
United Stakes is Malek, fourth in this 1 1/4-mile race on the dirt 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	High-Rise is one of four starters owned by the ruling Al Maktoum  
family of Dubai. Almutawakel is owned by Sheik Hamdan al Maktoum. 
High-Rise, Daylami and Central Park are owned by the Godolphin 
Racing stable of Sheik Hamdan and his brothers, Sheiks Mohammed and 
Maktoum al Maktouom. Sheikh Mohammed manages the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the field is British-owned and trained Running Stag,  
whose last four starts were in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Post time is 11:15 a.m. EST. There will be no betting at Nad  
al-Sheba. Wagers will be taken on the race at tracks and off-track 
facilities in Canada and 28 states, but not in New York, where 
betting on racing is prohibited on Palm Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, second to now-retired Awesome Again in the  
Breeders' Cup Classic Nov. 7 at Churchill Downs, opened 1999 with a 
win in the San Pasqual Handicap at Santa Anita. In his last two 
starts, however, he finished third in both the Donn Handicap at 
Gulfstream Park and the Santa Anita Handicap March 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The $3 million winner's share Sunday would make Silver Charm the  
second biggest money earner in thoroughbred racing history with 
$9,803,006. It would move him past Skip Away ($9,616,368) and place 
him behind Cigar ($9,999,815). 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, ridden by Gary Stevens, his regular jockey, will  
start from the No. 3 post. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Bailey will ride Victory Gallop from the No. 4 post. The  
4-year-old colt, trained by Elliott Walden and owned by brothers 
Art, Jack and J.R. Preston, was fourth in the Breeders Cup Classic. 
He opened 1999 by winning an allowance race March 3 at Gulfstream 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Victory Gallop won't try to get past Silver Charm at the  
start,'' Walden said. ``He'll stay behind, and Silver Charm won't 
see us coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malek, ridden by Alex Solis, has raced only twice since his  
fourth place in Dubai last year. He finished second to Silver Charm 
in the San Pasqual, then was second in the San Antonio Handicap 
Feb. 7 at Santa Anita. The 6-year-old Chilean-bred horse, trained 
by Dick Mandella and owned by Francisco Cortes and wife Theresa. 
will start from post No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``Silver Charm is still the horse to beat,'' Mandella said.  
</P>
<P>
	The four Maktoum-owned horses will be making their dirt-racing  
and 1999 debuts. High-Rise last raced when he finished seventh in 
the Prix de L'Arc de Triomph Oct. 4 at Longchamp in France. 
Daylami, who won the Man o'War at Belmont Park Sept. 12, finished 
third in the Champion Stakes in his last start Oct. 17 at Ascot, 
England. Central Park finished fifth in the Prix Niel Sept. 13 at 
Longchamp, and Almutawakel was eighth in the Prix Dollar Oct. 3 at 
Longchamp. 
</P>
<P>
	Running Stag, seventh in the Breeders' Cup Classic, hasn't race  
since finishing second to Silver Charm in the Clark Handicap Nov. 
27 at Churchill Downs.

<HEADLINE> Bush Asks for School Prayer Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A federal appeals court should reconsider  
its ruling that student-led prayers before Texas public high school 
football games are unconstitutional, Gov. George W. Bush said in 
court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and Republican Attorney General John Cornyn together filed  
a brief Friday, asking the court the revisit the case involving of 
the Santa Fe school district, about 30 miles southeast of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican governor, who this month formed a presidential  
exploratory committee, ``supports the right of students to 
participate in the free exercise of religion, a right which is 
guaranteed under the Constitution,'' said Bush spokesman Scott 
McClellan. 
</P>
<P>
	``And he believes government should not dictate or censor the  
content of student-led prayer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently upheld a lower  
court's decision allowing limited prayer at graduation ceremonies, 
but ruled out the prayers or other ``solemnizing ceremonies'' 
before football games. 
</P>
<P>
	Two unidentified Houston-area parents sued the school district  
in 1995, claiming that football game prayers violated the 
constitutional separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe football is sacred in Texas,'' said American Civil  
Liberties Union attorney Anthony Griffin. ``It's frightening to me 
that we now use religious stuff hypocritically and we ignore that 
this is a diverse society ... we shouldn't do that in our public 
schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cornyn said limiting graduation ceremony invocations or  
benediction prayers to ``nonsectarian'' or ``nonproselytizing'' 
prayers will force school officials to censor them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision asks the state to decide what type of prayer  
should be allowed. To ask the state to supervise religious speech 
is clearly unconstitutional,'' Cornyn said.

<HEADLINE> Nissan, Renault Agreement Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- French automaker Renault SA will invest $5.4  
billion in Nissan Motor Co. to buoy the debt-laden Japanese car 
manufacturer, the two companies agreed Saturday, creating the 
world's fourth-largest auto partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which makes Renault the biggest shareholder in Nissan,  
Japan's second-largest carmaker, is the latest example of 
increasing involvement by foreign companies in Japan's once 
virtually closed auto sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the two will have an output of 4.8 million vehicles  
and the ability to develop ``strong synergies'' worth $3.3 billion 
for the 2000-02 period, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As automakers, both companies have a strong wish to be giant  
global players,'' Nissan President Yoshikazu Hanawa told reporters. 
``That's why we reached this agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hanawa and Renault Chairman Louis Schweitzer inked the deal  
after it was approved by both companies' boards. Schweitzer said 
the deal would ``produce both growth and cost reduction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Renault will take a 36.8 percent stake in Nissan Motor and a  
22.5 percent stake in Nissan Diesel Motor Co., a truckmaker 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan ranks No. 7 in world production of cars and trucks, and  
Renault is 11th, according to industry analysts at Ward's 
Automotive International. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault first made a formal offer to buy a stake in Nissan on  
March 16, after talks between Nissan and Germany's DaimlerChrysler 
broke down. At the time, Nissan was seeking a foreign partner to 
help it write off an estimated $18 billion in debt and return to 
profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese government praised the deal.  
</P>
<P>
	Kaoru Yosano, Japan's minister of international trade and  
industry, said in a statement that the deal ``corresponds with an 
industrial revival program which Japan is seeking to implement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once a symbol of Japan's industrial might, Nissan has suffered  
losses during five of the last six years. The company's own 
forecast also shows it losing another quarter of a billion dollars 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies also announced Saturday that Carlos Ghosn,  
Renault's executive vice president, will become Nissan's chief 
operating officer and that two other top Renault executives will 
join the Japanese automaker's senior management. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the companies proposed that Hanawa assume a position on  
Renault's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign companies have become more involved in the Japanese car  
industry as it struggles with slumping sales caused by the Asian 
economic crisis and Japan's worst recession in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Ford Motor Co. gained a controlling share in Japan's  
Mazda Motor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In other big multinational tie-ups, Ford announced in January  
that it was buying the passenger car operations of Volvo AB, while 
Daimler-Benz AG bought Chrysler Corp. last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, General Motors Corp. is negotiating with Saab  
Automobile AB to buy the half of Saab that GM doesn't already own, 
according to widespread news reports.

<HEADLINE> Blue Devils Hit Boards This Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Duke and Elton Brand haven't been  
beaten in many categories this season, let alone embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday night, in a 68-62 victory over Michigan State in the  
NCAA tournament semifinals, the Blue Devils got some big-time 
redemption in the battle of the boards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever we see Elton get that face -- I really can't describe  
it, but he gets that look of confidence -- it really picks our whole 
team up,'' forward Shane Battier said of Brand's 18-point, 
15-rebound night. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke was overwhelmed by 16 rebounds in a Dec. 2 game against  
Michigan State, its worst inside effort of the season. It was worse 
on the offensive glass, with the Spartans holding a 25-5 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke vowed in the week leading up to its NCAA tournament Final  
Four rematch with the Spartans that things would be much different. 
And this season, Duke (37-1) has pretty much gotten its way. 
</P>
<P>
	Setting the tone from the start in its first Final Four  
appearance since 1994, Duke held a 28-14 halftime advantage on the 
glass. That included doubling the Spartans 16-8 on the offensive 
end with the hulking Brand and the shot-blocking Battier doing most 
of the inside work. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Krzyzewski drilled the Blue Devils for a week on  
boxing out in one of his patented intense practice sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh God, it was ridiculous,'' forward Chris Carrawell said of  
Duke's practices that stressed rebounding. ``But it paid off, it 
paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't go rebound, it's pathetic,'' Carrawell added.  
``It was one of those things where we worked on the fundamentals of 
just blocking out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, the national player of the year, was admittedly out of  
shape in the first meeting four months ago when he grabbed just 
three rebounds and scored 12 points. This time, Brand had 13 
rebounds by halftime in a satisfying grudge match for the 6-foot-8, 
270-pound sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt I was in better shape,'' Brand said. ``The guys found  
me in a great position to score and I had a lot of confidence I 
would play better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The difference was the first half,'' Michigan State coach Tom  
Izzo said. ``That assault they had on us in rebounding was 
incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Spartans (33-5) were able to set the tempo for the  
most part against the nation's highest-scoring team, Duke's defense 
also took over in the final five minutes of the first half, holding 
Michigan State scoreless to build yet another double-digit lead. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Brand cleared the defensive glass on four straight  
Michigan State misses as the Blue Devils led at halftime for the 
34th time in 38 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so important for us to assert ourselves and Elton was  
the guy,'' Krzyzewski said. 
</P>
<P>
	And with Duke 33-0 when leading at halftime, Michigan State -- a  
comeback team all season -- appeared to have little hope. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Duke's second-half strategy didn't include Brand  
picking up his fourth foul with 10:12 left and taking a seat next 
to Krzyzewski for 5 1/2 minutes as the Spartans pecked away at the 
Blue Devils' lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew we had to play every possession with all of our  
heart,'' Krzyzewski said of Brand's foul trouble. ``Points were so 
hard to come by. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elton's foul trouble put a spin on the game that might have  
made it even more difficult if our bench hadn't stepped up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Duke leading 59-52 with 4:44 left, Krzyzewski used a  
20-second timeout to get Brand back into the game. He paid instant 
dividends. 
</P>
<P>
	After Carrawell put in one of Brand's misses on a follow shot,  
Brand grabbed a defensive rebound and fed Carrawell, who was 
fouled. One free throw later, Duke was up by 10 and on its way to 
its 32nd straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elton really had a transformation from earlier in the  
season,'' Battier said, thinking back to the first matchup. ``The 
last game (against Michigan State) really embarrassed him. He 
looked really poor, but he recommitted himself to being the best 
player he could be. He was extra determined to come out and play 
well tonight.''

<HEADLINE> Weber St. Football Player Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OGDEN, Utah (AP) -- Scott Shields, a football star at Weber State  
for four years, has been charged with assault and disorderly 
conduct after a fellow student was beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	Shields, selected three times to I-AA All-America team, is  
expected to be picked in next month's NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged Friday for the altercation that occurred after a  
Weber State basketball game two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Weber County prosecutors also charged another football player,  
Phil Hazel, with assault and disorderly conduct. Weber State 
student Jason West was charged with criminal mischief and 
disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Shields' arraignment hearing is scheduled for April 8.  
</P>
<P>
	He was a safety, punter and placekicker during his four years at  
Weber State and played in the Senior Bowl after last season. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the participants, the fights broke out after the  
Wildcats won the Big Sky Tournament March 6, three days before NFL 
scouts were in town to see Shields work out. 
</P>
<P>
	West said Shields and Hazel approached him after he set off a  
car alarm in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	According to campus police, West and Hazel began to argue. West  
backed up against another car and it was then that Shields was said 
to have hit him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shields came out of nowhere and either shoved or hit West.  
That's clear assault,'' said Sgt. Dane LeBlanc. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Shields also caused $1,500 worth of damage. ``He knocked  
him in the back of a Chevy Blazer and broke the back window.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shields has previously denied the charges.

<HEADLINE> Assisted Suicide Advocates Dismayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- After nine years as the eccentric crusader for  
assisted suicide, Dr. Jack Kevorkian may soon leave that role at a 
prison's gates -- and leave a void in the debate over how people can 
end their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Assisted suicide advocates said they were dismayed at  
Kevorkian's conviction Friday on charges of second-degree murder 
and delivery of a controlled substance in the injection death of a 
Lou Gehrig's disease patient that was aired on ``60 Minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's important, or was important, because he was the only  
person who said assisted suicide should be allowed and I'll be the 
assister,'' said Dr. Ed Pierce, who led a failed effort to legalize 
assisted suicide in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Other observers, including Kevorkian's prosecutor, said the  
debate would continue for years to come, and that if Kevorkian 
fades from the scene, some acrimony might fade with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Assisted suicide opponents said they hoped the verdict would  
send a message that the alternatives to dying are always better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of his victims were denied a chance to get the support to  
live to the point of natural death,'' said Diane Coleman, the 
founder of Not Dead Yet, an anti-assisted suicide group consisting 
of people with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury of seven women and five men debated 12 1/2 hours before  
reaching their verdict. One juror, Patrick Pollock, said jurors 
watched the tape Kevorkian made of Thomas Youk's death ``a number 
of times'' before coming to their verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Dan Lemisch said jurors told him they spent most of  
their time deciding between first- and second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	First-degree murder requires a specific intent to kill;  
second-degree murder does not. Kevorkian's main defense was that he 
did not intend to kill Youk, just ease his pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, a 70-year-old retired pathologist, told freelance  
writer Jack Lessenberry in a story written for The Oakland Press of 
Pontiac that he didn't believe the verdict was rational. 
</P>
<P>
	``Manslaughter, I could understand how they would arrive at  
that. But murder? This? They must have been an astonishingly cruel 
jury,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that no matter the jury's verdict, he had the right to  
do what he did. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors plan to ask Oakland County Circuit Court Judge  
Jessica Cooper to sentence Kevorkian to at least 10 to 25 years in 
prison at an April 14 hearing.	   Kevorkian's attorney, David Gorosh, said he would ask for 
probation -- a sentence prosecutors say is possible, but improbable. 
Gorosh also vowed to appeal the case up to the Supreme Court if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian began his crusade in 1989 with a newspaper ad for his  
suicide machine. In 1990, an Oregon woman became the first person 
to take him up on his offer of help in dying. Kevorkian admits to 
helping about 130 people commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Youk's death was the first time he injected the drugs himself,  
Kevorkian told CBS' ``60 Minutes'' when it aired the video.

<HEADLINE> Test Satellite Goes Up From Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- A rocket roared off a converted oil  
platform floating in the equatorial Pacific Saturday in the first 
test of an international venture's oceangoing satellite launch 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ukrainian- and Russian-built Zenit-3SL rocket carried a  
dummy satellite as it lifted off from the Odyssey, a self-propelled 
platform stationed 1,400 miles south of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Fueled by kerosene and liquid oxygen, the three-stage rocket  
ignited and engulfed the platform in a cloud of smoke, then rapidly 
hurdled toward space. About an hour later, the satellite separated 
from the third stage at an altitude of 1,200 miles and continued on 
toward its planned position 23,000 miles above Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Sea Launch Co.'s inaugural launch was conducted from mission  
control on the accompanying ship Sea Launch Commander. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything looks good right at the moment,'' Sea Launch  
president and general manager Allen Ashy said from the ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials watched by satellite video link to Long Beach,  
home port for the two vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	The launch was delayed more than three hours by minor problems  
with support equipment. The company, citing cautiousness, had 
already pushed it back one day. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstration launch was a critical step for Sea Launch Co.,  
which has put $500 million into the first commercial marine-based 
launch system in hopes of capturing a chunk of the growing business 
of boosting communications satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	Launches at the equator allow a rocket to carry more weight into  
space than they can from other latitudes. The payload simulated an 
HS 702, a big commercial communications satellite built by Hughes 
Space and Communications.

<HEADLINE> Execution Nears After 25 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Robert Excell White wasn't supposed to  
be alive this long. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury that heard his history -- how he beat his pregnant wife  
and sliced a friend's throat with a hunting knife -- decided the man 
police called ``Excell the Executioner'' should be put to death for 
killing a small-town grocer with machine-gun fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with the death sentence at age 36, White wrote U.S.  
Supreme Court justices saying he opposed appeals to spare him. 
</P>
<P>
	That was almost 25 years ago.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a few qualms about the death penalty, but if they're  
going to have it they ought to carry it out and not wait 25 
years,'' says Dorothy Lawson, whose 73-year-old father, Preston 
Broyle, owned the country store north of Dallas where he and two 
teen-age customers were gunned down. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father had five children living. Now only two of us are  
left. And White is still living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White turned 61 on March 14, the longest serving of 452 men and  
women awaiting execution in Texas. Walter Bell, the next in tenure 
on death row, has been confined nearly 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three of the nation's some 3,600 condemned inmates -- two in  
Georgia, one in Florida -- have logged more time under a death 
sentence than White. 
</P>
<P>
	But time may be running out for White, who faces lethal  
injection Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's exhausted his state and federal appeals,'' says Heather  
Browne, a spokeswoman for the Texas attorney general's office. ``It 
looks like he'll be going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A clemency petition to Gov. George W. Bush appears to be White's  
lone remaining hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks to be closer than we've ever gotten before, but in  
this business you never say never,'' says Tom O'Connell, the Collin 
County district attorney. ``It's not so much frustrating as it is 
indicative of how the system can be manipulated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White's attorney, Larry Brown, did not return several telephone  
calls from The Associated Press. White, as is his custom, is not 
talking to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	When White arrived on Texas' death row Aug. 26, 1974, four other  
men had already been sentenced to die under a new capital 
punishment law passed after the U.S. Supreme Court threw out all 
existing death penalty statutes in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	One of White's predecessors committed suicide. The three others  
had their sentences commuted to life terms, leaving White the dean 
of the Texas death row. 
</P>
<P>
	Some inmates suggest his status has allowed White to delude  
himself about the chances of being put to death. ``They just can't 
get around to killing me because I've been here longer than anyone 
else,'' he's told fellow inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, history supports his optimism.  
</P>
<P>
	After he wrote to the Supreme Court asking that appeals of his  
1974 capital murder conviction be ignored, his case languished in 
the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned the conviction in  
1987 because White was not advised that what he told 
court-appointed psychiatrists could be used against him. Such 
warnings weren't required in 1974, but a 1981 Supreme Court ruling 
required them and allowed the mandate to be applied retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1987, he again was convicted of killing Broyle and  
sentenced to death. He was never tried for the other killings. Two 
18-year-old customers, Gary Coker and Billy St. John, also died in 
the machine gun burst. 
</P>
<P>
	With the second conviction, the mandatory appeals process, which  
has averaged 10 years before Texas inmates are executed, began 
over. It's taken a dozen more years for White's appeals to run 
their course. 
</P>
<P>
	In the total time he's been on death row, he's been joined by  
more than 600 condemned prisoners, 172 of whom have been taken to 
the death chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	In a confession, White said his crime spree began May 10, 1974,  
in Waco, where he fatally stabbed gun collector Roy Perryman, 53, 
and stole more than two dozen weapons, including a .30-caliber 
machine gun. 
</P>
<P>
	White and two companions, brothers James and Gary Livingston,  
drank until about midnight, then hopped into White's car and drove 
north to Dallas and beyond, toward McKinney. At daybreak, May 11, 
they pulled into the Hilltop Grocery Store in Princeton for gas. 
They had $2. 
</P>
<P>
	Broyle was outside, helping Coker and St. John put oil in their  
car. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court documents, White grabbed the machine gun and  
ordered the three men inside the store. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of them were shot repeatedly in the back of the head,''  
Mrs. Lawson, 73, says. ``We were never able to see my father after 
his death and I had a terrible time for years accepting it, because 
I didn't see him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White and the Livingston brothers got $6 from the register and  
$60 from the victims' wallets and returned to Waco. White then fled 
to Cleveland, Miss., where he told a cousin about the shooting and 
turned himself in to police. 
</P>
<P>
	He's been in custody since.  
</P>
<P>
	James Livingston, who accompanied White inside Hilltop Grocery  
but didn't shoot, was also convicted and condemned. His sentence 
was commuted to life in 1983. No parole is imminent for Livingston, 
whose record shows at least eight stints in solitary confinement. 
He remains in administrative segregation, meaning he has violated 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Livingston, who remained outside the store as a lookout,  
received a 20-year term and was freed in 1984. He committed suicide 
two years later.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Con Held After Firearms Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- A second ex-convict has been ordered held in  
Michigan on a federal weapons count as investigators try to 
determine whether he and a former prisonmate had any role in the 
1995 disappearance of atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary P. Karr, 50, of Novi, Mich., was arrested after FBI agents  
and police searched his suburban Detroit apartment Wednesday and 
found two loaded handguns, court papers allege. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Wednesday, authorities searched David Waters' apartment  
in Austin and arrested him after reportedly finding 119 rounds of 
ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters once was O'Hair's office manager in Austin and was  
convicted in 1995 of theft in his stealing $54,000 from the O'Hair 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men, who for eight months in the mid-1980s were inmates at  
the same minimum-security prison in Vienna, Ill., were charged this 
week with weapons counts under a federal statute barring felons 
from possessing ammunition or firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	Both remained jailed Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Karr served more than 20 years in Illinois prisons after a 1974  
crime spree that included rape, kidnapping and armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	He left prison in May 1995, four months before the disappearance  
from San Antonio of O'Hair -- the founder of American Atheists Inc. 
-- as well as her son Jon Garth Murray, and granddaughter, Robin 
Murray O'Hair. The three vanished along with $500,000 in gold. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Antonio Express-News reported Saturday that evidence  
puts Karr and Waters in San Antonio about the same time in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Waters has told the Express-News that he has been  
told by a federal prosecutor that Waters has been implicated in her 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters and Karr have not been charged in connection with the  
O'Hair case.

<HEADLINE> Ford Recalls 945,000 Cars, Trucks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Nearly 1 million Ford Motor Co. cars and  
trucks are being recalled to replace potentially defective 
cruise-control cables that could cause the accelerator to stick. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall, announced Friday, involves 1998 and 1999 models  
equipped with cruise control. The 945,000 vehicles include the 1998 
and 1999 Ford Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer sport utility 
vehicles, Ford Ranger pickup, Mustang sport coupe, and 1999 Super 
Duty F-series pickup and chassis-cab. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford does not expect to have all the cruise-control cables it  
needs to replace the defective ones before mid-May. Until then, 
Ford is warning owners not to use their cruise-control system; 
dealers will disable the system at no charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said that in some of the vehicles the cruise-control cable  
could interfere with a pulley and prevent the accelerator from 
returning to idle when the cruise control is disengaged. As a 
result, the car could continue to move at the set speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said there have been no reports of that happening. The  
problem was discovered by Ford engineers during a regular review, 
spokeswoman Karen Shaughnessy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of the affected vehicles will be notified by mail  
starting Monday. Customers also can call Ford at 800-392-3673 to 
find out whether their vehicle is subject to the recall; callers 
will be asked for the vehicle identification number, which can 
typically be found on the registration, insurance certificate or 
the door pillar. 
</P>
<P>
	The same information also can be obtained at a new Ford Web  
site: www.recall.ford.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford did not reveal how much it expects the recall to cost.

<HEADLINE> Public Defender Accused of Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The lawyer who unsuccessfully defended her client  
against first-degree murder charges has been removed from his case 
after she was accused of having sex with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Carmen L. Fischer, the public defender for Michael Sanders, was  
accused of having romantic interludes with him in jail, where he is 
awaiting sentencing in the so-called bounty slayings of a young 
couple. He could receive the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Gregory Martin  
ruled the alleged affair, while not illegal, poses a conflict of 
interest that could hurt Sanders' case and ordered Fischer removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Detention officers testified they saw Fischer and Sanders  
kissing, embracing and touching in prison visitation rooms and said 
they had engaged in sex. During a hearing on the issue Fischer and 
her representatives ultimately refused to say whether that was 
true, acknowledging only a ``personal relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders accused of being among five men who broke into the home  
of Chris Foote and Spring Wright in the middle of the night and 
shot them to death in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	They claimed to be bounty hunters looking for a bail jumper, but  
prosecutors said that was a ruse for robbery. Sanders was convicted 
last year of two counts of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona State Bar announced Friday it would conduct its own  
investigation of Fischer.

<HEADLINE> Man Guilty of Accidental Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUCKINGHAM, Va. (AP) -- A man who shot and killed a passing  
driver while test-firing a pistol has been found guilty of 
involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	David Lee Connell, 29, was convicted Friday. He will be  
sentenced in May. 
</P>
<P>
	In what both defense lawyers and prosecutors called a tragic  
accident, Connell shot John M. Sollecito while Sollecito was 
driving down a rural county road on Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Sollecito was, 49, chatting with his wife when his  
side window shattered and he slumped forward, dead. His wife and a 
companion were able to stop the car without crashing. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Connell was test-firing a Colt .45 pistol in a  
friend's yard. He testified he was aiming downhill at a tin can, 
thinking the bullet could never make it to the road. 
</P>
<P>
	The bullet careened off a log beneath Connell's target and then  
hit Sollecito's rear-view mirror before striking him in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the direction I was shooting, I wasn't shooting at the  
road,'' Connell said.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Pilgrims Continue Hajj Acts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINA, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Some 2 million Muslim pilgrims  
performed the symbolic ritual of stoning the devil before dawn here 
today, throwing pebbles at a massive pillar. 
</P>
<P>
	They then headed back to Mecca -- some by foot, some by bus -- to  
walk seven times around the Kaaba, the black-draped cube in the 
center of the Grand Mosque. The two rituals are considered the peak 
of the three-day pilgrimage, or hajj, which began Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have stoned the devil. I have circled the Kaaba. Thank God,  
I am a pilgrim now,'' said Mohammed Osman from Sudan. He spoke 
after catching his breath from the strain of circling the Kaaba 
among 200,000 other worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mecca, pilgrims also slaughtered rams and oxen in a ceremony  
performed across the Islamic world today as Muslims marked one of 
their most important holidays, Eid al-Adha, the Feast of Sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
	The white-robed pilgrims took at least two hours to cover the  
six-mile journey from Mina to Mecca today. With the massive crowds, 
traffic inched along the road. People sat on the roofs of buses and 
clung to the back windows, their feet dangling in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Others seemed to enjoy the pre-dawn walk back to Mecca under the  
stars. It was cool in comparison to Friday's daytime temperatures 
of 104 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilgrims' day began with a ritual symbolizing the rejection  
of Satan's temptations. They threw seven pebbles at a 50-foot 
obelisk of light gray stone that represents the devil. With each 
pebble, the pilgrims chanted ``Allahu Akbar,'' or ``God is Great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sacrifices of livestock opens the three-day Eid al-Adha  
holiday, which commemorates the sacrifice by the biblical Abraham, 
or Ibrahim, of a ram in place of his son. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrations took place around the Muslim world.  
</P>
<P>
	In Beirut, Lebanese Muslims filled mosques for dawn prayers and  
heard sermons praising government reforms and calling for further 
efforts to weed out corruption. In the southern suburbs, a 
predominantly Shiite Muslim area, children flocked to amusement 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cairo, the streets were empty of traffic. Young Egyptians  
packed the decks of riverboats for cruises up the Nile. Men 
slaughtered sheep and cattle in backyards and alleys while women 
cooked lavish lunches in keeping with the Eid's emphasis on family 
gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
	In Amman, the death of King Hussein in February cast a pall over  
the holiday. Mosques delivered special prayers for Hussein, who had 
ruled for more than 46 years. King Abdullah went to mosque and then 
visited the grave of his father for more prayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time that the Jordanian family celebrates a  
holiday without its leader, the father of all Jordanians,'' Rakan 
Majali wrote in an editorial in Ad-Dustour newspaper, the nation's 
second-largest daily. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saudis have deployed more than 45,000 people to help  
organize this year's 2.3 million pilgrims. 
</P>
<P>
	All able-bodied Muslims are required to perform the hajj at  
least once in their lives if they can afford it.

<HEADLINE> FBI Identifies Missing Sightseer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SONORA, Calif. (AP) -- They thought they were prepared for the  
worst. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet when the families of three missing tourists learned that one  
of the women's bodies was discovered near Yosemite National Park, 
news was no less painful to bear. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities on Friday said the body found near a reservoir west  
of Yosemite was that of 15-year-old Julie Sund, and that the second 
body found last week in the trunk of their torched rental car 
likely was her friend, Silvina Pelosso. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were prepared to hear this news, but we were not ready when  
we heard it. My feelings at this time are as any mother's,'' said 
Raquel Pelosso, Silvania's mother, on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie, her mother Carole Sund, 42, and Silvina, a 16-year-old  
exchange student from Cordoba, Argentina, all disappeared six weeks 
ago while on a sightseeing trip. Mrs. Sund's body was identified 
Monday as one of two corpses were found in the trunk of their 
torched rental car in remote Sierra Village. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will bring all available resources to bear to solve this  
horrible crime,'' said FBI agent James Maddock. ``We are all 
committed to solving this crime and bringing those responsible to 
justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would not comment on how Julie or the other sightseers died  
or what led investigators to her body. 
</P>
<P>
	After Julie's body was identified, family members recounted  
jovial stories about the young woman, a violinist and cheerleading 
squad member who was preparing to go to college. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's just a really sweet girl and typical teen-ager. I'm  
going to miss her so much,'' said Carole Carrington, Julie's 
grandmother, choking back tears at a press conference at her 
Modesto hotel. Flags there were flying at half mast. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sund, Julie and Silvina were last seen alive Feb. 15 just  
outside Yosemite, eating hamburgers at the Cedar Lodge restaurant 
in El Portal. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie's body was found on a steep, grassy hill that drops into  
Don Pedro Lake reservoir, about an hour from where their torched 
car was found. It also is on one of the most direct routes to 
Modesto, where Mrs. Sund's billfold was found. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddock said investigators still have not been able to move the  
timeline past when the women were last seen at the Cedar Lodge 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Dental records were used to identify Mrs. Sund and her daughter.

<HEADLINE> 20th Century Saw Medical Milestones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A century ago, the standard medicines in a  
doctor's bag included arsenic, mercury and other things that could 
kill before they cured. When these didn't work, doctors might 
recommend mustard poultices to draw out imaginary poisons. 
</P>
<P>
	A physical exam often amounted to little more than looking at  
the patient's tongue. Undoubtedly, healers often made people feel 
better, then as now. Wise practitioners have never underestimated 
the restorative powers of a reassuring touch. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, a trip to the doctor in those days was a dicey  
business at best. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all of the shortcomings of modern medicine -- the cost,  
the impersonal reliance on technology, the many ills still beyond 
its reach -- there has never been a better time to get sick than 
right now. 
</P>
<P>
	The revolution in medicine during the 20th century is  
mind-bending. What's changed? The real question is: What hasn't? 
</P>
<P>
	Alfred Gilman, a Nobel winner from the University of  
Texas-Southwestern Medical Center, counted the medicines in use at 
the turn of century that are still given today. He found only about 
15 -- digitalis, morphine, aspirin, quinine, iron and a few other 
minerals and such. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somewhere between 1910 and 1912 in this country, a random  
patient with a random disease consulting a doctor chosen at random 
had for the first time in the history of mankind a better than 
50-50 chance of profiting from the encounter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quote is attributed to Lawrence J. Henderson, a Harvard  
biochemist who died in 1942. But even in Henderson's time, 
medicines that now tame infections, high blood pressure and so much 
else were unimagined. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Michael DeBakey, Baylor College of Medicine's renowned heart  
surgeon, finished medical school in 1932 -- still a decade before 
antibiotics -- and one of his earliest memories as a doctor is 
sitting up all night watching a patient die of an abdominal 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I graduated,'' he remembers, ``there was virtually  
nothing you could do for heart disease. If a patient came in with a 
heart attack, it was up to God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slowly at first and then accelerating at mid-century, medicine  
retooled itself. 
</P>
<P>
	It became less art, more science. Purges and placebos gave way  
to things that actually worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are some essential landmarks of this metamorphosis.  
</P>
<P>
	 *ANTIBIOTICS   	
</P>
<P>
	Many argue this is the single most impressive medical  
achievement of the century. The discovery began in the 1920s, when 
Alexander Fleming at St. Mary's Hospital in London found that a 
mold, which he identified as Penicillium rubrum, killed 
staphylococci bacteria growing in a lab dish. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years later, scientists from Oxford came across his write-up  
and set about purifying the key substance. By D-day in 1944, there 
was plenty of penicillin to treat allied soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon streptomycin and other antibiotics followed. A new class of  
medicines, appropriately labeled miracle drugs, had been created. 
Suddenly, such implacable killers as tuberculosis, diphtheria, 
pneumonia, syphilis and tetanus were treatable. 
</P>
<P>
	While the effect on medical care was huge, so too was the impact  
on the medical profession. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that the antibiotic revolution has created  
the remarkable confidence and prestige of modern medicine,'' said 
historian Allan Brandt of Harvard Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
	 *X-RAYS   	
</P>
<P>
	The German scientist Wilhelm Roentgen demonstrated the power of  
the X-ray in 1895, when he took a picture of the bones of his 
wife's left hand, but this profoundly important innovation did not 
make its way into routine care until the 1920s. The shadowy gray 
pictures literally opened a window into the body. Now doctors could 
see fractures, tumors, congested lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	Much more followed -- ultrasound, CT scans, PET scans, MRIs --  
each offering a different internal view of the body without 
actually invading it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The imaging technology has probably had a bigger role than  
anything else in changing the way we think about the human body and 
how we take care of sick people,'' says Dr. Joel Howell of the 
University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	 *MATERNAL AND INFANT CARE   	
</P>
<P>
	In 1900, life expectancy in the United States was 48. Now it is  
76. Much of this gain came in the first half of the century, before 
many of the big research breakthroughs, including antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	The major reason was vast improvements in public health -- clean  
water, plumbing, refrigeration and especially an understanding of 
the importance of sanitation during childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
	Women today are only about one-tenth as likely to die while  
giving birth as they were at the turn of the century. Childhood 
mortality plunged as well. Now only about 1 percent of babies die 
before age 5 in well-off parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	 *INSULIN   	
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1800s, scientists realized that the pancreas made  
something the body needed to burn sugar. In 1921, Frederick Banting 
and Charles Best of Toronto University isolated the active material 
in dogs. They gave it to a dog near death with diabetes, and the 
animal quickly got better. 
</P>
<P>
	The next year, they tried a similar experiment on a dying  
14-year-old boy. Almost immediately his blood sugar level fell, and 
within a few weeks he was able to go home, though dependent on 
injections of the newly isolated substance, insulin. 
</P>
<P>
	Large-scale production of the hormone soon followed. Though it  
did not cure diabetes, it proved to be an important lifesaver. 
</P>
<P>
	 *HEART DISEASE TREATMENTS   	
</P>
<P>
	From the invention of the electrocardiograph in 1903 to the  
prescription of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs in the 1990s, the 
understanding and treatment of diseases of the heart and 
circulatory system have been one of medicine's outstanding 
successes. 
</P>
<P>
	High blood pressure, heart failure, irregular heartbeats and  
heart attacks all became treatable conditions. Much of this is the 
result of a stunning increase in heart medicines -- diuretics, beta 
blockers, ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, clot busters 
and more -- used in various combinations to keep diseased and 
damaged hearts pumping. 
</P>
<P>
	The bypass operation DeBakey developed in the 1960s, along with  
angioplasty, became routine for opening clogged arteries in the 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps as important as the medical breakthroughs, however, were  
science's new understanding of the role of cholesterol, fat, 
smoking and exercise in this disease and people's willingness to 
change their living habits to protect their hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	 *MENTAL ILLNESS TREATMENTS   	
</P>
<P>
	One of the most important insights of the 20th century is the  
understanding that serious mental disease results from disruptions 
in the chemistry of the brain. It led to the development and 
acceptance of medicines for illnesses of the mind. 
</P>
<P>
	The first truly effective drug was lithium, used to control  
manic depression in 1949. In the 1950s came chlorpromazine and 
other medicines for schizophrenia. Then followed treatments for 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
	The medicines allowed a vast depopulating of the country's  
mental hospitals, which had grown from 150,000 patients at the turn 
of the century to about 500,000 by 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	 *VACCINES   	
</P>
<P>
	Edward Jenner administered the first vaccine for smallpox in  
1796, but the broad use of vaccines is a 20th century development. 
Certainly the century's most famous was the polio vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	With its power to paralyze children, polio was one of the most  
feared of diseases. Jonas Salk of the University of Pittsburgh 
developed a vaccine made from killed virus, and to vast national 
relief it was declared safe and effective in 1955. Five years 
later, Albert Sabin's more effective oral vaccine was introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	Now vaccines are used to control a long list of once-common  
diseases -- mumps, flu, chicken pox, diphtheria, Haemophilus 
influenzae, hepatitis A and B, whooping cough, tetanus and many 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	 *TRANSPLANTS   	
</P>
<P>
	In 1954 in Boston, Drs. J. Hartwell Harrison and Joseph Murray  
performed the first successful kidney transplant. To get around the 
biggest problem -- the body's tendency to reject foreign tissue -- 
the operation was done on identical twins. Still, it opened the 
transplant era. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1963, doctors attempted lung and liver transplants. Then came  
heart transplants, first by Dr. Christian Barnard in South Africa 
and next by two Americans, Drs. Norman Shumway and Denton Cooley. 
</P>
<P>
	Organ transplants did not become routine until the late 1970s  
with the development of cyclosporine, a drug that suppresses the 
body's tendency to attack the new organ. Today, about 2,300 heart 
transplants are done in the United States annually, and 70 percent 
of recipients survive at least four years. 
</P>
<P>
	 *AIDS TREATMENTS   	
</P>
<P>
	AIDS, discovered in 1981, turned out to be one of medicine's  
toughest challenges -- a brand-new disease targeting the body in 
ways never before seen and caused by a virus, a class of microbe 
that medicine was virtually powerless against. 
</P>
<P>
	In short order, scientists identified the virus and developed  
tests to diagnose infection and prevent transmission through the 
blood supply. However, the real breakthrough came in the mid-1990s 
with the development of combinations of drugs that keep the virus 
from multiplying. While a cure and a vaccine are still elusive, the 
dramatic effect of these therapies raises hopes that AIDS at least 
has been turned into a manageable disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The research also has vastly increased knowledge of the immune  
system in both sickness and health and has speeded the development 
of drugs against other kinds of viral infections. 
</P>
<P>
	 *DNA    	
</P>
<P>
	The biggest discovery of the century? ``It's DNA. No question at  
all,'' says Dr. Meyer Friedman of the University of California, San 
Francisco, author of a recent book on medical discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
	It started with the discovery by James Watson and Francis Crick  
in 1953 of the rope-ladder structure of deoxyribonucleic acid. Each 
rung of the ladder is a unit of genetic code, and together they 
contain all the construction plans of life. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the understanding of genes is changing many parts of  
medicine: Insulin, heart drugs, growth hormones and other useful 
proteins are made through genetic engineering. An understanding of 
genes' role in triggering cancer has revolutionized the way 
scientists think about new therapies. Screening tests that look for 
defective genes offer advance warning about susceptibility to many 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many scientists believe this is barely the start. Like  
the discovery of X-rays at the end of the 19th century, the 
harnessing of genes at the end of the 20th is likely to pay off in 
powerful new ways to control human ills in the century to come.

<HEADLINE> Williams Sisters Face Off in Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. (AP) -- The first serve of the match came to  
Serena Williams, and she met it with a full swing, rifling a 
forehand crosscourt into the corner for a winner. Opponent Amanda 
Coetzer never moved. 
</P>
<P>
	Venus Williams lunged to her right for an off-balance volley,  
barely reaching the ball to lift a delicate shot that landed softly 
just beyond the net for a winner. Opponent Jana Novotna, frozen 
behind the baseline, could only shake her head. 
</P>
<P>
	With a remarkable combination of finesse and force, the Williams  
sisters have made their way to an all-in-the-family final Sunday at 
the Lipton Championships. Impressed opponents admit the matchup is 
no fluke, but rather a sign of the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their athleticism is incredible,'' said Steffi Graf,  
eliminated by Venus in the semifinals. ``They move extremely well. 
They're taking risks. They go for their shots. They don't have a 
certain weakness. They're very tall and big. That's definitely a 
plus. 
</P>
<P>
	``All those things are definitely working for them.''  
</P>
<P>
	The sisters aren't quite ready to be crowned queens of the WTA  
Tour. Even if Venus wins Sunday, she'll remain ranked No. 6. A 
victory by Serena would boost her to a career-best No. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	They're not necessarily even the best players in their age  
division. Martina Hingis, 18, has five Grand Slam titles to none 
for the Williams sisters. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the final between Venus, 18, and Serena, 17,  
supports the long-held hunch that they might be destined for 
greatness. 
</P>
<P>
	Serena, who beat Hingis, Coetzer and Monica Seles en route to  
the final, has won 16 consecutive matches and is on the threshold 
of her third tournament title in a row. No longer is she 
overshadowed by Venus, who is 15 months older. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been in the background,'' Serena said. ``It's time  
for me to move forward now. I'm playing the best tennis I have in 
my young career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Venus has compiled an impressive winning streak, too -- 11  
matches in a row at Lipton, including last year's final and 
victories this week over Graf and Novotna. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like putting my name and losing in the same  
sentence,'' Venus said. ``Winning and Venus sounds great. Serena 
doesn't like to lose either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last all-sibling final in professional tennis was in 1991,  
when John McEnroe beat his brother Patrick at Chicago. Williams vs. 
Williams will be the first all-sister women's final since the Open 
era began in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters don't seem as impressed by the achievement as the  
international media. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporter: ``Would you say a new era has arrived in women's  
tennis as of this week?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Venus: ``I guess so. It could be said.''  
</P>
<P>
	Reporter: ``Would you say it?''  
</P>
<P>
	Venus: ``I could say it, yes: A new era has arrived this week in  
women's tennis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scale of the occasion is such that their father, Richard,  
held a news conference Saturday. Prone to hyperbole, he bragged 
about various family medical and law degrees, Venus' fluency in 
four languages and his role in a group that may buy Rockefeller 
Center for $3.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no exaggeration in the pride he expressed for  
Sunday's finalists. 
</P>
<P>
	``My only hope in watching my babies is that I don't cry,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters practiced together Saturday, joking about mishit  
overheads and still laughing when they left the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're saying, `I'm going to hit the ball sister -- you'd  
better be ready,' '' their dad said. 
</P>
<P>
	Venus is 2-0 against Serena, with both matches last year. They  
played each other for the first time at the Australian Open in 
January, then at the Italian Open in May. 
</P>
<P>
	When they played each other as children, Venus usually won.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah,'' she said. ``But that's in the past.''  
</P>
<P>
	The future arrives Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Discusses Student Athletes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN VALLEY, Minn. (AP) -- Some academically-challenged  
athletes shouldn't have to attend classes in order to play college 
sports, Gov. Jesse Ventura said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura's comments were aired Friday from an interview with a  
young reporter for KARE-TV's ``Whatever,'' a show aimed at 
teen-agers. The interview was conducted after allegations broke 
about academic misconduct in the University of Minnesota men's 
basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	``My view is, to eliminate this cheating, or the possibility of  
it, why not let kids go to college and just be athletes while 
they're there?'' Ventura said. ``No classes. Let them simply play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then when they're done, if the don't make it in the NFL, if  
they don't make it in the NBA, if they don't make it in pro 
baseball, whatever it might be, then give them their scholarship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the former professional wrestler said, colleges should  
just accept that some students were never meant to study. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many great athletes simply aren't smart? But why shouldn't  
they have the chance to compete?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor said his own talents aren't being sufficiently  
rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get paid $120,000 a year,'' he said. ``What do you think I'd  
be paid if I was with a $12 billion corporation in the private 
sector? I'd be making $120,000 a month, and that wouldn't even 
count stock options.''

<HEADLINE> Gooden Hoping for Healthy '99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (AP) -- Dwight Gooden's biography and career  
pitching statistics for 14 big league seasons stretch over six 
pages in the Cleveland Indians' media guide. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1995 season, however, is summed up in just six words: ``Did  
not play in Major Leagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four years have passed since the temptation of drugs and alcohol  
nearly cost Gooden his family and baseball career. And although he 
didn't add a single victory or strikeout to his resume in '95, 
Gooden considers it the most important year of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when I got suspended, unfortunately it took a negative  
thing to get something positive out of it,'' he said. ``But looking 
back at it, being out that entire '95 season made me grow up as a 
person. It made me get more involved with my family and kids. 
Before that it was baseball first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sobriety has allowed the 34-year-old Gooden to take control of  
his life. He awakens each day with the same goal as the day before 
-- to stay clean and sober. The recovering addict's ``One day at a 
time'' mantra has served him well. 
</P>
<P>
	He has learned his lessons the hard way, and discusses many of  
them in his autobiography, ``Heat'', written with Bob Klapisch, who 
covered Gooden when he pitched in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In the book, Gooden details some of the nightmarish moments  
during the years when cocaine and booze dominated his life, 
including the time he contemplated suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The writing process was both painful and helpful, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was great for me because some of it was tough times  
and tough moments I had to relive and go through,'' he said. ``But 
it was therapeutic because it lets me know that if I let my guard 
down these are the things that can happen. Or something worse can 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden continues to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and  
still undergoes the mandatory weekly drug tests ordered by 
baseball. He has a sponsor to help him and continues to get support 
from long time friends like Adele Smithers, whose husband, 
Brinkley, founded the Smithers Institute in New York where Gooden 
fought his first battle with cocaine addiction in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smithers was in St. Petersburg on Friday to see Gooden pitch  
against Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, things couldn't be better for Gooden.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm healthy. I'm feeling good,'' he said. ``Overall, I  
couldn't be more happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden, slated to be the Indians' No. 5 starter, has been one of  
the club's most pleasant surprises this spring. His fastball has 
consistently registered above 90 mph and he's averaging a strikeout 
per inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, if he can just stay healthy.  
</P>
<P>
	``The last time? Wow,'' he said when asked if he could recall  
the last year he went injury free. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, like a doctor reading a patient's medical history, Gooden  
recounts a decade of ups and downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say '90, That year I won 19 games,'' he said. ``In  
'91, I had surgery in September. In '92, was on the DL (disabled 
list) at the All-Star break. '93, got shut down with the shoulder. 
'94 got suspended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Missed all of '95. '96 had a tired arm for the last part of  
the season, missed the postseason. '97 started out on the DL with 
the hernia. Last year, started out on the DL. It's been a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden, who went 8-6 last year in 23 starts, is just 15 wins shy  
of 200 for his career. He hasn't set any goals for 1999, and Gooden 
knows better than to think too far ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``My main thing is to stay healthy after all years with the  
injuries and setbacks, and get the ball every fifth day,'' he said. 
``That's all I can ask for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One pitch and one day at a time.

<HEADLINE> Technology Changing Medical Ethics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	On entering medicine, young doctors still affirm the Hippocratic  
oath. But some believe the ancient Greek ethical code needs 
updating after a century of research advances that have blurred 
once-sharp lines of right and wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Could Hippocrates have imagined cloning or machines that  
maintain breathing and heartbeat in brain-dead patients? The oath 
deals with euthanasia and privacy, but what about fertility 
treatments that produce eight babies, transplants of animal organs 
into humans, genetic engineering? What about Dr. Jack Kevorkian? 
</P>
<P>
	``Much of the challenge of our era is bringing our ethical  
compass up to date to match our technical expertise,'' said Dr. 
Linda Emanuel, director of the American Medical Association's 
Institute for Ethics. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate begins even before conception. Fertilizing an egg in  
a test tube has become almost commonplace. Sperm taken after death 
and frozen can be used to produce a child years later. A woman old 
enough to be a grandmother can bear a child. Fertility treatments 
recently produced septuplets in Iowa and octuplets in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we as a society have made a value judgment in the  
reproductive area. We've made a choice not to interfere. We just 
choose to allow it all to happen,'' said Arthur Caplan, director of 
the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	But Richard McCormick, a professor of Christian ethics at the  
University of Notre Dame, warned that in such cases, science 
already may have gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all matters touching life, the problem is that there have  
got to be limits,'' he said. ``We have responsibilities. The 
question is drawing the line at the proper place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Transplanting organs -- heart, lungs, kidney -- is now common, but  
the manner in which they are distributed has come under increased 
scrutiny, since some 4,000 people die each year in the United 
States while awaiting a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, organs are offered first to patients near where they  
become available, but the federal government wants to distribute 
organs to the sickest patients first, no matter where they live. In 
response, some states have passed laws to keep donated organs 
within their borders, regardless of urgent need elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Another solution, another ethical problem: Researchers  
responding to the shortage use organs and cells from pigs and other 
animals, even hearts from baboons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you squeamish but it beats being dead,'' said Robert  
Levine, chairman of the institutional review board at the Yale-New 
Haven Medical Center. ``Progress in medicine is an optional goal. 
If you don't want to pursue it, you don't have to. We don't force 
it on people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, historians cite notorious exceptions, when the century's  
quest for medical answers was hellbent, unchecked by Hippocrates' 
ethical brakes. Nazi doctors conducted horrific tests in 
concentration camps, and researchers in Tuskegee, Ala., withheld 
syphilis treatment from 399 black men to see how the disease 
progressed. 
</P>
<P>
	Most research, of course, aims to preserve life, and 20th  
century medicine's strides have done that dramatically -- with life 
spans in the United States now at 76 years, an increase of almost 
30 years over the 1900 figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet even this progress casts an ethical shadow. With the  
introduction of respirators, ventilators, and other devices doctors 
have learned to sustain life at its most tenuous. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1976, a young woman named Karen Ann Quinlan fell into a coma.  
After much soul-searching, her family went to court to seek and 
finally win the right to have her respirator removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Their fight ignited the death-with-dignity movement, which in  
recent years has taken shape as the right-to-die movement, largely 
centered on Kevorkian, a retired Michigan pathologist who has said 
he assisted about 130 people in committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces a murder charge in a September 1998 death. Murder  
charges have been thrown out twice previously, three times he has 
been acquitted of assisted suicide, and a fourth trial ended in 
mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kevorkian is actually forcing people to discuss the issue, and  
I would say the trend line is toward greater acceptance,'' said Dr. 
Stanley Korenman, associate dean for ethics and medical sciences 
training at the University of California at Los Angeles School of 
Medicine. ``I think that this is an evolving issue and it will 
evolve toward permissiveness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some ethicists find the idea reprehensible and argue that  
medicine's advances offer palliative care to ease suffering in 
virtually every case. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happens when we devalue whole sections of society, old  
people, sick people? It's a slippery slope,'' said Dr. Edmund 
Pellegrino, director the Center for Clinical Bioethics at 
Georgetown University. 
</P>
<P>
	Some ethicists worry that an ongoing government project to map  
the human genome, the common genetic blueprint, could give rise to 
other forms of discrimination, based on a person's genes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing to insert a gene to prevent fatal illness. It's  
another thing to select genetic makeups,'' Korenman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cloning research has raised even broader questions. Two years  
ago, Scottish researchers cloned a sheep named Dolly. Last year, a 
physicist in Chicago said he would attempt to create the first 
human clone. 
</P>
<P>
	Where does medical research go from here? Ethicists say it will  
continue to press the limits, prompting debates that will only get 
sharper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medicine has gone far. I think it has crossed into areas where  
we often feel we have no handrails to hold on to,'' Caplan said. 
``But to say it's gone too far is to ignore the incredible 
benefits.''

<HEADLINE> Big League Baseball Returns to Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Don Zimmer can barely contain himself. He gets  
bug-eyed talking about those old times when he played in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, what a great place!'' the New York Yankees interim manager  
said. ``Cuba -- Havana, Cuba! People fought to get to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``They loved their baseball. It was electric. They went goofy  
for their players. Oh, Havana, Cuba, was something I'll never 
forget!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starting pitcher Scott Erickson and the rest of the Baltimore  
Orioles will always remember their visit, too. The 55,000 fans who 
pack Latinoamericano Stadium for Sunday's game between Baltimore 
and the Cuban national team will make sure of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will let our players know that this will be the seventh game  
of the World Series for their country,'' Orioles manager Ray Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, it might mean even more than that.  
</P>
<P>
	It's been 40 years since a major league team visited this  
one-time International League hotspot, the old home of Cincinnati's 
Triple-A club, the Havana Sugar Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati pitcher Brooks Lawrence made that final trip in March  
1959 when the Reds played the Los Angeles Dodgers in an exhibition 
game at the same park, called the Gran Stadium de La Habana when it 
opened in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	That game took place two months after a former University of  
Havana right-hander -- Fidel Castro -- took power on the communist 
island nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a crazy atmosphere,'' Lawrence said. ``The new reign  
was coming in. Fidel came to the dugout and talked to a few of the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``You saw the people walking around with guns and shooting over  
the ballpark. It was something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Reds pitcher Joe Nuxhall also played in Havana that  
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were guys with machine guns and machetes standing  
everywhere,'' he said. ``Right away we said, `What's going on?' I'd 
go to the ballpark and they were all over out there. It was 
scary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In July 1960, the Sugar Kings moved to Jersey City, N.J., and  
American ball never returned. Pretty soon, the Cuban stars who 
played after the likes of Tony Oliva, Luis Tiant, Tony Perez and 
Camilo Pascual stopped making their way out. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, some young boys who left the baseball-crazed country  
blossomed into big leaguers -- Jose Canseco, Rafael Palmeiro and 
Tony Fossas, among them. 
</P>
<P>
	And more recently, Cuban defectors have been making a major  
impact in the majors -- 1997 World Series MVP Livan Hernandez, his 
older half-brother, Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, Rey Ordonez and 
Rolando Arrojo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Communist Party's Granma newspaper prints nothing about the  
defectors, although it occasionally ran stories last year about 
Mark McGwire. Two years before floating away from Cuba to star in 
his own World Series, El Duque listened to Livan's games broadcast 
on a radio station from Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Chances are, a major league team wouldn't have returned to Cuba  
until well into the new millennium if not for Orioles owner Peter 
Angelos. He started pushing for the trip several years ago, wanting 
to be the first to take a team back. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebuffed in his first bid in 1996, Angelos didn't give up.  
Staying in touch with the State Department and the White House, he 
got a break in January when President Clinton lightened 
restrictions against Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Even then, it was difficult to set up a home-and-home series  
that included the Cubans visiting Camden Yards in Baltimore May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	It took more trips to Cuba and more negotiations before both  
sides agreed what to do with the proceeds. The Americans didn't 
want any money going to Castro's government, so whatever is made 
will be used to support sports in both places. 
</P>
<P>
	Box seats for Cuban games usually cost 2 pesos (about 10 cents).  
But that's a lot in a place where the average monthly income is 
less than $11. In coming years, the delicately arranged visit might 
lead to more teams playing on the Caribbean island, provided all 
papers are in order. The Orioles had to scramble to make sure 
players without passports were not held up by visa problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this works, I'd encourage it,'' commissioner Bud Selig  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the game probably won't make it easier for Cuban players,  
such as star third baseman Omar Linares, to join the majors. It 
also probably won't make it easier for the Orioles or anyone else 
to tap into Cuban talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there are a lot of ballplayers who can come here right  
now and play,'' said Oliva, the former AL batting champion and now 
a minor league hitting coach for Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Linares hit three home runs, including an upper-deck drive at  
Atlanta's Fulton-County Stadium that clinched the gold medal at the 
1996 Olympics. He probably will not get to see Orioles third 
baseman Cal Ripken, whose father, Cal Sr., died Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Orioles will be the only team from the majors in Cuba,  
the rest of the league also will have a presence. Each team was 
allowed to send two representatives, although not every club will 
do that. 
</P>
<P>
	There also were other issues to be worked out, such as umpires,  
bats (the Cubans will use wood, instead of the aluminum they've had 
since 1977) and the need for padding on the outfield walls. 
</P>
<P>
	Set up as an exchange of sportsmanship, not political views, the  
game still has its opponents. Several groups have protested at 
Orioles games this spring, with Marlins owner John Henry taking 
part. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles pitcher Juan Guzman, who was born in the Dominican  
Republic and lives in Miami, asked out of the trip. And although 
Cuban umpires will work the game, AL umpire Rich Garcia called the 
exhibition ``a disgrace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball ``is being very insensitive to the Cuban people and the  
Cuban players,'' said Garcia, whose great-grandparents were Cuban. 
``They have families over there who are suffering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer played winter ball in Cuba long before Castro took over  
and remembers the good times, when music and dancing and cigar 
smoke filled the stands. Others who played then also talk fondly 
about those days. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best ball ever played in Latin America was played in  
Cuba,'' said Tony Gonzalez, an outfielder who starred for the Sugar 
Kings in the late '50s before hitting .300 three times for the 
Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stadium was well-kept, just like in the major leagues. The  
field was great,'' he said. ``The fans liked to argue, telling you 
what you did right and wrong. In Cuba, they loved baseball.''

<HEADLINE> Auburn Wins NCAA Swimming Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Ryk Neethling won the 1650 freestyle for the  
second consecutive year and Auburn took the team title in the NCAA 
swimming and diving championships on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Neethling, the 1996 Olympian who guided Arizona to a fifth place  
finish, also defended his title in the 200- and 500 freestyle. He 
became the eighth man in history to register three individual 
victories in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel very good about my performance today. I don't  
know what went wrong, but I know I should have been faster than 
that,'' Neethling said. ``I came here to win three titles and 
that's what I did, but I'm not happy with my time. Next year, I'll 
try to win three titles again and try to etch my name in with some 
pretty exclusive company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn won its second national championship in three years with  
467.5 points. Defending champion Stanford placed second (414.5) and 
Texas finished third with 356.5. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers secured the title by edging Stanford for first place  
in the 400 freestyle relay, the competition's final event. Auburn's 
time of 2:50.90 established a new NCAA record. The Tigers' winning 
relay team was composed of Brock Newman, Brett Hawke, Aaron Ciarla 
and Romain Barnier. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a dream come true,'' said Auburn's Dave Denniston,  
winner of the 200 breaststroke (1:55.51). ``This is why I came to 
Auburn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford kept the competition close throughout the final day,  
but could not catch the Tigers. Tate Blahnik registered a key 
victory for The Cardinal in the 200 backstroke with a time of 
1:41.42. The win propelled Stanford past Texas for good. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew this was going to be a tight meet. Our spirit has been  
really high all week,'' Blahnik said. ``We stayed positive. We 
stayed focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn's David Marsh was named Coach of the Year. Diver of the  
Year and Diving Coach of the Year honors went to Miami's Randy 
Ableman and Rio Ramirez respectively.

<HEADLINE> Peck, Ellis Win Wooden Coach Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Coaches Carolyn Peck of Purdue and Cliff  
Ellis of Auburn are the recipients of the 1999 John and Nellie 
Wooden Awards as the nation's top college basketball coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah Tip Off Club, which presents the awards in honor of the  
renowned former UCLA coach and his late wife, announced the winners 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Peck's Big Ten-champion Lady Boilermakers will play in Sunday's  
NCAA championship game against Duke. She has led Purdue to a 33-1 
record in just her second year at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Peck is a former assistant of Tennessee's Pat Summitt, who was  
last year's winner of the Wooden Award. Peck will become coach of 
the WNBA's expansion Orlando franchise this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis' Auburn Tigers were one of the big surprises in college  
basketball this season as they posted a 29-4 record, a Southeastern 
Conference title and a top seed in the NCAA tournament before 
losing to Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis, a former coach at South Alabama and Clemson, won his  
400th game this season and was the SEC's coach of the year for the 
second time. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards will be presented at a banquet in Salt Lake April 10.

<HEADLINE> Morgan Freeman's Tale of Mutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- On July 17, 1944, a ship loaded with  
munitions exploded at Port Chicago in San Francisco Bay, killing 
320 men, most of them black sailors. It was the worst home-front 
disaster of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The tragedy and its legal aftermath are the subject of  
``Mutiny,'' an NBC movie airing on Sunday, March 28, at 9 p.m 
(EST). 
</P>
<P>
	Before the explosion, the sailors had complained about long  
hours and unsafe conditions for handling the munitions -- a task for 
which they were untrained. Afterward, they were assigned the same 
duty at another Navy base. Fearing the same fate that befell their 
comrades, 50 sailors refused their assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	They were court-martialed and sentenced to 15 years at hard  
labor for mutiny. After the war, President Truman pardoned them. 
The survivors of Port Chicago still hope for an act of Congress to 
exonerate them with honorable discharges. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jai White, Duane Martin and David Ramsey portray the  
sailor-stevedores. Morgan Freeman does not appear, but served as 
executive producer through his film and television company, 
Revelations Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-time Oscar nominee for acting, in ``Street Smart,''  
``Driving Miss Daisy'' and ``The Shawshank Redemption,'' Freeman 
started the company two years ago. ``The idea was to make a 
specific kind of movie, hopefully ones that would inform us as well 
as entertain us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman noted a similar footnote-to-history background for two  
honored black-heritage films in which he appeared in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I think of things like 'Glory' and 'Amistad,' these are  
moments in American history that were completely hidden away. There 
are history buffs who know something about the stories, but the 
general public knows nothing. I thoroughly believe in the dictum 
about knowing your history in order to know yourself. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a country, we don't know ourselves. We just know what we've  
been told in the general history books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman admits he had been unaware of the Port Chicago disaster.  
</P>
<P>
	``I knew there had been a massive explosion during World War  
II,'' he said. ``I didn't know that Port Chicago is in California. 
This whole experience has been a history lesson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nor did he know about the mutiny and the support the sailors got  
from Thurgood Marshall, then of the NAACP and later Supreme Court 
justice. Marshall is portrayed by Joe Morton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mutiny'' portrays a wartime Navy as segregated as the Deep  
South of that era. Morgan Freeman knows that scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up in Mississippi in a segregated society,'' he  
remarked. ``To me, that was all to my good. I am who I am because 
of who I was. I didn't grow up in a society that told me one thing 
and showed me another. You need a face on it to deal with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For ``Mutiny,'' Freeman visited filming locations and took part  
in preproduction, including the bane of most actors -- auditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's such a hard process,'' said Freeman, who went through  
plenty of them in his early career.'' 'Just read this paragraph for 
me.' You almost make an arbitrary decision: Is this actor nervous? 
Can he do the job?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He recalled one of his worst experiences on the other side of  
the table, auditioning for Sidney Poitier, who was directing a 
play, ``Welcome to Morningside Heights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was working with another young actor who hyperventilated. He  
started to shake, and I had to walk him backstage so he wouldn't 
pass out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't get the job anyway, because Sidney was going to give  
it to Lou Gossett, who was a friend of his from 'Raisin in the 
Sun'.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Maintains Military Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As he guides the U.S. role in the NATO  
airstrikes on Yugoslavia, President Clinton is not hunched in a war 
room surrounded by maps and stern generals in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	His preferred setting is the Oval Office, with foreign policy  
advisers in business suits -- and at least one in uniform -- settled 
back on yellow sofas. 
</P>
<P>
	With no military experience, Clinton avoids the image of the  
saber-rattling commander-in-chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``The style seems to be to bring the two sides together, then  
carry a big stick,'' said John Mueller, a University of Rochester 
political scientist who has written about presidents and war. ``The 
hope is that the threat would be enough. That works fine if they 
capitulate. If they don't, you're left with the dilemma of using 
the stick or looking foolish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the assault two days old, the president had a videotaped  
message beamed into Yugoslavia by satellite and sent on the 
Internet Friday. That tactic -- friendly words for a nation's people 
while military action is focused against its leader -- is one 
Clinton has used before, with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also had Secretary of State Madeleine Albright -- whose  
father was a Czech diplomat in Belgrade before World War II -- 
deliver a message in the Serbs' own language. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello. I am glad to have this opportunity to speak directly to  
the people of Serbia at this critical time,'' she said. ``As you 
can see, I remember a little Serbian, albeit with a Czech accent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is the first president in a half-century who has no  
military background. He seemed uncomfortable about that during his 
first term, even going to the length of taking lessons in saluting 
from former national security adviser Tony Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of his lack of experience and because he is the first  
of the post-World War II, Vietnam-generation presidents, he has 
tended to be more deferential to military points of view than 
others,'' said Ivon Daalder, who served as the National Security 
Council's director of European affairs during Clinton's first term. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has not been willing to take on the military, even if it  
was evident that doing so may have served his purposes, foreign 
policy and otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when delivering a sensitive foreign policy message, such as  
his address to the nation from the Oval Office earlier this week, 
Clinton doesn't simply recite the lines his security experts hand 
him. He constantly reworks the texts. 
</P>
<P>
	During his first term, Clinton oversaw U.S. intervention in  
Somalia, where 18 soldiers died, followed by the humiliating 
withdrawal of American forces. He sent troops to Haiti in a 
successful mission to reinstate elected President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide, then passed off command to a multinational peacekeeping 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	And in 1995, there were the airstrikes over Bosnia, with no  
American fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
	Well into his second term, Clinton is more at ease. Last fall,  
he ordered airstrikes on Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for 
bombings at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. There have been 
several flare-ups with Iraq, and earlier this year nearly daily 
bombings of Iraqi sites. 
</P>
<P>
	As commander-in-chief, Clinton is ``detail oriented,'' said  
David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council. ``He asks 
a lot of questions and demands a lot of answers. He has made clear 
that he wants to be briefed on any and all important developments. 
He wants to think two or three moves down the chessboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In times like these, aides say, Clinton is a hands-on manager --  
but not so hands-on that he feels he should select bombing targets 
as President Johnson sometimes did during the Vietnam War.

<HEADLINE> Congress To Debate Dairy Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Depending on your point of view, letting  
groups of states join together to set milk prices in their region 
either helps stabilize the cost of that gallon jug against market 
swings or artificially inflates the price, at consumer's expense. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, Congress will decide the future of such regional dairy  
compacts as lawmakers tackle how to regulate one sector of an 
agricultural economy reeling from depressed prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress agreed to compacts as part of the farm reform law in  
1996. Only one now operates, the Northeast Dairy Compact, which 
began in 1997 and includes Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New 
Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	But other states want to join that compact or form their own.  
</P>
<P>
	The compacts allow states to band together and set what they  
consider a ``fair price'' for fluid milk. A commission funded with 
dairy producer contributions controls the operations and 
establishes a price higher than the federal government's for the 
commodity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northeast compact is set to expire Oct. 1 unless Congress  
agrees to reauthorize it. Meantime, a dozen southern states, 
including Georgia, Mississippi and Louisiana, are pushing for 
congressional approval to start a Southern Dairy Compact. 
</P>
<P>
	But some lawmakers, particularly those from the Upper Midwest,  
complain that the Northeast compact frustrates farmers from their 
states who might want to sell milk in New England. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Wisconsin lawmakers blocked a provision in last fall's  
budget discussions that would have extended the life of the 
Northeast compact. 
</P>
<P>
	Compact proponents say the regional agreements protect consumers  
from fluctuating prices. They note that the average retail price of 
a gallon of whole milk in Boston from April to June 1998 was $2.69, 
compared with a range of $2.76 in Philadelphia to $3.12 in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``This program does not cost the government anything at all,''  
said Robert Gray, executive director of the States Ratification 
Committee, a coalition of leaders from state agriculture 
departments of agriculture who are pushing the compact idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``The compact has really worked as a safety net to see that when  
you have these deep valleys, there is some sort of cushion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just this month, the government said the price producers receive  
for milk would fall $6 to $10.27 per hundred pounds of milk, the 
sharpest decline from one month to another in the industry's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those of us who belong to the existing Northeast Dairy Compact  
are able to soften the blow to our farmers,'' said Leon Graves, 
commissioner of Vermont's Department of Food and Markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Odom, Louisiana's Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner and  
a leading backer of a Southern Dairy Compact, said compacts are 
``sound public policy'' offering stable prices for both consumers 
and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom and others argue that since the 1996 farm law reduced  
government intervention in the dairy industry, compacts help 
maintain the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents, from milk processors to consumer activists, tell a  
different story. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our interest is to sell milk. Compacts interfere with that.  
Higher costs decrease consumption,'' said E. Linwood Tipton, 
president of the International Dairy Foods Association, which 
represents processors. 
</P>
<P>
	Added John Schnittker, an economist with Public Voice for Food  
and Health Policy: Compacts are ``effectively cheating consumers of 
savings on fluid milk products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Complicating the debate over compacts' future is the issue of  
reforming the federal milk marketing order, which basically is the 
federal government's pricing system. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the order program, different parts of the country are  
divided into ``marketing orders'' which are arranged by the 
agriculture secretary and which set the minimum price of milk in 
those areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress in 1996 told USDA to consolidate the 31 existing orders  
to between 10 and 14. The agency has proposed 11 and Agriculture 
Secretary Dan Glickman this week is expected to release the final 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the price paid to compact producers exceeds that of the  
marketing order, some groups such as Public Voice complain it 
eventually filters down to consumers.

from former national security adviser Tony Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of his lack of experience and because he is the first  
of the post-World War II, Vietnam-generation presidents, he has 
tended to be more deferential to military points of view than 
others,'' said Ivon Daalder, who served as the National Security 
Council's director of European affairs during Clinton's first term. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has not been willing to take on the military, even if it  
was evident that doing so may have served his purposes, foreign 
policy and otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when delivering a sensitive foreign policy message, such as  
his address to the nation from the Oval Office earlier this week, 
Clinton doesn't simply recite the lines his security experts hand 
him. He constantly reworks the texts. 
</P>
<P>
	During his first term, Clinton oversaw U.S. intervention in  
Somalia, where 18 soldiers died, followed by the humiliating 
withdrawal of American forces. He sent troops to Haiti in a 
successful mission to reinstate elected President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide, then passed off command to a multinational peacekeeping 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	And in 1995, there were the airstrikes over Bosnia, with no  
American fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
	Well into his second term, Clinton is more at ease. Last fall,  
he ordered airstrikes on Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for 
bombings at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. There have been 
several flare-ups with Iraq, and earlier this year nearly daily 
bombings of Iraqi sites. 
</P>
<P>
	As commander-in-chief, Clinton is ``detail oriented,'' said  
David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council. ``He asks 
a lot of questions and demands a lot of answers. He has made clear 
that he wants to be briefed on any and all important developments. 
He wants to think two or three moves down the chessboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In times like these, aides say, Clinton is a hands-on manager --  
but not so hands-on that he feels he should select bombing targets 
as President Johnson sometimes did during the Vietnam War.

<HEADLINE> New York Street Crime Unit Revamped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The police department announced major changes in  
its elite crimefighting unit on the heels of reports that four of 
its white members were indicted for murder in the killing of an 
unarmed black immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers in the Street Crime Unit will now wear uniforms instead  
of plainclothes, and 50 slots at the predominately white division 
will be reassigned to minority police officers, under changes 
announced Friday by Police Commissioner Howard Safir. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes are partly in response to concerns voiced by  
political and community leaders as well as city residents, Safir 
said. The changes may take place as early as Sunday, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Safir, Mayor Giuliani and the unit have been under intense  
criticism and scrutiny ever since four of the unit's officers fired 
41 bullets at Amadou Diallo on Feb. 4 in the vestibule of his Bronx 
home. He was hit 19 times. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the case told The Associated Press on Thursday  
that a grand jury had decided to indict all four officers for 
second-degree murder. The indictment remains sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers have yet to say publicly what happened, but a  
lawyer representing one of them has said they believed the 
22-year-old street vendor from Guinea was reaching for a gun. 
Critics have said Diallo -- who was black -- may have been acting 
strangely because he was approached at night by the four white 
officers in plainclothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Safir said clothing has apparently caused confusion in some  
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was explained to me a number of times that an individual  
would be followed by a nondescript car, three people in 
plainclothes would get out of the car, and a couple of people said 
to me: 'I just kept going because I didn't know who they were,''' 
Safir said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Diallo's killing, federal and state officials launched  
probes into the department, and more than 1,000 people have been 
arrested in civil disobedience demonstrations outside police 
headquarters in the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jesse Jackson was among 216 people arrested Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Safir said he plans to promote about 300 of the 380 Street Crime  
members to the rank of detective specialist, reassign 50 of them to 
robbery and apprehension units and earmark their Street Crime slots 
for minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	He said since Diallo's death, there has been a drop in 67  
percent arrests made by the Street Crime Unit. Safir blamed the 
media for the decrease, saying its members have been ``relentless 
in vilifying the Street Crime Unit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unit, whose motto is ``We Own the Night,'' was formed in  
1971, and expanded in 1997 by Giuliani. Because the unit works in 
high-violence areas, its officers have always worn plainclothes to 
fit into the neighborhoods they patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	The unit commander, Inspector Bruce Smolka Jr., said he'll take  
a ``wait and see'' attitude about the potential impact of putting 
his employees in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani lent his support to the plan.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am certain these changes will result in positive  
improvements,'' he said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> US Teen Skater Last but Has Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) - For a 13-year-old figure skater who was  
not supposed to be at the World Championships, Sarah Hughes had a 
great time. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes nailed six triples to finish sixth in the free skating  
and seventh overall as Maria Butyrskaya of Russia beat out American 
Michelle Kwan for the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a blast out there. It was so much fun,'' she said. ``I'm  
just so happy. Being here is so great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The skater from Great Neck, N.Y., was ninth after the short  
program. 
</P>
<P>
	She skated to ``Swan Lake'' in the long program Saturday, not  
making any major mistakes and even doing two triple lutzes 
including one in combination. 
</P>
<P>
	She received marks from 5.2 up to 5.6, and finished ahead of the  
other American, Angela Nikodinov, who came in 12th. Hughes was 
ecstatic coming off the ice and hugged her coach Robin Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes finished fourth in the U.S. championships in February  
with only three women's spots available. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 13-year-old, Naomi Nari Nam, was second to Kwan but was  
not allowed on the team, being below the minimum age limit of 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Hughes was picked because of a special exception  
that allows junior worlds medalists to participate in the senior 
worlds. Hughes was second in the world junior championships in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't do anything about the rules ... I just wanted to do my  
best and not worry,'' Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes was the youngest competitor in Helsinki. She said she  
didn't let her age worry her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't really think about it. I just wanted to show I could  
do well here, that I belong here,'' Hughes said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Asks for School Prayer Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A federal appeals court should reconsider  
its ruling that student-led prayers before Texas public high school 
football games are unconstitutional, Gov. George W. Bush said in 
court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and Republican Attorney General John Cornyn together filed  
a brief Friday, asking the court the revisit the case involving of 
the Santa Fe school district, about 30 miles southeast of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican governor, who this month formed a presidential  
exploratory committee, ``supports the right of students to 
participate in the free exercise of religion, a right which is 
guaranteed under the Constitution,'' said Bush spokesman Scott 
McClellan. 
</P>
<P>
	``And he believes government should not dictate or censor the  
content of student-led prayer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently upheld a lower  
court's decision allowing limited prayer at graduation ceremonies, 
but ruled out the prayers or other ``solemnizing ceremonies'' 
before football games. 
</P>
<P>
	Two unidentified Houston-area parents sued the school district  
in 1995, claiming that football game prayers violated the 
constitutional separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe football is sacred in Texas,'' said American Civil  
Liberties Union attorney Anthony Griffin. ``It's frightening to me 
that we now use religious stuff hypocritically and we ignore that 
this is a diverse society ... we shouldn't do that in our public 
schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cornyn said limiting graduation ceremony invocations or  
benediction prayers to ``nonsectarian'' or ``nonproselytizing'' 
prayers will force school officials to censor them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision asks the state to decide what type of prayer  
should be allowed. To ask the state to supervise religious speech 
is clearly unconstitutional,'' Cornyn said.

<HEADLINE> Pedro Martinez Ready for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Pedro Martinez has only one spring  
training start left. He doesn't really need it. 
</P>
<P>
	Not after striking out 10 and allowing three hits in six innings  
Friday against Texas. Not after giving up only two runs in 20 
innings over his last four starts. Not after reducing his 
exhibition ERA to 1.29 and improving his record to 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, 19-7 with a 2.89 ERA with Boston last year after  
winning the NL Cy Young Award with Montreal in 1997, is ready for 
opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I am the same way I was (Friday), I'm ready to go,''  
Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
	He left the game with a 4-1 lead and the Red Sox went on to a  
10-3 win over the Rangers. Martinez started by striking out leadoff 
hitter Tom Goodwin. Then he picked up the pace. 
</P>
<P>
	He struck out the side in the second, fanned one batter in the  
third, two in the fourth, two in the fifth and another in the 
sixth. He struck out eight of the nine starters, allowed only five 
balls out of the infield and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had good command of his pitches, a lot of strike-one  
counts,'' Boston manager Jimy Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez left his previous start after six shutout innings  
against Pittsburgh but had no strikeouts. The difference Friday? 
</P>
<P>
	``An extra day off, probably, and also the fastball was going  
way up (in the strike zone),'' Martinez said. ``That was the 
reason, extra juice and the extra rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's on schedule to pitch the opener April 5 at Kansas City.  
His final exhibition start is set for Wednesday against Pittsburgh, 
which has scored only once in 10 innings against him this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez has had only one poor performance. It came in his first  
exhibition game March 6 when he lasted one inning against 
Cincinnati and allowed four runs, three walks and one hit, although 
only one run was earned. 
</P>
<P>
	Four days later, he pitched four shutout innings against the  
world champion New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good,'' Martinez said. ``I'm already past the fifth  
inning. That's a quality outing. I think that will be good enough 
the first few outings and, from there on, stretch it out a 
little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez wouldn't mind matching his opening-day performance last  
season. In his first game with the Red Sox, he struck out 11, and 
allowed only three hits and two walks in seven innings in a 2-0 win 
at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	By the All-Star break, he was 11-2. Now he seems in midseason  
form nine days before the season begins. But he still has some 
things he'd like to work on. 
</P>
<P>
	``From now on, it's just a matter of keeping my focus and  
keeping my mind in the game and staying healthy,'' Martinez said. 
``If I manage to do that, the rest is going to happen by itself.''

<HEADLINE> Oliver Stone Must Give Deposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMITE, La. (AP) -- Oliver Stone has been ordered to give a  
deposition in a lawsuit that claims his film ``Natural Born 
Killers'' was responsible for the shooting of a convenience store 
clerk. 
</P>
<P>
	The director is scheduled to give testimony on April 14 in  
Amite, La., said Joe Simpson, an attorney for the family of Patsy 
Byers, who was paralyzed in a robbery-shooting involving two 
teen-agers in 1995. She died of cancer in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The family filed suit against Stone and Time Warner, which was  
involved in the movie's production and release. Their lawsuit says 
Sarah Edmondson shot Byers while Benjamin Darrus waited outside a 
Louisiana store, and that the two were inspired to commit the crime 
by watching the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone's attorney, Alton Lewis, claimed the suit threatens First  
Amendment rights to free speech. But the U.S. Supreme Court on 
March 8 denied a review of a state appeals court ruling that the 
case should not be dismissed, and sent it back to the Louisiana 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis was out of the office Friday and could not comment, his  
office said.

<HEADLINE> Doug Gilmour Sidelined for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Doug Gilmour, whose signing as a  
free agent failed to turn the Chicago Blackhawks into a playoff 
contender, will be sidelined the rest of the season with a bulging 
disk in his back. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old center is considering microsurgery to shave the  
disk that is pressing on his sciatic nerve. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's starting to go down my leg a lot more,'' Gilmour said of  
the pain. ``I was trying to play for Lorne (coach Lorne Molleken) 
and I wanted to see if I could get through the whole year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gilmour, who signed a three-year, $18 million contract in the  
offseason, spoke with Blackhawks general manager Bob Murray after a 
tie with Boston on Thursday and they decided that Gilmour should 
stop playing. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilmour intends to get a second opinion in California before  
making a final decision on his back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not major,'' said Gilmour, whose 16 goals and 40 assists  
was second on the Blackhawks in scoring. ``It's not career-ending 
or anything like that. It's something that I have to attend to. 
Maybe in three weeks it will go away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gilmour had played in the Blackhawks' first 72 games, the last  
coming on Thursday night in a 3-3 tie with Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Molleken felt Gilmour should have gotten help sooner.  
</P>
<P>
	``He shouldn't have been playing for the last six weeks or so,''  
said the interim coach who replaced Dirk Graham 14 games ago. 
``He's been playing in a lot of pain. We know what Dougie Gilmour 
is all about. He competes on the ice in all the tough areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been many times we told him to take the equipment  
off, but there was no way,'' Molleken said. ``We just about had to 
rassle him down to the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gilmour joined the NHL in 1983-84 and he has played in 1,197  
games, scoring 397 goals and 835 assists. A winner of the Selke 
Trophy as the NHL's best defensive forward in 1993, he ranks 20th 
on the NHL's career assists list. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilmour has played with St. Louis, Calgary, Toronto, New Jersey  
and now Chicago. He won a Stanley Cup in 1989 with the Flames in 
Calgary and won a gold medal as a member of Team Canada in the 1987 
Canada Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilmour was acquired by New Jersey on Feb. 27, 1997 from Toronto  
in a five player deal. While the Devils wanted him to stay after 
last season, the veteran could not turn down the money offered by 
the Blackhawks, who are on the verge of missing the playoffs for 
second straight year after making them the previous 28 years.

<HEADLINE> 35 Dead Remain in French Tunnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COURMAYEUR, Italy (AP) -- The charred bodies of at least 35  
victims remained in the Mont Blanc tunnel while officials tried to 
figure out why a fire aboard a truck carrying flour and margarine 
turned so deadly. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until late Friday afternoon, two days after the blaze  
broke out, that firefighters from three countries were finally able 
to extinguish it. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-mile tunnel under Western Europe's highest peak is a key  
route between France and Italy, handling some 4,000 vehicles daily. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Italian side, tunnel authority director Francesco Colombo  
put the death toll at 35. On the French side, Philippe Pathous, 
fire chief for the Haute-Savoie region, said as many as 40 people 
might have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said today it could be another two days before the  
tunnel is safe enough for a complete inspection and for a final 
death toll to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies, most found in and around their cars, were still in  
the tunnel, left in place so investigators could conduct their 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Rene Guichard, an investigator for the French state prosecutor  
in the Haute-Savoie region, said today that officials could start 
removing bodies on the French side of the tunnel later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement  
arrived in Chamonix today to take part in a funeral service for 
George Tosello, a 54-year-old French firefighter who died of a 
heart attack after being evacuated from the tunnel Wednesday. 
Firefighters on the Italian side of the tunnel observed a moment of 
silence in memory of Tosello. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire raised questions about the emergency systems in the  
tunnel, which is equipped with ventilation equipment and 17 
shelters, each of which can hold dozens of people. The shelters are 
designed to resist heat and poisonous fumes for two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a handful of the victims managed to reach the shelters.  
</P>
<P>
	Many felt security measures were not enough. ``For a long time  
now it has been said that the Mont Blanc tunnel is no longer 
adapted'' to heavy truck traffic, said the mayor of Chamonix, 
Michel Charlet. He called for a ban on heavy trucks in the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombo said an alert was sounded 60 seconds after the fire  
broke out, and he insisted that tunnel officials from both 
countries responded promptly to the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the survivors was the driver of the Belgian truck that  
caught fire Wednesday morning, causing the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilbert Degraves, driving from France to Italy, said he was  
alerted to the fire when oncoming vehicles flashed their 
headlights, about four miles into the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoke billowed from his truck. He stopped, checked underneath  
and ``it exploded,'' Degraves, a truck driver for 25 years, told 
French RTL radio. ``It was a ball of fire for about 30 seconds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the victims was Pierlucio Tinazzi, a 33-year-old Italian  
tunnel employee. He saved 10 people, making repeated trips into the 
tunnel on his motorcycle before succumbing to the fire, Colombo 
told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I consider him a real hero,'' Colombo said. ``He did his duty,  
and we are very grateful to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Italian family of four from a nearby village was also killed,  
as were five other Italians, a French firefighter, and a French 
couple from Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first fatal fire in the tunnel, which was the longest  
in the world when President Charles de Gaulle opened it in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	The tunnel operator in France, Mont Blanc Tunnel and Highway,  
said about 20 tractor-trailer trucks and 11 cars were destroyed in 
the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures in the tunnel at one point reached at least 1,832  
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 firefighters from France, Italy and Switzerland  
battled poisonous fumes and searing temperatures for two days to 
tame the blaze. For the first time, they managed to penetrate the 
length of the tunnel on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a spray mist, they cooled it down to 158 degrees, then to  
122 degrees. Smoke rose from their protective gear as they emerged 
from the tunnel. They declined to speak to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Poisonous fumes blowing through the passage forced rescuers to  
focus on the Italian side. The stench of burning rubber hung in the 
mountain air. 
</P>
<P>
	The burning flour aboard the Belgian truck immediately thickened  
the smoke in the tunnel, Colombo said. 
</P>
<P>
	French Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot said the tunnel  
would remain closed for several weeks.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Seeking To Buy Hornets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Michael Jordan is negotiating to buy a  
share of the Charlotte Hornets, NBA officials confirmed today. 
</P>
<P>
	The league released a statement this morning from commissioner  
David Stern, who said Jordan has been talking with Charlotte owner 
George Shinn about purchasing a 50-percent share of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been preliminary discussions about Michael and  
George becoming equal partners in the ownership and operation of 
the Hornets,'' Stern's statement said. ``Those discussions are 
ongoing but are not near an agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn also released a statement saying he was hopeful of  
completing a deal with Jordan, who retired from the Chicago Bulls 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been preliminary discussions about Michael Jordan  
possibly becoming an ownership partner with me,'' Shinn said. ``Our 
hope over the next few meetings is to work out a partnership that 
will benefit the Hornets and the entire community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Jordan nor his agent, David Falk, could be immediately  
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn, who was part of the original ownership group when the  
Hornets joined the NBA in 1988, has come under increasing fire 
recently to sell the club. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets have lost several high-profile players because of  
the team's refusal to pay eight-figure salaries, and attendance has 
been on a steady decline in the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dave Cowens quit in frustration earlier this month, and  
Shinn, who is the defendant in a sexual misconduct lawsuit in South 
Carolina, rarely attends games anymore. He sat in the stands for 
Friday night's victory over Orlando but refused to speak to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn's wife has filed for divorce.  
</P>
<P>
	Into the mix steps Jordan, who in January ended his 13-year  
career with six championships, five MVP awards, 10 scoring titles 
and unsurpassed worldwide fame. 
</P>
<P>
	With an annual off-court income estimated at $45 million, Jordan  
could afford to buy a piece of a team with an estimated worth of 
$150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Buying into the Hornets also would put Jordan closer to his  
childhood roots. He is a North Carolina native who was raised in 
Wilmington and played for North Carolina's Tar Heels. His mother 
lives in Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could work out great for everybody,'' said a Hornets  
employee who spoke today on the condition of anonymity. ``This 
could help George solve his image problem, give Michael something 
to do in retirement and give the team a boost at the same time.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Says Social Security Protected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft promised today  
that the Republican budget passed this week would protect Social 
Security from a ``spending raid'' by an administration seeking to 
fund new programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft praised the GOP-written budgets, similar versions of  
which passed the House and Senate Thursday, for strengthening the 
Social Security trust fund and safeguarding it from lawmakers who 
might try to dip into the system to pay for other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Social Security Trust Fund should not be used as a  
personal piggy bank for Washington politicians to finance their pet 
programs,'' Ashcroft said in the weekly Republican radio address. 
``This week's budget stops them dead in their tracks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft also applauded the Senate's rejection of a plan by  
President Clinton to invest $700 billion in Social Security money 
in the stock market. The senator had pushed for an amendment to 
prevent what he called a risky scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans should not have their Social Security trust fund  
invested in the stock market by government bureaucrats who want to 
play stockbroker for a day,'' Ashcroft said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget plan would set aside about $1.65 trillion in  
Social Security surpluses over the next decade for debt reduction, 
which is supposed to strengthen the economy and make it easier for 
the government to raise money to pay benefits. Clinton also would 
place Treasury bonds in the Social Security trust fund, which he 
says would extend the trust fund's solvency for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans would leave all $1.8 trillion in Social Security  
surpluses envisioned for the next decade for debt reduction. That 
is more than Clinton proposed, but he would set aside more than 
Republicans would over 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft also said GOP-backed tax cuts, topping $830 billion  
over the next decade, would help Americans keep more of what they 
make.

<HEADLINE> Delta To Again Prohibit Pets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines is advising passengers making  
summer travel plans that it won't be allowing animals to be checked 
as baggage when the temperature is above 85 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based carrier said Friday it has begun requiring  
passengers to notify the airline of plans to check an animal as 
baggage when they book a reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta also is asking customers planning to travel with pets in  
June, July or August to book flights leaving before noon or after 6 
p.m. to avoid the hottest part of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, several dogs were killed in Delta cargo holds when  
extreme heat gripped much of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Agriculture's Animal-Plant Health Inspection  
Service requires that pets not be checked as baggage if the animal 
will be exposed to temperatures below 45 degrees or above 85 
degrees for more than 45 minutes in flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta excluded tropical fish shipments from the rule.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's ruling party could lose the 2000  
presidential race -- in what would be its first defeat at the polls 
in 70 years -- if internal divisions develop, said former President 
Miguel de la Madrid, according to local reports Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	De la Madrid's comments came after a maverick candidate for the  
party's top leadership post quit the race, claiming the group's 
decisions were not democratic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Evidently, there is a risk of losing the presidency in 2000 if  
a serious fracture in the party occurs,'' de la Madrid said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	De la Madrid -- a member of the ruling Institutional  
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, who served as president from 1982-88 -- 
said Rodolfo Echeverria's decision Thursday to quit the race ``may 
weaken the party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the other candidate in the race, Jose Gonzalez  
Fernandez, was handpicked by President Ernesto Zedillo, and is 
guaranteed the post. 
</P>
<P>
	The party will vote for the presidency Tuesday.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Robbers shot a South American  
swimming champion in Rio de Janeiro when she evaded their attempt 
to steal her car, hospital staff said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariana Moraes Rangel, 23, the continent's 800 meter freestyle  
champion, was wounded in the thigh late Friday, said Catia 
Oliveira, a spokeswoman for the Souza Aguira hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite her wound, the Brazilian swimmer drove on to a gas  
station to get help, said Oliveira. She had surgery in hospital and 
was expected to recover fully.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Troops rescued a German man and four  
Colombians abducted early Saturday by suspected leftist rebels on a 
southern backroad, the army reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The guerrillas briefly exchanged gunfire with soldiers, and two  
of at least four fleeing rebels were detained, the local army 
commander, Gen. Carlos Ospina, told The Associated Press. No 
injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The German was identified as Joseph Meir, 58. It was not  
possible to confirm his identify through the German Embassy in 
Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colombian hostages included an engineer, a landowner and a  
79-year-old man, the army said. The identity of the fourth 
Colombian was not known. 
</P>
<P>
	The five were abducted in El Castillo, a rural town 75 miles  
southeast of Bogota in Meta State. 
</P>
<P>
	Ospina blamed the kidnapping on Colombia's largest guerrilla  
group, the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no comment from the rebel group, which is active in  
the region and frequently kidnaps foreigners and Colombians for 
ransom.

authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve containers carrying 1,300 pounds of cocaine were  
discovered in a routine search late-Friday of a warehouse at 
Bogota's El Dorado international airport, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The drugs were sealed in more than 600 plastic packages stashed  
inside the drums, which also contained chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they detained two men Friday in connection with the  
shipment, which was registered to a Colombian company. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia is the world's largest source of cocaine, exporting  
more than 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Russian Tops Kwan for Skating Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Maria Butyrskaya of Russia, thought to  
be too old and too skittish to be figure skating world champion, 
took the title from Michelle Kwan Saturday with a dynamic and solid 
performance that left her younger and usually steadier rival with 
the silver. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya, 26, had stumbled in previous high-pressure finals,  
but she was clearly in command from the opening moments of her 
free-skating program, leading off with a soaring triple lutz to a 
piano concerto by Raul di Blasio. 
</P>
<P>
	The serious music and pure white dress were a distinct contrast  
to her short program Friday, when she wore hot red and skated to a 
moaning blues. But the common factor in the two routines was her 
energy and assurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I skated like a woman and showed I can control my nerves,''  
said Butyrskaya, who became the oldest-ever women's champion. ``Age 
isn't very important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the nine judges gave her 5.9s for presentation, the other  
marks were 5.8s. She landed seven triple jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan, the defending champion, lacked her usual sparkle, and  
seemed tentative technically, converting a planned double axel into 
a single and landing her opening triple lutz a bit awkwardly. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlining the contrast between the two, Butyrskaya's final  
jump was a clean and vigorous double axel. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old Kwan had caught a cold en route to Helsinki, and  
although she'd overcome it by the end of the week, it had 
undermined her earlier practices -- and her confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, ``I felt OK ... but my cold probably hit me harder  
psychologically,'' she said. ``I was fighting inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan's long program, to Jules Massenet's symphonic piece  
``Lamento d'Ariane,'' was distinctly stronger than Friday's short 
program, when she fell on a double axel. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the performance, I fought,'' Kwan said. ``And that's  
why I'm satisfied now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she had ended the short program in fourth place, while  
Butyrskaya was in first. Under this year's new scoring system, 
Butyrskaya would have had to place third or lower in the free 
skating for Kwan to have a chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
	From the moment Butyrskaya ended her routine with a triumphant  
arm raise, her face working with emotion, it was clear that Kwan 
was out of contention. 
</P>
<P>
	Julia Soldatova of Russia, the bronze medalist, completed a  
triple salchow-triple toe loop, the only skater to do that 
combination in the final program. 
</P>
<P>
	American Sarah Hughes, at 13 the championships' youngest  
entrant, finished seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya's victory completed a sweep for the Russian team.  
</P>
<P>
	Alexei Yagudin won the men's title with a brilliant free skating  
display of a quad and eight triple jumps. In all, there were 14 
quads done by men at the world championships, the most ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze took the pairs title  
amid a controversy where two judges appeared to be seen to be 
conversing and exchanging signals during the competition. A 
technically superior but less artistic Chinese pair was second. 
</P>
<P>
	In ice dancing, Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov won on a  
5-4 decision over a French couple.

<HEADLINE> Test Satellite Goes Up From Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- A rocket roared off a converted oil  
platform floating in the equatorial Pacific Saturday in the first 
test of an international venture's oceangoing satellite launch 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ukrainian- and Russian-built Zenit-3SL rocket carried a  
dummy satellite as it lifted off from the Odyssey, a self-propelled 
platform stationed 1,400 miles south of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Fueled by kerosene and liquid oxygen, the three-stage rocket  
ignited and engulfed the platform in a cloud of smoke, then rapidly 
hurtled toward space. About an hour later, the satellite separated 
from the third stage at an altitude of 1,200 miles and continued on 
toward its planned position 23,000 miles above Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Sea Launch Co.'s inaugural launch was conducted from mission  
control on the accompanying ship Sea Launch Commander. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything looks good right at the moment,'' Sea Launch  
president and general manager Allen Ashy said from the ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials watched by satellite video link to Long Beach,  
home port for the two vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	The launch was delayed more than three hours by minor problems  
with support equipment. The company, citing cautiousness, had 
already pushed it back one day. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstration launch was a critical step for Sea Launch Co.,  
which has put $500 million into the first commercial marine-based 
launch system in hopes of capturing a chunk of the growing business 
of boosting communications satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	Launches at the equator allow a rocket to carry more weight into  
space than they can from other latitudes. The payload simulated an 
HS 702, a big commercial communications satellite built by Hughes 
Space and Communications.

<HEADLINE> Rapper ODB Arrested, Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rapper ODB was back in jail Friday -- again.  
</P>
<P>
	Days after being released from jail on drug charges, the Wu-Tang  
Clan rapper, whose real name is Russell Jones, was arrested and 
accused of driving with a suspended license. 
</P>
<P>
	Detective Joseph Pentangelo said police stopped Jones for  
driving a car without a license plate along Harlem's 125th Street 
about 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	When they checked his driver's license number, police discovered  
the license had been suspended -- for the sixth time -- and that 
Jones was wanted on an outstanding warrant for failing to pay child 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Peter Frankel, said Jones will plead innocent.  
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 30, has a growing rap sheet.  
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday he pleaded innocent in Los Angeles to a charge that  
he violated a new California law banning violent felons from 
wearing body armor. He was convicted of second-degree assault in 
New York in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a day late for that hearing because he was arrested  
Monday in New York on misdemeanor drug charges. In that case, 
police allegedly found a small amount of crack cocaine after a 
traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
	He also faces trial in two other Los Angeles cases -- one for  
allegedly threatening to kill the mother of his 1-year-old child, 
and another for allegedly making death threats to guards at a 
nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has been accused of shoplifting in Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Pirates Catcher To Bat Leadoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- Jason Kendall is on the brink of possible  
major league baseball history, and he didn't even know it. 
</P>
<P>
	Catchers are asked to call pitches, settle down pitchers, direct  
the defense, but one thing they do not do is lead off. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Kendall does.  
</P>
<P>
	Kendall will begin the season as the Pittsburgh Pirates' leadoff  
hitter and, about mid-May, likely will become the first catcher to 
lead off more than 32 times in a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1970, Jeff Newman (32) and Butch Wynegar (31) are the only  
catchers to lead off more than 30 times in a season. Before that, 
catchers led off about as often as they steal bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Oops. Jason Kendall does that, too, setting an NL record for a  
catcher with 26 steals last season 
</P>
<P>
	He also led the majors by being hit by pitches 31 times last  
season. And his .327 average was the highest by any Pirates player 
in a non-strike season since Dave Parker hit .334 in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall wasn't aware until Friday that so few catchers have led  
off. He suggests it is a reflection of the changing times of a 
sport in which catchers long ago shed their images as roly-poly 
heavyweights who love to hit and love to eat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nowadays, you've got to be in shape with all the  
weightlifting, the nutritional supplements, everybody in the game 
is stronger and faster,'' he said Friday. ``It's no different for a 
catcher. They're taking the labels off catchers that were on them 
for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Kendall batted second or third, so moving up to  
first doesn't seem like all that big a deal. He may be called on to 
steal bases more than before, but he already stole much more than 
the average catcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly think he doesn't care where he bats,'' manager Gene  
Lamont said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall's answer: ``I honestly don't. I'm still going to hit the  
same way I did before. If I get a 2-0 or 3-1 fastball, I'm 
swinging. I'm not taking the pitch. I'm not changing my approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Something is working this spring. His on-base percentage is  
nearly .500, far better than the .319 of Tony Womack, the Pirates' 
leadoff hitter last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only time I notice is it is the bottom of the first, and  
I've got to hurry to get my (catcher's) stuff off so I can lead 
off,'' Kendall said. ``I've got to be careful because you've got to 
hurry, but you don't want to rush too much and give an at-bat 
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He certainly hasn't in his first three seasons in the majors,  
batting .300 as a rookie in 1996, .294 in 1997 and .327. He made 
the All-Star game in 1996 and 1998 and, if he played in a bigger 
media market and hit a few more home runs, would be a star on the 
level of a Mike Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall's reaction: He has worked out with Piazza during the  
offseason and has seen how the New York Mets' catcher has 
sacrificed his privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pittsburgh, the fans leave Kendall alone if he is grocery  
shopping or restaurant hopping. He mostly frequents the same 
places, and the management tries to guard his privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to play anywhere else,'' said Kendall, who has  
been offered a $20 million, three-year extension of a contract that 
runs through 2001. ``I don't see me changing organizations. I like 
where I am. Mike Piazza? I feel for him. Tiger Woods? He can't go 
anywhere. In Pittsburgh, I can be myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if he isn't like any other catcher.

<HEADLINE> Langdon Let Game Find Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- He did what the good ones always do  
when things go bad. Trajan Langdon let the game find him. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first two-thirds of Saturday night's semifinal, Duke's  
best player was more a rumor than a fact. He passed up his own 
shots and defended like a devil in blue instead. He crashed the 
boards and chased loose balls into the seats. He threw passes that 
split the seams in the Michigan State zone like a man freed from a 
yearlong diet. 
</P>
<P>
	But in that split-second when the game was there for the taking,  
Langdon never hesitated. He stepped forward and grabbed it by the 
throat. 
</P>
<P>
	With eight minutes left and the Spartans surging to within  
51-48, Langdon caught the ball on the right side behind the 3-point 
arc and let fly a jump shot. It was the same one that he'd taken a 
thousand times on frozen playgrounds in Alaska, except then he was 
still a schoolboy, stuck wearing gloves and a coat. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't matter. The result was the same.  
</P>
<P>
	``That,'' Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said once he had the chance  
to catch his breath, ``was the biggest shot of the game.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles Arrive in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Most kids in the United States can't help grinning  
after getting an autograph and a handshake from a major league 
star. 
</P>
<P>
	Children in Cuba apparently get a kick out of it, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Thirty minutes after arriving in Cuba on Saturday, four  
Baltimore Orioles visited a collection of youths on a sandlot. 
Scott Erickson, Harold Baines, Scott Kamieniecki and Mike Timlin 
mingled with youngsters from the United States who had been playing 
against a team from Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just signing autographs and giving out smiles,'' said  
Erickson, the Orioles starting pitcher in Sunday's historic 
exhibition game against the Cuban national team. 
</P>
<P>
	Timlin, who is scheduled to pitch an inning, clicked away with a  
pocket camera at the sandlot before signing autographs and chatting 
with the kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so excited, I'm basically speechless,'' said Kristin  
Lehner, 17, of Washington, D.C., as she tightly gripped a baseball 
with Timlin's signature. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban boys didn't know the Orioles by name, but that didn't  
stop them from asking for autographs. One kid got his shirt signed 
by the four players; another had all four names scrawled on a small 
square of cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Baines asked one of the Cuban boys for his take on Sunday's  
game. The diplomatic reply, through a translator, was, ``The best 
team will win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Baines quipped back, ``You mean Cuba, right? We know who you  
want to win -- the home team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball game is important primarily because it's the first  
of its kind in 40 years. Although the Orioles have no intention of 
losing, the significance of the contest stretches far beyond the 
final score. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe this is a very important part of the sports and  
cultural exchange between these two countries,'' baseball 
commissioner Bud Selig said at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball is obviously the national pastime in both Cuba and  
United States, and so I think it is most appropriate that baseball 
serve as the linchpin to helping us work on a more constructive 
relationship,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson said he plans to give some of the Cuban players some  
hats and batting gloves. He also hopes to exchange a few words with 
them, although he didn't expect the conversation to get too deep. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not real fluent in Spanish, so I don't know if I can get a  
whole lot across,'' he said, ``but I'll drop a few `Holas!' on a 
few people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A week ago, Erickson wasn't overly enthusiastic about his role  
in the first major league exhibition between teams from Cuba and 
the United States since 1959. But after wading through a crowd of 
curious Cubans at the airport, he finally seemed to realize the 
massive interest that the game has generated. 
</P>
<P>
	``The No. 1 goal is getting ready for the baseball season, but  
the game is becoming a little more important now that we're here. 
It's certainly a little bigger than your average spring training 
start,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not going to be like the seventh game of the World  
Series, but we're not going to go out there and just mess around 
and play baseball. We're going to try to win the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams are at a disadvantage -- the Cubans must swing wooden  
bats instead of aluminum ones and the Orioles must get used to 
Cuban baseballs, which has a softer hide and larger seams. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's OK, I'll get a little sweat and rosin on it and we'll  
see what it can do,'' Timlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibition has attracted media from around the world and has  
created a stir on the streets of Havana, where many locals seem 
confident the home team will win. Regardless, there's always the 
possibility of a rematch next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's play this event tomorrow before looking ahead,'' Selig  
said. ``Hopefully it will be as smooth and good as we think it will 
be. Then we'll worry about the future.''

<HEADLINE> Silver Charm Chases $3M in Dubai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Silver Charm, the 1997  
Kentucky Derby winner, will try for a second straight victory in 
the Dubai World Cup Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the seven horses out to stop the strapping gray horse in  
the $5 million race at Nad al-Sheba Racecourse will be Victory 
Gallop, the 1998 Belmont Stakes winner, and High-Rise, winner of 
last year's English Derby at Epsom Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Silver Charm succeed, it would be without the presence of  
trainer Bob Baffert, who was at Turfway Park in Kentucky Saturday 
to watch Kentucky Derby hopeful Straight Man finish fourth in the 
Gallery Furniture.Com Stakes. Silver Charm and Straight Man are 
owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Eoin Harty, a Baffert assistant, will saddle Silver Charm.  
</P>
<P>
	Joining Silver Charm and Victory Gallop in representing the  
United Stakes is Malek, fourth in this 1 1/4-mile race on the dirt 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	High-Rise is one of four starters owned by the ruling Al Maktoum  
family of Dubai. Almutawakel is owned by Sheik Hamdan al Maktoum. 
High-Rise, Daylami and Central Park are owned by the Godolphin 
Racing stable of Sheik Hamdan and his brothers, Sheiks Mohammed and 
Maktoum al Maktouom. Sheikh Mohammed manages the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the field is British-owned and trained Running Stag,  
whose last four starts were in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Post time is 11:15 a.m. EST. There will be no betting at Nad  
al-Sheba. Wagers will be taken on the race at tracks and off-track 
facilities in Canada and 28 states, but not in New York, where 
betting on racing is prohibited on Palm Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, second to now-retired Awesome Again in the  
Breeders' Cup Classic Nov. 7 at Churchill Downs, opened 1999 with a 
win in the San Pasqual Handicap at Santa Anita. In his last two 
starts, however, he finished third in both the Donn Handicap at 
Gulfstream Park and the Santa Anita Handicap March 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The $3 million winner's share Sunday would make Silver Charm the  
second biggest money earner in thoroughbred racing history with 
$9,803,006. It would move him past Skip Away ($9,616,368) and place 
him behind Cigar ($9,999,815). 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, ridden by Gary Stevens, his regular jockey, will  
start from the No. 3 post. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Bailey will ride Victory Gallop from the No. 4 post. The  
4-year-old colt, trained by Elliott Walden and owned by brothers 
Art, Jack and J.R. Preston, was fourth in the Breeders Cup Classic. 
He opened 1999 by winning an allowance race March 3 at Gulfstream 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Victory Gallop won't try to get past Silver Charm at the  
start,'' Walden said. ``He'll stay behind, and Silver Charm won't 
see us coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malek, ridden by Alex Solis, has raced only twice since his  
fourth place in Dubai last year. He finished second to Silver Charm 
in the San Pasqual, then was second in the San Antonio Handicap 
Feb. 7 at Santa Anita. The 6-year-old Chilean-bred horse, trained 
by Dick Mandella and owned by Francisco Cortes and wife Theresa. 
will start from post No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``Silver Charm is still the horse to beat,'' Mandella said.  
</P>
<P>
	The four Maktoum-owned horses will be making their dirt-racing  
and 1999 debuts. High-Rise last raced when he finished seventh in 
the Prix de L'Arc de Triomph Oct. 4 at Longchamp in France. 
Daylami, who won the Man o'War at Belmont Park Sept. 12, finished 
third in the Champion Stakes in his last start Oct. 17 at Ascot, 
England. Central Park finished fifth in the Prix Niel Sept. 13 at 
Longchamp, and Almutawakel was eighth in the Prix Dollar Oct. 3 at 
Longchamp. 
</P>
<P>
	Running Stag, seventh in the Breeders' Cup Classic, hasn't race  
since finishing second to Silver Charm in the Clark Handicap Nov. 
27 at Churchill Downs.

<HEADLINE> Cheap Steel Imports Hurt Small Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HICKMAN, Ark. (AP) -- Rick Sweetman recalls what happened when  
his employer, Nucor Corp., cut production last year because of 
competition from cheap imported steel. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it wasn't for deer meat, my little girl and I wouldn't have  
eaten,'' Sweetman said. ``I took up hunting and fishing with a real 
zeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sweetman, 37, has worked at the Nucor-Hickman plant since it  
opened for business in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	His seven years on the Nucor production line accustomed him to a  
healthy paycheck, especially for northeastern Arkansas. Annual 
salaries averaged between $50,000 and $55,000 until last summer, 
according to plant manager Dave Chase. 
</P>
<P>
	But production at the plant, which turns out rolls of sheet  
steel, has been cut, largely because of cheap steel imports. 
Imports surged last year in the wake of the Asian economic crisis 
that lowered demand for steel abroad and forced foreign producers 
to turn to U.S. outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first quarter last year was the best production rate  
ever,'' Chase recalled, with Nucor-Hickman producing 540,000 tons. 
By the final three months of 1998, Chase said, production was down 
by two-thirts to only 180,000 tons. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're selling stuff at $230 a ton that we're selling for  
$400 a ton,'' said Dan DiMicco, manager at a sister plant, 
Nucor-Yamato in nearby Armorel. 
</P>
<P>
	This corner of northeastern Arkansas produces more steel than  
all but one other county in the nation, Lake County, home of Gary, 
Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country, steel producers blame at least 10,000  
layoffs and three bankruptcies on imports. 
</P>
<P>
	So was welcome news that the U.S. Commerce Department reported  
this past week that steel imports into the United States during 
February actually dropped below pre-1998 levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall imports were at 2 million metric tons, 15 percent below  
the 1997 monthly average of 2.4 million, preliminary statistics 
released by the Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it also said that two targets of recent U.S. government  
sanctions against ``dumping'' of cheap steal -- Russia and Brazil -- 
posted slight increases in shipments. That could give ammunition to 
Congressional representatives seeking stiffer penalties from the 
Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	While slumping sales and falling production have yet to prompt  
any layoffs at the two Nucor plants in Mississippi County, Ark., 
they have cut the generous production bonuses workers counted on in 
the past. When production was high, an average of two-thirds of 
each worker's pay had been comprised of bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, paychecks are closer to basic pay rates, which range from  
$17,600 a year to $24,000, says Phil Baker, 25, who, like Sweetman, 
works on the steel production line. Baker says his income dropped 
$12,000 from roughly $80,000 he had made in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker says his four children quickly found out that times were  
lean. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was, `Daddy, can we have this?' -- `No, we can't afford  
it,''' he recalled in a recent interview along with Sweetman and 
three other Nucor workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen a movie in a year,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The five said they knew of no one who had to give up a house.  
``But a lot of new vehicles went back,'' said Chad Utermark, 30, a 
supervisor at Nucor. 
</P>
<P>
	While Nucor officials say the lean times will continue until the  
government eliminates import dumping, they also express confidence 
Charlotte, N.C.-based company will survive, mainly because Nucor's 
plants are heavily automated and labor efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	However, for the towns affected, the import crisis goes beyond  
just the steel plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies that supply products and services to the Nucor plants  
in Mississippi County have been hard hit by job cuts. The county's 
unemployment rate in December was nearly 13 percent, up from almost 
10 percent last April. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ripple effect for us is just unbelievable,'' said Harold  
Wright, a local chamber of commerce chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to diversify, the chamber is now looking to attract  
plastics factories

	U.S. To Document Serb Atrocities  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today Serb troops  
continue to attack ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo even as 
NATO's bombs systematically target the forces of Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic. Clinton reaffirmed his determination to 
``defuse a powder keg at the heart of Europe. Our military 
operation has been under way for several nights now. In this time, 
Serb troops have continued attacks on unarmed men, women and 
children,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio address. ``This is all 
the more reason for us to stay the course.'' Clinton said he was 
``deeply impressed by the solidarity'' of the 19 NATO countries and 
thanked U.S. military personnel for ``risking their lives to 
protect peace in the Balkans.''

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- More reports of heavy fighting and  
Serb atrocities in Kosovo emerged today after NATO carried its 
offensive in Yugoslavia closer to Belgrade in the heaviest of three 
nights of attacks. State-run media showed pictures of explosions 
and fires in Belgrade suburbs caused by ``NATO criminals'' and 
claimed civilians were killed and injured. British Defense 
Secretary George Robertson told a daily news briefing today that 
atrocities by Milosevic's forces in Kosovo continued. ``The Serbs 
are bombarding villages to the point of obliteration,'' Robertson 
said.

in a London hospital at age 53. Myanmar's military government had 
denied Aris, who was ill with prostate cancer, a visa to enter 
Myanmar and see his wife one last time before he died. Western 
governments had urged the Myanmar government to grant Aris a visa 
on humanitarian grounds, but the military government refused and 
instead urged Suu Kyi to visit her husband in Britain.

ban on same-sex ceremonies. The suspension begins July 5 and 
continues until the Rev. Gregory Dell signs a statement saying he

<HEADLINE> NCAA Tourney Picks Were Just Right </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Let's hear it for the NCAA  
tournament selection committee. They had the field of 64 scoped 
just right. 
</P>
<P>
	For evidence of that, just look at the survivors who arrived in  
Florida for the Final Four. There were three No. 1 seeds -- Duke, 
Connecticut and Michigan State -- and a No. 4 -- Ohio State. And the 
Buckeyes beat the tournament's other No. 1, Auburn, en route to the 
Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	So after two weekends worth of slam dunks and 3-point shots, the  
field got to just about where the committee thought it would when 
it picked over all those peanuts and pretzels on Selection Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's twice in the past three years that three top seeds have  
survived the early rounds, a track record that should quiet 
complaints about how the committee does its work. There are always 
rumbles that some team should have been a 3 instead of a 6, or a 4 
instead of a 9. It's a lot of blather. Take the spot assigned and 
play the games. Win six and you are the national champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The whole idea of seeding is to benefit regular-season and  
conference-tournament achievement. Win games against better 
opponents and the committee notices. Win games on the road and the 
committee notices. Beat a bunch of powderpuffs at home to inflate a 
won-lost record and it notices that, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee is locked into conference champions because NCAA  
democracy, sometimes difficult to locate on other issues, dictates 
that the little guys get their chance, too, even if all they seem 
to be is first-round fodder for the powerhouses. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's good because every so often, a Detroit will beat a  
UCLA or a Miami of Ohio will beat a Utah. Nothing against the 
heavyweights, just a neat reminder that other guys can play this 
game, too. 
</P>
<P>
	And sometimes one of those other guys, such as a Southwest  
Missouri State or a Gonzaga, will make it to the late rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line is that 63 of the teams in this tournament lose  
their final game of the season. That does not make them losers, 
though. There were some substantial winners. 
</P>
<P>
	For starters, try coach Mike Jarvis of St. John's. He had the  
Red Storm a turnover away from the Final Four when freshman point 
guard Erick Barkley bounced a dribble off his leg against Ohio 
State, ending a dream season. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley was distraught. All season he had been the engine for  
Jarvis' team. Now he was in the locker room, tears in his eyes 
because of that last, critical turnover, the only one he made in 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarvis refused to accept that. He talked Barkley through the  
crisis, explaining that without the freshman, St. John's never 
would have been at that juncture. It was a classic coaching moment, 
a lesson in character-building. Once upon a time, that was what 
coaching was supposed to be about. 
</P>
<P>
	John Chaney of Temple would know all about that. He was not  
coaching when Dr. Naismith hung the peach baskets, it just seems 
that way. He went over 600 wins this season, but his most 
significant victory was 6-foot-4 Rasheed Brokenborough. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years after being admitted to Temple as a Proposition 16  
player, forced to sit out his first year because of academic 
issues, Brokenborough is a graduating senior. Now, he is thinking 
about sticking around for his Masters, perhaps petitioning to get 
that year of eligibility back since the courts have ruled against 
the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems fair. If redshirts are routinely allowed, permitting  
four years of eligibility over five years, why not extend them to 
academics? Why not reward a player like Brokenborough for his 
accomplishment by giving him that year back? 
</P>
<P>
	As Brokenborough left the court after Temple lost to Duke,  
Chaney hugged the young man. It was a sincere expression of 
affection by an old coach for a young player whose personal 
accomplishment turned that last loss into a much more important 
victory.

<HEADLINE> UConn's Moore Puts Clamps on Penn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The man known as The Stopper did it  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut guard Ricky Moore, a converted scorer and son of a  
PGA Tour caddy, is one of the few players in college basketball 
capable of transforming a game with his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to suffocating a team's big scorer and changing  
the flow and tempo of a game, Moore caddies to no one. 
</P>
<P>
	He altered the biggest game in Connecticut history -- one so big  
that virtually the whole state shut down to watch it Saturday -- by 
leaving Ohio State guard Scoonie Penn so off his game that he even 
forgot his own number. 
</P>
<P>
	It's No. 12, by the way, Scoonie, not the No. 35 you brought  
with you to Tropicana Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, called by Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun the best  
defensive player he has coached in 27 years in Division I 
basketball, did what he did best in the NCAA semifinals by limiting 
Penn to 11 points on 3-of-13 shooting in the Huskies' 64-58 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore also scored six points and, despite being just 6-foot-2,  
led the Huskies with eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	How good was Moore's defense? Penn was averaging 17.5 points in  
the NCAA tournament and, with teammate Michael Redd, was hailed as 
the best backcourt in the nation. Not now. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (33-2), a team vaunted for its NCAA tournament  
failures, now advances to the first championship game in school 
history against the winner of the Duke-Michigan State game. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a monumental accomplishment for a school that until this  
season had been known for its monumental collapses in March, never 
reaching the Final Four in 20 prior tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	But then Connecticut has never has had a defender before like  
Moore, who has played a pivotal defensive role throughout the run 
to the NCAA championship game. The game before, he limited Gonzaga 
star Matt Santangelo to 1-of-9 shooting and two points in 29 
minutes, the decisive factor in a 67-62 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	It's nothing new. He held Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves to six  
points on Dec. 5 and Johnny Hemsley of Miami to no second half 
points on Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no `D' in Moore's name, only in his game.

<HEADLINE> Prison Terms Change Crime Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- They were high public officials, tough on  
crime, but they say they discovered the humanity of the prison 
population -- and the error of their crime-fighting ways -- when they 
became prisoners themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we could get every public official in prison for a few  
months, the policy would change greatly,'' said Webster Hubbell, 
once associate attorney general in the Justice Department, now an 
ex-con from the Whitewater affair facing still more legal jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Pennsylvania Attorney General Ernie Preate Jr. and former  
California Republican leader Pat Nolan joined Hubbell at a meeting 
Saturday of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, representing 
family members serving long prison terms set during a wave of 
legislative efforts to crack down on crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Preate, once a hard-nosed advocate of mandatory sentences, spent  
a year in federal prison for mail fraud and emerged in 1996 with 
the belief that not only was his crime wrong, but so had been his 
treatment of criminals. ``I was the quintessential prosecutor,'' he 
said. ``My specialty was death penalty work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he said, ``we're on a collision course with social  
catastrophe'' unless more is done to rehabilitate criminals and 
find alternatives to prison for the 65 percent of inmates locked up 
for nonviolent crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Nolan saw his career in the California assembly turn to dust  
when he was convicted of racketeering and sent to federal prison 
for 29 months and a halfway house for four. 
</P>
<P>
	He recalled his cold response as a lawmaker when he was asked to  
support workers' compensation coverage for prisoners and how his 
attitude changed after he landed in a cell with a young drug 
criminal, a writer of bogus checks, a leader of the Los Angeles 
riots and a member of the Hell's Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were my brothers,'' he said. ``For the first time I saw  
them as human beings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell, a former law partner of Hillary Rodham Clinton, spent  
21 months in federal custody, some of it in a halfway house, for 
tax evasion and mail fraud. Still subject to more charges arising 
from independent counsel Kenneth Starr's Whitewater investigation, 
he was circumspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``Using the criminal process for political purposes is wrong,''  
he said, explaining he was not talking about his case specifically. 
Asked by one of the many sympathetic members of the audience 
whether Starr should be criminally investigated, he said pointedly: 
``I don't want any more investigations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court reinstated a tax evasion case against  
Hubbell in January, stemming from hundreds of thousands of dollars 
paid to him by friends of the Clintons in 1994 after he left the 
Justice Department. Starr theorized the payments were meant to keep 
Hubbell quiet during the Whitewater probe. 
</P>
<P>
	The three fallen public figures at the conference were not  
subjected to mandatory sentences, a device used more for drug and 
gun offenses than white-collar crime, and their incarceration was 
more comfortable than that experienced by people doing hard time. 
</P>
<P>
	He faulted himself for not doing enough while in the Justice  
Department to stand against the tide moving in favor of tougher 
sentences and an expanded list of federal crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress and many states have enacted laws requiring minimum  
sentences since mandatory terms began coming into favor in the 
1970s, but legal experts say a move to revert is growing. Michigan 
last year relaxed a law that mandated life in prison, with no 
parole, for anyone delivering, or intending to deliver, 650 grams, 
about 1.4 pounds, of cocaine or heroin.

<HEADLINE> Guard Play Carries UConn Into Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Ricky Moore never met a player he  
couldn't shut down. Khalid El-Amin never met a player who could 
shut him up. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Richard Hamilton, the third wheel of a three-guard  
offense that never stops scoring, they have transformed Connecticut 
from a team that knew only failure in college basketball's final 
month into one of the sport's Final Two. 
</P>
<P>
	Take a bow, Mr. El-Amin ... whoops, you already were.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've said it before and I'll say it again, all this team was  
missing was a player of my stature and leadership,'' El-Amin said 
after scoring 18 points in Connecticut's 64-58 victory Saturday 
over Ohio State in the NCAA semifinals. ``I think I've done a good 
job. I think I've been a leader.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Good enough that he has led a team that had never previously  
reached even the Final Four in 20 previous NCAA appearances -- the 
worst track record of any Division I school -- to Monday's 
championship game against Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	``That sounds awfully good,'' Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun  
said. ``Can you say it again please?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (37-1) and UConn (33-2) are the only two schools to be  
ranked No. 1 this season. The Huskies ceded the top ranking at 
midseason only by losing to Syracuse amid a succession of injuries, 
a fact that seems to be lost on those who have already awarded the 
national title to Duke, which beat Michigan State 68-62 in the 
other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's a little bit unfair,'' El-Amin said. ``I don't  
know if it helps us, but I think we'll be inspired by that a little 
bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A sophomore guard who began running the Huskies' offense from  
the first time he scrimmaged with them as a high school senior -- 
and began running his mouth about the same time -- was nearly left 
speechless after going 0-for-12 in Connecticut's 67-62 victory over 
Gonzaga in the West Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	It took him only three possessions to get back on his game  
Saturday, hitting a baseline jumper that made it 5-2 and set the 
tone for an 8-of-15, six-assist day. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton led the Huskies with 24 points and joined Chris Smith  
as the only 2,000-point scorers in school history. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other end of the court, Moore was disrupting and  
distracting Ohio State's Scoonie Penn, who was averaging 17.5 
points in the NCAA tournament but was limited to 11 points on 
3-of-13 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn was so off his game that he even forgot his own number. He  
couldn't find his No. 12, so was forced to wear a generic No. 35 
with no name on the back. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a suggestion: Maybe Moore, who calls himself the best  
defensive player in America, stole his number. He certainly stole 
his game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I think I did that, but I certainly had a lot of help,''  
said Moore, whose scoring average has dropped from 12 points per 
game two years ago to six points since he began concentrating on 
defense. ``I stayed aggressive on defense. I made him work for 
everything. That's my game, to wreak havoc.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said he wasn't bragging about being the premier  
scorer-stopper in the country. These numbers don't lie: He held 
Gonzaga's Matt Santangelo to 1-of-9 shooting and two points, 
Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves to six points. Johnny Hemsley of 
Miami to no second-half points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I work hard. Just look at the stats,'' Moore said.  
</P>
<P>
	Or look at his shoes. He wore a new pair of gold shoes --  
``They're 14 karat,'' he said smiling -- but ruptured the sole on 
his right shoe while chasing around Penn in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	``I blew 'em out,'' he said. ``They came apart, I was guarding  
him so hard. ... But I'll get them fixed before Monday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing needs fixing with Connecticut's game, not now, not with  
the biggest game in history of the school -- and a basketball-crazed 
state -- coming up Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We seized the moment,'' Calhoun said. ``Now we've got to do it  
again.''

<HEADLINE> Cuba Preparing for Orioles Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Toting trumpets, drums and plastic bottles filled  
with cheap rum, tens of thousands of baseball-crazy Cubans will 
celebrate the return of major league baseball to the communist 
island after 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell the Orioles to bring their earplugs!'' Jorge Leis  
screamed, shaking a gourd rattle amid the musical clamor of a 
playoff game at Latinoamericano stadium last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``And tell them to get ready to lose!''  
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's exhibition game at Latinoamericano has been the hottest  
topic of discussion of Havana street corners, in bars, workplaces 
and schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's thousands of self-appointed baseball experts disagree on  
who will win, who are the best players, the virtues of wooden bats 
versus aluminum ones. 
</P>
<P>
	But after four decades, what they really want to know is how  
their beloved ``peloteros'' -- ballplayers -- measure up to the big 
leaguers from the north. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is going to be a great show between the two  
countries, both of whom have great teams,'' Evel Bastida, third 
baseman for Havana's Industriales, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a good test to see ... if the American big leaguers  
really are the best in the world,'' said Industriales teammate and 
infielder Lazaro Vargas, considered one of Cuba's best players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban team was practicing in private at a field outside  
Havana and sports authorities denied media access to the players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans' roster included third baseman Omar Linares,  
considered one of the country's top players, catcher Juan Manrique 
and pitchers Jose Ariel Contreres, Pedro Luis Lazo and Jose Ibar. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the middle of the month, Cuban players have traded in  
their traditional aluminum bats for the wooden ones used by players 
in the United States and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The switch to wooden bats was a condition made by the Americans.  
They also insisted on the installation of padding along the walls 
of the playing field. 
</P>
<P>
	While the players have remained low key, baseball fans have not.  
</P>
<P>
	Grumbling began late in the week as word leaked out that  
entrance to Sunday's game at the 50,000-seat stadium would be by 
invitation only. Among those expected to be invited are members of 
the communist government's sports organizations and schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the only way,'' said a sports official, who spoke on  
condition of anonymity. ``If not, we will have a million people 
trying to get into the stadium -- pure chaos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those with an assured seat include Donatila Lopez, a grandmother  
of seven who receives a small government stipend to ensure order in 
the stands near home plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This stadium is part of my family,'' said Lopez, who raised  
her children in the shadow of the Latinoamericano. ``And now it, 
and we, will see history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Fidel Castro, a former baseball player with a  
legendary love of the sport known here simply as ``pelota'' -- ball 
-- also is expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball teams used to visit Cuba regularly, but  
the last time was in March 1959 -- about 2 1/2 months after Castro's 
revolution ousted dictator Fulgencio Batista on New Year's Day -- 
when the Cincinnati Reds and Los Angeles Dodgers played exhibition 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	A newspaper story at the time told of how the ``sizzling  
Dodgers'' defeated the Reds 4-3 before 3,400 ``highly vocal 
rooters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tradition of vocal rooting was in full display during last  
week's playoffs. A huge cheer went up through neighborhoods across 
Havana Wednesday night when the Industriales beat the team from the 
Isla of Juventud. 
</P>
<P>
	Enormous roars swept across the stadium as an elderly man in  
horn-rimmed glasses known simply as Armandito led thousands of 
Industriales fans in The Wave. 
</P>
<P>
	On a nearby platform, five teen-age cheerleaders in red halter  
tops and short white skirts gyrated hips to the toot-toot-toot of a 
huge steel horn powered by a diesel engine. 
</P>
<P>
	Housewives in curlers, elderly laborers smoking enormous cigars,  
little boys clutching baseballs all screamed passionately. 
</P>
<P>
	Orchestra players with trombones, trumpets and the large metal  
bell known here as a ``cecerro'' blared and clanged their approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cuba will win on Sunday, of course,'' said Industriales fan  
Leis, shaking the gourd called a ``chekere,'' which like the steel 
bell is an important instrument in Cuban music. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Orioles are good, but so are we. And if not, we win for  
enthusiasm.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Awarded $1.78M in Patent Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) -- A federal jury has awarded a Bigfork,  
Mont., woman $1.78 million, finding that Deckers Outdoors Corp. 
infringed on the patent for her Yeti cold-weather boots. 
</P>
<P>
	Molly Strong and her company, Yeti by Molly Ltd., won their  
lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Missoula, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	Deckers, the maker Teva, Ugg and Simple brand footwear, plans to  
appeal the decision, which was handed down last week after a 10-day 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Strong, who is unemployed and lives in a tepee in Bigfork,  
modeled the Yeti after a dog's paw. The soles are large, soft and 
flat, made of fleece and felt to grip on ice and snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this decade, she generated some publicity for the boots  
by using them to walk from Denver to Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Strong, 55, contended in her lawsuit that Deckers showed an  
interest in the boot, but worked with her only long enough to copy 
her design as a Teva sandal boot, hiring a former Yeti employee as 
director of product development. 
</P>
<P>
	Deckers, based in Goleta, Calif., claimed that it began making  
the sandal boot in 1992, before the company had met Molly Strong. 
The company quit making the Teva product in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Deckers posted a net loss of $2.9 million on sales of  
$102 million.

<HEADLINE> Text of Clinton Radio Address / Presidential Speech  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The text of Saturday's radio address President Clinton:  
</P>
<P>
	``Good morning. Three days ago I decided the United States  
should join our NATO allies in military air strikes to bring peace 
to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my address to the nation last Wednesday, I explained why we  
have taken this step -- to save the lives of innocent civilians in 
Kosovo from a brutal military offensive; to defuse a powder keg at 
the heart of Europe that has exploded twice before in this century, 
with catastrophic results; to prevent a wider war we would have to 
confront later, only at far greater risk and cost; to stand with 
our NATO allies for peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our military operation has been under way for several nights  
now. In this time, Serb troops have continued attacks on unarmed 
men, women and children. That is all the more reason for us to stay 
the course. We must, and we will, continue until Serbia's leader, 
Slobodan Milosevic, accepts peace or we have seriously damaged his 
capacity to make war. 
</P>
<P>
	``As always, America's military men and women are performing  
with courage and skill. Their strength comes from rigorous 
training, state-of-the-art weaponry and hard-won experience in this 
part of the world. This is the same brave and tested force that 
brought stability to Bosnia after four years of vicious war. I am 
confident they will once again rise to the task. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them are fighter pilots, some are bombers, some are  
mechanics, technicians, air traffic controllers and base personnel. 
Every time I visit our troops around the world I am struck by their 
professionalism, their quiet, unassuming determination. They always 
say, ``This is the job I was trained to do. They don't see 
themselves as heroes, but we surely do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've also been deeply impressed by the solidarity of NATO's  
purpose. All 19 NATO nations are providing support, from Norway to 
Turkey, from England to Italy, from Germany and France to our 
neighbors in Canada, including our three allies from Central 
Europe, the new NATO members: Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``And we should remember the courage of the Kosovar people  
today, still exposed to violence and brutality. Many Americans, 
now, have heard the story of a young Kosovar girl trying to stay in 
touch with a friend in America by e-mail, as a Serb attack began in 
her own village. Just a few days ago she wrote, ``at the moment, 
just from my balcony, I can see people running with suitcases, and 
I can hear some gunshots. A village just a few hundred meters from 
my house is all surrounded. As long as I have electricity, I will 
continue writing to you. I'm trying to keep myself as calm as 
possible. My younger brother, who is 9, is sleeping now. I wish I 
will not have to stop his dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We asked these people of Kosovo to accept peace, and they did.  
We promised them we would stick by them if they did the right 
thing, and they did. We cannot let them down now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans have learned the hard way that our home is not that  
far from Europe. Through two World Wars and a long Cold War, we saw 
that it was a short step from a small brush fire to an inferno, 
especially in the tinderbox of the Balkans. The time to put out a 
fire is before it spreads and burns down the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``By acting now, we're taking a strong step toward a goal that  
has always been in our national interest -- a peaceful, united, 
democratic Europe. For America there is no greater calling than 
being a peacemaker. But sometimes you have to fight in order to end 
the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me end now by repeating how proud all Americans are of the  
men and women in uniform risking their lives to protect peace in 
the Balkans. Our prayers are with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``And our prayers are with all the people of the Balkans  
searching for the strength to put centuries of divisions to rest, 
and to join Europe and North America in building a better future 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thanks for listening.''

<HEADLINE>  Williams Sisters Face Off in Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. (AP) -- The first serve of the match came to  
Serena Williams, and she met it with a full swing, rifling a 
forehand crosscourt into the corner for a winner. Opponent Amanda 
Coetzer never moved. 
</P>
<P>
	Venus Williams lunged to her right for an off-balance volley,  
barely reaching the ball to lift a delicate shot that landed softly 
just beyond the net for a winner. Opponent Jana Novotna, frozen 
behind the baseline, could only shake her head. 
</P>
<P>
	With a remarkable combination of finesse and force, the Williams  
sisters have made their way to an all-in-the-family final Sunday at 
the Lipton Championships. Impressed opponents admit the matchup is 
no fluke, but rather a sign of the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their athleticism is incredible,'' said Steffi Graf,  
eliminated by Venus in the semifinals. ``They move extremely well. 
They're taking risks. They go for their shots. They don't have a 
certain weakness. They're very tall and big. That's definitely a 
plus. 
</P>
<P>
	``All those things are definitely working for them.''  
</P>
<P>
	The sisters aren't quite ready to be crowned queens of the WTA  
Tour. Even if Venus wins Sunday, she'll remain ranked No. 6. A 
victory by Serena would boost her to a career-best No. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	They're not necessarily even the best players in their age  
division. Martina Hingis, 18, has five Grand Slam titles to none 
for the Williams sisters. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the final between Venus, 18, and Serena, 17,  
supports the long-held hunch that they might be destined for 
greatness. 
</P>
<P>
	Serena, who beat Hingis, Coetzer and Monica Seles en route to  
the final, has won 16 consecutive matches and is on the threshold 
of her third tournament title in a row. No longer is she 
overshadowed by Venus, who is 15 months older. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been in the background,'' Serena said. ``It's time  
for me to move forward now. I'm playing the best tennis I have in 
my young career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Venus has compiled an impressive winning streak, too -- 11  
matches in a row at Lipton, including last year's final and 
victories this week over Graf and Novotna. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like putting my name and losing in the same  
sentence,'' Venus said. ``Winning and Venus sounds great. Serena 
doesn't like to lose either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last all-sibling final in professional tennis was in 1991,  
when John McEnroe beat his brother Patrick at Chicago. Williams vs. 
Williams will be the first all-sister women's final since the Open 
era began in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters don't seem as impressed by the achievement as the  
international media. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporter: ``Would you say a new era has arrived in women's  
tennis as of this week?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Venus: ``I guess so. It could be said.''  
</P>
<P>
	Reporter: ``Would you say it?''  
</P>
<P>
	Venus: ``I could say it, yes: A new era has arrived this week in  
women's tennis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scale of the occasion is such that their father, Richard,  
held a news conference Saturday. Prone to hyperbole, he bragged 
about various family medical and law degrees, Venus' fluency in 
four languages and his role in a group that may buy Rockefeller 
Center for $3.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no exaggeration in the pride he expressed for  
Sunday's finalists. 
</P>
<P>
	``My only hope in watching my babies is that I don't cry,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters practiced together Saturday, joking about mishit  
overheads and still laughing when they left the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're saying, `I'm going to hit the ball sister -- you'd  
better be ready,' '' their dad said. 
</P>
<P>
	Venus is 2-0 against Serena, with both matches last year. They  
played each other for the first time at the Australian Open in 
January, then at the Italian Open in May. 
</P>
<P>
	When they played each other as children, Venus usually won.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah,'' she said. ``But that's in the past.''  
</P>
<P>
	The future arrives Sunday.

certain weakness. They're very tall and big. That's definitely a 
plus. 
</P>
<P>
	``All those things are definitely working for them.''  
</P>
<P>
	The sisters aren't quite ready to be crowned queens of the WTA  
Tour. Even if Venus wins Sunday, she'll remain ranked No. 6. A 
victory by Serena would boost her to a career-best No. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	They're not necessarily even the best players in their age  
division. Martina Hingis, 18, has five Grand Slam titles to none 
for the Williams sisters. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the final between Venus, 18, and Serena, 17,  
supports the long-held hunch that they might be destined for 
greatness. 
</P>
<P>
	Serena, who beat Hingis, Coetzer and Monica Seles en route to  
the final, has won 16 consecutive matches and is on the threshold 
of her third tournament title in a row. No longer is she 
overshadowed by Venus, who is 15 months older. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been in the background,'' Serena said. ``It's time  
for me to move forward now. I'm playing the best tennis I have in 
my young career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Venus has compiled an impressive winning streak, too -- 11  
matches in a row at Lipton, including last year's final and 
victories this week over Graf and Novotna. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like putting my name and losing in the same  
sentence,'' Venus said. ``Winning and Venus sounds great. Serena 
doesn't like to lose either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last all-sibling final in professional tennis was in 1991,  
when John McEnroe beat his brother Patrick at Chicago. Williams vs. 
Williams will be the first all-sister women's final since the Open 
era began in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters don't seem as impressed by the achievement as the  
international media. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporter: ``Would you say a new era has arrived in women's  
tennis as of this week?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Venus: ``I guess so. It could be said.''  
</P>
<P>
	Reporter: ``Would you say it?''  
</P>
<P>
	Venus: ``I could say it, yes: A new era has arrived this week in  
women's tennis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scale of the occasion is such that their father, Richard,  
held a news conference Saturday. Prone to hyperbole, he bragged 
about various family medical and law degrees, Venus' fluency in 
four languages and his role in a group that may buy Rockefeller 
Center for $3.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no exaggeration in the pride he expressed for  
Sunday's finalists. 
</P>
<P>
	``My only hope in watching my babies is that I don't cry,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters practiced together Saturday, joking about mishit  
overheads and still laughing when they left the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're saying, `I'm going to hit the ball sister -- you'd  
better be ready,' '' their dad said. 
</P>
<P>
	Venus is 2-0 against Serena, with both matches last year. They  
played each other for the first time at the Australian Open in 
January, then at the Italian Open in May. 
</P>
<P>
	When they played each other as children, Venus usually won.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah,'' she said. ``But that's in the past.''  
</P>
<P>
	The future arrives Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Guilty of Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian made a video of himself  
killing a man and dared prosecutors to charge him. Then he ordered 
jurors to convict him if they looked at him and saw a murderer. 
</P>
<P>
	They did.  
</P>
<P>
	Now after participating in what he says are more than 130  
suicides over nine years, the 70-year-old crusader for assisted 
suicide and euthanasia faces the possibility of spending the rest 
of his life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury convicted Kevorkian of second-degree murder Friday in  
the Sept. 17 death of 52-year-old Thomas Youk, who suffered from 
Lou Gehrig's disease, rejecting Kevorkian's argument that ``there 
are certain acts that by sheer common sense are not crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor David Gorcyca said state guidelines call for a  
minimum of 10 to 25 years. Kevorkian's defense attorney said he 
would ask for no prison time. Kevorkian was also convicted of 
delivery of a controlled substance, which has a maximum penalty of 
seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian escaped a first-degree murder conviction, which would  
have sent him to prison for life without possibility of parole. He 
told The Oakland Press of Pontiac that the verdict wasn't rational. 
</P>
<P>
	``Manslaughter, I could understand how they would arrive at  
that. But murder? This? They must have been an astonishingly cruel 
jury,'' he said. ``I got what I wanted -- a conviction. Why? That 
proves how corrupt the society is, and how malevolent are those who 
run it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the retired pathologist's first murder trial. In four  
previous felony trials on assisted suicide charges, his defense 
relied on evidence of the pain and suffering by people who died 
with his help. The earlier trials resulted in three acquittals and 
one mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, that defense wasn't allowed.  
</P>
<P>
	And this time, prosecutors had the tape that Kevorkian gave to  
CBS's ``60 Minutes'' of himself injecting Youk with a fatal dose of 
drugs. In past cases, Kevorkian has said his clients used his 
homemade devices to control the carbon monoxide or intravenous 
chemicals that killed them. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian baited the prosecutors on ``60 minutes.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to force them to act,'' he said. ``They must charge  
me. Because if they do not, that means they don't think it was a 
crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No, they didn't, said prosecutor John Skrzynski. ``If Jack  
Kevorkian had not videotaped this, no one would have ever known it 
happened,'' he said after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Kevorkian has even begged and sometimes taunted me into  
prosecuting him,'' Gorcyca said. ``Today a jury of his peers 
granted him his ultimate wish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To convict on second-degree murder, the jury only had to agree  
Kevorkian either intended to kill or do great bodily harm, or 
created a high risk of death or great bodily harm. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, who served as his own attorney during the swift  
trial, showed no reaction as the verdicts were read after 12 hours 
of jury deliberations. He remained free on bond after agreeing to 
do nothing unlawful. 
</P>
<P>
	``No assisted suicide. No injection. No anything,'' Judge  
Jessica Cooper told him. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing is scheduled for April 14.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney David Gorosh said he would pursue an appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Kevorkian is certainly no murderer,'' said Gorosh, who  
resumed his role Friday morning after Kevorkian withdrew as his own 
attorney. ``We believe it's certainly unjust to equate an act of 
compassion to an act of murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian won the right to represent himself despite the  
misgivings of the judge, who asked him: ``Do you understand you 
could spend the rest of your life in prison?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much of it left,'' he responded.  
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian sometimes stumbled in his efforts to serve as his own  
lawyer. He called no witnesses after the judge refused to let him 
call Youk's widow and brother, who supported Kevorkian, to the 
stand. Prosecutors had argued that their testimony was irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments, Skrzynski likened Kevorkian to ``a medical  
hitman in the night'' and asked jurors not to let him make a 
political statement with Youk's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian told jurors that he acted out of compassion, and that  
he was merely doing his duty as a physician to relieve Youk's 
suffering. He compared himself to civil rights pioneers Rosa Parks 
and Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certain acts that by sheer common sense are not  
crimes,'' he told jurors. ``Just look at me. ... Honestly now, do 
you see a criminal? Do you see a murderer? ... If you do, then you 
must convict. 
</P>
<P>
	``And then, take the harsh judgment of history, and the harsher  
judgment of your children and grandchildren if they ever come to 
need that precious choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian's only prior conviction was in November, on  
misdemeanor charges related to a scuffle with police outside a 
hospital where he and an associate were dropping off a body.

<HEADLINE> Suit Filed in `Angel of Death' Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A respiratory therapist who confessed to  
killing dozens of hospital patients but then recanted has been sued 
by the family of a man who died while the therapist was on duty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Superior Court lawsuit against Efren Saldivar was filed  
Friday by the estate and heirs of John N. Schwartz, an elderly man 
who died at the Glendale Adventist Medical Center hospital on May 
31, 1993. It claims wrongful death and negligent infliction of 
emotional distress upon the family. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also names the hospital. It is the first suit filed in  
the so-called ``Angel of Death'' case, which has not resulted in 
any charges against Salvidar. He has, however, been fired from the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Saldivar confessed to killing patients between  
1989 and 1997 who looked ``like they were ready to die'' by 
suffocating them or giving them lethal injections. 
</P>
<P>
	He later recanted.  
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that Mr. Schwartz was a victim of Efren Saldivar,''  
the family's lawyer, Christopher Nicoll said. ``There were many 
suspicious circumstances surrounding his death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saldivar, 29, was on duty when 91-year-old man died ``and there  
were apparently no other persons present at the time of Mr. 
Schwartz's untimely death,'' the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of general and punitive damages being sought wasn't  
specified. The whereabouts of Saldivar were not known. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no comment from the hospital, which hadn't seen the  
lawsuit, spokeswoman Alicia Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glendale police Sgt. Rick Young said detectives are still  
investigating the case.

<HEADLINE> Woman's Shot Worth $2 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- All the practice paid off for  
19-year-old Alicia Brown, who hit a 3-point shot worth $2 million 
in the Gillette Challenge at the Final Four Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who was coached by Hall of Famer Rick Barry, connected  
between games of the semifinal doubleheader, winning $1 million for 
herself and another $1 million donated to the Susan G. Komen Breast 
Cancer Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used a different routine Rick suggested yesterday,'' Brown  
said. ``I used to dribble before shooting, but he had me bend my 
legs and shoot it without dribbling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who was informed Friday that she would be taking the  
shot, played three years as a point guard at Corona High School in 
Corona, Calif. Her mother, Cheryl James, won the sweepstakes and 
transferred the attempt to her daughter because of Brown's high 
school experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Half of the money is going to my mom because it was her  
entry,'' Brown added. ``She's the only one keeping me sane right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown also said she would likely buy a new truck with her  
winnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The shot was taken at Hoop City, an NCAA promotion being held at  
the Tampa Convention Center in conjunction with the Final Four.

<HEADLINE> Warnings of Computer Virus Issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A new computer virus can allow documents to be  
e-mailed to other people without warning, a potential security 
breach that should worry businesses and governments, an expert at 
Carnegie Mellon University said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Melissa macro'' or W97M--Melissa virus spreads via infected  
e-mail and attacks computers loaded with Microsoft's widely used 
Word 97 or Word 2000 programs, according to CERT -- or Computer 
Emergency Response Team -- Carnegie Mellon's Department of 
Defense-funded computer security team. 
</P>
<P>
	CERT first heard of the virus Friday afternoon and its members  
worked through the night to analyze the virus and develop a fix, 
CERT manager Katherine Fithen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting so many reports from across the world, that we  
know this is going to be a huge problem come Monday,'' Fithen said. 
</P>
<P>
	She noted that since CERT was founded 10 years ago, this is only  
the second time it has considered a virus important enough to 
warrant a public announcement. The first, in 1994, warned of a 
virus that allowed computer burglars to collect passwords. 
</P>
<P>
	CERT has not determined where the Melissa virus originated.  
</P>
<P>
	Fithen said she is not allowed to say whether any governmental  
agency has suffered a security breach as the result of Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Adam Sohn said company programmers worked  
with CERT and manufacturers of anti-virus programs to develop an 
antidote. 
</P>
<P>
	If a computer user opens an infected Word-format document, the  
virus propagates itself by reading the user's e-mail address book 
and sending an infected message to the first 50 entries, CERT said. 
</P>
<P>
	The message can include the contents of any Word document that  
is open on the computer, Fithen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the virus reproduces and sends so much unwanted e-mail  
that the volume can overload some mail servers, the computers that 
distribute e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it apparently causes no direct damage to a computer's  
memory or programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Infected documents are sent as attachments to e-mails most  
frequently bearing a header: ``Subject: Important Message From'' 
the name of person whose computer relayed the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of the message says ``Here is that document you asked  
for ... don't show it to anyone else ;-).'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	EDITOR'S NOTE: CERT information about the Melissa virus is  
available on the Web at 
http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-99-04-Melissa-Macro-Virus.html. 
Microsoft has a patch available at

<HEADLINE> Penn Bans Alcohol at Campus Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The University of Pennsylvania has banned  
alcohol at undergraduate campus parties after a partygoer died at a 
fraternity house. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban, expected to last at least until a student-faculty task  
force at the Ivy League school takes up the issue in about six 
weeks, applies to registered campus parties, typically those hosted 
by fraternities and attended by nonmembers. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban follows the death last weekend of alumnus Michael Tobin,  
26, of Pittsford, N.Y. He was found dead outside the Phi Gamma 
Delta fraternity house, where he was a member, and apparently fell 
from a balcony after a night of heavy drinking at a reunion party. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the alcohol ban, Phi Gamma Delta has been suspended by  
its national organization, University President Judith Rodin and 
Provost Robert Barchi said in a letter announcing the ban on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 25 percent of Penn's 20,000 undergraduates belong to 49  
campus fraternities and sororities.

<HEADLINE> Americans Divided on Airstrikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several days into the bombing, Americans  
remained closely divided on the wisdom of the military action 
against Yugoslavia, new polls have found. Narrow majorities backed 
the effort but opinion was unsettled, with the prospect of American 
casualties a worry. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's handling of the crisis won support in a  
variety of polls, although the edge was slight, and it appeared he 
was persuading more Americans that military intervention was the 
right course. 
</P>
<P>
	Support for U.S. involvement in the air campaign stood at 53  
percent in a Newsweek poll taken during the second and third days 
of the bombing, which began Wednesday. Thirty-six percent opposed 
it. A Time-CNN poll found 44 percent approving of the action and 40 
percent against it. 
</P>
<P>
	A rise in support was sharply noted in an ABC News poll taken  
Friday in which 60 percent approved of the strikes, up from 47 per 
cent on the eve of the campaign. Less dramatically, support stood 
at 50 percent or a bit better in polls by CBS News, USA 
Today-Gallup and the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Indicating just how tentative opinion is on the U.S. course in  
the Balkans, no more than 3 or 4 percentage points -- the margins of 
error in most of the surveys -- separated opposing views on many key 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Although NATO reported no causalities or losses of its  
warplanes, the danger of the operation was high on people's minds. 
More respondents than not in the Newsweek poll predicted NATO 
casualties and in the ABC survey, 49 percent said peace in Kosovo 
is not worth the loss of U.S. lives while 45 percent said it would 
be. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by Time and CNN how many American lives ``would you be  
willing to sacrifice to achieve U.S. goals'' in Kosovo, 74 percent 
said none while 14 percent said fewer than 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek found Clinton's overall approval rating dropped to 57  
percent from 63 percent early in the month, indicating the public 
may not be rallying around him as vigorously as they often do for 
presidents in the opening of a military campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	A slight majority in the ABC survey say he has not done enough  
to explain the need for U.S. involvement. Still, more approved of 
his handling of the situation than not, even while a majority did 
not believe vital U.S. interests are at stake.

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio Jersey Sold for $56,025 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bob Payne was in an orphanage in Winston Salem,  
N.C., in 1955 when he was given a Mickey Mantle jersey from a crate 
of items donated by the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	The pinstriped jersey had been worn by Mantle in 1952, his first  
full season in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne decided it finally was time to part with that cherished  
No. 7 jersey, and it was auctioned this week along with other 
memorabilia at Leland's auction house in New York. It fetched 
$42,093. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more valuable was a road uniform jersey worn by Joe  
DiMaggio in 1939, his first full season with the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	That jersey went for $56,025. It was held by the same family  
since 1940. The man who offered it to Leland's for auction got it 
from his father who played on semi-pro team in New Jersey, and 
received the jersey because he was the star of the squad.

</P>
<P>
	KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Viacheslav Chornovil, one of Ukraine's most  
prominent politicians and a former Soviet political prisoner, died 
Thursday in a car crash. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	Chornovil, the longtime leader of the opposition Popular Rukh  
movement and a key figure in Ukraine's fight for independence from 
the Soviet Union, was killed when his car collided with a truck 
near the capital, Kiev. 
</P>
<P>
	Chornovil worked as a journalist, became active in the Soviet  
human rights movement and was ousted from a newspaper in 1966 for 
refusing to testify at a political trial. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested in 1967 for his dissident activities and  
sentenced to three years in prison, a term later cut in half. In 
1972 he was again arrested, this time as publisher of an 
underground newsletter, and sentenced to six years in prison and 
three years in exile. 
</P>
<P>
	He served his term in exile in Siberia.  
</P>
<P>
	In April 1980, Communist authorities again sentenced Chornovil  
to five years in prison, but he was released in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1980s he became the leading advocate of Ukrainian  
independence and was instrumental in forming the pro-independence 
Popular Rukh in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Chornovil ran for Ukraine's presidency in 1991, but finished  
second.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Albert Gollin, a renowned researcher at Columbia  
University and the American Newspaper Publishers Association, died 
Wednesday. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Gollin directed public opinion surveys at Columbia University's  
Bureau of Applied Social Research and Washington's Bureau of Social 
Science Research during the 1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of his work centered on civil rights, poverty issues and  
the protest movements of the time. He later went on to become a 
research leader on newspapers and their audiences at the American 
Newspaper Publishers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Gollin was awarded the distinguished achievement award  
from the American Association for Public Opinion Research. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Ann; two children and three  
stepchildren.

oldest and largest public relations firm, died Tuesday of cancer. 
She was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	McDermott came to Hawaii in 1958 and worked for several top

</P>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Arthur E. Raymond, a Douglas  
Aircraft engineer who was a key figure in designing the DC-3 
transport plane and a founder of the Rand think tank, died Monday 
at age 99. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond was working for Douglas Aircraft in 1932 when he became  
lead designer of the DC-1, the prototype of the twin-engine DC-3. 
An improved model, the DC-2, went into production, and the DC-3 
came out in 1935. At that time, the DC-3 was a major advance in 
passenger comfort. 
</P>
<P>
	During his 35 years with Douglas, Raymond was involved with a  
variety of projects, including the DC-8 commercial jetliner and 
antiaircraft missiles that were placed around major cities during 
the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring as vice president for engineering in 1960, he  
became a consultant to Rand and an adviser to the Apollo space 
program.

</P>
<P>
	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Dorin Teodorescu, an acclaimed  
Romanian tenor who played leading roles in hundreds of operetta 
shows, died Friday following brain surgery. He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
	Teodorescu, who was director of Bucharest's Ion Dacian Operetta  
company, had suffered a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Teodorescu graduated from Romania's music conservatory in 1965  
and immediately became his countrymen's operetta idol. 
</P>
<P>
	He played lead roles in works by Johann Strauss and Franz Lehar  
on various European stages and in Tel Aviv, Israel. He also gave 
concerts with arias from operas by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Giacomo 
Puccini and others.

once recognized as the dean of Oregon Republicans, died Tuesday at 
age 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Yturri was elected to the Senate in 1956 and also served as  
chairman of the Oregon Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	He also served on several corporate boards including the U.S.  
National Bank of Oregon, Union Pacific Railroad and Equitable 
Savings &AMP; Loan Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Yturri, who began his career practicing law in Ontario in 1937,  
served on the Senate Transportation Committee throughout his Senate 
career.

                           *Doug Edelson    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Radio journalist Doug Edelson, whose  
characteristic deep voice and political interviews were broadcast 
for more than a quarter of a century on WINS, has died. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Edelson died Friday at a hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He  
had been hospitalized since Sunday after suffering a heart attack, 
his family said. 
</P>
<P>
	Edelson had interviewed every president from Harry Truman to  
George Bush, ``and put his stamp on New York's biggest news 
events,'' the station said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his retirement five years ago, Edelson lived in Florida  
and Pennsylvania with his wife, Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	Edelson is survived by his wife; twin daughters, Jeanne Edelson  
and Catherine Fischer; and a grandson, Matthew Douglas Verlaque.

                         *Lawrence Duke Sr.    	
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Lawrence ``Dan'' Duke Sr., the former chief judge  
of the State Court of Fulton County who once waved a whip in the 
face of former Gov. Eugene Talmadge to prove a point about racism, 
has died. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke who was known for his work defending blacks and prosecuting  
those who carried out racially charged crimes, died Wednesday of 
pneumonia at Fayette Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke was best known for his confrontation with Talmadge in 1941.  
As an assistant solicitor for the state, Duke successfully 
convicted several members of the Ku Klux Klann for the flogging 
death of a black man. 
</P>
<P>
	After Talmadge threatened to grant the men clemency, Duke waved  
the whips used in the crime in the governor's face. Talmadge 
relented. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include Mrs. Fletcher, sons Lawrence Duke Barnes of  
Denver, Daniel Duke Jr. of Alpharetta, and Tarleton C. Duke of 
Tyrone; sister Myra Duke Coulon of Barnesville; and four 
grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Golfers Say TPC Course Too Tough  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The greens are too brown. The  
rough is too thick. The fairways aren't fair. The whole course is 
sick. 
</P>
<P>
	With years of practice, PGA professionals have transformed the  
art of complaining about golf courses into pure poetry. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the incessant carping this week at The Players  
Championship has stood out -- and cast a pall over the tournament 
that nobody can seem to escape. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, the worse the score, the more unhappy the player. Yet  
even the leaders had strong comments about the Stadium Course on 
the TPC at Sawgrass, a par-72 layout that has played at an average 
of 2.5 strokes over par over the first three days. 
</P>
<P>
	If this keeps up, only the U.S. and British Opens will have  
played tougher over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	After the wind kicked up Saturday and wrecked rounds left and  
right, most players said this tournament already equaled up to a 
major. 
</P>
<P>
	``The course is getting harder and harder and harder every  
day,'' said Payne Stewart, who stood at even-par after three 
rounds. ``You just have to hit great golf shots. If you don't, 
you're extremely penalized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes when they do, they get penalized too. That's how  
things are when strong winds buffet a course with 6-inch rough 
around the greens and fairways. 
</P>
<P>
	It was so bad that Brandt Jobe chose to hit off a cart path  
instead of taking a drop into the thick grass after an errant drive 
at No. 18 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	During Friday's round, Tiger Woods hacked a ball out of rough so  
thick it literally sent him spinning through his follow-through, a 
la Babe Ruth after a swinging third strike. 
</P>
<P>
	First-round co-leader Bob Estes missed one fairway and it took  
the spotter three minutes to find his ball, even though it landed 
only five feet to his right. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you miss a green, you are chipping out of however long  
rough they want to call it, five or six inches,'' third-round 
leader David Duval said. ``You have to take a good swing to hit, 
but at the same time try not to progress the ball. That combination 
doesn't work. That is what makes it so difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the rest of the complaints have to do with the greens.  
</P>
<P>
	In no particular order, players are upset because they feel they  
are running too fast, the pin placements are too difficult and they 
are dying out and look terrible on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like it as far as aesthetics,'' said Fuzzy Zoeller,  
who missed the cut with a score of 11-over 155. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked (bad) on TV yesterday. This is someplace we're  
supposed to be promoting as our TPC course, and there I see brown 
greens. You get that at Amelia golf course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What you won't find there are pin placements that can make a  
good shot look bad. Woods and Curtis Strange were among those who 
couldn't believe the difficulty of the placements so early in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``On 13, it's 1 1/2 steps from falling off the ridge,'' Woods said  
after Friday's round. ``That's not right. You can lip out a putt 
and run it off the ridge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Strange: ``You can grow rough and have narrow fairways, but  
have the greens the way they normally are. Within reason, you can 
speed them up. But don't have the pin right to the edge. Just use 
good judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past few years, managers at TPC have made a concerted  
effort to toughen the course, hoping to avoid a replay of Greg 
Norman's winning score of 24 under in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the challenge has been to find a happy medium.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is our tournament. We should have some say in it,  
shouldn't we?'' Ernie Els said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody wants to turn it into the U.S. Open, where Lee Janzen won  
with a score of even par at The Olympic Club in San Francisco last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, this tournament has drawn the third-best field of  
the decade. Everyone agrees they should leave having felt properly 
challenged. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our Players Championship and we should be able to put  
out the absolute best golf course available to us,'' Zoeller said. 
``I think they've gone overboard with it, but ... Someone's going 
to win Sunday and be very happy with it.''

<HEADLINE> Jordan Looks To Buy Part of Hornets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Michael Jordan isn't finished with the  
NBA. Barely two months after retiring as a player, Jordan is 
working on a deal to rejoin the league as a part owner of the 
Charlotte Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the NBA and the Hornets confirmed Saturday that  
Jordan began speaking with team owner George Shinn earlier this 
month about buying a 50-percent share of the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been preliminary discussions about Michael and  
George becoming equal partners in the ownership and operation of 
the Hornets,'' NBA commissioner David Stern said in a statement 
released by the league Saturday. ``Those discussions are ongoing 
but are not near an agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn, who brought pro basketball to Charlotte 11 years ago but  
has fallen on hard times lately, also released a statement saying 
he was hopeful of completing a deal with Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been preliminary discussions about Michael Jordan  
possibly becoming an ownership partner with me,'' Shinn said. ``Our 
hope over the next few meetings is to work out a partnership that 
will benefit the Hornets and the entire community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hornets officials said no firm dates had been set for the two  
sides to meet again, but that both parties had agreed to stay in 
touch over the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who retired from the Chicago Bulls in January, could not  
be located for comment Saturday, and his agent, David Falk, did not 
return telephone messages left at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte Observer first reported Saturday that Jordan was  
interested in buying a share of the Hornets. Such a deal would not 
only return Jordan to the game he helped shape over the past 13 
years, but it would give a boost to a franchise that has been under 
fire for poor leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some uncertainty because there could be an ownership  
change, but by and large everyone's pretty excited,'' said a 
Hornets employee who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition 
of anonymity. ``This could work out great for everybody. This could 
help George solve his image problem, give Michael something to do 
in retirement and give the team a boost at the same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan is the only potential buyer now in negotiations with  
Shinn, The Observer reported, citing a source it said was close to 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn was granted an expansion franchise for $32.5 million and  
was revered in Charlotte when the Hornets made their debut in 1988. 
Now, however, he is viewed by fans as someone unwilling to pay the 
big money needed to keep top talent, and there have been calls for 
him to sell the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dave Cowens resigned in frustration this month, and fans  
have been demonstrating their displeasure with the state of the 
team by not showing up for games. Turnstile counts have dropped 
considerably in the past year at the 23,799-seat Charlotte 
Coliseum, which used to be among the NBA leaders in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn, who counters his detractors by saying he needs a new  
arena to generate the money needed to pay the best players, also 
has personal problems. His wife has filed for divorce, and several 
women have accused him of sexual misconduct, including one who has 
named him as a defendant in a lawsuit in South Carolina, where 
Shinn has a home. 
</P>
<P>
	Into the mix steps Jordan and his six NBA championships, five  
MVP awards, 10 scoring titles and unsurpassed worldwide fame. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jordan retired as a player for the first time in 1993, he  
briefly pursued a professional baseball career before returning to 
the NBA late in the 1994-95 season. When he retired this year, he 
said he wanted to devote more time to his wife and three children, 
play more golf and focus on his various business interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Those business activities have helped him generate an annual  
off-court income estimated at $45 million, which would enable him 
to afford a piece of an NBA franchise said to be worth at least 
$150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Buying into the Hornets also would draw Jordan closer to his  
childhood roots. Raised in Wilmington, N.C., Jordan played for 
North Carolina, and his mother lives in Charlotte. He already has 
several business interests in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a great thing to have Jordan come in, but there's  
still the question of where Shinn fits in the picture,'' said D.J. 
Wittek, a patron of the Selwyn Avenue Pub, a popular postgame 
eatery. ``I think a lot of people will wonder how long a 50-50 
thing between Shinn and Jordan can last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf said he wasn't surprised at word  
that Jordan could join the ranks of NBA owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that it's going to happen. But no, nothing  
surprises me about Michael,'' Reinsdorf said in Mesa, Ariz., where 
he was attending spring training for his Chicago White Sox.

<HEADLINE> Russian Tops Kwan for Skating Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Maria Butyrskaya of Russia dethroned  
Michelle Kwan for the women's title at the World Figure Skating 
Championships today with a magnificent performance in the free 
skating. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya was an artist on ice as she executed dynamic jumps,  
including seven triple jumps, exquisite footwork and powerful 
spins. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya, after winning the short program a day earlier,  
needed to finish at least second today to be sure of the title, no 
matter what Kwan did. And 26-year old Russian left no doubt about 
the outcome. She earned marks of 5.7 and 5.9 from the judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan became a longshot to repeat after she slipped to fourth  
place when she fell Friday on the relatively simple double axel in 
the short program. 
</P>
<P>
	An error-free routine, combined with her qualifying group  
victory Wednesday, left Butyrskaya in position to complete a 
Russian sweep of the titles. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's what happened as Russia became the first ever to  
skate off with all four titles in the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	It has won all four titles at the Europeans the last three  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya became the first Russian woman of the post-Soviet era  
to win a world singles title. Oksana Baiul of Ukraine won the world 
title in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	After Butyrskaya's strong performance today, Kwan was clearly  
out of the running when she took the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year old had heard the cheering backstage after  
Butyrskaya skated but did not know her marks yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same old thing.... I just had to focus on my own  
thing,'' Kwan said. 
</P>
<P>
	A chance to win the free skating evaporated when she stepped out  
of her opening triple lutz. Later she only had a single axel, 
worrying about the jump that she missed in the short program. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan said she had recovered from the cold that had bothered her  
earlier in the week, but that her earlier weakness ``played a 
little game with my head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting with her coach Frank Carroll, before she received her  
marks, Kwan said she had been thinking of what not to do rather 
thinking positively. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was all negative,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Julia Soldatova of Russia finished third.  
</P>
<P>
	American Sarah Hughes, 13, was seventh in her first world  
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ice dance, Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov kept  
Russia's title streak alive with a close victory. 
</P>
<P>
	They performed a routine entirely to the rhythm of drums with no  
melody. However their technique and variety of rhythms was enough 
for them to gain a 5-4 decision in a head-to-head match against 
France's Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat. 
</P>
<P>
	Anissina, born in Russia, and Peizerat skated a more  
conventional routine to ``Man in the Iron Mask'' that was 
highlighted by unique lifts, including one where she holds him off 
the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz finished third.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Russia's Alexei Yagudin won the men's title, and  
compatriots Yelena Berzhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze took the pairs 
championship.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Ohio State is still searching for  
No. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	No, Scoonie Penn wasn't missing during Saturday night's national  
semifinal between the Buckeyes and Connecticut. He scored 11 points 
and had four assists in 40 minutes, but had to do it in a new 
jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Ten co-player of the year wore a number other than 12  
for the first time since transferring to Ohio State from Boston 
College. His usual red road jersey was either lost, stolen or 
inadvertently left at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes, a self-described superstitious bunch, aren't sure  
what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he got to the arena, the red 12 was not in his bag,''  
Ohio State sports information director Gerry Emig said. ``We don't 
know if it didn't get back here from Columbus or whether packing 
his stuff to come to the game it fell out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if maybe the jersey had been stolen, Emig said: ``That's a  
possibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn didn't buy the argument that changing numbers somehow may  
have played a role in a 3-for-13 shooting performance or the 
outcome of the game, which Connecticut won 64-58. 
</P>
<P>
	``That didn't have any impact,'' the Ohio State star said,  
adding he discovered the jersey was missing about 10 minutes before 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came back in here and I couldn't find it, so I had to wear  
No. 35,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Neshaun Coleman said he was almost certain he saw the  
missing jersey before the Buckeyes went out on the floor for 
warmups about 25 minutes before tip-off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to bet the house that I saw that jersey hanging  
up,'' Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The jersey Penn wore is the Buckeyes' so-called ``blood  
jersey.'' The NCAA requires every team to carry at least one extra 
jersey in case a player gets blood on his regular uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Penn wore a number other than 12 was when he was  
No. 11 at Boston College two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PENN STOPPER:* Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun said it wasn't  
difficult to decide who Ricky Moore, the Huskies' best defender, 
would guard. Michael Redd was Ohio State's leading scorer this 
season, but Penn made the Buckeyes go this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scoonie to me is all about what happens. ... After watching  
tape, it was clear to me that as Scoonie goes, so does Ohio 
State,'' Calhoun said, adding it would have been difficult to pick 
a most valuable player for the game between Moore and Richard 
Hamilton, who scored 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically he cut the head of the dragon off,'' Calhoun said of  
Moore, who he described as the best defensive player he's ever 
coached.

	 *FREQUENT FLYERS:* With Duke's men's and women's team in the  
running for national titles this weekend, it's an extremely busy 
time for school president Dr. Nan Keohane and athletic director Joe 
Alleva, who are traveling between St. Petersburg and San Jose, site 
of the women's finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Keohane and Alleva flew to California from Florida on Friday to  
watch the women's team beat Georgia to advance to Sunday's 
championship game. They returned Saturday on a private chartered 
jet in time for the men's semifinal against Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	With both teams having one more game, they'll repeat the  
cross-country trek Sunday and Monday.

	 *PROUD PARENTS:* Slobodan Savovic, Ohio State's freshman guard,  
believes he is the first Serbian to play in the Final Four. His 
parents, who had only seen tapes of his college games, planned to 
watch the live telecast of the semifinals in Montenegro, 
Yugoslavia. Savovic said he spoke with his parents -- Nikola and 
Olivera -- during the week, but declined to answer reporters 
questions about the NATO bombing of the Balkans. The 6-foot-6 
guard, slowed late in the season by an Achilles injury, has a 
tattoo that reads: ``When is it going to end?'' Savovic finished 
with seven points and three rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FEELING BETTER:* Connecticut forward Kevin Freeman, who  
practiced only one time the past week because of an ear infection, 
started for the Huskies and had five points and seven rebounds in 
22 minutes. He took antibiotics and rested early in the week before 
joining his teammates for practice on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

	 *No. 1 vs. No. 1:* For the first time since 1993, when Michigan  
faced North Carolina, a pair of No. 1 seeds will play for the 
national title. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HUGE CROWD:* Attendance was announced as 41,340, the largest  
crowd to ever watch a basketball game in Florida. Last year's South 
Regional final drew 40,589 to Tropiciana Field. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	 *LOW SCORING:* The combined point total of 122 in the  
Connecticut-Ohio State game was the lowest in a national semifinal 
since Villanova beat Memphis State 52-45 in 1985. Ohio State lost 
for only the second time this season when holding an opponent below 
70. The Buckeyes were 25-2 in such games.

	YASS, Australia (AP) -- The media prince and the beauty queen  
were married Saturday in a wedding that not even pouring rain could 
spoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Lachlan Murdoch, the 27-year-old heir apparent to father

photographs were published on the Web site of Murdoch's News Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement posted on the site, News Ltd. said 100 guests  
including the parents of the bride and groom attended the service,

<HEADLINE> Rapist Terrorizes Atlanta Suburbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SMYRNA, Ga. (AP) -- Women in the suburbs north of Atlanta jog  
through their neatly landscaped neighborhoods only in pairs these 
days, and many pack more than water bottles. At night, they 
barricade doors and sleep with kitchen knives or even machetes 
beside their beds. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past six months, 24 woman have been attacked,  
apparently by the same man. All the women -- some alone, some with 
male companions -- were robbed, five were raped and at least five 
others suffered some form of sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are taking it very seriously,'' said Kathy Fitzner, 45,  
who lives two buildings away from where one woman was attacked. ``I 
had some Mace but I never carried it. Now I've got that, a siren 
attached to my bed and a cell phone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police won't say if they have DNA or other evidence linking the  
crimes, which began in October, but they say victims' descriptions, 
crime locations and times, and the man's tactics have been similar. 
The attacker sometimes wears a ski mask or cap and dark clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also say he carries a silver-colored handgun.  
</P>
<P>
	But he has only used the gun once, in the latest attack. The  
victim was shot in the side when she opened the door after a man 
knocked to tell her she left her headlights on. The 33-year-old 
woman, who was not sexually assaulted, has been released from a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows that he's escalating,'' Fulton County police Maj.  
Terry Mulkey said. ``This person is displaying very violent 
tendencies now and it does alarm us and it should alarm the 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the crimes have been in Cobb, DeKalb and Fulton counties,  
within a couple of miles of Interstate 285. Besides the separate 
county investigations, the FBI and the Georgia Bureau of 
Investigation are looking into the crime wave and helping with a 
profile of the attacker, Mulkey said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although robbery appears to be the primary motive, the man  
sexually assaults his victims whenever circumstances permit, said 
Cobb County police spokesman Robert Quigley. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the women were accosted in a parking lot as they walked  
to or from their residences. Some attacks took place at restaurants 
or shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son came over and brought two guns and told us to pick  
one,'' said Jessie Ford, 68, who lives with her husband at a Cobb 
County complex. ``I never did like guns and we never had one, but I 
tell ya', when something like this happens ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	The location of the attacks have run the gamut from older  
complexes with several entrances to new apartment complexes with 
iron gates accessible only with a remote or code number. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been two rapes since December at the Waterford Place  
apartments in Fulton County. 
</P>
<P>
	Resident Barbara Bretas, 21, isn't taking any chances. When she  
returned home late one night, the Georgia State student saw an 
unfamiliar man in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as I got out of my car I just started screaming and  
ran to my apartment and opened my door really fast and got in,'' 
she said. ``When I looked out the window he was still there so I 
called 911. Five minutes later, there were like four police cars 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The man was apparently just a visitor and not arrested.  
</P>
<P>
	Most of the communities in the area have distributed fliers with  
the police sketch. In many, police have met with residents to 
discuss the investigation and safety measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents are being advised to avoid going outside at night  
alone and to carry a whistle or pepper spray. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still no substitute for common sense -- looking around  
when getting in and out of your car, looking in the shadows,'' 
Mulkey said.

<HEADLINE> Dr. Charged in Mayo Clinic Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A Japanese doctor completing a research  
fellowship at the Mayo Clinic was charged with stealing medical 
research data from the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Yoichi Ito of Osaka appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge  
John Mason late Friday afternoon. He was ordered not to travel 
outside Minnesota and to return to court Wednesday, or else face a 
$25,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an FBI search warrant affidavit filed Thursday,  
Ito, 32, had been working in Mayo's cartilage and connective tissue 
laboratory in Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he was warned when he arrived in 1997 that his research  
work belonged to the clinic, Mayo officials discovered last week 
that he had removed his own notes and research materials from the 
clinic and stolen other research data from clinic computers, the 
affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Mayo spokesman said Ito was to have completed a two-year  
fellowship in the orthopedic research department on Monday, the end 
of the academic quarter. He was scheduled to return to Japan that 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Ito declined to comment after his release.  
</P>
<P>
	According to the affidavit, Ito had been working on gene  
sequencing research associated with the laboratory's efforts to 
synthesize genes and cells that might allow a human body to 
regenerate and replace diseased or damaged cartilage and connective 
tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	He is accused of downloading lab research dating to 1990 from  
the lab's computer onto optical disks without authorization, as 
well as illegally removing slides and research materials produced 
by others.

<HEADLINE> Report: King Caught in Tyson Hoax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Boxing promoter Don King apparently was the  
victim of prankster claiming to be jailed former heavyweight 
champion Mike Tyson, the New York Post reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said King received a telephone call Thursday night  
from someone with a high-pitched lisping voice claiming to be 
Tyson. The caller said he was at the Montgomery County Detention 
Center in Maryland, where Tyson is serving a one-year sentence for 
assaulting two motorists. 
</P>
<P>
	The caller told King that, despite their falling out last year  
when Tyson slapped the promoter with a $10 million lawsuit over 
lost earnings, all was forgiven. The caller said he desperately 
need to see King. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy was asking for help,'' a King spokesperson told the  
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	So King traveled to the jail Friday, only to be told he was not  
on the list of approved visitors, the newspaper said, citing an 
unidentified prison official. 
</P>
<P>
	``King kept shouting, `This man called me last night. He told me  
he needs me. Ask him yourself,' '' the official told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Guards complied, but said Tyson refused to see King.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was stunned,'' the official said of Tyson. ``He said he  
wants nothing to do with King. He hates him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The King spokesperson told the newspaper that the promoter was  
upset. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of someone's warped sense of humor, Don flew from  
Miami to Maryland in vain, thinking he could be of aid to someone 
in their time of need,'' the spokesperson said. ``It's just sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesperson for Tyson declined comment to the newspaper.  
</P>
<P>
	Calls were placed by The Associated Press to representatives for  
King and Tyson, but none of them could be reached.

<HEADLINE> House Moves To Honor Rosa Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rosa Parks, hailed as the mother of the civil  
rights movement, would be honored with a Congressional Gold Medal 
under legislation that has moved a step closer to its expected 
approval by the full House. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill must also pass the Senate and be signed by President  
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton invited Parks to his State of the Union address in  
January and the 86-year-old civil rights pioneer rose from her seat 
in the House gallery for a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said in his speech that for many the civil rights  
movement began ``when a woman named Rosa Parks sat down on a bus 
and wouldn't get up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill cleared a House Banking subcommittee Thursday by voice  
vote. It will go directly to the full House because it has the 
support of at least 319 members, more than the required two-thirds 
majority, or 290, co-sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	A vote by the House is expected after Congress' two-week Easter  
recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar legislation is pending in the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	``Rosa Parks is an American hero not because she held high  
office, but because she was an ordinary citizen with extraordinary 
courage,'' said the subcommittee chairman, Republican Rep. Spencer 
Bachus of Alabama, where Parks' single act of defiance nearly 44 
years ago awakened the conscience of a nation. 
</P>
<P>
	She was arrested in December 1955 for refusing to surrender her  
seat to a white man on a segregated bus in Montgomery, where she 
was a seamstress. Her arrest set off a lengthy bus boycott by a 
then-local minister, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her quiet courage that day ... launched a new American  
revolution that opened new doors of opportunity and brought 
equality for all Americans close to a reality,'' said Rep. Julia 
Carson, D-Ind., the prime sponsor of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Parks now lives in Detroit.  
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee meeting, scheduled Thursday at the last minute,  
came after a nationally broadcast urban radio program told 
listeners the bill was in danger of failing to garner the support 
needed for a full House vote. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 573.

<HEADLINE> Inflammation Linked to Stroke Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Smoldering, low-level inflammation that  
goes on for years but is detectable only on blood tests appears to 
be a sign of a high risk of stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say it's unlikely that inflammation itself triggers a  
stroke. Rather, it appears that chronic inflammation is one part of 
the underlying disease that eventually leads to these medical 
catastrophes. 
</P>
<P>
	Several studies in recent years have shown that signs of  
inflammation in the blood are strongly linked to an increased risk 
of suffering a heart attack. In these studies, researchers check 
for C-reactive proteins, substances that rise in the bloodstream 
during inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest findings about strokes were presented at an  
epidemiology conference sponsored by the American Heart Association 
that concluded Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both strokes and heart attacks usually occur when a growth of  
fatty material, called plaque, breaks open in an artery, triggering 
a clot that chokes off the blood supply. These lumps begin when 
cholesterol collects on the artery wall. This in turn attracts 
disease-fighting blood cells, which treats the cholesterol as a 
foreign substance, causing an inflammatory reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Some believe that germs, too, might start the process of plaque  
build-up, and the inflammation could be part of the body's attempt 
to kill bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	``C-reactive proteins don't cause a heart attack,'' said Dr.  
Lewis H. Kuller of the University of Pittsburgh. ``It's a marker of 
what's going on in the plaque.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A variety of other problems also can raise the levels of these  
proteins, including such brief infections as colds, and such 
chronic inflammation as arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the reports at the American Heart Association conference:  
</P>
<P>
	--Dr. Jess David Curb and colleagues from the University of  
Hawaii measured C-reactive proteins in about 8,000 
Japanese-American men who took part in the Honolulu Heart Program. 
After 20 years of follow-up, those whose protein levels were in the 
top one-third were 50 percent more likely to have had a stroke 
compared to those in the bottom third. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dr. Peter Wilson of the federally sponsored Framingham Heart  
Study in suburban Boston reported on a 12-year follow-up of about 
1,500 men and women. Men whose protein levels were in the top 
quarter were twice as likely as those in the bottom quarter to have 
died from cardiovascular disease. However, no such link was seen in 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dr. James Pankow of the University of North Carolina looked at  
C-reactive protein levels in a study of about 6,000 people in 1,100 
families. He found that family members were likely to have similar 
protein levels, suggesting that this tendency is at least partly 
inherited. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said that too little is known about what the  
inflammation means to begin measuring it routinely. However, they 
said doctors may someday monitor it as part of an overall 
assessment of cardiovascular health and might give 
inflammation-fighting drugs to patients whose levels of C-reactive 
proteins suddenly shoot up.

<HEADLINE> Lonesome Glory Wins Carolina Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMDEN, S.C. (AP) -- Lonesome Glory, a four-time Eclipse Award  
winner, showed age is no deterrent to success, drawing off to 
victory in Saturday's $100,000 Carolina Cup steeplechase. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-year-old Lonesome Glory drew even with leader Assurance  
at the 14th and final fence and cruised a 6 3/4-length victory at 
Springdale Race Course before a National Steeplechase Association 
record crowd of 69,300. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner topped a field of six, traveling the 2 1/4-mile course  
in 4:22 4-5 with Blythe Miller aboard. Lonesome Glory is trained by 
Miller's father, Bruce, and owned by Kay Jeffords. 
</P>
<P>
	Assurance, who held on for second, set the pace for Saturday's  
feature. He grabbed the lead at the first fence and held until 
Lonesome Glory blew by at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Assurance was 1 1/4 lengths ahead of Romantic.  
</P>
<P>
	Rowdy Irishman and Fifth Creek rounded out the finishers. Prime  
Legacy was eased before the final fence. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a happy return to Springdale for Lonesome Glory in his  
first start of the year. The champion won the Carolina Cup in 1997 
and also owns three Colonial Cups, the steeplechase race run here 
each fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Blythe Miller said that her horse took her to the front at the  
right time after biding his time in the middle of the pack most of 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was confident that my horse had enough to get home,'' she  
said. ``He just had to get going. He's got class. He ran a great 
race today. It was great to see him run like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Augustin Stables' Henares won the $35,000 Woodward-Kirkover Cup,  
the co-feature on the six-race card. Henares was ridden by Craig 
Thornton and trained by Sanna Neilson. 
</P>
<P>
	Thornton and Neilson also won the $25,000 Springdale Cup with  
Augustin Stables' Brankman.

<HEADLINE> Tip of Elephant's Trunk Severed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An elephant lost four inches off her trunk,  
getting it caught in hydraulic barn doors. 
</P>
<P>
	Tara, a 7,860-pound pachyderm, unexpectedly turned her head  
Thursday as keepers opened her barn's doors for the night. The 
African elephant did not bellow in pain but ran to an outside yard 
carrying the detached piece in her mouth, zoo spokeswoman Judy Shay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury was not considered severe, and no nerve damage  
occurred. A park veterinarian said the 33-year-old elephant was 
expected to keep the sore clean on her own. 
</P>
<P>
	Handlers compared Tara's misfortune to a wild elephant whose  
trunk might get snapped off by a crocodile. 
</P>
<P>
	``It reminds me of when children get doors slammed on their  
hands,'' said zoo curator Michael Dee. 
</P>
<P>
	Keepers provided a bucket of ice water to Tara so she could dunk  
her trunk, about 8 feet in length. Handlers will hand-feed her hay 
until the tip heals, Ms. Shay said.

	With years of practice, PGA professionals have transformed the  
art of complaining about golf courses into pure poetry. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the incessant carping this week at The Players  
Championship has stood out -- and cast a pall over the tournament 
that nobody can seem to escape. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, the worse the score, the more unhappy the player. Yet  
even the leaders had strong comments about the Stadium Course on 
the TPC at Sawgrass, a par-72 layout that played at an average of 
2.1 strokes over par over the first two days. 
</P>
<P>
	If this keeps up, only the U.S. and British Opens will have  
played tougher over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't make everybody happy,'' said Davis Love III, a  
player-director on the PGA Tour Policy Board. ``This is major 
championship golf conditions that you see just a few times a year. 
A lot of guys aren't used to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that anybody could ever become accustomed to 6-inch rough  
around the greens and fairways. 
</P>
<P>
	It was so bad that Brandt Jobe chose to hit off a cart path  
instead of taking a drop into the thick grass after an errant drive 
at No. 18 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	During Friday's round, Tiger Woods hacked a ball out of rough so  
thick it literally sent him spinning through his follow-through, a 
la Babe Ruth after a swinging third strike. 
</P>
<P>
	First-round co-leader Bob Estes missed one fairway and it took  
the spotter three minutes to find his ball, even though it landed 
only five feet to his right. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you miss a green, you are chipping out of however long  
rough they want to call it, five or six inches,'' David Duval said. 
``You have to take a good swing to hit, but at the same time try 
not to progress the ball. That combination doesn't work. That is 
what makes it so difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the rest of the complaints have to do with the greens.  
</P>
<P>
	In no particular order, players are upset because they feel they  
are running too fast, the pin placements are too difficult and they 
are dying out and look terrible on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like it as far as aesthetics,'' said Fuzzy Zoeller,  
who missed the cut with a score of 11-over 155. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked (bad) on TV yesterday. This is someplace we're  
supposed to be promoting as our TPC course, and there I see brown 
greens. You get that at Amelia golf course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What you won't find there are pin placements that can make a  
good shot look bad. Woods and Curtis Strange were among those who 
couldn't believe the difficulty of the placements so early in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``On 13, it's 1 1/2 steps from falling off the ridge,'' Woods said.  
``That's not right. You can lip out a putt and run it off the 
ridge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Strange: ``You can grow rough and have narrow fairways, but  
have the greens the way they normally are. Within reason, you can 
speed them up. But don't have the pin right to the edge. Just use 
good judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past few years, managers at TPC have made a concerted  
effort to toughen the course, hoping to avoid a replay of Greg 
Norman's winning score of 24 under in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the challenge has been to find a happy medium.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is our tournament. We should have some say in it,  
shouldn't we?'' Ernie Els said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody wants to turn it into the U.S. Open, where Lee Janzen won  
with a score of even par at The Olympic Club in San Francisco last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, this tournament has drawn the third-best field of  
the decade. Everyone agrees they should leave having felt properly 
challenged. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our Players Championship and we should be able to put  
out the absolute best golf course available to us,'' Zoeller said. 
``I think they've gone overboard with it, but ... Someone's going 
to win Sunday and be very happy with it.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a fourth round of air strikes expected  
today, the Clinton administration is expanding its efforts to 
verify suspected Serbian war crimes against ethnic Albanians in

stark picture of life in a land torn by war. Her words, if not her

<HEADLINE> Bush Said To Have Raised $3 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking an early edge in a crowded GOP field,  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush has raised at least $3 million so far 
this year for a possible presidential bid, according to Republicans 
familiar with his fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's take for the first three months of 1999 is expected to  
put him ahead of several potential rivals for the Republican 
presidential nomination when their first fund-raising reports come 
out April 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Bush's potential challengers expect to report less than  
$1 million in fund raising: Former American Red Cross President 
Elizabeth Dole will report in the ``mid six-figures,'' while former 
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander expects between $700,000 and 
$800,000, their spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other GOP contenders are closer in the money race to Bush, early  
leader in Republican primary polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Quayle, who served as vice president under Bush's father, is  
expected to report around $2 million, spokesman Jonathan Baron 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who had a fund-raiser last week in  
New York; conservative activist Gary Bauer; and Rep. John Kasich of 
Ohio, who is spending the week raising money on the West Coast, 
also are expected to disclose at least $1 million in contributions 
for the period Jan. 1 through March 31, campaign officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The race for campaign funds is considered the first primary of  
the 2000 presidential election. Politicians and strategists say a 
candidate needs to raise $20 million by the end of this year to 
properly finance a campaign in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is considering forgoing federal matching funds, taxpayer  
assistance to candidates who agree to spending limits. That, aides 
say, will allow him to compete better against millionaire publisher 
Steve Forbes, whose self-financed candidacy has no spending 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Political experts estimate that Bush would have to raise around  
$50 million to be able to go that route. 
</P>
<P>
	Some campaigns are reticent to discuss the financing of their  
campaigns. Bush's figures were provided by Republicans familiar 
with his fund raising who would speak only on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Others, however, are trumpeting the money they have raised.  
</P>
<P>
	Bauer's campaign manager, Frank Cannon, said the $1.4 million  
his boss has raised, mostly through small donations, gives him a 
good base for future fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're a direct mail-oriented candidate, as you identify  
supporters and they continue to give to you, your number rises each 
quarter,'' Cannon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle has tried to tap supporters he made connections with  
while serving as vice president and at the same time is reaching 
out to those who identify with his conservative social message. 
</P>
<P>
	The former vice president ``has access to the major donor  
community, and that's important,'' said Baron, his spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich has raised $1.3 million, and is in the midst of a  
fund-raising trip to California and Washington state. ``What we 
have shown is he can raise the money,'' spokesman Todd Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Steve Schmidt said Alexander's major fund-raising  
events aren't scheduled until the second and third quarters of the 
year. For example, his Nashville kickoff, which raised $2 million 
when he ran for president in 1996, won't be until May. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our fund raising is right on track with what it needs to be,''  
Schmidt said. ``We've begun the campaign, have money in the bank 
and paid all the operating and startup costs.''

<HEADLINE>  Fraschilla Named New Mexico Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Brooklyn-born Fran Fraschilla will  
finally get to go West as the next coach at New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Fired last year at St. John's after developing an interest in  
the coaching vacancy at Arizona State, Fraschilla was hired 
Saturday by the Lobos. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a basketball junkie and the chance to coach in one of the  
best environments in college basketball is just a dream,'' 
Fraschilla said during a telephone conference call from the Final 
Four in St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraschilla, 40, has been a frequent shopper for coaching  
vacancies throughout the country in recent months. His name has 
surfaced in coaching job openings at Georgia, San Diego State, 
Pittsburgh, East Carolina and Southwest Missouri State. 
</P>
<P>
	His hiring at New Mexico came four days after Dave Bliss  
resigned to take the head coaching job at Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico athletic director Rudy Davalos called Fraschilla  
``one of the best recruiters in the country,'' and a coach with the 
ability to take the Lobos to a higher level of national prominence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is I want the best for New Mexico  
basketball,'' Davalos said. ``I'm excited as heck about a guy that 
can give us a different aspect. The guy I hired is a high, high, 
high energy coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Associate athletic director Bill McGillis, a member of the  
advisory committee that helped in the search, said Fraschilla was 
the leading candidate from the start on a list that started out 
long and was trimmed to about six candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once Bliss started looking at the Saint Louis and Baylor jobs,  
we came up with a list,'' McGillis said. ``Fran was always at the 
top. He has a national profile and the focus was always on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bliss left as the winningest coach in New Mexico history with a  
record of 246-108 in 11 seasons. He led the Lobos to seven NCAA 
tournaments in the last nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico was 25-9 this season and lost to Connecticut at the  
West Regional. In Bliss' final four seasons, the Lobos won 102 
games, but Bliss became the target of increasing criticism from 
fans and the media for the Lobos' inability to advance further than 
the second round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraschilla, who coached St. John's to its first NCAA tournament  
bid since 1993, said he was ready for the mania and fish bowl 
atmosphere in Albuquerque, where the Lobos are the only game in 
town and annually rank among the top 10 schools nationally in home 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to be going into a place where people expect you to  
win,'' Fraschilla said. ``Coming from New York, I'm used to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Fraschilla left St. John's, the school said it had reached  
an agreement with Fraschilla to end their relationship because of 
``fundamental differences over the management of the basketball 
program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school said the decision had nothing to do with any unlawful  
conduct, violations of NCAA regulations or financial improprieties, 
and that none of those things had been reported or alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can say it was based on the opportunity to look at the  
Arizona State job and it ruffled some feathers back at St. 
John's,'' Fraschilla said.

<HEADLINE> Duke, Purdue Vie for Women's Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Purdue plays smart basketball, and so  
does Duke. Purdue keeps its composure when things get tight, ditto 
for Duke. Teamwork? There's plenty of that to go around, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The final game in the women's basketball season has come down to  
a pair of remarkably similar teams meeting in the NCAA championship 
game Sunday night. That should come as no surprise because the 
players who make up the heart and soul of both teams all started in 
the same place. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-ranked Purdue rode the spectacular play of Ukari Figgs and  
the steady contributions of Stephane White-McCarty to a 77-63 
victory over Louisiana Tech in one semifinal Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicole Erickson and Michele VanGorp, who once played at Purdue  
with Figgs and White-McCarty, led the way as Duke advanced with an 
81-69 victory over Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Predictably, both sides were reluctant to wade into the issue of  
former teammates meeting in the biggest game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are just going to approach it like any other game,''  
White-McCarty said. ``We are playing Duke. We are not playing just 
against those two players. We are playing the whole team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson and VanGorp transferred to Duke following the dismissal  
of Lin Dunn as Purdue's coach in 1996. Like their former teammates, 
they have a chance to take their school to its first national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any hard feelings for Purdue,'' VanGorp said.  
``Everyone wants to beat this dead horse. I feel happy for 
Stephanie, I feel happy for Ukari. It's exciting. I'm not going to 
fuel the fire. There's no fire there to fuel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams played with plenty of fire Friday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Erickson scored 22 points and VanGorp 20 as Duke (29-6) followed  
its stunning upset of three-time defending national champion 
Tennessee with an outstanding effort against Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	But that didn't surprise the Blue Devils, who shot 51 percent  
and defused Georgia's explosive twins, Kelly and Coco Miller, with 
solid defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we had an emotional letdown at all,'' Duke coach  
Gail Goestenkors said. ``I think the players were ready to play. We 
were very focused. I didn't feel worried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke built a 15-point lead early in the second half and used a  
late 16-3 run to rebuild its advantage after Georgia pulled within 
six. They also set a national semifinal record by making nine of 15 
3-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have a very good effect defensively,'' Georgia coach  
Andy Landers said. ``They shoot the ball terrifically from the 
3-point line and as we spread ourselves all around the perimeter, 
we leave ourselves vulnerable inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coco Miller led Georgia (27-7) with 18 points, and Tawana  
McDonald added 14. Kelly Miller, who scored 33 points in the 
regional final against Iowa State, scored just 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Figgs scored 18 points in a sensational first half -- 14 in the  
opening 11 1/2 minutes -- and finished with 24 as Purdue (33-1) won its 
31st straight game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers used runs of 13-2 and 12-2 in building a  
15-point lead in the first half and answered with a 12-0 burst 
after Louisiana Tech (30-3) pulled within three in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always keep our composure,'' Figgs said. ``They made a run  
at us, but we weren't really rattled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty finished strong to get 17 points after a 1-for-7  
opening half and Katie Douglas scored 15. The Boilermakers 
committed only 11 turnovers against a team that had been forcing an 
average of 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we went on adrenaline in the second half,'' Douglas  
said. ``We really wanted this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amanda Wilson's 18 points led Louisiana Tech, which had won 22  
straight since a 71-65 loss to Purdue on Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	By reaching the championship game, Duke threw out a challenge to  
its men's team to do the same. Duke plays Michigan State tonight in 
the men's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We support our men's team totally,'' VanGorp said. ``It's  
right there on our itinerary: men's game.''

<P>
	Bliss left as the winningest coach in New Mexico history with a  
record of 246-108 in 11 seasons. He led the Lobos to seven NCAA 
tournaments in the last nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico was 25-9 this season and lost to Connecticut at the  
West Regional. In Bliss' final four seasons, the Lobos won 102 
games, but Bliss became the target of increasing criticism from 
fans and the media for the Lobos' inability to advance further than 
the second round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraschilla, who coached St. John's to its first NCAA tournament  
bid since 1993, said he was ready for the mania and fish bowl 
atmosphere in Albuquerque, where the Lobos are the only game in 
town and annually rank among the top 10 schools nationally in home 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to be going into a place where people expect you to  
win,'' Fraschilla said. ``Coming from New York, I'm used to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Fraschilla left St. John's, the school said it had reached  
an agreement with Fraschilla to end their relationship because of 
``fundamental differences over the management of the basketball 
program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school said the decision had nothing to do with any unlawful  
conduct, violations of NCAA regulations or financial improprieties, 
and that none of those things had been reported or alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can say it was based on the opportunity to look at the  
Arizona State job and it ruffled some feathers back at St. 
John's,'' Fraschilla said.

<HEADLINE> Border Agent, 3 Others Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN YSIDRO, Calif. (AP) -- A Border Patrol sport-utility vehicle  
rolled off a treacherous dirt road near the Mexican border 
Saturday, killing an agent and three unidentified people. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other passengers were injured and taken to nearby  
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities learned of the accident about 7 a.m. Saturday when  
three of the injured men approached an agent driving nearby and 
told him a Border Patrol vehicle had rolled down an embankment in 
the remote area about a half mile north of the border. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer called for help and was able to find the accident  
site after hiking down the steep hillside, said Robert Smith, a 
Border Patrol agent. Rescuers took the three men, who were 
passengers in the vehicle, and a fourth victim to local hospitals, 
and their condition was not immediately known, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, who was the only Border Patrol agent in the vehicle,  
and three other men were already dead, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear what caused the accident or who passengers in the  
vehicle were, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We assume them to be illegal immigrants,'' he said. ``The only  
the person that would have known that was the driver of the vehicle 
and he was killed in the accident.''

	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) - For a 13-year-old figure skater who was  
not supposed to be at the World Championships, Sarah Hughes had a 
great time. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes nailed six triples to finish sixth in the free skating  
and seventh overall as Maria Butyrskaya of Russia beat out American 
Michelle Kwan for the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a blast out there. It was so much fun,'' she said. ``I'm  
just so happy. Being here is so great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The skater from Great Neck, N.Y., was ninth after the short  
program. 
</P>
<P>
	She skated to ``Swan Lake'' in the long program Saturday, not  
making any major mistakes and even doing two triple lutzes 
including one in combination. 
</P>
<P>
	She received marks from 5.2 up to 5.6, and finished ahead of the  
other American, Angela Nikodinov, who came in 12th. Hughes was 
ecstatic coming off the ice and hugged her coach Robin Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes finished fourth in the U.S. championships in February  
with only three women's spots available. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 13-year-old, Naomi Nari Nam, was second to Kwan but was  
not allowed on the team, being below the minimum age limit of 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Hughes was picked because of a special exception  
that allows junior worlds medalists to participate in the senior 
worlds. Hughes was second in the world junior championships in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't do anything about the rules ... I just wanted to do my  
best and not worry,'' Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes was the youngest competitor in Helsinki. She said she  
didn't let her age worry her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't really think about it. I just wanted to show I could  
do well here, that I belong here,'' Hughes said.
