<HEADLINE> TOT Suggested for Attracting Foreign Funds to Power Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The plant can use the money to build new power plants. Upon the
term expiration, the foreign investors may again transfer the
power plant back to the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
The two experts believed that TOT avoids the risks and
contradictions found in BOT, and is easily accepted by Chinese and
foreign investment partners.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has been exercising BOT to attract
foreign investors to the country's power sector, but the result
has not been as good as expected, they noted.
</P>
<P>
"The key to the problem lies in the 'B', or building of power
plants, because construction of power plants demands huge
investment, and has a long term of repayment," the two experts
explained.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Weihe Power Plant in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province adopted TOT to transfer some of its operations to a
foreign investor, and has seen improved results.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that TOT is of great significance to the
country's power industry as a means of attracting more foreign
funds, as the method is conducive to enlivening state-owned
assets, drawing additional funds for the construction of new
projects and introducing advanced management experience.
</P>
<P>
By adopting TOT, foreign investors can quickly obtain profits
from China's rapidly-expanding power industry, though not as much
as they might obtain from BOT, the experts say.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Puts Lifting Embargo as Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Burundi today called on its
neighbors to lift the economic embargo they imposed on it as a
precondition for beginning peace talks with the country's Hutu
rebels.
</P>
<P>
"One cannot have dialogue as long as the blockade is not
lifted," Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted Burundian Prime
Minister Pascal-Firmin Ndimira as telling the diplomatic corps in
Bujumbura today.
</P>
<P>
The countries of the Great Lake region of Africa decided last
weekend at a summit in Arusha, Tanzania, to maintain the economic
sanctions on Burundi they imposed two months ago on the tiny
central African state.
</P>
<P>
These African countries, which condemned the military putsch in
July by the Tutsi-dominated Burundian army, also gave Burundi one
month to begin negotiations with the Hutu rebels.
</P>
<P>
"With the blockade, it is impossible to go ahead on the road
of negotiations. We are predisposed and always have decided to
engage in negotiations, but not within the framework of this
blockade," said the prime minister who was nominated by the
military after the coup.
</P>
<P>
While accusing "some countries" of trying to "strangle the
people of Burundi," he said that the embargo has "endangered the
peace process, encouraged the armed factions while the government
has its hands bound."
</P>
<P>
"The Burundian government denounces the conspiracy of all
those who, under the cover of democracy, continue to manoeuvre for
their own interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the embargo, which has cost Burundi -- one of the
poorest nations of the world -- an economic loss of 162 million
U.S. dollars, is completely illegal, unfair and unilateral.
</P>
<P>
At least 150,000 people have been killed in the past three
years in inter-ethnic conflicts between the Hutus and Tutsis.

<HEADLINE> Modern Economy Treats Americans Very Differently </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The modern U.S. economy has
treated people very differently and Americans, in turn, have
sharply different views about how well the economy is performing.
</P>
<P>
A widening gap between those who are prospering and those who
are not in the U.S. has resulted in the most striking feature of
the U.S. economy, an article by The Washington Post said today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy as a whole may be growing steadily in the past
years, with low inflation and falling unemployment. But there are
many people who are not sharing in the economic gains, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
A national survey by the The Washington Post, Harvard
University and the the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation found
that the unequal fashion in which the modern economy passes out
rewards is matched by sharp divisions in how Americans think about
the economy's prospects.
</P>
<P>
Respondents faring well financially were generally upbeat about
the economy's prospects.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Americans who recently lost a job and have trouble
paying credit card bills had a much bleaker view of the economy's
performance. They are more likely to underestimate the growth rate
and overestimate the unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
Among those who said they they had experienced more than four
economic problems in past years, nearly half described the U.S.
economy as "stagnating" or in recession.
</P>
<P>
One of many reasons for the sharply opposite views is the big
change of paychecks, the paper said. The annual paycheck of the
average chief executive at American companies now is 120 times
greater than that of the average production worker. It was 35
times the production wage in 1974.

<P>
ANKARA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP) is to send its representative Samir Abdul for talks on the
latest developments with the high-ranking officials of the
Turkish Foreign Ministry this afternoon, a spokesman from the
ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Omer Akbel, told reporters at a weekly press
conference that Turkey is closely following the situation in
northern Iraq where the KDP's rival the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) has retaken the city of Sulaimaniya.
</P>
<P>
Akbel expressed the hope that the fightings in northern Iraq
which broke out again between the KDP and PUK would end
immediately and the differences between the two parties would be
solved through peaceful means and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Turkey respects Iraq's territorial integrity,
sovereignty and independence.
</P>
<P>
Turkey will take necessary measures to secure the security
and economic interests on the border region linking northern
Iraq, said Akbel.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey is keeping in contact with both the KDP
and PUK on the situation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Northern Iraq has been split into rival zones since the KDP
and the PUK began fighting in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Microfinance Provides China with New Anti-poverty Weapon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China may spread the use of
microfinance in its anti-poverty drive if the experiment with the
micro-credit model is successful, said a government official in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Gao Hongbin, director of the State Council Leading Group for
Poverty Alleviation Office, told an ongoing workshop on Chinese
microfinance today that China must apply the micro-credit model
giving full consideration to its own national characteristics, and
cannot copy the Grameen Bank Model, which has greatly aided
poverty reduction in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
In microfinancing activities, microfinance institutions provide
consumption loans to poor households and production loans to small
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Though the practice of microfinance is still experimental in
China's poverty reduction strategy, ten microfinance projects have
been launched across China involving numerous world organizations,
including the World Bank and the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP), Gao said.
</P>
<P>
The largest of these projects, which has already started in the
Qingba mountainous areas in northwest China's Shaanxi Province,
will inject 400 million US dollars into microfinance, including a
World Bank loan of 200 million US dollars, according to a World
Bank official.
</P>
<P>
"The real value of microfinance lies in whether it can be
spread across the country and thereby play an important role in
China's poverty reduction goal," Gao said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day workshop has attracted large numbers of experts
in microfiance, who will discuss microfinance projects in China,
initial experiences in microfinance in the world and its prospects
as a new method for reducing poverty.
</P>
<P>
China has vowed to eradicate poverty by the end of this
century. At present, 65 million Chinese people are still living
under the poverty line.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein, Arafat Open Talks in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan and
visiting Palestinian Authority (PA) leader Yasser Arafat opened
talks here today on the latest impasse in the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis and the Palestinians have fallen out owing to
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's delay in implementing
the redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank town of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Arafat came to Jordan via King Hussein Bridge from the West
Bank earlier today.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at the bridge that he was in Jordan to meet
King Hussein and discuss issues of common concern about the
deadlocked implementation of the signed accords.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Palestinian-Israeli talks that are due to
resume Tuesday at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba, Arafat
said, "Israel was (is) still procrastinating."
</P>
<P>
The PA leader complained that the political, economic,
security and civil affairs committees which began talks earlier
had not yet come up with any positive results.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that because of Israel's hardline policies and
its lack of desire to break the deadlock in the negotiations, the
whole peace process in the region was facing more and more
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian president, who held talks with the Jordanian
monarch on the sidelines of the Washington summit earlier this
month, declined to comment on whether there would be a
possibility of holding a mini-summit in Jordan's southern port
city of Aqaba later which Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
Arafat himself and King Hussein might attend.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's advisor Nabil Abudani said the visit was aimed at
forging closer Jordanian-Palestinian coordination toward the
peace efforts in the region.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Amman, Arafat will pay a visit to
hospitals to see the Palestinians who were injured during the
last month's Palestinian-Israeli clashes.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader will conclude his visit Tuesday.

HARARE, October 14 (Xinhua) --The Value of Zimbabwe's

</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a series of talks with the Greek

Bilateral trade currently stands at some 100 million U.S.

<HEADLINE> SADC-EU Ministerial Conference Opens in Namibia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The second South African
Development Community (SADC) and the European Union (EU)
ministerial conference opened today in the Namibian capital
Windhoek, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
About 300 delegates from the 12 SADC and the 15 EU countries
attended the two-day conference, which is a follow up to the
Berlin conference in 1994 aimed to explore political dialogue and
exchange of ideas on how the two regional blocs can benefit from
each other, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at the opening session, Namibian Prime Minister
Hage Geingob called for expanded trade and investment among the
SADC countries.
</P>
<P>
Geingob said: ''We are not looking for handouts from friends,
but for an opportunity for effective and mutually beneficial
partnership.''
</P>
<P>
The SADC wanted to grow the bilateral trade with the EU and
hoped private sector investment from Europe in SADC region would
be accelerated, said Geingob.
</P>
<P>
The conference Chairman, Irish Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Dick Spring, said the EU would try to " be as
supportive as possible in the challenge facing SADC as it
integrated itself into the world economy".
</P>
<P>
SADC Executive Secretary General Kaire Mbuende said balanced
regional trade and higher investments flows towards southern
Africa could do much to reverse the current imbalances between
the regions.
</P>

<HEADLINE> World Makes Progress in Programs for Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali said here today that the world made great
progress in programs for children, especially in disease control.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the report on progress at mid-decade on
implementation of the General Assembly resolution on the World
Summit for Children six years ago, Boutros-Ghali noted the
greatest progress had been in control of preventable diseases.
</P>
<P>
Immunization continued to reach approximately 80 percent of all
children before their first birthday, up fourfold in little over
10 years and now saving one million young children every year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Polio had been eradicated from large parts of the world and,
with continued effort, this scourge should go the way of smallpox
by the year 2000 or shortly thereafter, he said.
</P>
<P>
Major progress had been made towards elimination of neonatal
tetanus; Guinea worm disease, which tormented and sapped the
energies of millions of people only five years ago, had declined
by 97 percent; use of oral rehydration had doubled over the last
five years and was saving one million children a year from
diarrhea, the second leading cause of child deaths; and some 1.5
billion more people were consuming iodized salt today than in
1990, protecting a big number of children from mental retardation,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned the progress in Vitamin A supplementation and
fortification to prevent blindness and immune system damage,
promoting breastfeeding, more access to safe water and higher
enrollment of school-age children.
</P>
<P>
However, the rate of child mortality reduction was still too
slow; maternal mortality was a bigger problem than it had been
previously thought; little improvement had been achieved in child
malnutrition; and the quality of basic education left much to be
desired, he noted.

<HEADLINE> U.S.To Assit West African Peacekeepers in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government has
expressed its willingness to assist countries wishing to send
troops to Liberia, a radio report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. special envoy for Liberia Ambassador Howard Jeters
assured the west African peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG that
the U.S.government is desirous to assist the force in many ways
it can, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Without the ECOMOG, Liberia's peace process would remain in
danger, the envoy said while exchanging views with ECOMOG Field
Commander Nigeria's Major-General Victor Malu in Monrovia,
capital of Liberia, over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
But the envoy did not elaborate the intended U.S. assistance
to ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Malu, however, reiterated the urgent need for additional
troops to enable the force to deploy more men into the interior
and undertake disarmament programs in accordance with the peace
agreement signed by Liberia's warring factions from next month.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace accord signed in Abuja, capital of
Nigeria, last August, disarmament and demobilization of the
warring factions in Liberia are scheduled to be finished before
the end of January next year, and a democratically elected
government will come to power on May 30, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Says Greek Cypriots Create Tension in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry
spokesman Omer Akber said today that the Greek Cypriots have
chosen a "policy of tension and provocation" instead of one of
negotiation and compromise.
</P>
<P>
Akber made the remarks at a weekly press conference in the
Foreign Ministry. He added that officials of northern Cyprus were
carrying out an investigation into the death of Greek Cypriot
Petros Kakoulides, who was shot dead Sunday for crossing 200
meters into northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said: "It is obvious that the provocative attitudes of the
Greek Cypriots on the island were effective in the saddening
incident."
</P>
<P>
"We hope that a tense atmosphere on the island could be
overcome soon," said the spokesman, adding, "Yet, recent
incidents have shown that the Greek Cypriot side preferred a
policy of tension with the promotion of Greece."
</P>
<P>
Akber pointed out: "The Greek Cypriot side, within the
framework of tension policies, continuously carried out a
campaign accusing Turks." "We sincerely believe that common sense
will prevail in the end and intercommunal talks would start to
find a satisfactory solution to the problem," he added.
</P>
<P>
On August 14, Turkish troops shot dead a Greek Cypriot
demonstrator as he tried to bring down the Turkish flag on the
edge of the northern Cyprus side.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place after the funeral of another Greek
Cypriot, Tassos Isaac, 24, who was beaten to death on August 11
in clashes between the Greek Cypriot demonstrators and Turkish
troops in the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 Turkish troops are stationed in northern
Cyprus and the soldiers are under strict orders to fire on
anyone crossing the Green Line dividing Cyprus into Turkish
Cypriot north and Greek Cypriot south.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been unofficially partitioned since Turkey sent
troops to take control of the northern third of the island in
1974 in the wake of an abortive coup by Greek Cypriots seeking
union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> OAU Cools Down U.S.Idea of Creating African Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Organisation of African
Unity (OAU) has been cool to the idea of creating an African
Peacekeeping force proposed by the United States Secretary of
State Warren Christopher who is currently visiting Africa.
</P>
<P>
OAU Assistant Secretary-General Ahmed Haggag said here today
that the regional body needs to consult widely with member states
and the United Nations on the details concerning the function of
a proposed western-backed African Crisis Force before any
commitments can be made.
</P>
<P>
In addressing some 40 southern African senior military
officers who are attending a two-week regional peace-keeping
course, the OAU official said while the United States, France and
Britain had offered to finance the African peacekeeping force,
many questions still remained unanswered.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for more information and wide-ranging
consultations on what Africa has to do, the modalities and
deployment of such a force and immediate payments for the
deployments," said Haggag.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who is on a five-nation African tour, has already
met with OAU officials and offered to provide support for a
10,000 strong inter-African force to intervene in conflicts under
the mandate of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"We will need to coordinate all the proposals that have been
made by the western countries and then consult with member
states," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the OAU had experienced difficulties in mobilisation,
logistics and funding of the African peace-keeping missions.
While the OAU has welcomed the proposal from the west, some
African countries have already expressed reservations over the
American proposal.

<HEADLINE> Greece Expresses Concerns over Situation in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Greece today expressed concern
over the situation in Cyprus following the killing of a Greek
Cypriot civilian by the Turkish side on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas condemned what he called
"a criminal act" and said the incident would "create tension in
the region."
</P>
<P>
Petros Kakoulis, a 58-year-old Greek Cypriot, had gone snail-
gathering with his son-in-law and mistakenly entered Turkish
Cypriot-controlled area. He was shot and killed by Turkish
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Reppas said Athens is cooperating and coordinating moves with
the Cyprus government in relation to Sunday's killing.
</P>
<P>
"The Greek government will work internationally to stress that
as long as the Cyprus issue remains unresolved it will be a hot
spot for the region", the spokesman said, adding that the Greek
government may raise the issue at Tuesday's meeting of EU foreign
ministry political directors in Brussels.

<HEADLINE> UK PM under Pressure over "Cash-for-Question" Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major today faces renewed pressure to allow an independent
investigation into claims that the government tried to suppress
inquiries into Parliamentary sleaze.
</P>
<P>
Commons Speaker Betty Boothroyd has told the House of Commons
the cash-for-question allegations against Neil Hamilton, the
former trade minister "must resolved as soon as possible".
</P>
<P>
"The reputation of the House has been called into question...As
speaker, I an bound to be concerned about that," the Speaker
added.
</P>
<P>
She said Sir Gordon Downey, the Parliamentary Commissioner for
Standards would be given extra staff if necessary to conduct an
investigation into the matter.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition parties, Labor and the Liberal
Democrats have jointly demanded a tougher inquiry into the
Parliamentary sleaze than that proposed by the government.
</P>
<P>
The investigation being conducted by Sir Gordon Downey did not
go far enough, they said.
</P>
<P>
It is understood Sir Gordon Downey believes he does not have
the powers to carry out for such an inquiry, as suggested by the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Tony Blair, the Labor leader, yesterday left open the option of
a no confidence vote when parliament returns today. "We'll have to
wait and see how the debate progresses. I don't rule anything
out," he said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the showdown could come if the
government resisted calls for a full, public inquiry into the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
These include the claim that David Willetts, then a Tory whip,
tried to influence a Commons committee investigating allegations
against Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
Many MPs regard this as more serious than the
cash-for-questions allegations.

<HEADLINE> Aqaba Gas Terminal Project to Go Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Jordan said Sunday that it was
not aware of any Israeli move to freeze a gas deal on building a
gas terminal at the southern port city of Aqaba, the
English-language daily Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Discussions on technical level with Qatar and Israel over the
gas terminal are continuing, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The report said the U.S. Enron Corporation which signed the
deal with Jordan was also told by Israel to go ahead with the
agreement, which was signed on the fringes of the Middle East and
North Africa Economic Summit held here in the Jordanian capital
of Amman last year.
</P>
<P>
The project involves two separate accords. Under one accord
signed with Qatar, the Enron Corporation will develop a gas field
in the Gulf emirate and market the output.
</P>
<P>
The second agreement calls for Israeli purchase of gas from
the U.S. firm worth two billion U.S. dollars every year.
</P>
<P>
Jordan will host a 300-million-dollar terminal at Aqaba to
store and process liquefied gas shipped from Qatar and pump it to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The terminal will be a joint venture, with Enron providing 50
percent of the project cost and Jordan and Israel 25 percent
each.
</P>
<P>
The reported Israeli move to freeze the project was said to
have stemmed from hardline Israeli Infrastructure Minister Ariel
Sharon.
</P>
<P>
The move reportedly came in retaliation for a Qatari
suspension of all moves to normalize relations with the Jewish
state until the government of Benjamin Netanyahu makes concrete
progress in its peace negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Officials here noted that Sharon was not authorized to take
any such decisions, given the limited powers to him by Netanyahu,
who reluctantly appointed him as cabinet minister under
political pressure in June.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Says Nuclear Disarmament Should Be Quickened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali said on Monday the world community should
quicken its movement towards nuclear disarmament with the
conclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which now
has attracted 124 signatures and one ratification.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the First Committee of the General Assembly as
it began its first day of deliberations, Boutros-Ghali said that
the treaty has not only increased the momentum towards nuclear
disarmament, but also stirred great expectations that
international security and stability can be assured.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the race to nuclear disengagement and disarmament
should become as relentless as was the nuclear arms race during
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
With regards to the next step towards a secure and stable
twenty-first century, he listed ratification of the Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty (START II), a cutoff of the production of fissile
material for weapons purposes, the entry into force of the
Chemical Weapons Convention and the expansion of the
nuclear-weapon free zones.
</P>
<P>
On a proposed Special Session of the General Assembly, he noted
that there is overwhelming support. That session could assess the
security situation in the post-Cold War era and set the
negotiating agenda for the years to come.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the disarmament of small arms, saying that
he will continue to strongly press for a total ban on
anti-personnel land-mines.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Deport Foreign Laborers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Jordan might deport guest
workers and impose bans on foreigners from several professions in
a bid to reduce unemployment in the kingdom, the English-language
daily Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Labor is considering deporting foreign workers
"very soon" to bring the number of foreigners working in the
kingdom down to 100,000 from the current estimated 400,000, a
source at the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
He added that new measures might be taken to ban foreign
workers from undertaking such jobs as engineering, nursing,
management, accounting, typing, education and hairdressing.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that unemployment among Jordanians is
nearly 15 percent, but unofficial estimates say that it is
reaching up to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Deportation and ban on foreign workers from some sectors
could "relieve the pressure on the national labor market," the
source said.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports here said the ministry planned to reduce the
number of foreign nurses at 40 private hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Competition between Jordanian and non-Jordanian workers
results in a generally low level of salaries, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
They added that such circumstances could hinder the approval
of a recent proposal to fix a minimum wage for Jordanian
workers.
</P>
<P>
However, a minimum wage would put Jordanians at a disadvantage
in the labor market, as employers could hire foreigners at a
lower cost, they said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Ministry of Labor released statistics in 1995
to suggest the need for urgent actions to check illegal workers.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Ends Visit to Angola, Failing to Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States Secretary of
State Warren Christopher today wrapped up his four-hour short
visit to Angola, failing to meet former rebel leader Jonas
Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
After a brief meeting with Angolan President Eduardo dos
Santos, Christopher told a press conference that it is
"imperative" that the rival factions in Angola to honor the peace
accord they signed.
</P>
<P>
"The international community will never tolerate any possible
resumption of conflict," said Christopher.
</P>
<P>
He also regretted the refusal by the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) leader to come to capital
Luanda to meet him. Savimbi had invited the U.S. secretary of
state to meet him at his military headquarters, citing personal
insecurity if he goes to the capital.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was rejected by Christopher who said it might
send a "wrong signal" to the world if he goes to Savimbi's
military base for talks.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Christopher sent his aide, George Moose, to the UNITA
base to meet Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
During talks with the Angolan president, Christopher expressed
the U.S. government's willingness to cooperate with Angola in
realizing the country's final peace and national economic
rebuilding, and President dos Santos pledged its commitment to
Angola's peace process.

<HEADLINE> Population Overgrowth in Africa Affects Per </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The discrepancy between
demographic growth and agricultural production in the past 20
years in Africa has resulted in the decline of per capita food
production, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said
today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement marking the World Food Day to be observed on
October 16, 1996, FAO said agricultural output grew at the rate
of about 1.9 percent a year in Sub-Saharan Africa between 1970
and 1990 with the region's population growth rate, one of the
highest in the world, averaged three percent.
</P>
<P>
The reason for this widening gap between nutritional needs and

according to the World Bank, rose from about 84 billion
U.S.Dollars in 1980 to 289 billion dollars in 1993.

Drought, diseases, pests, a lack of adequate irrigation,
fertilizer and other inputs and environmental degradation are
among the impediments that exacerbate the pressing conditions, it
added.

<P>
Armed conflicts have compounded the problem, it said, adding
that of the 32 million people who received assistance from the

of these, nearly two-thirds are victims of war and civil strife.

The statement quoted a report to the 19th FAO African regional
conference as saying that Unless adequate policy measures are
taken, with the utmost commit- ment and urgency on the part of
national governments and the international community,"the already
disastrous situation facing many countries risks reaching
unmanageable dimensions''.

According to the statement, agriculture is a key sector in
most African countries, employing about 63 percent of the labour
force and contributes 20 percent of the Gross Domestic Product of
the Sub-Saharan Africa. Eenditem

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Cashew Producers Urge To Retain High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's cashew pro-
cessing industry have appealed to parliament to retain a high
surtax on exports of raw cashewnuts, radio Maputo reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an appeal to the Planning and Budget Commission of the
parliament issued today in Maputo, the industry's officials
stressed the need to maintain the high tariff to protect the
cashew processing industry.
</P>
<P>
They said that without a high tax exports on raw nuts, the
processing plants fear that the bulk of the nuts will be exported
to India and not enough raw will be left for Mozambican
factories.
</P>
<P>
But the World Bank is forcing the Mozambican government to
open up the cashew nut industry by allowing free exports.
</P>
<P>
The country's surtax for the 1995-96 cashew season is 25
percent on exported raw nuts of up to 600 U.S.dollars a tonne,
and 70 percent on every dollar after this amount.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has objected this amount and forced the
government to reduce the tariff to just 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government is yet to announced the levy charges for the
1996-97 season, but the World Bank wants the tax reduced to 12
percent, eliminating the tax altogether by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Cashew nuts are one of Mozambique's major exports and the
country is the biggest cashew nuts exporter in Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's population growth
outpaces its economic growth, Minister of Information and
Broadcasting Services Amusaa Mwanamwambwa said here today.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the challenge to meet the goals of the
International Conference on Population and Development held in
Cairo in 1994 is daunting in the face of Zambia's annual
population growth of between 3.2 percent to 3.5 percent which is
massively outpacing the economic growth of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the current population of nine million will increase
to 12 million by the year 2000 and 24 million in the year 2025 if
the current growth rate is not checked.
</P>
<P>
This increase will be a great burden on the country's social
services, infrastructure, water and food, security and economic
development, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the rapid population increase for the unemployment,
lack of access to basic health services, declining life
expectancy and high child mortality rate.

<HEADLINE> Britain Wants to See Quick Implementation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A British high-ranking
official said that Britain wanted to see a quick implementation
of all agreements reached between the Palestinians and the
Israelis, reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The British Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth
Affairs with responsibility for the Middle East, Jeremy Hanley,
made the remark while speaking in Riyadh, capital of Saudi
Arabia, at a press conference at the end of his three-day visit
to the oil-rich kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Hanley said Britain was disappointed at the difficulties
facing the Mideast peace process and would work jointly with
other European Union countries to help achieve an early
implementation of the agreements and make progress as well on the
Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
Hanley arrived in Saudi Arabia Saturday on his first working
visit to the kingdom as Minister of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs.
</P>
<P>
During his stay there, he conferred with Emir of Riyadh Prince
Salman Ben Andel Aziz, Information Minister Fuad Faresi and Gulf
Cooperation Council Secretary General Jamil Al-Hojailan.
</P>
<P>
Their talks focused on the stalled peace process in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Besides, they also reviewed the whole gamut of regional and
international issues including the bilateral relations between
Saudi Arabia and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Trade exchange between the two countries in 1995 reached 5
billion U.S. dollars and there are 30,000 British nationals
working in Saudi Arabia now, the minister was quoted by the
Kuwait News Agency as telling the news conference.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are also signatories to the
multi-billion-dollar Al-Yamamah Defense Project including a
Saudi-British joint missile venture, signed in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hanley also asserted Britain is committed to
securing the stability of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Britain was one of the main Western countries taking part in
the U.S.-led anti-Iraq allied forces in 1991 which launched
Operation Desert Storm to drive the Iraqi occupation troops out
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Hanley is due to leave Saudi Arabia today to tour Kuwait and
Qatar.

<HEADLINE> Many African Countries Not Benefit From Uruguay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Many African countries have
not yet benefited from the Uruguay round multilateral trade
negotiations ever since the Uruguay Round was established in
1994, the Ugandan Minister of Trade and Industry said today.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Minister of Trade and Industry Henry Kajura made the
statement at the opening of a five-day African Carribean and
Pacific-European Union (ACP-EU) regional confernce on the Uruguay
Round results held here today.
</P>
<P>
The conference is organised by African, Carribean and Pacific
general secretariat, the Eruopean Commission and the World Trade
Organistion (WTO) secretary.
</P>
<P>
It is being attended by over 70 participants from Eritrea,
Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, Tanzania, Mauritius, Seychelles and
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Kajura observed that the successful conclusion of the Uruguay
Round in 1994 and the establishment of the World Trade
Organisation in 1995 were giant steps for trade and development and
responses to the challenges of the modern world which is also
marked by the progressive dismantling of protectionism.
</P>
<P>
He however noted that the Uruguay Round and other global
developments had offered little to the least developed countries
an opportunity and challenges to attract investment and expand
their exports.
</P>
<P>
World income is expected to rise by over 193 billion
U.S.Dollars annually by the year 2005, of which Africa is
expected to register a net loss of 0.2 percent of the GDP during
the period, Kajura disclosed.
</P>
<P>
He therefore called uplon the least developed countries to
understand the implication of the Uruguay Round before they
embark on implementation of the WTO agreement.
</P>
<P>
The first WTO ministerial meeting is scheduled to take place
mid December this year in Singapore to discuss more about the
issues reached at the African trade ministers'
international conference held in Tunis in October 1994.

MOSCOW, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov today hailed great prospects for Russian-Venezuelan
relations, saying that Moscow hopes to expand cooperation with
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
After his talks with his visiting Venezuelan counterpart Miguel
Burelli, Primakov told a news conference that "Russian-Venezuelan
relations have good prospects for development in the political and
economic field including the oil business."
</P>
<P>
He further stressed potential for bilateral cooperation in the
scientific and technological fields, where Russia "could provide
Venezuela with world-class technologies" and Venezuela, for its
part, could share its developments "at the forefront of world
progress in a number of fields, in particular as regards heavy oil
and its pipeline transportation."
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also exchanged views on a number of
international issues, including the situation in the Middle East,
Afghanistan and in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the need to seek normalization of relations between
Cuba and the United States as soon as possible, Primakov and
Burelli came out against the Helms-Burton law adopted by the
United States, which envisages tightening anti-Cuban trade and
economic sanctions, and called for step-by-step "removal of
irritants" in Cuban-U.S. relations.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Chief Confident of Timely End to Liberian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Field Commander of the west
African peacekeeping force operating in Liberia, known as ECOMOG,
said today he is confident of a timely end to the conflict in the
war-torn Liberia, despite the continued disorbedience of armed
factions.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement signed by Liberia's warlords last August
in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, for restoring peace in the country
"will not fall behind schedule," ECOMOG Commander, Nigeria's
Major-General Victor Malu told U.S. special envoy to liberia,
Ambassador Howard Jeter, according to a report reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, factional fighters should have disengaged
from checkpoints and combat positioins by August 31 to pave the
way for the disarmament and demobilizatiion of some 60,000
combatants between november this year and January next year.
</P>
<P>
However skirmishes have since continued between rival factions
in west and southeast Liberia, preventing the delivery of badly
needed aid to thousands of vulnerable citizens affected by the
nearly seven-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
Malu, however, assureed Jeter that "All skirmishes will stop
when ECOMOG deploys its forces fully in those most crisis-prone
areas," the report said.
</P>
<P>
He accused the leadership of some factions, "particularly the
Liberia council led by George Boley of not making enough effort
to explain the details of the Abuja Accord to their fighters,
(nor) enlisting their total cooperation for the success of the
accord."
</P>
<P>
Since the accord came into effect two months ago, Boley and
"general" Roosevelt Johnson of the Krahn wing of the United
Liberation Movement (ULIMO-J) have not visited their controlled
areas to educate their fighters about the peace deal, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report, the U.S. envoy told Malu that
the American government is desirous to assist ECOMOG in many ways
it could.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government is also willing to assist countries
wishing to send troops to ECOMOG, Jeter said, adding that
"Without ECOMOG, Lliberia's peace process would remain in
jeopardy."

<HEADLINE> No Date Set for Meeting with Arafat: Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said today that no date has yet been set for
his meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the comments to reporters after attending a
meeting of the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported earlier today that Netanyahu might hold a
third summit with Arafat as early as Wednesday in an effort to
break recent deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister said that his meeting with Arafat
would only take place at the final stage of the talks. He said
the two sides were trying to address the Israel's security
concerns, adding only with "good faith" could the talks succeed.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, Netanyahu admitted he shouldered the
responsibility for opening the second exit to the underground
archeological tunnel in east Jerusalem, which sparked last
month's bloody clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces,
killing more than 70 people.
</P>
<P>
But he defended his decision, saying that there had been
intelligence warnings against such Palestinian violence even
before the opening of the tunnel exit.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he not only regarded the Palestinian
policemen's shooting at Israeli soldiers as serious, but also
worried about the large number of them who carried weapons which
should have been confiscated by the Palestinian Authority (PA).
</P>
<P>
The hardline premier described the current Israeli-Palestinian
 peace talks as at "a sensitive stage," but declined to go into
details.
</P>
<P>
He added that there were still many other controversial issues
to be tackled, including Israeli troop redeployment from Hebron,
revising the anti-Israeli Palestinian Charter, confiscating the
large number of illegal weapons held by Palestinians and handing
over Palestinian "murderers" to Israel.
</P>
<P>
After this, Netanyahu said, he would agree to start the
final-status talks with the Palestinians, which will determine
the permanent status of the Palestinian territories. The
final-status talks firstly opened last May but have been frozen
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators today continued
informal consultations in order to create a better basis for
upcoming talks that were delayed for a day at the request of
U.S. envoy Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
Ross made the proposal in a bid to bridge the gap over the
Hebron issue to ensure the success of future talks. The central
dispute between the two sides remains that Israel insists on
additional security arrangements for the redeployment, while the
Palestinians demands the accurate implementation of the signed
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Chief negotiators on civilian affairs from both side toured
Hebron today to review the transfer of civilian powers to the PA
following Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank town, where
some 450 Jews live among 120,000 Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> French Communist Party "Indignant" over Judicial Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The French Communist Party (PCF)
expressed its "indignation" this evening over the launching by a
Paris court of judicial inquiries into its leader Robert Hue and
its former leader Georges Marchais over alleged "hiding of
influence peddling."
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Investigation Court of Paris said this evening
that its judge Laurence Vichnievsky last week investigated the
roles played by Hue and Marchais in a deal between the water
company Compagnie General des Eaux (CGE) and 70 towns governed by
the Communist Party in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Vichnievsky tried to find the final destination of more than 10
million francs (2 million U.S. dollars) in bills said to be paid
by the CGE to a research institute the SICOPAR, suspected to
belong to a clandestine financing system of the PCF.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued this evening, the PCF said that its
financial affairs are "transparent" and that the inquiry is a
"grave event."
</P>
<P>
"These simultaneous questionings make up the evidence of a
deliberate attack against the PCF and its press. They are
intolerable and cannot but raise the deepest indignation," said
the communique.
</P>
<P>
Together to have been investigated with Hue and Marchais is
Richard Beninger, the chief of the Communist Party newspaper
"L'Humanite," and Pierre Sotura, a member of the central committee
of PCF.
</P>
<P>
"The accounts of the PCF are public, deposited each year to the
competent official national commission... They try to attack a
political party and a newspaper which denounce the reign of money
above the French society," said the PCF.

LAGOS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Flood has hit about 500 families
and distroyed farm crops and animals worth millions of Naira in
east Nigeria's Adamawa State, the News Agency of Nigeria reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The flood followed the overflooding of some streams and rivers

</P>
<P>
According to the report, five districts were mostly affected
and houses, animals and farm products were washed away, together
with the road thereby making it difficult for vehicles to reach
the areas.
</P>
<P>
Currently victims of the flood reside in temporary camps set
up in primary schools, waiting for necessary assistance assured
by the local government.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency, a similar flood
disaster rendered 379 families homeless and destroyed property
worth 33 milliion Naira (about 413,000 U.S. Dollars) in the state
capital of Yola, while similar damages were also recorded in
another two areas 10 days ago.

<P>
JERUSALEM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel's rightwing Likud
government defeated an opposition's no-confidence vote in the
Knesset (Parliament) debates this evening.
</P>
<P>
The final vote was 49 in favor of the no-confidence motion put
forward by the Labor and the Meretz parties against Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and 55 against the motion.
</P>
<P>
Two Knesset members from the Moledet, a far-right party,
abstained. The Moledet usually supports the current hardline
government, but is reportedly unhappy about the negotiations
between the government and the Palestinian Authority right now.
</P>
<P>
Meretz Knesset faction chairman Haim Oron, who submitted the
motion, said, "This government has cut off (Yitzhak) Rabin's
road to peace, torn Jerusalem in two, and ignited the
territories."
</P>
<P>
Labor Knesset faction chairman Ra'anan Cohen called on all
opposition MKs to turn up for the vote.
</P>
<P>
This was the second no-confidence vote during the current
Knesset since the rightwing coalition assumed office in June.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the government, Foreign Minister David
Levy defended the government's policy, saying that the
negotiations with the Palestinians on Hebron redeployment could
be concluded in just a matter of days, not of weeks.
</P>
<P>
Despite the defeat, Labor MK Tael Dayan said that the
opposition will demand no-confidence votes every week until the
government changes its hardline policy toward peace with Arabs.

MOSCOW, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkmenistan's president
Saparmurat Niyazov, who is on an official visit here, said today
that he is against "any interference" in Afghan affairs.
</P>
<P>
After his talks with Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, Niyazov told reporters Turkmenistan's attitude
to the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We are against any interference in th conflict in Afghanistan
which we consider its domestic problem," Niyazov said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Turkmenistan had good neighborly relations
with the entire Afghan population, including Talibs. He said
Turkmens and Afghans had a common border, and Turkmenistan would
not meddle with Afghan domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Niyazov also said Turkmenistan intended to coordinate its
activities concerning the Afghan crisis with Moscow. According to
him, Chernomyrdin and he during today's talks had been able to
reach common approaches to the conflict in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The warring parties should sit down to the negotiating table
under the U.N. auspices. We do not quite share the (results of)
Alma-Ata (capital of Kazakhstan) summit on the Afghan crisis. We
believe that the conflict in Afghanistan is an Afghan domestic
affair," Niyazov said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he went to say, Turkmenistan intends to export five
trillion cubic meters of natural gas into Russia in 1997. Thus, it
plans to emerge on the world market together with Russia, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Niyazov and Chernomyrdin also discussed, during their talks,
the problem of Russia's gas debt to Turkmenistan, the Itar-Tass
news agency reported. But the problem was not settled today.

<HEADLINE> UK Managers Want Change of Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- More than half of Britain's
managers are discontented with the Conservatives' policy towards
Europe and call for a change of government, according to a survey
published today.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Institute of Management which has
70,000 members, shows that 56 percent of executives polled believe
that it is time for a change of government.
</P>
<P>
While 68 percent believe that the government's policies on
Europe have weakened Britain's position in the European Union
(EU), 72 percent believe that Tory party disagreements over Europe
are adversely affecting UK business in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"The survey shows that there is a great deal of disillusion
with the Tory government," said Mark Hastings, policy adviser at
the institute.
</P>
<P>
Although 74 percent said Tory policies have improved the UK's
competitiveness and about two-thirds trusted the government to
keep public borrowing, spending and inflation under control, 44
percent believe the Conservative party is now out of touch with
the needs of business.
</P>
<P>
Roger Young, director-general of the institute, said that
Europe is the key to Britain's long-term prosperity, and managers
are concerned that the Conservatives' approach to Europe is
damaging the UK's interests.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the result of the survey will undermine the
Conservative party's effort which they made at last week's party
conference to set aside differences over Europe for the sake of
unity.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Commonwealth
Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku today held the mass media
responsible for making too much negative reports of the
developing countries, especially Africa.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegates attending the biennial conference of the
Commonwealth Press Union in Cape Town, Anyaoku said: "Let us not
forget how damaging it can be to play up the negative aspects of
a situation, a country, a people or a religious viewpoint,
without presenting both sides of the story."
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku said it is already a tendency for the western media to
present a negative picture of the developing world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Commonwealth secretary general, who comes from
the West African country of Nigeria, also pledged to take a more
active role in moving against member states that clamped down
upon press freedom.

<HEADLINE> Weizman Leaves Egypt After Talks with Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
left here today after meeting with his Egyptian counterpart Hosni
Mubarak during a brief visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said Weizman assured him at their two-hour meeting
that Israel respected all the agreements already signed with the
Palestinian Authority (PA) and would implement them.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with Weizman following the
meeting, Mubarak also affirmed that Egypt would pursue its
endeavors until peace was established in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The president assured me they (Israeli government) are
honoring the agreements and they (the agreements) are going to be
 implemented," he said. "I told him that Egypt will continue to
support the peace process as much as we can ..."
</P>
<P>
Weizman, who arrived in Cairo earlier today, said that the
Israeli government intends to go forward with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that (Israeli) Premier (Benjamin) Netanyahu, like
us, wants to make an achievement in the peace process and
security," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As I have promised President Mubarak, the Israeli government
will continue to exert its utmost to realize peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's Cairo visit came at a time when the renewed
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have so far failed to achieve
tangible results and Egyptian-Israeli ties are deteriorating
because of Egypt's frustration over Israel's procrastination in
implementing the peace agreements it has already signed.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which has acted as a mediator between the Israelis and
the Arabs, has repeatedly urged the Jewish state to honor all its
 agreements signed with the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the long-delayed redeployment of Israeli troops in
Hebron, the last West Bank town still under Israeli occupation,
the Israeli president said that "it is better late than never."
</P>
<P>
Israel has been seeking amendments to the agreement on the
redeployment of forces in Hebron, citing security concerns.
</P>
<P>
The PA, however, rejected Israel's demand to alter the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, asked if he was to meet Netanyahu soon, said the
meeting could take place when the issue of Hebron is solved.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Time magazine to be published today,
Mubarak accused the Israeli prime minister of derailing peace
efforts by reneging on agreements to pull the Israeli army out of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference before Weizman's departure, Mubarak
indicated that he hoped Weizman could influence Netanyahu to
change his hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
"Today, we discussed the most appropriate solutions to current
problems so that Weizman may convey them to the Israeli
government," Mubarak said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- East and Central Africa's
Sanctions on Burundi are "selective and not intended to cause
trouble for the people", Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said
here today.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference, Museveni said the sanctions were
intended to put pressure on Burundi's military regime led by
Major Pierre Buyoya to move quickly to solve crises in the
ethnic-stricken country which is at the verge of a civil war.
</P>
<P>
Museveni commended the collective action by the leaders
of the region, who had gathered in Tanzania's northern town of
Arusha to take common stance on the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He said positive results have already shown in the month-long
economic sanctions and transport embargo on Burundi, citing the
willingness of the Buyoya government to restore the parliament
and to lift the ban on political activities.

<HEADLINE> No Progress on Solution of Georgian/Abkhaz Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali said today no significant progress had yet
been achieved on a comprehensive political settlement of the
Georgian/Abkhaz conflict in spite of continuous efforts made by
the international community.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, Boutros-Ghali noted that
the key unresolved issues remained the future political status of
Abkhazia and the return of refugees and displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
Since its independence on April 9, 1991 from the former Soviet
Union, Georgia has been plagued by social unrest and sometimes
fierce fighting mainly in Abkhazia as the local authorities have
attempted to separate from Georgia. As a result of the lasting
conflicts, 300,000 Georgian citizens have been expelled from the
territory of Abkhazia and thousands more have been shot dead,
burned alive, hanged or tortured to death, according to Irakli
Menagarishvili, foreign minister of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Though the two sides reached a cease-fire agreement on
September 3, 1992 in Moscow, the agreement was never fully
implemented. The United Nations has carried out peacemaking
efforts through consultations with the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, appointing a special envoy of the
secretary-general and establishing an observer mission in August
1993.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. secretary-general said lawlessness continued to be a
serious problem in the Gali security zone and cases of murder,
armed robbery, kidnapping and assault occurred frequently, while
the situation in the Kodori Valley had improved markedly.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia, which consisted
of 117 officers now, had to limit its patroling of the Gali sector
because of the mine threat, the secretary-general said.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali asked his special envoy to visit the region and
assess the situation with representatives of both sides and with
the Russian Federation before he considers the steps to be taken
to reinvigorate the peace process.

establishment of economic unity between the two countries as well
as joint investments.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Ratib al Shallah emphasized the importance of
implementing the economic and social agreement between Syria and
Lebanon, while Adnan Qassar spoke about the need for economic
integration between the two countries in conformity with
political integration.
</P>
<P>
Shibly Abu Fakhr underlined the necessity of adopting
practical steps for the implementation of the economic and social
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>

economic relations to the level of bilateral political ties, the
mobilization of all potentials for this purpose, and the
promotion of distinguished bilateral economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Following items on the agenda, the participants approved the
internal statutes of the Syrian-Lebanese Supreme Council as well

company, a holding company, and agreed on the formation of the
related technical committees.
</P>

on the establishment of a Syrian-Lebanese common market. They
agreed to hold the conference in Damascus early next March.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 30 percent of
marketmaking jobs in the City have been cut and another 20 percent
are likely to go with improvements in computer technology, the
Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Although the introduction of computer technology, especially
the new "order-driven" system for share trading, will allow
investment banks to reduce staff costs, their spending on
information technology is increasing and margins are expected to
fall.
</P>
<P>
This explains why several investment banks resisted the
introduction of the new system which will match up buy and sell
orders through a computer network and reduce the need for
marketmakers to communicate on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the six major investment banks in London,
whose tradings account for more than half of the volume of
transactions, have recently reduced their staff levels from a
total 245 to 175.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several senior managers say that a UK marketmaking
operation will need no more than 20 staff in the longer run, which
imply a total of about 120 for the six investment banks, half the
former level.

<HEADLINE> US Calls on Warring Kurds to Stop Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
urged two rival Kurdish factions in northern Iraq to stop fighting
upon a time when one group recaptured part of territory lost to
the Iraqi-backed group last month.
</P>
<P>
The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) has regained control of
the three Kurdish provinces of Sulaimaniyah, Arbil and Kirkuk that
had been captured by the Iraqi-backed Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP), a PUK spokesman said in London today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said, "We are
calling on both the PUK and KDP to end the fighting. We don't
believe Kurdish interests will be promoted by a continuation of
fighting between them."
</P>
<P>
Burns said U.S. officials had been in touch with both Kurdish
factions, trying to make peace between them.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the KDP asked Iraqi troops to help them drive the
PUK out of most of northern Iraq, the West-imposed Kurdish
enclave, which provoked the United States to launch missile
attacks on Iraqi air defense installations.
</P>
<P>
After the air strikes, the United States invited a KDP
delegation to Washington for talks in an attempt to curb Baghdad's
influence in the region.
</P>

The KDP delegation arrived in Turkey today on its way to
meeting with U.S. officials in Washington, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Bill to Use Military Plane to Fight Wildfires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today signed a bill to allow the Pentagon to sell military
aircraft to private Forest Service contractors for use in battling
wildfires.
</P>
<P>
The Forest Service's current fleet of 39 air-tankers include a
variety of planes dating to World War II and the Korean War. The
fleet was insufficient in fighting against wildfires in the
western U.S. wildfires this year.
</P>
<P>
The fires, the worst in four decades as Clinton called, have
destroyed about 4.5 million acres (1.87 million hectares) of
forests.
</P>
<P>
"We can't tolerate a situation where any firefighter is unable
to protect the public or themselves because of a lack of
equipment, especially the air tankers that can muster such force
and power to fight fires," Clinton said in signing the bill in
Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he is preparing for his second and
final debate against Bob Dole, Republican presidential nominee.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests New Killing by Turkish Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today protested to the
five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council against
Turkish troops' killing of a Greek Cypriot refugee Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides summoned today the
ambassadors of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council in Nicosia, protesting the new killing, the fourth in
four months.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened Sunday when Petros Kakoulli, 58, a
retired fireman from the Turkish-occupied village of Lefkoniko,
was collecting snails with his 27-year-old son-in-law Panikos
Hadjiathanasiou.
</P>
<P>
He was reported to have erred in crossing into the
Turkish-controlled area and was shot and killed by Turkish
soldiers in Achna village, near the British base area of
Dhekelia.
</P>
<P>
His body was removed four hours after the killing and was
taken to the hospital of the Turkish-controlled town of
Famagusta. The body was handed over to the Cypriot authorities
this afternoon through the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Michaelides told the press after his meeting with the
ambassadors that this was not an isolated incident but part of a
series of criminal acts by the Turkish troops, which aim to
discourage those who are interested in a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
He said apart from Kakoulli's son-in-law there was another
eyewitness, a Cypriot policeman at the British base.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he discussed the issue over a phone call
with his Greek counterpart Theodoros Pangalos. He will have
another telephone conversation with Pangalos later today to
coordinate action.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides said the latest incidents underline the need to
intensify efforts for a solution to the Cyprus problem. "All
those who are interested in a solution must multiply their
efforts," he added.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman
said today it is evident that the Greek Cypriots have chosen a
policy of tension and provocation instead of one of negotiation
and compromise.
</P>
<P>
He also said officials of northern Cyprus were carrying out an
investigation into the death of the Greek Cypriot.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to
take control of the northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
A 180-kilometer-long buffer zone has separated the island
into two parts and the people from both sides are forbidden to
cross the Green Line.
</P>
<P>
In July, Turkish soldiers shot and killed an unarmed Greek
Cypriot National Guards man in the U.N. buffer zone in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
In August, two Greek Cypriot youths were also killed during
an anti-occupation demonstrations.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Efforts should be made to
establish a network that provides legal services for the disabled,
State Councillor Peng Peiyun urged here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national meeting on legal issues which affect the

framework, especially for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
Peng lauded the meeting as a concrete action to promote
socialist ethical and cultural progress, which was the focus of
the just-concluded Sixth Plenum of the 14th Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
"We should make every effort to set up a legal network for the
handicapped to help them get legal services in the nearest

<HEADLINE> Israeli Banker Warns of Economic Downturn from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 15 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli banker has
warned that economy in the country will suffer a severe
downturn, if the peace process does not get back on track,
according to a report of The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
Badine Baudot-Trajtenberg, head of international marketing of
securities at Bank Hapoalim, was quoted by the paper as saying
that the effect of a stalled peace process is likely to be felt
most in investments in securities portfolios, rather than in
direct investments.
</P>
<P>
Baudot-Trajtenberg, who is also a senior vice-president of
the leading Israeli bank, said, "The (changing) politics of
Israel are often an impediment."
</P>
<P>
Before the peace agreement signed with the Palestinians in
1993, foreign investments amounted to about 500 million
U.S. dollars per year. In 1994, it rose to 2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
While the peace process changed perceptions of Israel in the
world, Baudot-Trajtenberg added, "Israel still has a stigma."
</P>
<P>
Israeli business executives are still welcomed in the United
States, but this is not the case in Europe, she said, adding,
"The politics of today can affect a meeting planned for a week
from now."
</P>
<P>
The decline in tourism has implications for other sectors of
the economy, too, the Hapoalim executive said.
</P>
<P>
She said many tourists are potential investors, and the
drastic drop in tourism has found an echo in investment.
</P>
<P>
"The business climate is extraordinary sensitive to political
developments here. If Israel is not a safe place to visit, they
postpone the investment," the banker said.

GUANGZHOU, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A total of 802 overseas
investors were rewarded by the provincial government of Guangdong
at a conference today for their outstanding contributions to local
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng met the delegates together with Vice-Premier Li
Lanqing. The provincial Party chief Xie Fei and Governor Lu Ruihua
also spoke at the event.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding overseas investors were selected according to
their actual investment, annual exports and profits.
</P>
<P>
Since China began the reform and opening policies in the late
1970s, the southern province has enjoyed rapid economic growth, at
an average annual rate of 14.2 percent, and with its gross
domestic product (GDP) increasing from 18.47 billion yuan in 1978
to last year's 544 billion yuan.
</P>

The total foreign trade volume of Guangdong in the past 17
years stood at 382.34 billion US dollars, increasing by 27.86

<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Shen Guofang today asked countries concerned to stay
alert about Taiwan authorities' separatist activities in the
international community.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan authorities, who have ulterior political
motives, have engaged in activities recently to promote the
acceptance of "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" by every
possible means.
</P>
<P>
They are attempting to separate Taiwan from the motherland by
destroying the relations between China and those countries which
have diplomatic ties with China, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said he hopes that countries concerned stay alert
about the political scheme of the Taiwan autorities in order to
prevent any adverse influence on their bilateral relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks here this afternoon in response
to reports by the media in Taiwan alleging that a communique of
"mutual recognition" between "The Republic of China" and Fiji has
been signed.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the Chinese ambassador to Fiji recently demanded
clarification from the Fiji side on the alleged communique of
"mutual recognition" with the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to the Fiji side, he said, Fiji has never signed such
an agreement with Taiwan, nor has it recognized Taiwan as a
"sovereign state" or "official government."
</P>
<P>
Shen noted that the Fiji government has reaffirmed to adhere to
the principles set in the joint communique on the establishment of
diplomatic relations between Fiji and China, as well as its "one
China" policy. It also recognizes the government of the People's
Republic of China as the only legitimate government representing
the whole China and it will not forge "diplomatic" ties with
Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> 5 Arrested in Pakistan for Forging Directives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Federal
Investigation Agency (FIA) has arrested five people who ran a
lucrative business by issuing forged directives of Prime Minister
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Additional Director General of FIA, Abdul Rehman Malik, told a
press conference here today said the accused include Major
(retired) Tahir Qaiser Qureshi, one retired Lieutenant Colonel
whose name will be made known later.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Divisional Engineer of Telephones, Zahid Mian Bhutto,
a diary and despatch clerk in PM Secretariat, Rustam Sahitu, and
an official from state-owned Oil and Gas Development Company,
Bahadur Ali were also arrested in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Malik said these criminals were carrying this business for one
and a half years.
</P>
<P>
Giving details of their activities, Malik disclosed that Tahir
prepared the samples of various utility items and wrote a
directive from PM secretariat to the Managing Director of the
state-run Utility Stores Corporation (USC) to purchase the items
on escalated prices, bringing huge profits to him.
</P>
<P>
The USC director found the prices unfeasible and sent the
letter back to the PM Secretariat, asking for review.
</P>
<P>
The concerned officials found no record of the letter with
forged signatures and referred it to the FIA.
</P>
<P>
The FIA, registering the case, started the investigations and
arrested the involved.
</P>
<P>
The accused were also involved in a number of other criminal
activities of the same nature, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Malik said the money the accused earned from this business has
not been calculated but it runs into millions of rupees.
</P>
<P>
He said, it is a criminal case and has no political
ramifications.
</P>
<P>
Most of the arrests were made from Islamabad. FIA hopes to
make more arrests in this regard.
</P>
<P>
No officer of the PM secretariat was found involved, said
Malik.

<HEADLINE> Arab Journalists Asked to Keep Their Distance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The International Arab
Journalists Federation called upon all the Arab press syndicates
to halt any steps toward normalizing relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based federation said it is concerned that some
journalists from a number of Arab countries have violated the
decision not to normalize relations with Israel until a just and
comprehensive peace is realized and all Arab legitimate rights
are restored, according to a Middle East News Agency (MENA)
report, citing a release issued today.
</P>
<P>
The journalist group noted that some journalists had visited
Israel and even had talks with Israeli officials under different
pretexts.
</P>
<P>
"This could be a serious precedent that could undermine the
Arab stand to boycott Israel due to its intransigent policies,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The release warned that the practice could eventually lead to
the failure of the Arab boycott.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Headway in Developing Renewable Energy Resources (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- China has made important
achievements in exploiting and utilizing alternative and renewable
energy resources, with the annual consumption of these energies
equal to 450 million tons of coal.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Conference on China-European Union Energy
Cooperation which closed here today, Shi Dinghuan, a senior
official with China's State Science and Technology Commission,
noted that with the rapid economic development in China, the
nationwide demand for energy keeps growing.
</P>
<P>
He said that China gives top priority to the development of
alternative and renewable energy resources, along with its
vigorous efforts to produce coal, electricity, petroleum and
nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
And China has finally achieved satisfactory results in the
development and utilization of mini-hydropower and solar, wind,
geothermal and tidal energy resources.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official told the EU officials and experts that
China's present total installed capacity of small hydropower
plants has reached 16.2 million kw nationwide, and over 88 percent
of the country's rural households use electricity.
</P>
<P>
Mini-hydropower, one of the most effective energy sources
available in rural areas, plays an important role in promoting
electrification in the country's vast countryside. At present, 300
counties in China have realized primary electrification
levels.

<HEADLINE> 80th China Export Commodity Trade Fair Opens (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The 80th China Export
Commodity Trade Fair, which opened here today, has received
congratulative inscriptions from President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li
Peng, CPPCC Chairman Li Ruihuan and Vice-President Rong Yiren.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Pent cut the ribbon at the opening ceremony and
described the fair as the largest and most famous in China.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the opening ceremony were CPC Central Committee
Politburo Member and Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, CPC Central
Committee Politburo Member and provincial Party chief Xie Fei, NPC
Standing Committee Vice-Chairperson Chen Muhua and CPPCC National
Committee vice-chairmen Henry Ying Tung Fok and Ma Wanqi.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that in the past 40 years, the fair has played
a significant role in the development of China's foreign trade,
the country's trade cooperation with other countries and regions,
and the reform and opening drive.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China's foreign trade has made remarkable
achievements in the past 40 years, especially since the country
adopted the reform and opening line in the late 70s. China has
ranked high among the largest trading countries in the world, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The development of foreign trade has brought funds, advanced
technology and management experience, and also increased
employment opportunities and pushed forward the country's economic
development, the premier noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's rapid economic development has laid a sound
foundation for the growth of the foreign trade sector, which has
inevitably become an important part of the national economy and
will play an increasingly bigger role.
</P>
<P>
Li held that in the next 15 years, China will maintain a good
development trend, the country's import and export volumes are
expected to increase at a relatively high speed, and more overseas
investors will come to the country because of its political
stability, social progress and constantly improving investment
environment.
</P>
<P>
"We have predicted that by 2000, the total foreign trade volume
will amount to 400 billion, while keeping a balance between
imports and imports," he said. "Therefore, China will provide a
vast market to all the other countries in the world."

The official said that solar energy has been popularized to a
considerable extent. The annual production capacity of household
solar heat facilities amounts to 800,000 sq m, and the nationwide
application of solar energy covers four million sq m. China
presently produces solar energy equal to 900,000 tons of coal a
year.
</P>
<P>
Great progress has also been made in the utilization of other
renewable energy resources: the utilization of geothermal energy
is comparable to six million tons of coal; the installed capacity
of wind turbines exceeds 30 MW; the installed capacity of
geothermal power exceeds 25 MW, and more than 100 million kwh is
generated annually; and the installed capacity of tidal power
reached six MW, with annual electricity generation hitting 100
million kwh.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the alternative and renewable energy
resources cause slight or no environmental pollution, constitute
the country's urgently-needed supplementary energy resources and
are playing great roles in promoting rural social and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
In light of the country's program of developing alternative and
renewable energy resources, the goal in the next 15 years is to
improve efficiency of energy conversion, cut down production costs
and widen the margin of renewable energy, taking into account the
country's energy system.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, the total renewable energy utilization will be equal
to 600 million tons of coal, the Chinese official announced.

Li stressed that since China is currently building a socialist
market economy, its foreign trade sector must also be reformed by
setting up a plural dealership system in order to meet the
requirements for economic restructuring and fierce competition in
the international market.
</P>
<P>
He called on Chinese export-oriented enterprises to produce
high-quality, competitively-priced goods that can meet the demands
of the international market.
</P>
<P>
An widely-varied industrial system has been established in
China, which is capable of manufacturing various automotives,
machines, electronic products, mechanical engineering equipment
and whole-set equipment for power generating, metallurgical,
chemical and construction industries, Li said.
</P>
<P>
China will provide buyer's credits as necessary funds for
exporting the country's whole-set equipment, which will be major
change for the export of Chinese-made export commodities, he
noted. He asked foreign countries, especially overseas business
people who have attended the fair in past years, to take notice of
this change.
</P>
<P>
Li called the mushrooming of various kinds of large-scale trade
fairs held in big cities an example of the booming foreign trade
in China.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the consistent good trend in China's economic
development this year, Li told his audience to note that while
having maintained rapid economic growth, the country's inflation
rate has been greatly reduced.
</P>
<P>
Although severe natural disasters have devastated some regions
this year, the country as a whole has reported a good harvest,
which has provided more favorable conditions for China's economic
development, and for deepening of the reform and further opening
next year, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Li referred to the recently-closed Sixth Plenary Session of the
14th CPC Central Committee, saying that to promote both material
progress and ethical and cultural progress is the fundamental goal
of building socialism with China's characteristics. The two are
completely complementary and neither could be omitted, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Along with the strengthening of ethical and cultural progress,
China will provide a better investment environment to overseas
business people and further boost the development of the foreign
trade sector, Li said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, met with a delegation from the Tio Chew Association of
Thailand led by its Chairman Chulit Jivamongkol here today, saying
that the achievements that China has made are universally
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the visitors on the Sixth Plenum of the 14th Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) which closed here
on October 10, Li said that China's overall domestic situation is
good, its society is stable, the economy is growing steadily with
the inflation rate decreasing, and the country is expected to reap
a bumper harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
Of course, Li said, there still exist some problems which
cannot be overlooked, such as prostitution and gambling, and
difficulties in social security and social order.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Resolutions of the Central Committee of the
CPC on Certain Important Questions on Promoting Socialist Ethical
and Cultural Progress call on the whole party to strengthen the
promotion of ethical and cultural progress while encouraging
material progress, and preventing and curbing the spread of
decadent practices and ideology.
</P>
<P>
Li said that as long as people throughout the country work hard
together, earnestly promoting ethical and cultural progress,
society's downturn will change, and the goal of turning China into
a strong, democratic and civilized modern country is bound to be
realized.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about whether promoting ethical and
cultural progress will affect China's reform and opening to the
outside, Li said that to eliminate the influence of the decadent
things is to create a good environment, and this will help move
the reform and opening up in the healthy direction.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, such worries are unnecessary, he said.
</P>
<P>
This is Chulit's fourth visit to China, and he said he hoped
that the Chinese side will assist overseas Chinese in educational
areas, especially in training them to speak Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, composed of leaders of an association of
counties in Tio Chew, arrived here on October 13 as guests of the
Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council.

<HEADLINE> Peres Blames Netanyahu for Four Mistakes in Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres has accused his successor Benjamin Netanyahu of
having made four mistakes in his policy toward the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French daily Le Figaro published
today, Peres, who narrowly lost to Netanyahu in the May election
for prime minister's seat, said that although he was defeated in
the election, he was still ready to fight for peace until 2000,
the next election year in the country.
</P>
<P>
"God has given me an excellent health and a balanced character,
which is very useful in politics. I devote myself until 2000,"
said Peres.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Israeli right-wing has adopted an erroneous
line which does not "have the smallest chance to succeed".
</P>
<P>
"First of all, they think that they can have peace for
nothing. Peace should be exchanged for peace. I know from my
experience that one can have nothing by giving nothing. The best
the government (of Netanyahu) will obtain is a state of no-peace
in exchange for its no-peace policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the second mistake Netanyahu made was that he thought
Israel can have security before having peace.
</P>
<P>
"In my view, it is just the other way round: Only peace can
bring security. It is absurd to ask for one without offering the
other," said Peres.
</P>
<P>
He said Netanyahu made the third mistake by trying to slow down
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Peres pointed out that the peace process in the Middle East is
just like a horse-racing: If one does not push forward the horse
of peace, the others will push forward the horses of Islamic
fundamentalism, terrorism and non-conventional arms race.
</P>
<P>
He said that by delaying the peace process, as Netanyahu is
trying to do, one cannot "in any sense win the time because the
time is being counted".
</P>
<P>
Peres finally rapped Netanyahu for insisting that the permanent
solution to the Palestinian territories is "a generous autonomy".
</P>
<P>
"But the autonomy should be a step, not a definitive solution.
I don't think that the Palestinians see the agreements concluded
as an act of generosity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Peres said that he is especially worried about the state of
"no-peace" in the Middle East, which he said could lead to
terrorism, international isolation of Israel, race of armaments,
and war.
</P>
<P>
"In the world today, one can find many `sponsors' for a new war
in the Middle East," he added.

<HEADLINE> Progress Achieved on Ulster Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's main parties
agreed early today on an agenda for the start of substantive
negotiations, marking the first breakthrough in four months of
wrangling.
</P>
<P>
The deal hammered out by the two larger parties, the Ulster
Unionist Party and the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour
Party (SDLP), means that serious dialogue can now begin in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The talks participants would commence substantive consideration
of the agenda later in the day, said an official from the British
Northern Ireland Office.
</P>
<P>
The talks group all Northern Ireland's pro-British and
pro-Irish parties except Sinn Fein, excluded because of the
refusal of its Irish Republic Army (IRA) guerrilla allies to
restore a 17-month cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, also told
reporters that as a result of this agreement, there would be
substantive discussion on decommissioning at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Participants said a breakthrough was made possible by agreement
among seven out of nine parties on how to tackle the surrender of
arms held by guerrilla groups, an issue which has dogged the peace
process for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Political observers believe the Ulster Unionists appear to have
compromised on the question of decommissioning of the IRA's
terrorist arms.
</P>
<P>
Weapons would no longer have to be handed in as a first
priority, and the issue would be discussed after parties set out
their general position, they add.
</P>
<P>
However, the issue remained theoretical because both the IRA
and loyalist guerrillas have said disarmament can only take place
as part of an overall settlement reconciling pro-British Unionist
and Irish nationalists.

<HEADLINE> Ebola Strikes Again in Gabon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) today confirmed that Ebola virus is responsible for an
outbreak of hemorrhagic fever raging a few weeks ago in
northeastern Gabon.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen people were infected by the virus and 10 of them were
in critical conditions, according to the WHO report.
</P>
<P>
This is the second Ebola virus outbreak in the Ogooue-Ivindo
province of the African country. Last February, the virus claimed
21 lives and caused 16 other infections.
</P>
<P>
A hunter might be the first infected in the recent outbreak,
according to the Gabonese Health Ministry. The hunter probably
got infected in the forest. He died on August 23 in a Boue local
hospital after falling ill a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The last suspected victim of Ebola infection died on October 8,
said a WHO press release.
</P>
<P>
The Ebola virus is transmitted among people through contact via
contaminated blood, secretions of body fluids, contaminated
needles and syringes.
</P>
<P>
The virus became known to men in the 1970s. No vaccine or
medicine is so far available against it, which kills 80 percent or
more of the infected people.
</P>
<P>
Last year, an Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Zaire caused 245
deaths among 316 infections.

<HEADLINE> Events Held to Mark "Long March" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 800 people gathered
together today in Beijing's Great Hall of the People to be briefed
with the results of a series of events held to mark the 60th
anniversary of the famous Long March.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, and also
Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
(CPPCC), as well as Yang Shangkun, the former president of China,
attended the gathering.
</P>
<P>
This year is the 60th anniversary of the victory of the Long
March by the Red Army, led by Chairman Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
Sixty years back, the Red Army, led by the Communist Party of
China (CPC), covered 12,500 km, trekking through more than a dozen
provinces and municipalities, and became strong through this great
feat.
</P>
<P>
A special committee, which is responsible for the organization
of the series of commemoration events, entitled "Long March --
Century's Monument", was set up in October last year.
</P>
<P>
So far it has done much work to mark the 60th anniversary of
the march, including the shooting of a 12-part TV program, and
another six-part TV documentary, the holding of a major exhibition
of poetry and paintings, as well as a cultural and recreational
evening party.
</P>
<P>
The commemoration events helped introduce the Long March spirit
of the CPC members, and have produced a positive effect for
teaching trans-century young people the fine tradition of being
firm in their beliefs and arduous struggle, as well as for
promoting the socialist ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
To promote economic development of western areas traversed by
the Red Army 60 years ago, the organizing committee also held an
international seminar for the development of west China. It
introduced more people around world to learn more about the
western regions.
</P>
<P>
The two-day commemoration event was initiated by more than 30
organizations, including the Development and Research Center under
the State Council, and the All China Federation of Trade Unions.

cooperative ties with the CPC and to contribute to the growing
bilateral relations.

<P>
TEHRAN, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran's leftist camp, which was
once dominant in the parliament, has vowed to revive itself in
the political scene again in a bid to compete for the presidential
elections in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Today's local press published a statement by the Mehdi
Karrubi, head of the Society of Combatant Clergymen (SCC), who
declared that his group decided to resume their political
activities.
</P>
<P>
SCC lost last year's parliamentary elections because of stiff
opposition in the influential and conservative Guardians Council.
Under the tremendous pressure, it finally decided not to
introduce any candidates.
</P>
<P>
A source close to SCC said that the group was originally
planning to launch a campaign for Mir-Hossein Mousavi, Iran's
war-time prime minister, but since Mousavi had not shown enough
interest, They would have to choose another candidate.
</P>
<P>
However, the source declined to comment on who would be a
likely SCC candidate in the absence of Mousavi.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Firms Allowed to Trade Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on the launching of the new Business
Times Singapore Regional Index (SRI), Hu said the move, in line
with the Monetary Authority of Singapore's policy to allow the
gradual internationalization of the Singapore dollar, is part of
the sweeping measures to attract more foreign listings on the
Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES).
</P>
<P>
Currently, foreign companies seeking listing here have to
denominate their shares in foreign currencies, mainly in the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the foreign firms which intend to list on the
SES must be incorporated in Singapore and have at least two years'
operating track record here and they must comply with the SES
requirements governing the listing of foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Singapore holding companies must have
operational headquarters or finance and treasury centers based in
Singapore and the senior management responsible for managing the
business of the listed company are located in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the listed firm must have more than 35 percent of its
revenue, profits or expenses attributable to its Singapore
operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Those companies which have listed their shares on the SES and
meet these criteria for a Singapore dollar listing will also be
permitted to issue Singapore dollar bonds under suitable
conditions where the majority of the proceeds raised are used for
their Singapore operation, he said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Bourse Index Down over Finance Minister's Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The stock exchange of Thailand
(SET) today reacted negatively to the resignation of Finance
Minister Bodi Chunnananda.
</P>
<P>
The SET index today slid 12.97 points from Monday to close at
905.34 points, dropping further below the July 1993 level and was
near the 900 psychological barrier.
</P>
<P>
The news of Bodi's resignation broke out on Monday only after
the bourse closed, otherwise SET index could have plummeted on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bodi, who was in office for only five months and would have
only slightly over a month before a new government is formed
following the November 17 election, said he quit for 'personal
reasons'.
</P>
<P>
However, sources linked his resignation to caretaker prime
minister Banharn Silpa-Archa's annoyance at the ministry's
decision last week to cut the fiscal 1997 budget by 2.54 percent
from 984 billion baht (39.36 billion US dollars) to 959 billion
baht (38.36 billion dollars) in anticipation of a revenue
shortfall.
</P>
<P>
The budget cutback is seen as a slap in the face of the
Banharn-led government as it showed the government's inefficiency
in revenue collection.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Hussein Hold First Meeting in Jericho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein, on
his first visit to the West Bank of Jericho in 29 years, met today
 with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a symbolic show of
solidarity.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders flew in two helicopters to the West Bank town
of Jericho from the Jordanian capital of Amman, where they held a
summit Monday to discuss the current deadlock in the
Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
A long line of Palestinian dignitaries greeted Arafat and the
king, who went into talks after reviewing the Palestinian guard
of honor.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Arafat thanked the
king for making the visit at a "difficult time." The monarch
replied that he hoped to encourage the peace process by
supporting the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the stalement in Israeli-Palestinian talks over
Israel's troop pullback from the West Bank town of Hebron,
both leaders stressed that Hebron redeployment was vital to the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat dismissed Israel's security excuse for its insistence
on changing security arrangements in Hebron. "If you don't
trust the joint patrol units, if you don't trust our
soldiers, why not to call for international presence with the
participation of the American army," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has strongly denounced Palestinian policemen for
shooting at Israeli soldiers during last month's bloodshed,
saying it has destroyed the trust needed to continue previous
joint patrols and justified its demand for making security
changes in the Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Hussein said that he planned to host an Arab-Israeli summit
once Israel and the Palestinians settled the issue of Hebron
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian king, one of major peace mediators in
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, reportedly tried to arrange a
summit between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli officials denied any invitation extended
to Netanyahu. Contrary to earlier speculation, U.S. special
peace envoy Dennis Ross also did not attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Ross traveled to Amman to hold a meeting with Arafat
as he made intensive efforts to bridge the Israeli-Palestinian gap.
</P>
<P>
Hussein's visit to the West Bank, where Jordan had ruled till
it was taken over by Israeli forces in the 1967 war, bears a
symbolic but important meaning to the Palestinians, who wish to
establish an independent Palestinian state despite Israel's
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, his visit came at a time when the
Israeli-Palestinian talks are bogged down over Israel's insistence
on making changes to the signed agreement on its troop
redeployment. It is a public demonstration of solidarity with the
Palestinians and pressure on Israel.
</P>
<P>
Despite his solid support for the Palestinians, the king
originally refused to publicly criticize the hardline
policies adopted by the Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
However, during the tripartite Washington summit with Arafat
and Netanyahu earlier this month after the recent
Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed, King Hussein sharply criticized
Netanyahu's hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
Together with Egypt and other Arab countries, Jordan also
escalated verbal attacks on Netanyahu recently in a bid to put
greater pressure on Israel so as to force it to honor the signed
agreement.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Palestinian sources told Xinhua that
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are to resume talks later
today in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba. Palestinian chief
negotiator Saeb Erekat will travel to Taba after attending the
Arafat-Hussein summit.

<HEADLINE> No Fiji-Taiwan "Mutual Acknowledgement": Chinese FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Shen Guofang today asked countries concerned to stay
alert about Taiwan authorities' separatist activities in the
international community.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan authorities, who have ulterior political
motives, have engaged in activities recently to promote the
acceptance of "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" by every
possible means.
</P>
<P>
They are attempting to separate Taiwan from the motherland by
destroying the relations between China and those countries which
have diplomatic ties with China, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said he hopes that countries concerned stay alert
about the political scheme of the Taiwan autorities in order to
prevent any adverse influence on their bilateral relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks here this afternoon in response
to reports by the media in Taiwan alleging that a communique of
"mutual acknowledgement" between "The Republic of China" and Fiji
has been signed.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the Chinese ambassador to Fiji recently demanded
clarification from the Fiji side on the alleged communique of
"mutual acknowledgement" with the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to the Fiji side, he said, Fiji has never signed such
an agreement with Taiwan, nor has it acknowledged Taiwan as a
"sovereign state" or "official government."
</P>
<P>
Shen noted that the Fiji government has reaffirmed to adhere to
the principles set in the joint communique on the establishment of
diplomatic relations between Fiji and China, as well as its "one
China" policy. It also recognizes the government of the People's
Republic of China as the only legitimate government representing
the whole China and it will not forge "diplomatic" ties with
Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Russian Lawmakers Discuss Policy on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia's State Duma, the lower
house of parliament, today held closed-door hearings on the
settlement of the Chechen issue.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers are expected to draw up recommendations for the
government and the president, based on the results of the
hearings, said Mikhail Surkov, vice-chairman of the Duma.
</P>
<P>
Surkov told reporters that "we did not learn anything new,
anything classified from the speeches delivered by the secretary
of the security council (Alexander Lebed)".
</P>
<P>
Lebed is also head of the newly-created emergency commission
for Chechen settlement.
</P>
<P>
Among other participants of the hearings were Interior Minister
Anatoly Kulikov, Nationalities Minister Vyacheslav Mikhailov,
Federal Security Service Director Nikolai Kovalyov, First Deputy
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and deputies of both houses.
</P>
<P>
Before the opening of the Duma hearing, Kulikov told reporters
that the territorial integrity of Russia must be the "focus" of
the hearings.
</P>
<P>
The key initiator of the hearings, Lebed, managed to avoid
meeting reporters before the opening of the hearings. Unlike at
previous Duma meetings, reporters were barred not only from the
session hall, but also from the floor where the hall is.
</P>
<P>
The Duma tried to work out its attitude toward the latest peace
agreement signed between Lebed and Chechen separatist
chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov on August 31.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which ended 21 months of fighting, provided for
a withdrawal of Russian troops and postponed a decision on the
region's future political status for five years.

<HEADLINE> Japan-US Security Accord Must Not Exceed Bilateral Category </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, october 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Shen Guofang said here today that the Japan-US Security
Accord must not exceed the bilateral category, and there is no
reason for any third country to intervene in the Sino-Japanese
dispute over the Diaoyu Islands issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that the dispute between China and Japan over the issue
of the Diaoyu Islands is a problem for the two countries to solve
by themselves.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference today, Shen commented on a five-page
report drafted by the United States Congress which demanded that
the US defend the Diaoyu Islands in line with the Japan-US
Security Accord.
</P>
<P>
Shen stressed that if the accord between the US and Japan
exceeds the bilateral sphere, it will arouse uneasiness and
promote vigilance in the neighboring Asian countries including
China, and complicate the regional security.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the alleged acknowledgement by the Chinese government
of the Diaoyu Islands' inclusion in the Ryukyu Archipelago, as
listed in the Memorandum of Understanding reached between Japan
and the US, the spokesman said the Chinese government declared
solemnly in 1971 that it is illegal for the governments of the
United States and Japan to list China's Diaoyu Islands and other
islands as "returned areas" in the joint accord on the returning
of the Okinawa Archipelago. This will not change the territorial
sovereignty of the People's Republic of China over Diaoyu and
other islands, he added.
</P>
<P>
China's stance is clear, consistent and firm, the spokesman
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Delhi Government Urged to Treat Dengue as Epidemic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government said
today that it has already requested the Delhi government to treat
the outbreak of dengue fever as an epidemic and take urgent
remedial measures, the Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
The central government made the clarification in response to an
inquiry of the Delhi High Court which sought the opinion of the
government about whether issuing notification to this effect would
help in combating the disease spreading in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Since the first death caused by dengue fever was reported in
the city on August 22, the toll has now gone up to at least 145
with nearly 3,000 cases reported in some major hospitals alone.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi High Court, which on its own proposed hearings on the
matter for today, also directed the civic bodies in the capital to
immediately step up efforts to control the mosquito-transmitted
disease.
</P>
<P>
However, a top Indian health expert said today that the
prospect of checking the present dengue epidemic in Delhi does not
look bright.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Ramalingaswami, former chief of the Indian Council of
Medical Research, blamed the spread of this disease on an
ineffective mosquito control program and urban decay characterized
by sub-standard housing, inadequate water and waste disposal
system.
</P>
<P>
He said absence of a disease surveillance system and sustained
program for epidemic prevention has contributed to the spread of
dengue.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the disease has secured a firm foothold in
India and it would be at least five years before a safe vaccine
will become available for public use.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the current epidemic, he called for a two-pronged
attack on mosquitoes by spraying insecticides and community action
to eliminate sources of mosquito breeding.

<HEADLINE> Quality of Chinese Police Force Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- China's police force has
greatly improved its own quality, and is gaining more and more
popularity with the general public.
</P>
<P>
"During the past year, conspicuous changes have taken place in
terms of the mental outlook and public image of an overwhelming
majority of the police departments in China's large and
medium-sized cities," said Tao Siju, minister of Public Security,
at a meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
He added that the professional ethics of the country's police
force have also been greatly enhanced.
</P>
<P>
He attributed all these changes to a one-year campaign to learn
from the traffic police in Jinan, which started last October and
covered all police departments across the country.
</P>
<P>
The police force in Jinan, the capital of east China's Shandong
Province, was named the "National Model Traffic Police Corps" in
late 1995.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin wrote an inscription of
encouragement, "Strictly Enforcing Law and Rendering Good
Service", to the department after learning of their achievements.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Security today held a national
conference in Beijing to discuss the achievements of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, traffic police departments from eight major
Chinese cities, namely, Xi'an, Shenzhen, Nanjing, Xiamen, Hohhot,
Nanchang, Shenyang, and Taiyuan, were awarded first-class merit
citations, along with bonuses of 10,000 yuan (about 1,200 US
dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
Another 100 police units and 200 policemen from all over the
country were recognized as "Advanced Units" and "Advanced
Individuals," and received awards.
</P>
<P>
Ren Jianxin, Secretary of the Political Science and Law
Commission of the CPC Central Committee, met with representatives
of all model units before the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The campaign of learning from the Jinan traffic police is in
the spirit of the Sixth Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The party plenum, which ended last week, placed special
emphasis on the promotion of the socialist ethical and cultural
progress throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Ren said he hopes that the country's police force would set
loftier goals for itself and continue its current work for
self-improvement.

<HEADLINE> Power Price Dispute Between Kenya, Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has unilaterally raised
the rate of electricity sold to Kenya, bringing up the low power
rate issue again.
</P>
<P>
The rate-raising announcement, which is the latest turn in a
row over an agreement dating back to 1954, was made by Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni at a press conference held in Kampala
on Monday, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord signed during the British colonial rule, no
provision is made for a review of Uganda's electricity rate until
the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
The colonial pact stipulates that Uganda is bound to supply 30
megawatts of electricity from the Owen Falls Dam in Jinja to
Kenya at a price of two U.S. Cents a unit.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan President charged that Kenya had been buying
Uganda's electricity at a low price whereas it produced a unit of
electricity at the cost of six U.S. Cents.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said he raised the matter with President Daniel arap
Moi during their recent meeting in Arusha, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"We had lost so much. What we now need is payment according
to market rates," he told Moi.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Uganda, which sells five megawatts every year to
neighboring Rwanda and Tanzania respectively, has charged eight
U.S. Cents a unit.
</P>
<P>
So, the Ugandan President called for renegotiations of the
deal with the Kenyan government to settle their dispute.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Energy Minister Darius Mbela has said his government is
willing to review the agreement signed between the two east
African countries because the current cost of electricity greatly
exceeded the pricing when the deal was sealed.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Power and Lighting Company also said the problem is
not renegotiating the agreement but a guarantee of 30 megawatts
electricity export to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has a power deficit of 50 megawatts every year. The
peak demand of Kenya's power supply system is 670 megawatts while
available capacity is 620 megawatts, according to Kenya Power and
Lighting Company.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebel Group Shows Peace Gesture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A Muslim rebel group assured the
Philippine government today that the recent clash between its
members and government troops will not affect negotiations between
the two sides for a comprehensive ceasefire agreement and a final
peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Executive Secretary Ruben Torres told reporters here
today that Ghazli Jaafar, vice-chairman of the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) sent an emissary to him this morning to
explain MILF's stand on the two-day gunbattle in North Cotabato at
the weekend that killed 10 civilians and wounded 80 others.
</P>
<P>
According to Torres, the MILF emissary said that the clash will
not derail the discussion between the two sides toward a cessation
of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the clash began Saturday when 200 MILF
rebels attacked two outposts of the government army in North
Cotabato.
</P>
<P>
However, Torres said, in sending the emissary, "the MILF wants
to inform us that they will not allow the clash to deter us from
continuing our exploratory talks toward formal peace talks."
</P>
<P>
He said that government negotiators and MILF representatives
will meet in a week's time to discuss a proposed comprehensive
ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
After the government and the Moro National Liberation Front
signed a peace pact in September this year, the 1,700-strong MILF
has become the largest rebel group in the country.
</P>
<P>
AT present, the MILF maintains its control over Central
Mindanao, the southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Few Minority People Back to Hometown in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said today that in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, very few refugees and displaced people have returned
to their hometowns where they are ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR has been having tremendous problems in getting
minority people back to their original hometowns, UNHCR spokesman
Ron Redmond told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Most of the displaced people were Muslims and Croats trying to
return from the federation or elsewhere to the Republic of
Serbscka, he added.
</P>
<P>
Redmond said some Serbs who tried to go back to their homes in
the federation were blocked, in particular by Bosnian Croats.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, he added, a group of 250 Serbs trying to visit their
homes in Divoir in northwestern Bosnia were stopped outside the
town by local authorities, which did this partly in retaliation
for Serbs who blocked returning Croats elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR also said the situation in eastern Zaire has calmed
down and his agency was resuming normal relief operations in the
refugee camps in the African country.
</P>
<P>
Redmond said there were 13 camps in the Uvira region,
accommodating 219,000 refugees, 76,000 of them Rwandans and
143,500 Burundis.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that refugees fleeing the Runingo camp in
Uvira last weekend were returning to the camp after order had been
restored in that area.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR expected most of them to be back in the camp on
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Runingo camp had 19,000 refugees, with 8,000 from Rwanda
and 11,000 from Burundi. It was attacked by unidentified armed
men before dawn on Sunday, who killed four refugees and wounded
six others.
</P>
<P>
This was the second incident in the area in about a month,
Redmond said. In mid-September, Zairean soldiers repelled an
armed group attempting to slip into Zaire near Runingo from
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen in the two incidents were believed to be Zaireans of
Rwandan origin.
</P>
<P>
In northern Uganda, UNHCR offices in two separate places in the
Pakelle region were attacked and ransacked by unidentified gunmen
Monday, said Redmond. For security reasons, UNHCR staff and staff
of other international agencies have withdrawn from that region.
</P>
<P>
Redmond said that the UNHCR offices in Pakelle have been taking
care of half of the 229,000 Sudanese refugees in Uganda.

ADDIS ABABA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Petroleum
Enterprise announced here today that the country has a 10 million
liter kerosine deposit at present.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of the enterprise Worku Gossaye said part of

</P>
<P>
He said an additional 10 million liters of kerosine will arrive at
Assab Port in five days.
</P>
<P>
He said some areas of the country are facing kerosine
shortages, due to high kerosine consumption.
</P>
<P>
There would be no fuel shortage from now onwards as there is a
continuous importation every two weeks, he added. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
opened today at the Department of Tourism an exhibit of ancient
Chinese artifacts dating back to early 10th century.
</P>
<P>
The artifacts were part of the 4,771 pieces of priceless
ceramic and copper wares discovered last year by a group of divers
from a Chinese merchant vessel that sank 600 years ago. The rare
antiques were supposed to be traded off for Philippine forest
products, gold and pearls.
</P>
<P>
The discovery off Palawan Island in the southern Philippines is
considered to be one of the most important archeological finds of
precolonial Philippine treasures, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said the discovery is a confirmation of "the existence of a
vibrant Asian economy that thrived at that time, more than a
century before Ferdinand Magellan and the Spaniards sailed to our
shores and discovered the Philippines".

BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told Slovenian President Milan Kucan
today that he hopes the republics in the area of the former
Yugoslavia will settle any remaining political problems through
peaceful negotiation.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, the Chinese
foreign minister said China appreciates the positive role played
by Slovenia in European affairs in the post-Cold War period.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Kucan briefed Qian on Slovenia's position
on European and world affairs.
</P>
<P>
The head of state noted that profound changes have taken place
in Europe and the world, and that the Europe-centered era is gone.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia not only will join the union of Europe but also should
attach importance to the cooperation with countries in other parts
of the world, particularly China and Asia, Kucan said.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Kucan's remark that the world is growing towards
multi-polarization, Qian noted that the Asia-Pacific economy is
growing rapidly and that China is willing to expand economic and
trade cooperation with Slovenia on an equal basis in order to seek
common development.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who met with Kucan three years ago when he visited
Slovenia, said he hopes that the current visit of Kucan will
contribute to the development of Sino-Slovenian ties.
</P>
<P>
Kucan told Qian that his talks with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin were fruitful, and that he is pleased with the advancement
of bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Calls for Collective War against Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has called for
urgent and collective efforts in South Asia to fight against their
common enemy of drugs.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Secretary of Narcotics Control Division Afzal Kahute
made the appeal at the inaugural session of Technical Committee on
Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) held here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Kahute asked the delegates from the
SAARC countries to carry out the drug eradication efforts at the
national, regional, sub-regional and international levels.
</P>
<P>
Kahute said the drug problem is multi-dimensional and it
requires the similar approach to successful grappling of the
issue.
</P>
<P>
"Collective efforts are the only weapon to win a war against
the common enemy of drugs and the resultant bleak future."
</P>
<P>
While giving the perilous drug scenario in Pakistan, Kahute
said, of about 3 million addicts in Pakistan, 1.5 million are
heroine users.
</P>
<P>
However, the efforts of the government proved salutary, he
said, as the acreage of drug production had decreased from 8,500
in 1978-79 to 4,538 acres in 1995-96 with the production falling
from 800 to 44 tons.
</P>
<P>
The merger of Pakistan Narcotics Control Board and
Anti-Narcotics Task Force has doubled the strength and efficiency
of the Anti-Narcotic Force, he added.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from all seven South Asian countries participated in
the two-day conference to discuss ways and means to control drug
trafficking and abuse in the sub-continent.

<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The China Charity Federation
(CCF) has donated one million yuan to the country's flood-stricken
 provinces to help reconstruct the damaged houses for the elderly
people.
</P>
<P>
This summer, central China's Hunan, Hubei, and east China's
Jiangxi provinces suffered from flooding, stretches of farmland
were submerged and houses, especially many of the old ones, were
damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
To help local elderly people and children who were victims of
the floods live more comfortably, CCF donated 600,000 yuan to
homeowners in Hunan and Hubei, and 400,000 yuan to Jiangxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
The federation, founded in April 1994 after a 40-year
suspension of China's charity work, raised 835 million yuan both
at home and abroad from January through September, and donated 405
million yuan to various charity projects.
</P>
<P>
CCF, the largest national comprehensive charitable organization
in China, is designed to uphold the principle of humanitarianism
and the Chinese tradition of helping the people in need, with the
aim of promoting social equality and progress.

<HEADLINE> HK Bank Launches Capital-Protected Investment Deposit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong-based Hang Seng
Bank announced the launch here on Tuesday of a new investment
deposit program which will offer higher returns with total capital
protection.
</P>
<P>
The Capital Protected Investment (CPI) Deposit combines the
benefits of a time deposit and an investment, providing customers
with an opportunity to earn higher yields with 100 percent capital
protection.
</P>
<P>
The new product offers customers a wide range of investment
options to maximize their returns, the bank says. They can invest
in either a bullish or bearish market view of the Hang Seng Index
of six foreign currencies of German mark, Japanese yen, Pound
sterling, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and New Zealand
dollar against the Hong Kong dollar or US dollar.
</P>
<P>
The investment returns on the deposits are linked to the
performance of the selected investment choices and the
corresponding participation rates, and customers have an
opportunity to enjoy higher returns than on normal time deposits
and even direct investment in foreign currencies and the Hang Seng
Index.
</P>
<P>
For foreign currency investments, customers can choose to make
a "lock-in" arrangement which allows them to lock in at a
favorable exchange rate when the market works in their favor
during the deposit period. Any later exchange rate fluctuations
will not affect the guaranteed returns, according to officials of
the bank.
</P>
<P>
CPI Deposit offers different levels of capital protection to
meet investors' varying risk appetites. They can choose either 100
percent or 99 percent capital protection for foreign currency
investments, and 100 percent or 97 percent capital protection for
Hang Seng Index investments. Customers can increase the power of
their investment for even higher returns by selecting lower
capital protection levels.

<HEADLINE> Australian Economy to Benefit from Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- An Australian official has
said that the country's economy would be boosted by 7.3 billion
Australian dollars (5.77 billion US dollars) in 10 years from
increased trade and investment off-shooting because of the Sydney
2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Finance Director of The Sydney Organizing Committee for the
Olympic Games (SOCOG) John Pope said that preliminary figures from
the Atlanta Games showed the state of Georgia benefited about 8
billion US dollars from increased tourists, according to a press
release available here today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by an economic study showed that 1.3
million additional tourists would visit Australia because of the
games, but Pope believed that the figure would be exceeded.
</P>
<P>
"My view is that it will be over a longer period and it won't
just be the ten years but it will be a sustainable increase in
investment in Australia."
</P>
<P>
An additional 156,000 full and part-time jobs would be created
in the lead up to the Olympics. "For that reason I truly believe
that it is a great economic opportunity for us," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) Tuesday sharply criticized Japan for its
efforts to become a political power.
</P>
<P>
An article carried in the Minju Choson newspaper said that
Japan is making every effort to become a political power, trying
to realize its long-held ambition for overseas expansion and more
aggression.
</P>
<P>
It said that Japan has refused to recognize its war crimes and
whitewashed its aggressive history; moreover, there have been
annual shrine visits in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which has become a big military power in the world, has
vowed to establish a military force matching its economic
strength, it said.
</P>
<P>
Once Japan becomes a political power, its ambition for new
aggression will threaten world peace and security, the article
said, adding that Japan's attempt runs counter to the trends of
the current era and it will produce negative effect to the
establishment of a new and just international order.
</P>
<P>
The article said the people in Asia and elsewhere in the world
are closely watching Japan's moves. Japan will be isolated if it
continues to persist in its scheme.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Raises Alarm Over Water Shortage in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
warned here today that the country was facing a water shortage
which, if left unremedied, would put at risk all the successes the
country had made in the economic and social fields in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
Ramos issued the warning in a speech at the opening ceremony of
the second National Water Summit held in the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
"We are on the verge of a water shortage. Its signs are
becoming evident," he said, adding that these signs include the
upsurge in water-borne diseases such as cholera, dengue and
diarrhea across the country this year and the recent massive
fishkill in Manila Bay.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the rash of these water-borne diseases,
which had killed nearly 100 people in the country, had also
deepened the Filipino's concern about the long-term reliability of
the country's water supply.
</P>
<P>
"All the breakthroughs and successes we have made in the
economic and social fields in the past few years can be put at
risk should we face a prolonged water shortage brought about by
lack of environmental protection, water resources conservation,
and water treatment and distribution," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Heartened by some congressional initiatives to solve the water
problem, Ramos said he was inclined to accede to certain proposals
of the lawmakers. These proposals include the appointment of a
"water czar" to give special focus to water-related programs and
projects.
</P>
<P>
The first National Water Summit was also held in the
presidential palace on December 9, 1994. Delegates attending the
meeting agreed on certain commitments to ensure sustained water
supply in the country.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi will begin an eight-day tour on Thursday
that will take him to Vietnam, Myanmar and Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, current chairman of the Standing Committee of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), said today that
the visits are aimed at strengthening bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He will be in Vietnam from October 17 to 20, in Myanmar from
October 20 to 22 and in Cambodia from October 22 to 24, he told
reporters after opening a Mekong Valley Civilization Seminar here.
</P>
<P>
He said the issue of Myanmar's entry into ASEAN would not be a
priority topic for discussions during his visit to Myanmar, which
submitted a formal application for full ASEAN membership in
August.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Develop Intensive Animal Farming (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Xilinhot (Inner Mongolia), October 15 (Xinhua) -- After touring
Australia early last year, wise and diligent Yadam changed his
thoughts about keeping animals on the prairies of China.
</P>
<P>
The trip made him determined to develop intensive animal
farming on his grasslands in the Xilin Gol League in central
Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
"Australians impressed me most with their love for their land,
and their awareness of nature protection," said Yadam, 55, a
robust Mongolian in his typical blue dress.
</P>
<P>
He decided to enhance the quality of his grassland, and improve
the animal stock on his own lands, while increasing his herd if he
can lease more grassland from other herdsmen. He had an income of
330,000 yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Like Yadam, more and more herdsmen, working as farming
families, have begun to develop intensive grassland farming, by
improving their prairies, breeding better animals, and enhancing
productivity, said deputy governor Hao Yidong.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the vast areas of natural prairie saw animals
keeping in a more traditional way, with a natural economy that
meant lower productivity and lower efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Contrasted with advanced experiences both inside and outside
the country, the league government advocated an intensive model in
1993, in a bid to modernize animal husbandry in the grassland area.
</P>
<P>
The first step was to develop intensive animal farming based on
family farming, Hao said. The development of modern animal farming
companies, and modern animal farming industries, are expected in
the future across the prairies.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1970s, animal husbandry in the league has been
completely transformed from nomadic to family settlement, while
production has gone from a shiftable style on the grasslands, to
settlement.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the league had more than 13 million horses, oxen, and
goats, the most among the level of leagues in the prairie area,
according to Hao.
</P>
<P>
Some 5,000 households, 12 percent of the total, have more than
500 animals each.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Airlines to Expand Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnam Airlines Corporation
is expected to expand its fleet from 36 to 80 aircrafts by the
year 2010, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the airlines' Director General Le Duc Tu, the
corporation intended to buy more airbus aircrafts for its fleet at
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Airlines currently has a fleet of 36 aircrafts
including nine Boeing 767 and 737 aircrafts, six airbus a320s, six
atr72s and other small planes and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
While expanding domestic routes, the corporation has opened 22
international routes to major cities spanning 19 countries and
territories in Asia and Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
But the increase of animals added to the deterioration of
grasslands. Together with insufficient construction of water
wells, pens, and grasslands, the development of animal husbandry
was blocked.
</P>
<P>
Intensive grassland animal farming emphasizes the construction
of grasslands, improvement of herd stocks, control of water
pollution, raising in the winter and spring, and fattening of
animals in a short period. These will be accomplished through
better management, infrastructure construction, and the
application of modern technology.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years 3,000 households in the league have
been guided along the road of intensive farming.
</P>
<P>
"Intensive management, combined with grassland animal
husbandry, proved to be our best choice for the future
development," said Hao.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, around 10,000 households will be practising
modern animal husbandry, a quarter of the total. It is expected
that the level will reach that of such prairie-animal husbandry of
developed countries like Australia, Argentina and New Zealand,
according to the deputy governor.
</P>
<P>
For the healthy development of the area, the league will
further strengthen social services, foster markets and promote
circulation, Hao said.
</P>
<P>
To better use grasslands for a sustainable development of
prairie animal husbandry, the Xilin Gol League last month issued a
local regulation to implement a system of responsibility. It
ensures a balance between grass and animals. Last year, there was
a nine percent surplus of animals, compared with the reasonable
amount for grasslands.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, local leaders at all levels have
to co-ordinate the development of the animal numbers, while the
herdsmen will also be held responsible for an overuse of his
grasslands by his herd. He will be fined 20 percent of the value
of the surplus animals.
</P>
<P>
The population of the league is 900,000, with almost 29 percent
of them Mongolians. The total area of natural prairie is 295
million mu (19.8 million ha).

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Unemployment Rate Exaggerated: ILO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The South African
unemployment, often cited as being the world highest, was not as
high as the previous figures usually given, a local daily "the
Citizen" today quoted a research report as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, published on Monday in Geneva and
conducted by the International Labour Organization (ILO) at the
request of the South African government, the actual rate of
unemployment in South Africa might be as much as one-third lower
than stated figures.
</P>
<P>
However serious the actual rate of unemployment might be, the
ILO report said the generally cited figure of 33 percent was
probably exaggerated, and a rate of 20 percent was closer to
reality.
</P>
<P>
Guy Standing, chief co-ordinator of the ILO report, said many
of the poorest in South Africa were normally employed, and that
"sensible redistribution is the key to overcoming the political,
social and economic legacy of apartheid".

PARIS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Soon after the Supreme Court of Belgium announced Monday its
decision to stop allowing Judge Jean-Marc Connerotte to continue
investigations in the affair of serial child-kidnapper Marc
Dutroux, the reaction of anger has been rising across
Belgium. Many people are now more convinced that the country's
judicial system is trying to protect the privileged people who are
involved in sexual exploitation of children.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Seven French trade unions of public sector, most of them in
public service, and several organizations of doctors and nurses,
will stage a one-day strike and demonstration on Thursday against
the "non-application" of the social security reform of Prime
Minister Alain Juppe.
</P>
<P>
-- The National Secretary of the French Communist Party (PCF),
Robert Hue, and the former general secretary of the PCF, Georges
Marchais, were put under judicial inquiry last week by a Paris
court for their suspected role in a financial scandal involving a
research institute run by the PCF and the national water company
Compagnie Generale des Eaux.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Talks Put off Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Palestine will
not return to their negotiating table at the Egyptian Red Sea
resort of Taba until tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations should have resumed today after a one-day
postponement, which was request by U.S. Middle East
Coordinator Dennis Ross. He said the change of venue would
increase the pace of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed on holding their peace talks in Taba
and Eilate, Israel, alternately.
</P>
<P>
Last week's talks at Erez checkpoint on the entrance to Gaza,
were stalled when the Palestinians rejected the Israeli
demands to change part of the previously-agreed deal on Hebron and
insisted that it be honored unaltered.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators from both sides have been trying to hammer out
an agreement on the issue of Hebron troops redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The redeployment from the last major West Bank town of Hebron
should have been completed seven months ago under the original
self-rule accord. About 400 Jewish settlers live in heavily-armed
compounds amid 100,000 Arabs in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
While Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy Monday expressed
confidence in reaching prompt agreement on Hebron, the
Palestinians warned of a possible setback.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour stuck to the Palestinian
position that no changes should be made in the Israel-PLO accord
which called for Israel to withdraw from Hebron in March. He said
reports of agreement on security issues were "totally untrue."
</P>
<P>
The Israelis and Palestinians resumed peace talks last week after
a summit in Washington called for healing wounds from last month's
violence.

<HEADLINE> Two Australian Ministers Resign Within One Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government was
rocked by another ministerial resignation today as that of
Parliamentary Treasury Secretary Brian Gibson was accepted after
the weekend resignation of Assistant Treasurer Jim Short.
</P>
<P>
Gibson submitted his resignation Monday under opposition
attacks on his signing of an exemption order in June to give Boral
Energy, a company of which he held shares, access to the Victorian
Electricity Exempt futures market.
</P>
<P>
He explained that he had wrongly believed at the time of
signing the exemption that he and his wife had sold their Boral
shares.
</P>
<P>
"It could therefore be perceived, despite the purely mechanical
nature of the decision, that he had a conflict of interest in
making that decision," Prime Minister John Howard told Parliament
today.
</P>
<P>
"I felt no alternative but to accept his resignation. I regret
that fact," he said.
</P>
<P>
This took place within days after Assistant Treasurer Short
resigned for a possible conflict of interest involing his
ownership of ANZ Bank shares.
</P>
<P>
Howard told Parliament last Thursday that Senator Short had
"carelessly" overlooked a requirement to divest almost 50,000
Australian dollars (39,500 US dollars) in ANZ Bank shares while he
had responsibility for banking and superannuation affairs.
</P>
<P>
The shares have appreciated by more than 20 percent since
Short's appointment as Assistant Treasurer on March 11.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has hounded the government for a week over
apparent ministerial conflicts of interest, and kept on an attack
on Industry Minister John Moore today over his continued ownership
of a venture capital company that may benefit from his ministerial
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Howard, however, said he did not believe Moore had breached the
ministerial guidelines.

DALIAN, October 15 (Xinhua) -- West Pacific Petrochemical
Company, a large Sino-foreign joint oil refinery in Dalian in
northeast China's Liaoning Province, has shipped out its first
consignment of fuel.
</P>
<P>
The 8,000 tons of diesel oil were sent to east China's Zhejiang
Province, paving the way for shipments to other provinces
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Built at a cost of more than one billion US dollars, the oil
refinery was funded by seven companies from China's inland areas,
Hong Kong and French companies.
</P>
<P>
Four years of effort helped the company successfully carry out
a trial run last month, producing quality petrol and diesel oil.
</P>
<P>
Along with other facilities going into operation, the plant
will produce petroleum, liquefied natural gas, and polypropylene.
</P>
<P>
It plans to sell 580,000 tons of petrol and diesel oil to east,

<HEADLINE> Singapore Launches New Stock Market Index </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Singapore today launched a
new stock market index, known as the Business Times Singapore
Regional Index, or in short, the SRI, in an effort to develop
Singapore into an international financial center.
</P>
<P>
"The launch of the SRI marks another milestone in the evolution
of the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) from an exchange catering
to fund-raising by domestic companies into a center for
international investors to trade shares of regional companies,"
Finance Minister Richard Hu said at a seminar to unveil the new
index.
</P>
<P>
He said the SRI was developed in response to calls from market
participants for a benchmark to measure the performance of their
investment portfolios in Asia, which reflected the increasing
international dimension of the Singapore stock market.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the SRI would provide investors with a
convenient and efficient way of achieving exposure to the region
and enjoying its growth by investing in baskets of the 38
SRI-component stocks within the security of Singapore's
well-regulated financial system, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Hu also said that companies listed on the SES would in turn
benefit as studies in other markets had shown that component
stocks of a well-followed index attract greater interest from fund
managers, thus enhancing their liquidity.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the introduction of the SRI will set in motion a
virtuous cycle of attracting more large and reputable foreign
companies to list on the SES, and enlarging the pool of investment
alternatives for investors and fund managers," he said.

LUANDA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government issued a
communique on Monday urging for more U.S. pressure on the rival
UNITA movement to accelerate the implementation of the peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
The communique came at the end of a four-hour visit by U.S.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, the first of its kind ever
paid by such a U.S. high-ranking official since 1975.

</P>
<P>
The communique said the Angolan government considered
Christopher's visit an important step toward better cooperation
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The government hoped that the U.S. administration would
continue using its influence to force UNITA to accelerate the
completion of peace work, the communique added.

<P>
CAIRO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Travelers who buy tickets to Europe this week will
be able to cash in on an offer by EL Al, Israel's national
carrier, which is the latest step in the ongoing airline price
war, the Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
It is offering a price of 299 dollars for round-trip to Europe
for night flights and 349 dollars for day flights. The catch is
that the tickets, valid during November, must be ordered by Friday.
</P>
<P>
The destinations offered are Amsterdam, Paris, Zurich, and
Rome. The El Al deal undercuts earlier offers for some European
destinations for 333 dollars. El Al also recently cut its
trans-Atlantic fares, which now stands at 699 dollars to New
York.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israeli Knesset (parliament) Finance Committee
Monday unanimously approved what for most products is the final
stage of the government's five-year import liberalization
program, the Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision reduces customs duties to 12 percent on most
finished products and 8 percent on raw materials. In a few
especially vulnerable industries, such as shoes, fertilizers, wood
 products and electric cables, however, duties will go down to
these levels only in 1988. Altogether, rates were reduced for
some 1,800 products Monday.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- A Lebanese-Syrian company for investments has been
set up by businessmen of the two countries, with its headquarters
in Beirut and branches in Damascus, Beirut's Ad-Diyar daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting in the Syrian capital Monday, the Council of
Syrian and Lebanese Businessmen decided to establish the company,
and worked out the company's interior and basical system.
</P>
<P>
The council was set up by an agreement of economic cooperation
the Syrian and Lebanese governments signed in September 1993
within the framework of the 1991 Treaty of Brotherhood,
Cooperation and Coordination.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Ten airlines operating in Kuwait have greed to
raise their air fares to Indian destinations to pre-1994 levels on
a "rescue mission" for their operation.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement signed by the 10 airlines, including Kuwait
Airways, Air India, Oman Air, Gulf Air, Air Lanka and Qatar
Airways Monday, came in the wake of a dramatic drop in air fares
to the subcontinent and other Asian destinations. It will come
into effect from October 20.
</P>
<P>
According to the new agreement, a return ticket to Bombay or
Delhi which three years ago cost 212 Kuwait dinars (699
U.S. dollars) and is available for 120 dinars (396 U.S. dollars)
now, will increase to 190 dinars (627 U.S. dollars) from October
20.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a one-way ticket has been increased from 78 dinars
(257 U.S. dollars) to 124 dinars (409 U.S. dollars), a rise by
over 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement which only applies to Indian destinations
has also stipulated that air fares to other cities have been
increased by similar margins.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The 10th Session of Vietnamese
National Assembly's Ninth Legislature opened here today to discuss
the five-year plan (1996-2000) and to approve some draft laws.
</P>
<P>
This is the year-end session conducted after the 8th National
Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam, therefore this session
has an important role in the institutionalization of the party
line and the implementation of the congress' resolutions.
</P>
<P>
At today's session, Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet
reported to the assembly on the socio-economic situation in 1996
and the 1997 socio-economic development plan.
</P>
<P>
According to the Prime Minister, after nine months of
implementation of the 1996 plan, the economy has achieved an
estimated annual gdp growth rate of 9.5 percent, which is within
the scope of the targeted 9 to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural-forestry and fishery production value is
expected to grow by 4.8 to 5 percent, which will surpass the
target of 4.5 to 4.8 percent, and the industrial production value
will reach the planned 14 percent increase rate.
</P>
<P>
The export turnover will increase by 32 percent, much higher
than the planned target of 27 to 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Vo Van Kiet pointed out that there were still some
problems such as poverty and corruption which hindered the
economic development and foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The session, which will last for a month, will also consider
the implementation of the 1996 state budget, the state budget
esitmation for 1997 and the five-year plan on socio-economic
development for 1996-2000.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Silt to Yellow River Reduces 300 Million Tons Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Effective soil and water
conservation in northwest China's Loess Plateau has reduced the
volume of silt in the Yellow River by about 300 million tons a
year.
</P>
<P>
Latest surveys show that the seven provinces or autonomous
regions in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River have
made marked progress in preventing soil erosion, by launching more
water and soil conservancy projects, and planting more trees and
grass.
</P>
<P>
The investigation was made by a group of experts, dispatched by
the Ministry of Water Resources and Yellow River Water Conservancy
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Loess Plateau, comprising provinces of Qinghai, Gansu,
Shaanxi, Shanxi and Henan, and the Ningxia and Inner Mongolia
autonomous regions, is a region faced with the world's most
serious soil erosion problem.
</P>
<P>
The soil in the region is very lose and frequently suffers
from heavy rains. The plateau has 430,000 sq km of soil eroded
land.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Defends Controversial Power Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has defended the controversial multi-billion Dollar deal
signed by Zimbabwe and Malaysia's YTL corporation to buy a
majority shareholding in the Hwange Thermal Power Station, saying
the process was part of black empowerment.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the "Financial Times" of London, which is
being published today, the president said the government while
privatizing public enterprises to bring in blacks, would form a
Zimbabwe investment trust fund.
</P>
<P>
He said the govrernment wanted to use the fund as an
instrument for empowering the indigenous people. The
manufacturing, mining and other sectors are dominated by whites.
</P>
<P>
He said, "if we sell a parastatal, for example now in regard
to Hwange, the shares that we sell to YTL should yield a fund
that we can use for purposes of empowering blacks."
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed deal worth 600 million U.S. Dollars, YTL
will buy 51 percent shareholding of Hwange which supplies
Zimbabwe with more than 50 percent of its power needs.
</P>
<P>
The deal has already received wide condemnation from several
economic and labour groups, including the Zimbabwe Congress of
Trade Unions (ZCTU) as among other things, it halted a tender bid
already put out for expansion of the power station.
</P>
<P>
The president said, "we are very clear about this and of
course they are those who do not want to see a country like
Malaysia having an entry onto our economy... they think they
alone should participate in our economy."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said this was a typical example of south-south
cooperation, and the government would like to see other
participants come "into the fold".

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestine Far Apart On Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators are still far apart from certain key issues on
Hebron redeployment, reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
The two sides still differ on Israel's insistence that
Israeli soldiers should be allowed to enter
Palestinian-controlled parts of Hebron known as H1, the
report quoting senior officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Prime Minister's Office insist that the
issue, considered to be the most sensitive in the talks, is not
just whether Israel was permitted to enter H1, which comprises 80
percent of Hebron, in hot pursuit of terrorists, but also
about whether the army can enter the Palestinian
Authority-controlled parts of Hebron if Israel suspects an attack
is about to happen.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said Monday night
that Israel was seeking to "reopen" the Oslo agreement.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said before the Knesset
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Monday afternoon that
Israel was not seeking to reopen the Oslo agreement. He added
that the negotiations on Hebron entered what he called a
sensitive stage and Israel must take security into consideration.
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear whether the negotiations will be held in Taba,
Egypt's Red Sea resort, today, or if informal talks will
continue in Tel Aviv and elsewhere. U.S. officials believe
progress is most likely when small groups of negotiators meet
informally.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy expressed upbeat Monday about the
talks, saying that an agreement could be reached in just a matter
of days, not weeks. But Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour
denied that there had been progress in the negotiations. "There
is no progress. There is nothing new. The differences are as
great now as they were a week ago," he told The Jerusalem Post
in an interview published today.
</P>
<P>
PLO officials reportedly said that PA President Yasser Arafat
had rejected a proposal by Netanyahu that they could hold a
summit if Arafat agreed to change the Hebron deal and give
Israel the right to enter areas to be under PA control.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, U.S. special Middle East coordinator Dennis
Ross flew to Amman, where he held talks with Arafat who met
with King Hussein earlier in the day. Ross is seeking ways
to bridge the gaps between Israeli and Palestinian positions.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein was scheduled to go to Jericho this morning with
Arafat for his first visit to the West Bank since the Six Day
War in 1967. The move is seen here as the king's solidarity with
Arafat in time of difficulties.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Push WTO for Textile Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) will push members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) for further textile liberalization at the first
WTO ministerial meeting in Singapore in December, reports reaching
here said today.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN will urge WTO members to include an agreement on
textile liberalization in a WTO declaration to be produced at the
meeting, according to Thai Commerce Ministry officials who
attended a WTO meeting in Geneva last week.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the ASEAN countries opposed unilateral
measures, like the rule of origin, taken by developed countries,
especially the United States and the European Union members, which
they said would block textile liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN members will also urge WTO members to include an
agricultural agreement and anti-dumping measures in the
declaration, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai officials indicated that the ASEAN hoped the standard
of anti-dumping and countervailing duty measures would be written
in the declaration as developed countries frequently used them as
trade harassment against developing countries.
</P>
<P>
They also reaffirmed ASEAN countries' position that the WTO
should not link environmental issues with trade.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese peasant Shi Wei, from
Liaoyang County, in northeast China's Liaoning Province, has
reaped an annual income of 160,000 yuan by growing vegetables,
thanks to the implementation of the Spark Program.
</P>
<P>
The program, designed to use advanced, but suitable technology
to improve economic proficiency, has helped many Chinese peasants
to become wealthy.
</P>
<P>
The average annual income of peasants in eastern mountainous
areas of Liaoyang County has jumped from 400 yuan to over 1,000
yuan, thanks to the plan.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chunbiao, deputy magistrate of the county, said that in
the past ten years, the county has invested over 32 million yuan
on over 130 projects under the plan.
</P>
<P>
Over half of the villages in the county have become various
production bases, specializing in rice, vegetables, freshwater
fish, as well as other products.
</P>
<P>
Approved by the State Council, the Spark Program covers 24
major fields, including development of mountainous areas, aquatic
production, livestock farming, animal husbandry and processing of
farm and sideline products.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- China's railways are not only
making two ends meet by selling train tickets, but its authorities
are running hotels, travel agencies, as well as property and
foreign trade businesses.
</P>
<P>
Han Zhubin, Minister of Railways, told a national meeting
convened recently in Guiyang, that multi-purpose operations have
already become an important economic pillar of the railway
industry.
</P>
<P>
Railways across the country have opened over 8,000 businesses
engaged in operations other than train services. Of them, 28 have
an annual business turnover exceeding 100 million yuan (12.04
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
There are 38 enterprises each with an annual profit exceeding
10 million yuan, and 60 businesses each with a yearly profit of
over 50 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The foreign trade companies of the railways in the past five
years have transacted more than five billion yuan, and have
attracted about 100 million US dollars in overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the railways have paid taxes to the
State worth five billion yuan (602.4 million US dollars) from
their off-track operations.

<HEADLINE> Airlines in Kuwait Agree to Raise Fares to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Ten airlines operating in
Kuwait had greed to raise their air fares to Indian destinations
to pre-1994 levels on a "rescue mission" for their operation.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement signed by the 10 airlines, including Kuwait
Airways, Air India, Oman Air, Gulf Air, Air Lanka and Qatar
Airways Monday, came in the wake of a dramatic drop in air fares
to the subcontinent and other Asian destinations. It will come
into effect from October 20.
</P>
<P>
According to the new agreement, a return ticket to Bombay or
Delhi which three years ago cost 212 Kuwait dinars (699
U.S. dollars) and is available for 120 dinars (396 U.S. dollars)
now, will increase to 190 dinars (627 U.S. dollars) from October
20.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a one-way ticket has been increased from 78 dinars
(257 U.S. dollars) to 124 dinars (409 U.S. dollars), a rise by
over 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement which only applies to Indian destinations
has also stipulated that air fares to other cities have been
increased by similar margins.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here noted that this was the first sign
marking a joint effort by the airlines here to end the price war.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the airlines have agreed to unify
their direct and non-direct flight fares. There are more than 30
airlines operating in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
It is to be seen if the agreement will ever be
implemented. Airlines in Kuwait have a bad record regarding
agreements of this kind, travel agents said.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, 13 foreign airlines flying the Asian
lines agreed on a minimum price limit for various
destinations. But it was not long after the accord came into
effect, the limit was broken by themselves.
</P>
<P>
Ticket prices for both the direct and transit flights from
Kuwait to various Asian destinations dropped to unprecedented
low this month.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Africa Rejects U.S-led Crisis Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S.Secretary of State
Warren Christopher yesterday completed his five-nation African
tour aimed at enhancing Washington's role in Africa but his
attempts to win over support on the African Crisis Response Force
(ACRF) were largely a failure.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit by a U.S. secretary of state to
sub-saharan Africa in the past six years. Christopher has visited
Mali, Ethiopia, Tanzania, South Africa and Angola, in addition to
a call on the headquarters of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) based in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
According to Christopher,the ACRF should be formed by about
10,000 troops from several African countries, and be trained,
equipped and sponsored by the United States and its western
allies.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. would like the force to be operational within four to
six months to deploy rapidly into African conflicts, Christopher
told his host leaders.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States has undertaken to pay a quarter of
the estimated 40 million U.S. Dollars cost of training the
pan-African force and has pledged an additional 10 million
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Christopher has only collected endorsements from Mali and
Ethiopia on his tour and his assistant George Moose is reported
to have won approval from "several other African nations" on an
earlier visit last month.
</P>
<P>
But Secretary-general of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU), Salim Ahmed Salim, said African leaders had concerns about
the U.S. plan and pressed Christopher to respond.
</P>
<P>
Salim, after private talks with Christopher, said the OAU had
concerns as to why Washington approached only 10 of the 47
sub-Saharan African states to join the force, who would command
it, how long-term funding could be guaranteed, and who would own
the military equipment donated by the U.S and its allies?
</P>
<P>
The OAU leader urged Washington to hold broader consultations
with more African countries publicly.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, which is one of the biggest military power in
the continent, Christopher also met with a soft rebuff.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela told him that the initiative for the
ACRF should come from the United Nations, but not from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after talks with Christopher, Mandela
said such a force would have to enjoy widespread support from
Africa.
</P>
<P>
"It should be in the interest of Africa to have such a
peacekeeping force," he said, adding any such plan would have to
be discussed with the OAU and the Southern African Development
Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
If not, he said, his ccountry will not support the U.S-led
ACRF.
</P>
<P>
"We are part of the U.N. and part of the OAU. If we are asked
by them, and we have the capacity, we will discuss it among
ourselves," he said at a joint press conference with Christopher.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Christopher's African tour, the South African
Press Association said in a report that the visit "turned into a
fiasco".

<P>
GENEVA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- World swimming's governing body
FINA said on Monday it had reclaimed control of the swimming
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
FINA director Cornel Marculescu said it did so at the request

</P>
<P>
FINA told the federations it was not prepared to let the
series continue to be called the World Cup unless it was
involved.
</P>
<P>
"For the last two years FINA has not been involved and we have
just allowed the federations to use the word "world' in the
competition," Marculescu said.
</P>
<P>
"The competition has taken on much greater importance
recently and the level keeps getting higher. From now on the
World Cup will be run under FINA rules and its control."

<HEADLINE> High Development of Agriculture in Wuxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Wuxi, the birth
place of China's rural industry, are taking the lead in developing
modernized agriculture in China.
</P>
<P>
Less than 18 percent of the workforce in rural Wuxi, a
richly-endowed place in east China's Jiangsu Province, are engaged
in agricultural production. Most workers go in for rural
industry. The per capita annual income of farmers has reached
about 4,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
More than 96 percent of Wuxi's farmlands were sown with
improved rice and wheat strains.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the city has built 20,000 hectares of
high-yield land, with each hectare producing eight tons of grain a
year.
</P>
<P>
Over 23,000 ha of medium and low-yield fields in the city have
been transformed into fertile farmland.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990 and 1995, the local government invested 234
million yuan in purchasing farm machinery, and almost 500 million
yuan on water conservancy projects.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of towns and villages in Wuxi have set up
agro-science stations and service centers, to help farmers use
modern farm tools and techniques and improve field management.
</P>
<P>
It is usual practice for a dozen experienced farmers to
contract 20 ha or more land, and work together.
</P>
<P>
During harvest period, 2,000 combined harvesters gathered all
the crops in just three days.

<P>
HAIKOU, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Hainan's private economy has
provided jobs for more than 200,000 unemployed people, thanks to
an annual growth rate of over 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
By the first half of this year, some 14,700 private enterprises
had been registered in Hainan, China's largest island province,
with a combined registered capital of 17.4 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The province ranks the first in China, both in terms of the
number of private firms and in the amount of registered capital.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 percent of the privately-run firms in Hainan are either
Sino-Foreign joint ventures, or businesses built by investors in
other Chinese provinces.
</P>
<P>
The private firms produce an annual output value of
approximately three billion yuan, or about seven percent of
Hainan's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Private business in Hainan has been shifted from small-scale
management to intensified management over recent years, from small
commerce and catering trade to tropical highly-efficient
agriculture, processing business, tourism and high-tech
development.

LUSAKA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- About 43 percent of all
hospital beds in Zambia have been occupied by AIDS patients, the
post newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted a policy document by Ms-Zambia, a
Danish aid project, as estimating that 33 percent of the urban
people and 15 to 20 percent of the rural people are HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
Ms-Zambia identified AIDS as a major deterrent to both
economic and social development in the country.
</P>
<P>
On the economic sector, AIDS has been blamed for loss of vast
working hours and for reduced productivity.
</P>
<P>
"There is a marked loss of man hours as nationals are away
from work looking after the sick, being sick themselves or being
absent as they are dead," said the document.
</P>

The Danish project has since last year spent five billion
Kwacha (about four million U.S. Dollars) on community-based
projects in Zambia.

<HEADLINE> China Successfully Launches Experiments on Space breeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Out-of-this-world rice will
help to feed China's growing population at the dawning of the new
century.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have turned to space to breed a high-yield
version of the country's staple food.
</P>
<P>
They believe that breeding rice seeds in retrievable satellites
in space will boost crops by at least a fifth.
</P>
<P>
And they see propagation in the upper atmosphere as the way
forward. The scientists have successfully launched seven
experiments, breeding 300 kinds of crops of 51 categories in
space. The seeds were carried into space aboard retrivable remote
sensing satellites.
</P>
<P>
Nine years of work by Chinese breeders have indicated that the
space processed seeds can produce variabilities that will not
appear on the earth, resulting in much higher yields.
</P>
<P>
According to a scientist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
space is the ideal growing environment, with its micro gravity,
high-vacuum, super clean, strong-radiation and big temperature
differences compared to the earth.
</P>
<P>
He said that all the conditions are favorable for the
development of high-yield, quality and early-maturing crop seeds.
</P>
<P>
Chinese breeders said that space-bred rice could increase
production by some 20 percent, and green peppers by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province has already grown space
developed rice and green pepper seeds on over 300 hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
Now China is launching a space breeding project, and a
satellite disaster-relief system project, and will launch an earth
resources satellite soon.
</P>
<P>
The country will make more efforts in the next decade for the
industrialization of space technology.
</P>
<P>
China launched its first man-made satellite in 1970 and has
already sent a total of 47 satellites to the sky, including 10
foreign ones.
</P>
<P>
China has also carried out various kinds of piggyback
experiments, with the help of retrievable satellites.

<HEADLINE> Exam Exemption System Suspended to Halt Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The practice of allowing
selected students to proceed directly to post-secondary schools
without writing entrance examinations will be suspended for one
year while guidelines are rewritten to avoid abuse, according to
today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The guidelines were meant to give an exemption to top academic
achievers recommended by senior middle schools, Zhou Liming, an
official with the State Education Commission (SEC) said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
However, because some schools recommended students based on
criteria other than academic ability, the program was vulnerable
to abuse, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
The SEC will work out improved regulations to ensure top
achievers are the ones winning the exemptions before the program
is resumed, likely in 1998, said Zhou, an official from the
College Students Affairs Department under the SEC.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations will prevent schools from submitting the
names of their top students ahead of scheduled times, to ensure
regular teaching schedules and curricula are carried out without
disruption, said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
The exemption system was instituted in the mid-1980s, whereby
top senior middle school students could earn an exemption, and
thus allowing many colleges and universities to recruit excellent
students ahead of exam results.
</P>
<P>
However, some problems emerged during the implementation of the
recommendation system, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Some schools were pressured into recommending students not
worthy of the exemption, because their relatives were government
officials, or provide financial support to the schools.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Won't Join European Rate Mechanism Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Prime Minister Goran
Persson said today that it was not the right time now to discuss
whether to link his country's currency, the Krona, with the
European Rate Mechanism (ERM).
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the answer would be negative if the
Swedish parliament and citizens were now asked to vote on the
nation's proposed entry into the ERM.
</P>
<P>
The ERM is designed to maintain monetary stability among
European Union member states on the way to a single European
currency. Currency stability is a criteria for the launching in
1999 of the single European currency.
</P>
<P>
Sweden was planning to announce whether to bring its krona into
the ERM by autumn of next year, Persson told a press conference,
after he attended a meeting of the Nordic Socialist Democratic
Parties Cooperation Committee here.
</P>
<P>
Before then, the Swedish government would fully weigh the pros
and cons over its proposed entry into EMR, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Sweden would have to meet the economic and monetary
criteria specified in the Maastricht Treaty for joining the
European Economic and Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
The country could immediately participate in the economic and
monetary union, if the Swedish people agreed, when the third stage
of the union was completed on the target date of January 1, 1999,
added the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish government, last Saturday, announced that the
nation's currency, the markka, would join the European Rate
Mechanism this month.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's Finance Minister Erik Asbrink said the Finnish move
would not influence his country's policy-making.

<HEADLINE> Chile's Children Return to School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Chile's three million school
children returned to school today, after the nation's 120,000
teachers ended their 13-day strike for better pay.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from the Teachers' Union and the Education Ministry
reached an agreement minutes before midnight Sunday. The ministry
promised to double its budget for teachers' pay between 1997 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
The ministry agreed to increase its 1997 budget proposals for
teachers' salaries by 20 percent, from 25 billion pesos (about 60
million U.S. dollars) to 30 billion pesos. It also promised to
further increase its budget for teachers pay to 60 billion pesos
in 1998, doubling that of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Jose Pablo Arellano, minister of education, said the agreement
meant better pay for the teachers in 1997 and 1998, "over and
above the general adjustments that will be granted to public
sector employees in the country this December."
</P>
<P>
Union leader Jorge Pavez said he was satisfied with the deal,
but added that "it is still not enough". He said a national
assembly of the union would be called this week to inform teachers
of the details of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to work with the Education Ministry to formalize
a program to recover the hours lost by the strike and finish the
school year within a normal schedule," Pavez said.

<HEADLINE> China Begins Alligators' Performance Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have made a
breakthough in the taming of the fierce-charactered Chinese
alligators, which are the country's first-class protected species.
</P>
<P>
A group of tamers, from Anhui's Chinese Alligator Breeding
Research Institution, chose six 30-to-50 kg adult alligators for a
taming program at the beginning of this year. The biggest 'gator
is 1.85 meter in length.
</P>
<P>
Now the three-strong group, including 30-year woman researcher
Chen Donghua, can ask the tamed alligators to perform a series of
clever stunts.
</P>
<P>
They include, "fighting with alligators," "sleeping with
alligators," "putting hands into the mouths of alligators" and
"alligator dancing."
</P>
<P>
Wang Chaolin, deputy director of the research Institution, said
further contact with the alligators paved way for the future
development of alligators.
</P>
<P>
As the taming period was very short, he said, some of the
performing acts are not mature.
</P>
<P>
He added that researchers will begin the taming of newly born
alligators.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese alligator is one of the world's two kinds of fresh
water alligators to inhabit the middle and lower reaches of
Yangtze River, China's longest river.
</P>
<P>
China established the world's first alligator breeding research
center in Xuancheng in Anhui Province in east China in 1983. After
more than a decade of efforts, the country has realized artificial
breeding and raising of Chinese alligators.
</P>
<P>
The number of alligators in China has risen in just ten years
from 500 to some 5,000.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Welcomes Human Rights Panel's Findings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
welcomed the final report of the National Commission on Human
Rights (Komnas Ham) on the July 27 riots in the capital city of
Jakarta, the official news agency Antara reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The government appreciates the findings as they reflect the
seriousness on the part of the commission to collect data and
information about the riots," Coordinating Minister for Political
Affairs and Security Soesilo Soedarman said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In its long- and much-awaited final report released last
Saturday, the Komnas Ham announced that five people were killed,
one of whom died from a gunshot wound, in the worst riots in the
city in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
It said that 149 were injured and 23 went missing.
</P>
<P>
The 21-member panel said the riots were caused by the violent
takeover of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) headquarters in
central Jakarta by supporters of new party leader Soerjadi from
supporters of ousted party chief Megawati Sukarnoputri.
</P>
<P>
"The takeover of the PDI headquarters was an action carried out
violently by the Soerjadi camp and its supporters together with
security forces," said the panel.
</P>
<P>
Soesilo Soedarman said that the findings would serve as inputs
for the government and would be followed up.
</P>
<P>
"Further checking will be done on the report," he said.
</P>
<P>
On July 27, clashes broke out when supporters of PDI new leader
Soerjadi took over the party's headquarters which had been
occupied by Megawati's supporters.
</P>
<P>
According to official reports, four people died and at least 22
buildings, 91 cars and two motorcycles were destroyed and burned
during the riots.
</P>
<P>
Megawati, daughter of Indonesia's late first president Sukarno,
was elected in 1993 to a five-year term as the party leader. She
was ousted by the breakaway faction in June at a congress in
Medan, North Sumatra. Soerjadi was installed as the new PDI leader
at the congress.

JAKARTA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Competition in world trade will
grow tighter in the 21st century, for which Indonesia has to
prepare itself especially by promoting its human resources, an

<HEADLINE> CSIC Wins Property Rights Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- China Shipping Industrial Co
(CSIC) won a property rights infringement case, with the
defendants, three other companies, ordered to pay more than 11
million yuan (1.3 million US dollars) in compensation to the
shipping company, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 engineers and technicians gave up their jobs in
the 718 Office of the Seventh Research Institute under the CSIC in
Handan, a city in north China's Hebei Province in July of
1992. Because they were offered jobs by the Jiangsu Wuxian
Economic and Technological Development Co, sources from the CSIC
said.
</P>
<P>
The engineers and technicians used "confidential technology"
they had brought with them and set up their own hydrogen generator
plant in Wuxian and Tianjin, the Handan Intermediate Court said on
Thursday last week.
</P>
<P>
The technology was about making hydrogen through water
electrolysis that the Seventh Research Institute spent years
developing.
</P>
<P>
This resulted in great profits for their companies and
considerate losses for the CSIC, the court said after two years
of intensive investigations.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the compensation, the defendants are under a court
order to keep the pirated technology secret, according to the
court's Thursdays decision.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Relief Remains an Arduous Task in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The poverty-relief program in
China will require commitment and hard work to complete, "China
Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that China has successfully lifted 7 million
rural residents out of poverty over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Despite this achievement, there are still 65 million people
living in abject poverty. Most of them live in plateau,
mountainous and desert areas under harsh conditions with little
access to transportation and communication.
</P>
<P>
The government has pledged to help these people overcome
poverty before the next century and the task is enormous, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The local governments' use of poverty-relief funds, tended in
the past to pursue large industrial programs, but neglected
agricultural development. Relief funds benefitted only those
employed by these programs, and passed over many of the poor
people.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 75 percent of the government's financial
allocation, or half of all poverty-relief funds, are used to
subsidize poor counties' administrative expenditures and
employees' wages instead of being injected into production.
</P>
<P>
The current credit system in poverty-relief programs also tends
to benefit those who are not poor.
</P>
<P>
To alter the situation and let loans go directly to poor
farmers, the grants should no longer be put under the charge of
commercial banks. Instead, special policy credit institutions,
such as agricultural development banks at county and district
levels, should be set up in poor areas, as suggested by experts.
</P>
<P>
To root out poverty, poverty-relief funds alone are not
enough. It is of greater significance to equip farmers with
science and technology so they can make money on their own.
</P>
<P>
Relief programs should tilt in favour of agricultural
development because they are mostly familiar to farmers and in the
most direct contact with farmers' food and clothing needs. About
80 percent of relief-funds should be invested in agricultural
development.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Plans to Boost Exports by Clearing Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Commerce Ministry
has come up with a proposal to clear out existing export stocks
quickly as part of its plan to boost sluggish exports, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The proposal will initially focus on getting rid of garment
stocks at factory prices, followed by 17 other sectors with poor
export performances.
</P>
<P>
Garments will be aggressively marketed to 10 low-end markets,
including some Middle East countries, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Three major stocks clearance promotion sales are scheduled to
be held at the end of November in Bangkok, the northeastern city
of Nakhon Ratchasima and the southern city of Hat Yai.
</P>
<P>
Importers from neighboring countries will be invited to the
three fairs.
</P>
<P>
The Export Promotion Department is planning to organize stocks
clearing fairs for other slow-performing sectors, such as plastic
products, rubber products, synthetic fibers, frozen squid, fresh
fish, canned food, shoes, toys, ceramics, frozen chicken, frozen
shrimp and artificial flowers.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, 18 of Thailand's major export items
recorded considerable sales slowdown totaling 6 to 7 billion baht
(240 to 280 million US dollars) in the first seven months this
year, compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The poor performances have been blamed on a worldwide economic
slowdown, trade barriers in importing countries, and the weakening
competitiveness of Thai products.

</P>
<P>
The company has spent six years studying and developing this
new bioplastic. Recent tests showed the plastic decomposed
completely in two months.
</P>
<P>
Plastics are widely used, but their inability to decompose has

Neste has started test producing the new bioplastic for use in
packaging. The bioplastic also has potential for use in garbage
bags and baby diapers.

<HEADLINE> Hainan to Use Foreign Loan for Vanilla Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A 130-million yuan drive to
challenge the world's vanilla producing market is to be launched
in China.
</P>
<P>
Officials see the sweet scent of success in growing the popular
natural food flavoring in a world market demanding more "green"
products.
</P>
<P>
Hainan Province in China's southernmost part is to use a loan
from Asian Development Bank (ADB) to build vanilla growing
plantations and processing plants.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the entire project will cost a
total investment of 130 million yuan (15.66 million US dollars),
of which, half funded with the ADB loan.
</P>
<P>
The officials said vanilla will be grown on 133 hectares in
areas, including Tunchang and Qiongshan of the province, and an
auxiliary processing factory, with annual production capacity of
800,000 tons, will also be built.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, farmers from neighboring areas will be helped
to go in for specialized plantations on large tracts of land, or
plantations on a scattered basis, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
Vanilla is a kind of tropical orchids. The flavoring agent is
widely used in culinary and commercial foods, perfumery, and
medicines.
</P>
<P>
The principal sources are Madagascar, Comoro Islands, and
Reunion, as well as Mexico, Uganda and Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
Hainan is one of the few places in the world where the climate
is suitable for vanilla growing.  But due to investment factors,
and a long growing period, the province now only grows 66 hectares
of vanilla plant.
</P>
<P>
Dong Hui, general manager of Hainan Damei Vanilla Corporation,
which is also responsible for the implementation of the whole
project, said that he is confident of the success of the project,
as green food is becoming more popular, and natural
flavoring agents are selling well on international markets.
</P>
<P>
According to Dong, the investment will be recovered within
seven years from the time the basic facilities of the project are
finished.
</P>
<P>
The project will promote economic development in central Hainan,
and is expected to be able to create job opportunities for 2,000
people.

MONTEVIDEO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
news briefs from the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) over the
last few days:
</P>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO -- The Mercosur and Japan will increase
bilateral trade, said Jose Botafogo, undersecretary general of
Foreign Trade and Economic Integration Matters for Brazil's
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
During Japanese Foreign Minister Kazuo Ogura's recent visit to
Brazil, the two sides decided to hold meetings to discuss the
development of their trade relations. According to Botafogo, Japan
was very interested in the Mercosur's mining, food, energy, steel,
chemical and automobile sectors.
</P>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil's trade deficit is expected to reach
at least six billion U.S. dollars in 1997, an increase of 100
percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to Brazil's Ministry of Industry, Commerce and
Tourism, the rise could be attributed to an expansion of economic
activities in 1997 which would stimulate the imports of capital
goods and raw materials.
</P>
<P>
During the first nine months of this year, the nation's trade
deficit reached 1.3 billion dollars and was expected to exceed
three billion dollars by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- The Argentine government has begun to impose
basic requisites for textile products and footwear.
</P>
<P>
It stipulates that they must have complete information on the
country of origin and quality on labels in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
SAO PAULO -- The most important unions in the Mercosur
countries and Chile will meet in this city on October 17 to study
the possibility of a strike throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
The strike was designed to demonstrate the unions' opposition
to the neoliberal model for development implemented by most of the
countries in this region.
</P>
<P>
QUITO -- The Agriculture and Livestock Ministry in Ecuador
will control the exports of Ecuadoran bananas to Mercosur
countries to prevent lower prices caused by excessive exports.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador exported about 98 million boxes of bananas worth 466
million U.S. dollars during the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
MADRID -- The meetings between the Mercosur and the European
Union will be held in the Brazilian city of Bello Horizonte on
November 5-7 to prepare the ground for free trade between the two
blocs, according to European Commission sources.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first meeting of the trade subcommittees from
the two blocs.
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- Bolivia and Mercosur countries will sign a free
trade agreement during the Mercosur summit to be held in
Fortaleza, Brazil, in December.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Bolivia will be able to export 1,300 kinds
of products to Mercosur countries and import 500 kinds of
products, all tariff-free, as of January 1, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Waive Taxes on Imports of Machinery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Thai ministers in charge of
economic affairs Monday approved a proposal by the Board of
Investment (BOI) to waive tax on imports of machinery for six
sectors to improve the competitiveness of Thai industries.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Government House, the BOI will be
authorized to grant tax exemptions on imports of machinery for the
six sectors, regardless of their locations.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only those projects located in Zone III, which
covers rural areas excluding Bangkok and its neighboring
provinces, enjoy tax exemptions on imports of machinery.
</P>
<P>
The six sectors are basic transport projects, basic utilities,
environmental projects, technology-related projects, basic
industries, and projects which export more than 80 percent of
their total output.
</P>
<P>
The basic transport projects include those on mass transit, oil
pipeline, and road construction which could help ease the traffic
chaos in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The basic utilities include those on tap water and water
supplies for industrial uses, while the basic industries include
steel, petrochemicals, and pulp making.

<HEADLINE> Indian Court Extends Bail for Ex-PM in Forgery Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Former Indian prime minister
P.V. Narasimha Rao Monday won a three-week extension of bail in a
forgery case in which he was charged as a co-accused, the
Hindustan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Rao has been accused of conspiring with others a few years ago
in fabricating documents designed to defame former prime minister
V.P. Singh and his son.
</P>
<P>
Delhi Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Prem Kumar, who is in
charge of the trial of the case, deferred hearing till October 30
by extending the bail which expired Monday.
</P>
<P>
The anticipatory bail for Rao was first issued by the Delhi
High Court last Wednesday in the context that there was the need
to find a new trial venue for the forgery case due to perceived
threats to the life of Rao.
</P>
<P>
In its order issued Sunday evening, India's Supreme Court
further extended the period of the anticipatory bail by one week
beyond the passage of any order by the trial court of Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate Kumar Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kumar, who actually extended the bail by another three weeks,
said he made the decision on the basis of the order of the Apex
Court.

The options include a coalition agreement with either the Labor

<HEADLINE> Bad Financial News Leads to Falling Stock Index </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The poor performance of the
Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) on Monday was linked to bad
financial news which increased investor jitters, according to
analysts.
</P>
<P>
The SET index fell 14.56 points, or 1.56 percent, on Monday to
close at 918.31 points, the lowest level since July 1993, on a
total trading turnover of 2,878.66 million baht (115.15 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The nosedive was led by the building, banking and finance
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Among the bad news was a report that the Singapore-based
Political and Economic Risk Consultancy has handed down a higher
risk rating for Thailand. The agency pointed to the upcoming
elections next month and the export slowdown for the most part of
the year.
</P>
<P>
Stock exchange analysts also attributed the continued
bearishness on the bourse to fragile investor sentiment shaken by
rumors that local financial institutions have been hurt by
involvement in the ailing property sector.
</P>
<P>
Others blamed the decline on the increase in fixed deposit
rates by some banks, which had thwarted any hope that lending
rates would fall in the near term, which in turn prompted
investors, particularly foreigners, to worry about the cash inflow
position of the property sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group of small local investors plan to submit an
urgent letter this week to SET authorities, urging them to
implement more concrete measures to halt the continued declines on
the SET.
</P>
<P>
Political uncertainty and an economic slowdown in the country
have left the SET bearish since the House of Representatives was
dissolved late last month by Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa.

<HEADLINE> Experts Offer Chorus Of Praise For China's Singing Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A singing desert in China has
amazed experts because of its unique melodic music.
</P>
<P>
And they believe that the ultimate 'Desert Song' experience
could become one of the country's newest tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
Chinese desert experts have discovered that the Badain Jaran
Desert, China's second largest desert, is an extremely large
"singing desert", producing various sounds - even when there is no
wind.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Lanzhou Institute of Deserts, attached to the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, said entering the 49,200-km desert in
Inner Mongolia High Plateau, sounds can be heard like flying
planes. Normally deserts sing when there is wind, but in the
Badain Jaran the "songs" and melodious music could be heard almost
everywhere in the desert, without even the slightest breeze.
</P>
<P>
Sand hills in shapes of a new moon, and pyramids, are scattered
around the desert, usually climbing to between 200 meters and 500
meters in height.
</P>
<P>
The singing sands are usually found on windswept beaches and
deserts, but experts say no singing sand area spanning such a
large space has even been discovered in the world.
</P>
<P>
Qu Jianjun, an expert from the Lanzhou Institute of Desert said
the long-term movement of sand caused by winds from different
directions has made the sand very clean, with each grain of sand
similar in size with tiny cellular holes.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the sand singing to the frictional resonance of
sand grains that have this unique surface structure.
</P>
<P>
The singing desert and 144 inland lakes in the desert, have
created a unique natural desert scenic spot, and the desert is a
good place for desert tourism, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Ruehe: U.S. Role in NATO Will Diminish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States' position in the
new NATO will be diminished, while Europe will play a balancing
role, says German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the Economic Committee of the
Christian Democratic Union in Berlin, Ruehe pointed out that
France listed this principle as a condition for its joining the
fundamentally changed military organisation.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, Germany would support the French, Ruehe said.
</P>
<P>
The new NATO created for Europe the "possibility of acting
independently," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to reform of the alliance, he said it was undertaking
unimaginable weight-losing, including reducing the number of the
military establishments and halving headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of NATO's eastward expansion, the minister stressed
that it wasn't intended to aggrandize or enlarge NATO's range and
power, nor to promote the effectiveness of its old military
structure, but to open it to countries with self-determination,
democracy and free market systems.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe noted that it was clear to Russia that it had no right of
veto in NATO's expansion. It was also clear to Russia that the
alliance was to establish a "new partnership" with it.
</P>
<P>
The West was trying to sign an agreement with Moscow in a bid
to modify future cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Western countries also suggested setting up a Russia-NATO
Committee to discuss ways of solving crisis arising in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Sign Nuclear Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will sign the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty despite what it calls the
treaty's inability to halt all nuclear testing activities,
according to its national news agency Bernama today.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia had supported the enabling resolution ... and will
sign the treaty out of realization that an imperfect treaty is
better than no treaty," Malaysian Alternate Permanent
Representative to the U.N. Hasmy Agam was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hasmy told a U.N. meeting on disarmament and international
security in New York yesterday that Malaysia made the decision
because even though the treaty, adopted on September 10, could not
end all nuclear testing activities, it could at least suppress
nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
"While we regret that the treaty will not put an end to all
forms and manners of testing of nuclear weapon devices, the treaty
would halt or at the very least strongly inhibit nuclear testing
as we know it," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, in his recent
address at the U.N. General Assembly, criticized the treaty as
flawed and deficient in enforcing nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Hasmy said Malaysia also hoped that a review of the Nuclear
Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) early next year would consider
further steps to be taken by member countries to fulfill their
obligations to the treaty, and seriously consider how to bring the
few countries outside the treaty to realize its importance.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is a signatory of the Southeast Asia Nuclear
Weapon-Free Zone adopted in December 1995 for regional peace and
security.

<P>
WUHAN, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Young men and women who show
respect and care for their elders have been rewarded by Cheng
Qimu, an ordinary farmer in Zhicheng City, central China's Hubei
Province.
</P>
<P>
Cheng made a fortune when he contracted some 1,700 hectares of
farmland. For the past nine years he has been offering 10,000 yuan
annually to the city's dutiful sons and daughters on a voluntary
basis. It is his way of promoting cultural and ideological
progress in rural society.
</P>
<P>
"Over recent years, an increasing number of rural young people
have realized the importance of science and technology, which
provides them with access to a richer life, " said Cheng.
</P>
<P>
But he held that the promotion of cultural and ideological
progress, including carrying forward such traditional virtues as
respect and care for the elderly, is more important than material
progress.
</P>
<P>
"It helps to forge a better relationship among members of both
rich families and comparatively poor families, thus offering an
access to a happier life," said Cheng.
</P>
<P>
Cheng's move has drawn positive response from the public,
resulting in a drive of support and respect for the city's elderly
people.

<HEADLINE> Non-Traditional Faces Seen on College Campuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 15 (Xinhua) -- After working 21 years as a
grassroots cadre in the Jiangbei District in Ningbo, Zhang Suying,
a "Granny" as called by most of the people she knows, has claimed
a new identity: she is a college student.
</P>
<P>
Granny Zhang said that she had never dreamed of entering
college at her age. Yet she enrolled in an administration course
in Ningbo Education College, along with 42 classmates, after
passing an examination sponsored by the city's education
commission in late September.
</P>
<P>
"Even neighborhood committee workers need to learn more,"
Granny Zhang said, smiling. In the next two years, she will
continue her work in community affairs five days a week, and
attend classes on Saturdays and Sundays. She must complete ten
courses before she can graduate.
</P>
<P>
Granny Zhang is not alone among the non-traditional students
found at today's college campuses. Village cadres and
businesspeople are also entering college for self-improvement.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Normal University became the first in China to enroll
village cadres, when 100 village party chiefs became students
in 1994. They received two years of regular education.
</P>
<P>
The program has since become quite popular in the province, and
hundreds of village cadres are getting a college education every year.
</P>
<P>
When teachers in Hangzhou University decided to enroll students
for an advanced business and trade training program last August in
Yiwu, one of the country's biggest distribution centers of small
commodities, they expected no more than 30 people would apply for
admission.
</P>
<P>
To their surprise, more than 200 local small commodities
traders registered on the same day the enrolment notice was issued.
</P>
<P>
A forty-something trader wrote on his application form, "I think
nothing of diplomas. The important thing is that I can learn
something here. The more one learns, the bigger one's business
will become."
</P>
<P>
These out-of-the-ordinary faces seen on China's campuses are a
sign of social development, a social worker concluded.
</P>
<P>
"Ordinary people are setting new requirements for both the
quality of life and their own accomplishments," the worker said.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Farmers Favor fewer Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Many farmers in north
China's Hebei Province have changed their ideas on what
constitutes "happy families".
</P>
<P>
They have realized that having just one child later in marriage
is perfect.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qingshan, a farmer in Doujiazhuang Village in Xinji city,
explained why he likes the idea of a smaller family.
</P>
<P>
"Several years ago, we had on average two mu (15 mu is
equivalent to one hectare) of farmland, but now we have only one
mu. If it was not for the policy of family planning, the share of
farmland for each person would keep dropping. How could our future
generations make a living, if we had not practiced the family
planning?" said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Like Wang, more farmers in the village have come to realize the
need for family planning, which has made it easier to control a
population explosion.
</P>
<P>
Feng Jinkun, secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Branch of
Doujiazhuang Village, said that since villagers prefer giving
birth to fewer children, the village-run primary school will have
fewer students in five or six years.
</P>
<P>
Many farmers in Zhoutou Village of Jinzhou, another city in
Hebei Province, also favor fewer children.
</P>
<P>
Some younger couples have given up thoughts of a second child,
even though two offspring are permitted.
</P>
<P>
Pan Jiangxia, a 28-year-old woman in the village, has just
given birth to a baby, several years after marriage.
</P>
<P>
She said, "I think it is bad for the education of children, and
their upbringing, to give birth to more children."
</P>
<P>
Many farmers also think that giving birth to fewer children
will improve their standard of living.
</P>
<P>
Businessman Cao Jiangyi didn't become a father until he was 30.
</P>
<P>
He said, " We used to be very poor. So, it made no difference
whether we had one child or two or three children. But now things
are different. To raise one more child means that you have to
spend more money, as well as energy. This will reduce your income
and debase your living standard."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the view that now it does not matter whether
your child is a boy or girl.
</P>
<P>
According to Jinzhou's Mayor, Fu Shiwu, most farmers have
changed their concept of child birth because, with economic
growth, they have come to realize family planning is in their best
interests.

<P>
CHENGDU, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Nanning County, inhabited
mainly by ethnic groups, earned some 14 million yuan in 1991. And
it yielded a financial income of more than 40 million yuan last
year.
</P>
<P>
Local officials in the county, in southwest China's Sichuan
Province, attributed the achievement to science and technology
progress in the region.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan has an ethnic population of 4.89 million, ranking the
sixth in the country. In the ethnic group-inhabited pastoral
areas, there are more than 6,400 schools, including five
institutions of higher learning, 25 secondary technical schools,
and 300 middle schools.
</P>
<P>
There is a force of 12,000 scientific and technical personnel
in the province. And farming technique promotion centers have been
set up throughout the province.
</P>
<P>
Last year grain output in the ethnic group-inhabited areas
reached 2.42 million tons, 170,000 tons more than in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Tibetans in the Aba Autonomous Prefecture of ethnic Qiang and
Tibetan Ethnic Groups, used to have difficulties yielding
enough 'qingko' barley, the local staple food. After the acreage
of high-yield farmlands expanded in the prefecture, the output
of 'qingko' barley has greatly increased, and basically solved the
supply problems for the Tibetans.

<P>
SARAJEVO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N.-led International
Police Task Force (IPTF) will replace the Western European Union
(WEU) in maintaining law and order in the southern Bosnian town of
Mostar, a European official said today.
</P>
<P>
The change of hands will take place after midnight when the
mandate for the WEU police expires, said Dragan Gasic, spokesman
for the EU administration in Mostar.
</P>
<P>
But the 50-strong IPTF team will only assume the task of
monitoring and issuing guidelines for local police forces in the
town, while security for the city will be provided by Muslim and
Croat police, Gasic said.
</P>
<P>
Muslims and Croats have yet to agree on forming a joint police
force in Mostar, which is normally controlled by a unitary city
government but in reality still divided into two areas controlled
separately by the two ethnic groups.

<HEADLINE> Problems Remain in Implementing Oil-for-Food Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- German Ambassador Tono
Eitel, chairman of the Iraqi sanctions committee, said here today
that there were still some problems in implementation of the
oil-for-food formula.
</P>
<P>
After the 144th meeting of the Security Council Committee
Established by Resolution 661 Concerning the Situation Between
Iraq and Kuwait, known as the Iraqi sanctions committee, he
briefed the press that one problem was the number of the
independent inspection agents. Another was about the freedom of
movement, as Iraq wanted advanced notice, he added.
</P>
<P>
But, the U.N. secretary-general was confident that all of them
could be solved and no problem was insurmountable, he said.
</P>
<P>
The pricing mechanism was also a barrier, which seemed a
difficult one for the Iraqi side, and amendments should be made on
the pricing mechanism when Security Council Resolution 986 became
operative, he said.
</P>
<P>
Though the U.N. secretariat considered the situation was not
mature and the secretariat was not ready yet for implementation of
the resolution, it believed that the time would come, he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq after its
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. In order to alleviate the
hardships of Iraqi people, the Security Council adopted Resolution
986 in April 1995, allowing Iraq to export oil worth 2 billion
dollars in six months for import of food, medicine and other civil
goods.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. secretariat and Iraq reached an accord on
implementation of Resolution 986 or the oil-for-food formula on
May 20 and some progress has been made since then.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Representative on World Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The international
community should work to achieve a real-term "new and equitable
global partnership," while endeavoring to narrow the gap of
economic growth between the developing and developed countries.
</P>
<P>
China's Deputy Permanent Representative to the U.N. Wang
Xuexian made the statement while addressing a meeting of the
Second Committee (on economic and financial issues) of the General
Assembly here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed to the inequality and irrationality in the world
economic system. The gap between developing and developed
countries is still widening, he said.
</P>
<P>
The per capita income of more than 100 countries with a total
population of 1.6 billion is lower now than what it was 15 years
ago, he said. International cooperation for development is
experiencing great difficulties, with stagnation and even
retrogression in such areas as finance, debts, trade and
technology transfer, he added.
</P>
<P>
Some major developed countries continue to practise
protectionism and unilateralism in international trade and
economic activities, Wang said, adding that they "emphasize in a
one-sided manner" the role of private capital and market mechanism
and minimize the government's responsibility in meeting their
commitments with regard to official development assistance.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador also called on some major countries to
respect the choice made independently by countries as to the path
and model of economic and social development, and mutually
beneficial cooperation. "Attempts to impose particular models of
development on other states on whatever ground, and the practice
of using aid as a leverage for exerting political pressure will
not contribute to forging a solid partnership, and should
therefore be abandoned," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang urged developed countries to change their "short-sighted
behavior of seeking only immediate benefits." They should make
further steps to solve effectively the debt problem of
heavily-indebted nations, lift trade restrictions and
expand market access, according to the Chinese ambassador.
</P>
<P>
He called for "full understanding and accommodation" to the
difficulties faced by the least developed countries and African
countries. He also emphasized the role of the United Nations in
promoting such a "new and equitable global partnership" proposed
at the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development (Earth
Summit), which was held in Brazil in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Algeria to Hold Referendum on Constitutional Revision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Algeria will hold another
referendum on constitutional revision on November 28, Algerian
President Liamine Zeroual announced this evening on Algerian
radio-television.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second constitutional revision for Algeria
since 1989 when the country revised its constitution to introduce
a multiparty political system.
</P>
<P>
But Algeria was plunged into violence and chaos after the
Islamic Salvation Front, a fundamentalist Muslim party, was
stripped of its electoral victory by the country's army following
the legislative election in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Zeroual said that the Algerian people will be asked to give
their opinions on four constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
The first amendment says that Algeria's national identity will
for the first time include three components: Islam, Arab and
Amazighite.
</P>
<P>
The last one is the Berber people who have been campaigning for
the recognition of their status as one of the components of the
Algerian nation, and the recognition of their language as one of
the official languages besides Arabic and French.
</P>
<P>
For the second amendment, the constitution is envisaged to
include a clause on the banning of the use of violence by any
political parties, and banning of the abuse of any of the national
identities -- notably Islam -- for political purpose by any
political groups.
</P>
<P>
The third amendment says that Algeria will set up a second
chamber of parliament which is aimed at "giving more stability to
the institutions of the state."
</P>
<P>
The fourth amendment says that Algeria will set up a Council of
State to exercise judicial supervision over the administration,
and set up a High Court of the State as a watchdog for
guaranteeing that the power given by the people to the president
is not abused.
</P>
<P>
Zeroual called on Algerians to make their choice with "liberty,
transparency and serenity."
</P>
<P>
"I commit myself today, before you, to respecting your
sovereign decision. Your choice will give a new boost to the
revision of the laws on political parties and electoral code,"
the president said, adding that laws on local and legislative
elections will also be revised in future.
</P>
<P>
The president also confirmed that Algeria will hold legislative
elections by the end of the first quarter of 1997, and will hold
local elections before the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that the state is doing everything to "finish the dregs
of terrorism while adopting a policy of clemency towards most of
the youths who have made a mistake by joining the terrorist
groups.
</P>
<P>
Zeroual said that Algeria is facing an "acute" economic and
social crisis that resulted from both a decade-long economic
stagnation and four years of sabotages by terrorists, who had cost
the country an estimated loss of at least 2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
At least 50,000 people have been killed since 1992 when Algeria
was plunged into a war between Islamic extremists and government
forces.

<HEADLINE> FBI Jails Man for Bomb Threat in Passenger Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) today arrested a man without bond in charge of
making a bomb threat that forced a USAir plane to make an
emergency landing, in which eight people were injured.
</P>
<P>
The man, Richard Josephson, 37, allegedly told a crew member of
the Boeing 757 during Sunday's flight from Philadelphia to Los
Angeles, that he had pipe bombs in his carry-on baggage. He then
took several pills and fell asleep and could not be awakened,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The plane, then devoted to Dayton, Ohio, and made a safe
emergency landing at the Dayton International Airport and
passengers were evacuated by emergency slide chutes during which
eight were slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
During the evacuation, Josephson awakened by fire officials,
said that 17 pounds of explosives were in his luggage and that he
planned to detonate it with a remote control detonation device in
his pocket.
</P>
<P>
Investigators searched the plane but no explosives were found.
And Josephson later told officials that the statement about
explosives being in his luggage was meant a joke.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Josephson could be sentenced to a maximum 20
years in prison for the incident.

<HEADLINE> Cease-Fire Monitoring Committee Discusses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The cease-fire monitoring
committee overseeing implementation of a cease-fire understanding
between Lebanon and Israel held today a six-hour meeting in a
south Lebanese border town to consider Lebanon's complaint
against the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the committee, which consists of the United
States, France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, left Naqoura without
making any statement when their meeting in the headquarters of
the U.N. peacekeeping forces in south Lebanon ended this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The committee held the fifth meeting after Lebanon filed to
the committee a complaint over bombardment of Israeli forces at
south Lebanese villages Friday, wounding 13 civilians and causing
serious damages.
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up following the signing of an April 26
cease-fire understanding between Lebanon and Israel, which put an
end to a 17-day Israeli blitz in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S.-brokered understanding, both the Israeli forces
and Lebanese guerrillas are banned from attacking civilian
targets or launching attacks from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
The official Lebanese National News Agency (LNNA) announced
that the meeting started this morning "on the basis of the
Lebanese complaint against the Israeli occupation forces for
their violation of the April understanding and bombardment Friday
night at Safad Al-Batikh."
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the bombardment at the town "deeply"
inside the western sector of south Lebanon led to the wounding of
13 civilians, including four seriously hurt and eight from a
single family, in addition to damages to houses and properties.
</P>
<P>
It said that the complaint was filed by the Lebanese
delegation Saturday to David Greenlee, chairman of the committee
and representative of the United States.
</P>
<P>
LNNA quoted Lebanese sources as saying that the Lebanese
delegation would not be satisfied with the complaint and would
not accept justification of apologization and acknowledgement of
mistake, but would ask "field investigation at the venue."
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese delegation accused the Israeli occupation forces
of using internationally-prohibited shells, including cluster
bombs, in the bombardment at Safad Al-Batikh, in a purpose to
cause as much casualties and damages as possible," the agency
underlined.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army said earlier that it shelled the village
after Hezbollah guerrillas "fired mortars from the outskirts of
Tavnin and Safad Al-Batikh."
</P>
<P>
After its fourth meeting on September 25, the cease-fire
monitoring committee issued a statement, calling on all parties
to stop under all circumstances "indiscriminate shelling" that
puts civilian lives in danger.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by Moslem guerrillas and bombardments and
air strikes by Israeli forces have constituted a daily scene in
south Lebanon, the last active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli
conflict.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Population Reaches 3,111,828 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's population comes to
3,111,827, among which 29.2 percent are those younger than 15
years old, according to the results of a census announced by the
Lebanese Ministry of Social Affairs today.
</P>
<P>
This was the first census since 1943 when the country won
independence. A previous one was conducted by the French
mandatory authority in 1932.
</P>
<P>
Beirut, the Lebanese capital, has a population of 407,403,
making it 13.1 percent of the country's total population, the
ministry said in a statement issued at a press conference
attended by Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and other senior
officials and foreign diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The country's total population is distributed in provinces as
follows: 1,145,458 in Mount Lebanon, 399,890 in the Beqaa,
670,609, in Northern Lebanon, 283,056 in Southern Lebanon,
205,412 in Nabatiyeh.
</P>
<P>
Among the total population, 29.2 percent are those under 15
years old, 63.8 percent are those whose age ranges from 15 to 65
and 6.9 percent are the citizens exceeding 65 years old. There is
a margin of 0.1 percent which the census does not specify.
</P>
<P>
An average Lebanese family is of 4.7 persons, according to the
census.
</P>
<P>
The illiterate rate of the Lebanese population amounts to 13.6
percent, or 9.2 percent of the men and 17.8 percent of the women.
</P>
<P>
Of the Lebanese families, 13.2 percent are single-parent ones
having no fathers, the census said, underlining that these
families "are suffering more than others economically and
socially."
</P>
<P>
The number of those who have emigrated since mid-1993 stands
at 23,501, including 19,973 men and 3,578 women, and of which
40.6 percent have received middle or secondary education, and
33.6 percent obtained academic degrees of bachelors or higher.
</P>
<P>
However, the census has bypassed a crucial problem on the
proportion of Lebanon's 17 religious and sectarian communities
according to which the country's political powers are distributed.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of this social nature, the parliament seats are
equally allocated to Christians and Moslems and redivided into
various communities according to their estimated proportions.
</P>
<P>
From the same reason, Lebanon's president is a Maronite
Catholic, house speaker a Moslem Shiite and prime minister a
Moslem Sunni.
