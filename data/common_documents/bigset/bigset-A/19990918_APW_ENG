<HEADLINE> Congressman's Widow Seeks His Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) -- The widow of 18-term Democratic  
Rep. George E. Brown is fighting nine contenders for her husband's 
seat in a race that's seen as an early test of the GOP's ability to 
hold on to or expand its majority in the House in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Marta Macias Brown faces a major challenge from a Democratic  
state senator in addition to her Republican opponent in the special 
election Tuesday to represent the district at the inland edge of 
Los Angeles' sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
	The 42nd District, former home of Kaiser Steel, has blue-collar  
roots and a Democratic edge in voter registration, but party 
allegiance isn't strong. Brown, who died in July at age 79, was on 
the GOP's hit list for years. Typical of off-year elections, the 
race is stirring less interest in the district than in Washington, 
where a fight over gun control is seen as a possible preview of 
next year's house elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``To some extent, it's a testing of the waters for both  
parties,'' said Michael LeMay, a political science professor at 
California State University, San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
	With 10 candidates, it is considered unlikely that anybody on a  
ballot this crowded can pull 50 percent of the vote to avoid a Nov. 
16 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brown, 54 and a longtime advocate for Hispanic issues who  
worked on her husband's staff, is concentrating her campaign 
against fellow Democrat Joe Baca, a moderate state senator from 
Rialto. Also running is another Democrat with name recognition in 
the district, Fontana Mayor David Eshleman. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrying the GOP's hopes to build on the party's 222 to 211 seat  
majority in the House is businessman Elia Pirozzi, who lost to 
Brown by a 15 percent margin last year. Also on the ballot are two 
other Democrats, two Republicans, including Rob Guzman who withdrew 
from the race, and two minor-party candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who was serving his 18th term in Congress when he died,  
was a liberal and longtime booster of science spending. 
</P>
<P>
	In a campaign waged mostly by personal appearance, mail and  
radio advertising, the national issue to emerge has been a fight 
over gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brown is a staunch advocate of banning assault weapons and  
cheap handguns, and has accused Baca, who has been supported in 
past campaigns by the California Rifle and Pistol Association, an 
affiliate of the NRA, as soft on an issue gaining momentum in the 
state after the Jewish center shootings in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Her direct mail campaign has attacked Baca as ``the radical gun  
lobby's favorite Democrat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baca responded with a mailer that pictured him standing next to  
Democratic Gov. Gray Davis as the governor signed a bill requiring 
that guns be sold with trigger locks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to be there gun control on every issue. But I  
will be on common sense legislation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	An August poll by the liberal women's group Emily's List found  
Baca leading with 22 percent, Pirozzi with 17 percent and Brown 
with 16 percent. When respondents were told the candidates' 
positions on gun control, the field reversed: Brown 32 percent, 
Baca and Pirozzi 15 percent. The poll, conducted by Fairbank, 
Maslin, Maullin &AMP; Associates, has a 4 to 5 percent margin of error.

<HEADLINE> Volunteers Cleaning World's Beaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than a half-million volunteers are taking  
part in an international crusade to comb the world's shorelines for 
cigarette butts, bottle caps and any other trash they can find. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Coastal Cleanup is in its 14th year, with  
participants ready to collect more than 10 million pieces of trash 
along more than 12,000 miles of shoreline in 70 countries today. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsored by the Center for Marine Conservation, several other  
non-profit groups and corporate sponsors, the campaign is a one-day 
attempt to improve conditions on vital waterfronts. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigarette butts are by far the most common item, with exactly  
1,616,841 picked up and counted in last year's cleanup. They were 
followed in popularity by food wrappers, plastic pieces, bottle 
caps and shards of glass. The global event is held the third 
Saturday of September. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the biggest volunteer corps from any one country came  
in the Philippines, where nearly 300,000 people took part in the 
cleanup. With more than 7,000 islands, the Philippines has among 
the longest shorelines. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States had more than 150,000 volunteers.  
</P>
<P>
	``From coast to coast and around every major body of water, we  
have a debris problem,'' said Seba Sheavly, director of the Center 
for Marine Conservation's marine debris program. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheavly planned to be out herself -- bags in hand -- at the mouth  
of Chesapeake Bay in Virginia. Bad weather associated with 
Hurricane Floyd affected some plans, but thousands of volunteers 
were ready to go, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``After you've lugged bags of trash and logged every single  
piece, you begin to realize that every piece of trash has a 
person's face on it,'' Sheavly said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20,000 divers are joining to clean up offshore debris,  
with major underwater efforts in the United States, the 
Philippines, Germany, Italy, Australia, Venezuela and El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
	Globally, less than 20 percent of shore debris clearly comes  
from the water. The bulk appears to come from land sources, Sheavly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the effort is counting the trash. Volunteers carry cards  
to record their collections, which will be compiled and used for 
studies of how to combat the problem year-round. 
</P>
<P>
	The cards include a space for peculiar stuff.  
</P>
<P>
	Random items reported include a typewriter in New Zealand, a  
plunger in Belize and umbrellas in Britain. Among the oddest 
discards from various beaches are a BMW sedan, a pitchfork, a 
cannon ball and a baby carriage filled with adult books.

<HEADLINE> Jimenez Leads Lancome Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAINT-NOM LA-BRETECHE, France (AP) -- Defending champion Miguel  
Angel Jimenez still has the lead, but now it's just one stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez shot a 1-under par 70 Saturday and leads Pierre Fulke by  
one shot entering the final round of the $1.29 million Lancome 
Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden's Fulke, who entered the round six shots off the lead,  
finished with a 6-under par 65. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last big event before next week's Ryder Cup, Jimenez  
finished the third-round at 11-under par for a total of 202. 
</P>
<P>
	European No. 1 Colin Montgomerie is at 9-under with a 204, with  
Sweden's Ryder Cup player Jarmo Sandelin and Spain's Ignacio 
Garrido three shots off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez, who secured the Lancome Trophy last year with a  
brilliant chip on the last hole, had a three-stroke lead over 
England's Gary Evans entering the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	And he gave every indication that he would retain the title with  
birdies on the third and eighth holes, at which point he had a 
five-stroke lead. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 35-year-old Spaniard missed a six-foot putt for par on  
the 10th and Fulke began to make his move. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing conditions were nearly perfect, with warm, bright  
weather and a slight breeze drying out the damp greens that had 
caused problems for some golfers over the first two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie started at six-under, four behind Jimenez.  
</P>
<P>
	He birdied the first hole, but a bogey on the fourth set him  
back in his chase for a 23rd European circuit win and second at the 
Lancome event. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean Van de Velde, who like Jimenez and Sandelin will appear in  
the Ryder Cup for the first time next week, was playing in front of 
French fans for the first time since losing a three-stroke lead on 
the last hole at the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 33-year-old couldn't maintain the solid form that had  
put him 4-under par after the first two rounds. He quickly dropped 
out of contention with a succession of early bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
	Van de Velde recovered to make par, and he ended the day seven  
shots behind Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
	Scotland's Andrew Coltart, who will play in Brookline after  
getting a surprise wild card, missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	After his round, Montgomerie said that Jimenez would likely pair  
up with fellow Spaniard Jose Maria Olazabal, who has struggled 
recently, during the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will be a very good combination,'' Montgomerie said.  
``(Olazabal) is obviously concerned about his form but I think he 
will play all five,'' Montgomerie said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Ryder Cup is about more than golf and if it came down to a  
four or five-foot putt to win then he is the player you or I or the 
rest of the team would vote for to hole it,'' Montgomerie added. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryder Cup captain Mark James also backed Olazabal, who was  
four-under par after Saturday's third round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every player's form is a concern. I have 12 players and there  
was every chance that some would be playing well and some wouldn't 
be,'' James said. ``I'm not particularly worried about anyone at 
this stage and by all accounts Olazabal has been playing well this 
week.''

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Newspaper Editor Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- The editor-in-chief of a major independent  
newspaper was arrested Saturday for alleged financial corruption at 
the daily, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Riyad Hroub, editor-in-chief of al Arab al Yawm, was denied bail  
and will remain in detention for 14 days pending interrogation, the 
officials said on customary condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at al Arab al Yawm declined to comment and no further  
information on the arrest was immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Hroub has been engaged in a running feud with the authorities  
over the newspaper's critical reports and cynical commentaries 
about the government. Authorities have temporarily cut off the 
service of the state news agency for the newspaper, accusing it of 
``unethical reporting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hroub has also been fighting several lawsuits filed by some of  
his staff following numerous layoffs at the newspaper, which is 
said to be facing serious financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Khalid Zubeidi, a board member at the National House for  
Publishing and Distribution, which publishes the newspaper, also 
filed a lawsuit against Hroub last month, accusing him of 
``financial mismanagement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Al Arab al Yawm, one of the most prominent of Jordan's six  
dailies, is an independent newspaper with a circulation of 70,000.

<HEADLINE> Reagan Biography Stirs Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After 14 years of researching former President  
Ronald Reagan, a prize-winning biographer is stirring controversy 
even before the book is released to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Some historians, writers and Reagan associates are questioning  
Edmund Morris' decision to use a fictional narrator who interacts 
with Reagan as part of the narrative, The New York Times reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 860-plus-page book, ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,'' is  
scheduled to be released Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Morris is only 59, he depicts himself in the book as a  
Reagan contemporary who, for example, caught a glimpse of Reagan as 
a teen-ager playing in a 1926 high school football game. The 
fictional Morris traces Reagan's life from his birth in 1911 
through the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was expecting the definitive book on Ronald Reagan,'' former  
Reagan aide Lyn Nofziger told the newspaper. ``But how am I going 
to get the definitive book if there's a fictional character in it? 
Maybe if I read the whole book I would be pleasantly surprised. But 
just the idea of mixing fact and fiction is something that's 
disturbing me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Edmund has either engaged in an act of genius or a most  
remarkable leap off the precipice,'' Anthony Doland, the Reagan 
administration's chief speech writer, told the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said it viewed the book on the condition that direct  
quotations from it not be used. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris did not return a message left Saturday at his Washington  
home 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan aides granted Morris unusual access to Reagan over the  
years, allowing him to interview the president an average of once a 
month and travel overseas with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1980 for his only other  
book, ``The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt,'' signed a contract for a 
Reagan biography in 1985. It originally was scheduled to be 
released in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris reportedly received a $3 million advance from Random  
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris has said little about what he saw while observing the  
Reagan presidency. Among the few insights he has offered: Reagan 
was fading throughout his eight-year presidency, and the decline 
began with the assassination attempt in 1981, Reagan's first year 
in office. 
</P>
<P>
	``His thoughts became slower, his speech became slower, he  
deliberated more, he hesitated more when he spoke,'' Morris said in 
an interview last year. ``He lost his quickness. And for the rest 
of his presidency it was a very, very slow and steady mental and 
physical decline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said Random House apparently has not released many  
copies of the book. Employees at a Washington bookstore 
specializing in political works said they had not received any 
copies, which they said was unusual for a book scheduled to go on 
sale in only a matter of days. 
</P>
<P>
	In Random House publicity material, the publisher tells readers  
that the narrator is ``not quite Edmund Morris'' in the early parts 
of the book, the Times said. ``He is in effect a literary 
projection of the author back through time,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said early copies of the book circulating  
privately include references to the fictional Morris' early 
diaries. Those early copies do not provide any explanation of the 
fictional character. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand that a lot of what historians do incorporates  
techniques that fiction writers do,'' said Mark Gilderhus, author 
of the college textbook ``History and Historians. ``But there still 
is a difference and that is that historians should be constrained 
by the evidence,'' he told the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Random House has granted Newsweek exclusive rights to an excerpt  
set to appear in its Sept. 27 issue.

<HEADLINE> Pageant Field Narrows to 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- The field of women vying to become  
Miss America 2000 was narrowed to five late Saturday in a telecast 
that opened with a crack about a controversial change dropping the 
pageant's 50-year ban on divorce and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	The five were Miss Texas Yanci Yarbrough, Miss Maryland Keri  
Schrader, Miss Illinois Jade Smalls, Miss Pennsylvania Susan 
Spafford and Miss Kentucky Heather Renee French. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the rewards awaiting the winner: a newly designed  
rhinestone-and-ruby ``millennium'' Miss America crown, a $40,000 
college scholarship, an all-expense paid Seventh Avenue shopping 
spree and a yearlong speaking tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The pageant, hosted by newcomers Donny and Marie Osmond,  
promised plenty of new twists. The most controversial one wasn't in 
effect this year, but that didn't stop Marie Osmond from making fun 
of it. The new Miss America plans to split the scholarship money, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's going to share it with her ex-husband,'' Osmond said.  
</P>
<P>
	And for the first time since Miss America took to the airwaves  
in 1954, viewers were to see only five of the contestants perform 
talent routines, instead of 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated by declining TV ratings, pageant officials opted to  
cut the number of baton twirlers, tap dancers and pianists who try 
their luck on the Convention Hall stage in hopes of speeding up the 
show and holding onto viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Also cut were the traditional musical production numbers  
featuring contestants. In their place were profiles of some of the 
women, a video retrospective of Miss America -- the icon -- through 
the 20th century and a pre-recorded performance by vocal group 98 
Degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The swimsuit competition's still in. This year, the women picked  
their own suits (only thongs were banned) and decided whether to 
wear shoes or go barefoot. 
</P>
<P>
	Pageant officials have decided to drop a nearly 50-year-old ban  
on divorce and abortion. The Miss America Organization, which runs 
the annual beauty pageant, voted in June to strike the ban to 
comply with anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
	But pageant officials put the changes on hold after outraged  
state pageant directors who like Miss America the way she is went 
to court to block them. 
</P>
<P>
	In any event, the changes weren't in effect for this year's  
contest.

<HEADLINE> Cincinnati 17, No. 9 Wisconsin 12 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Robert Cooper ran for 143 yards and a  
touchdown, and Deontey Kenner scored on a 5-yard run Saturday as 
Cincinnati upset No. 9 Wisconsin 17-12, spoiling a record-setting 
performance by Ron Dayne. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne rushed for 231 yards on 28 carries to pass Archie Griffin  
and become the Big Ten's career rushing leader with 5,615 yards, 
including bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne also moved into sixth place on the NCAA career rushing  
list, which does not include bowl games. He has 5,087 
regular-season yards, 1,193 shy of breaking Ricky Williams' NCAA 
career mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenner's TD run gave Cincinnati a 14-6 lead with 9:59 left in  
the third quarter. Wisconsin closed to 14-12 on Dayne's 18-yard 
touchdown run with 5:15 remaining in the third, but the Badgers 
self-destructed in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne fumbled into the Cincinnati end zone midway through the  
final period and the Bearcats recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the period, Wisconsin's Nick Davis fumbled a punt and  
Carlton Sykes recovered for Cincinnati at the Wisconsin 25, setting 
up a 41-yard field goal by Jonathan Ruffin that put the Bearcats 
ahead 17-12 with 5:01 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin scored the apparent go-ahead touchdown on a  
fourth-down pass in the final minute, but it was wiped out by an 
illegal motion penalty. On the next play, Scott Kavanaugh overthrew 
Davis in the end zone with six seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati stunned Wisconsin on the first play of the second  
quarter when Robert Cooper scored on a 51-yard touchdown run for a 
7-3 lead. It was the first time Wisconsin trailed this season. 
</P>
<P>
	With 5:32 left in the half, Vitaly Pisetsky kicked his second  
field goal for Wisconsin to make it 7-6. Davis, the nation's 
leading punt returner, had an 81-yard TD return called back in the 
first half because of an illegal block. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne rushed for 103 yards in the first half to move past  
Temple's Paul Palmer, Rice's Trevor Cobb of Rice and South 
Carolina's George Rogers on the NCAA list. His second-half yardage 
moved him past Anthony Thompson of Indiana and Darren Lewis of 
Texas A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne was held out of several series in the first half because  
of a sprained ankle, and his absence was felt most on the drive 
that ended with Pisetsky's second field goal.

<HEADLINE> Minor Leaguer Suspended for Tipping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- Huntsville Stars catcher Jeff Alfano was  
suspended for tipping off Orlando batters to upcoming pitches in an 
extra inning game that may have affected the Southern League 
championship scenario. 
</P>
<P>
	The Milwaukee Brewers, the Stars' parent club, suspended Alfano  
for 30 days and fined him $500, to be donated to a charity 
designated by the major league team, according to Milwaukee 
director of player development Cecil Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huntsville Times reported Cooper's action Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The punishment follows investigations by the Brewers and the  
Class AA Southern League. It will take affect at the start of next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Cooper said Alfano admitted telling Orlando Rays  
batters what pitches were going to be delivered in an extra inning 
game on Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy did it out of frustration is the way I've had it  
explained to me,'' Cooper told The Times in a story Friday. ``He 
apologized to his teammates and he apologized to me. I think he has 
shown a lot of remorse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alfano did not return calls from the newspaper. He did not have  
a listed number in Huntsville. Officials with the Stars did not 
immediately return a call from The Associated Press on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando eventually won the game in 17 innings, finishing in a  
tie with Jacksonville for the Southern League East second half 
title. Orlando went on to beat Jacksonville in a one-game playoff 
and advance to the championship series against West Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfano, a 23-year-old from California, had served a six-game  
suspension in August after tearing apart the Huntsville clubhouse 
buffet in a postgame rampage after being criticized by manager 
Darrell Evans. 
</P>
<P>
	Stars president and general manager Don Mincher said if anything  
the latest punishment was too light. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfano's actions ``affected the outcome of a game in a negative  
way, and that's a very, very serious infraction,'' Mincher told the 
newspaper. ``The integrity of the game has got to be protected. 
This not only affects our club, but the whole league. ... I think 
he did a disservice to baseball.''

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Stranded by Floyd's Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Rescuers in fleets of helicopters and boats  
rushed to help people still stranded Saturday by floods from 
Hurricane Floyd's drenching rainfall. Officials warned that major 
rivers across eastern North Carolina were still rising. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of thousands still had no electricity from North  
Carolina to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown water from the Tar River crept into three blocks of Main  
Street, where business owners waded or used small boats to check on 
property that had been dry just 12 hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody knows how bad it is. Nobody expected this,'' said  
attorney Tommy Moore, who wore chest waders as he checked on a 
friend's law office. His own office was dry in Rocky Mount. 
</P>
<P>
	A helicopter roared overhead, looking for stranded residents  
near the riverbank. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hear these helicopters, and it just makes you sick,''  
Moore said. ``You know they're helping people, but it makes you 
realize how vulnerable we are. It's like a war zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 45 people died, including 20 in North Carolina, as  
Floyd churned up the East Coast and thousands of homes and 
businesses were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pinetops, N.C., authorities on Saturday recovered the bodies  
of four people whose boat capsized while they were trying to escape 
floodwaters. The bodies were that of a middle-aged woman, her 
daughter, and two girls who were between 3 and 5 years old, said 
fire chief Steve Burress. 
</P>
<P>
	In hard-hit North Carolina, high water on Saturday still blocked  
parts of Interstates 95 and 40, the state's two busiest highways, 
along with more than 300 other roads. More than 5,600 people spent 
the night in 69 shelters across eastern North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The highway closures have created a logistical nightmare when it  
comes to supplying food and water to people in shelters and 
isolated communities. Five shelters are being supplied exclusively 
by air -- three in Edgecombe County and two in Pitt County. 
</P>
<P>
	Supermarkets are running out of food and to ensure people are  
fed, 30 mobile kitchens have been set up in 16 counties. Fort Bragg 
provided 50,000 ready-to-eat meals. 
</P>
<P>
	State agricultural officials estimated that a million poultry  
and 100,000 swine had perished. Together with anticipated crop 
losses, ``this potentially is the worst agricultural damage that 
eastern North Carolina has ever faced,'' state agriculture 
department spokesman Jim Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said agricultural losses could exceed the $872 million  
benchmark set by Hurricane Fran in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak said Saturday that it had restored full service along the  
Northeast Corridor, which connects Boston, New York and Washington. 
Limited service was being offered south to Richmond and Newport 
News, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The railroad said it did not expect to resume service until at  
least Monday on Silver Service trains between New York and Miami; 
the Carolinian, which runs between New York and Charlotte, N.C., or 
its Auto Train, which runs between Lorton, Va., and Sanford, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	As Floyd's 15 inches of rain slowly drained away from eastern  
North Carolina, forecasters warned that more major flooding still 
lies ahead for the Tar, Neuse, and Cape Fear rivers. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Tar River crested Saturday in Tarboro at 43 feet -- 24  
feet above flood stage -- the Neuse and Cape Fear rivers weren't 
expected to crest until Tuesday, also well above flood stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be bad,'' said Al Lazo of the National Weather  
Service in Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 50 helicopters, with more expected from other states,  
were in the air for rescue missions Saturday in Edgecombe, Nash, 
Pitt and Duplin counties. In Edgecombe County alone, 3,500 people 
had been rescued. 
</P>
<P>
	Contaminated drinking water supplies were a growing problem.  
</P>
<P>
	Several waste lagoons on North Carolina hog farms had reached or  
exceeded their capacities, and at least one had ruptured, spilling 
2 million gallons of sewage waste into a tributary of the Northeast 
Cape Fear River. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 20 communities and 200 swine farmers have reported  
wastewater problems, officials said. The entire water supplies of 
Pitt and Edgecombe counties were contaminated, said Renee Hoffman, 
a state public safety spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Water service was restored Saturday for 119,000 people in  
Portsmouth, Va., and nearby Chesapeake and Suffolk, but residents 
were told to use the water only for flushing toilets. The area has 
been without drinkable running water since flooding damaged a 
pumping station on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 1 million people in New Jersey were told to boil  
their water, at least through the weekend, because flooding 
overwhelming a treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
	In Franklin, Va., 9 to 12 feet of water from the Blackwater  
River filled more than 180 downtown businesses on Saturday, and 
authorities said the river might not crest until sometime Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all look at each other and have tears in our eyes and our  
hearts are throbbing,'' said Mayor Jim Councill, whose insurance 
office had water to its first-floor ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenville, a city of 44,000, was completely in the dark  
Saturday because the flooded Tar River short-circuited its main 
power plant. They were among some 277,000 without power Saturday in 
North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, more than 75,000 customers remained without power in  
Pennsylvania; 74,000 in New Jersey; 6,000 in Vermont; over 128,000 
in Maryland, 5,000 in Connecticut, 51,000 in Virginia and 50,000 in 
New York.

<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Aaron U. Jones and his wife paid a session  
high $725,000 Saturday for a filly by Mr. Greeley at Keeneland's 
September Yearling Sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Dixiana Farm Inc., as agent for Stoneworth Farm, sold the dark  
bay or brown filly out of Final Deputy, by Deputy Minister. She is

<P>
	A daughter of Cherokee Run brought $325,000, the second high  
price of the session Saturday. J.S. Moss and his wife purchased the 
bay filly. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherokee Run is the sire of undefeated Chilukki, one of the top  
2-year-old fillies in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	During Saturday's session, Keeneland sold 289 horses for

<HEADLINE> Ex-Adviser: New Cuba Policy Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. government should remake its policy  
toward Cuba and encourage some limited foreign investment on the 
island, a former White House adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Nuccio, who served as President Clinton's special  
adviser for Cuban policy in 1995 and 1996, said the United States 
could go a long way toward improving relations without lifting its 
economic embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should be leading a worldwide campaign to promote foreign  
investment in Cuba,'' he said Friday during a speech to more than 
30 people at an academic seminar on Cuban policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Nuccio said the U.S. government should support conditional,  
limited investment, while making clear a list of recommended 
conditions, including that workers be paid directly and that labor 
have a right to organize. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States also should lift its ban on sales of food and  
medicines to Cuba, he said. ``It's bad politics, it's bad policy, 
and it's bad morality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight D. Eisenhower was president in 1960 when the United  
States imposed a trade embargo on Cuba. Eight U.S. presidents and 
nearly 40 years later, the embargo remains in place. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has looked for ways to expand  
people-to-people contacts with the island and to ease the 
humanitarian situation of the Cuban people without strengthening 
the government of President Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	Nuccio, now an adjunct professor at Georgetown University,  
resigned from the State Department after he was stripped of his 
highest security clearances because of his role in revelations 
about what he described as CIA misconduct in Guatemala. He is now 
writing a book about U.S. policy toward Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a change in policy, relations between the two countries  
could become volatile, Nuccio said. He said he is worried about the 
possibility of a military confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe Castro would rather take us down with him than be  
the Gorbachev of Cuba,'' he said. ``I don't want to find out where 
the breaking point is.''

<HEADLINE> Pilot Killed in Nevada Air Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A plane flying in an air race crashed into a  
residential neighborhood, breaking apart and hitting cars and 
homes. The pilot was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	A young girl on the ground was treated after she was hit in the  
finger by flying shrapnel, said Tom Medland, a spokesman for the 
Airport Authority Washoe County. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Levitz, 61, of Grand Prairie, Texas, was flying in the last  
heat of the 36th annual National Championship Air Races when 
structural damage in the tail of the P-51 Mustang plane caused it 
to break apart in the air, Medland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities still were investigating the crash in Lemmon  
Valley, about 12 miles north of Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mustang is the most powerful plane in the five classes that  
race in the competition, and is capable of speeds above 400 mph.

<HEADLINE> 10 Die in Pakistan Train Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAXILA, Pakistan (AP) -- A passenger train slammed into a lone  
engine traveling in the other direction Saturday night, killing at 
least 18 people and injuring 70 others, witnesses and railway 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear what caused the crash or why the  
two trains were on the same stretch of track a few miles outside 
Taxila, 21 miles from the capital, Islamabad. 
</P>
<P>
	The first railway car of the six-car passenger train, the Chenab  
Express, was a mangled mass of steel and the second one was badly 
damaged. The death toll was expected to climb as many of the 
wounded were in serious condition, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Railway officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the  
engine apparently accidentally rolled out of the Taxila station 
along the tracks until it smashed into the oncoming passenger 
train, which was heading toward the Arabian Sea port city of 
Karachi. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Wah Military Hospital, where many of the wounded were  
taken, Mohammed Aurengzeb cradled his wife's head in his hands. She 
was unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
	``I woke up with the crash and I began to look for my wife,'' he  
said. ``I didn't know what had happened. I yelled her name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Awakened by the sound of the accident, nearby residents ran from  
their homes to the crash site, removing the dead and wounded, 
flagging down cars, trucks and horse-drawn carts to take the 
injured to nearby hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The last major train crash was in March 1997 when a runaway  
train jumped its tracks and slammed into a sand dune in the eastern 
Punjab province, killing 135 people and injuring 175 others. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past decade, more than 2,000 people have died in train  
crashes in Pakistan. The deadliest crash occurred in 1989 when two 
passenger trains slammed into each other in southern Sindh province 
killing 850 people.

<HEADLINE> Elliott Begins Long Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- While San Antonio Spurs forward Sean Elliott  
can't participate yet in any vigorous workouts following his kidney 
transplant, he's keeping busy. 
</P>
<P>
	When the NBA champion Spurs start playing exhibition games next  
month, Elliott plans to travel with the team and be on the 
sidelines providing color commentary for team broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great, I really do. I feel really good,'' Elliott said  
Friday. ``Considering I'm a month out of the initial surgery, I'm 
feeling a lot better than I thought I would at this time, that's 
for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, who had a kidney transplant Aug. 16, can walk on a  
treadmill and is waiting for doctors to clear him to run, which 
could happen in the coming month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing too strenuous, is what I've been told,'' he said.  
``I'm sticking to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott also is sticking to his plan for a possible NBA return.  
</P>
<P>
	A comeback after a kidney transplant would be unprecedented in  
professional sports, but that doesn't worry Elliott. He has 
recovered from knee injuries in the NBA and was told after a knee 
injury in high school he would never play again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't bother me at all,'' the 31-year-old forward said.  
``I don't think about it. I think if somebody can do it, I can do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, a 10-year veteran who helped San Antonio to its first  
NBA title in June, received the kidney from his brother, Noel. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a condition called focal segmental glomerular sclerosis,  
which prevents the kidneys from properly filtering waste from the 
blood. Without the transplant, he was weeks away from needing 
dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott wants to put his comeback on the fast track. The longer  
he is away from basketball, he says, the harder it could be. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest with you and myself, I would rather do it this  
year than sit out a year and then try to come back,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said it would be about six weeks after the transplant  
before he could run or do strenuous activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty much champing at the bit now to do a little bit  
more,'' he said. ``It's the hardest part, just laying around half 
the time. People say, `Get off your feet.' Well, I've been off my 
feet for long enough. It's time to start getting better and 
strengthening my body back up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said some medications have made him ill, but doctors plan to  
reduce the dosages over the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	If he does return, he would have to shield the new kidney with a  
protective device in the pelvic area. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the immediate concern, making sure that you don't get  
hit. Then the other concern is you have protection and you're 
afraid to go out there and play or you're afraid that you're going 
to get hit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to get past that mental part. If I can get past all  
that, then I'll try to play.''

<HEADLINE> Actor Macy Happy To Be So Busy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actor William H. Macy says he has so many  
roles, his hair hasn't been its natural color in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	He's frenetically busy, and the former ``E.R.'' cast member  
nominated for an Oscar for his role as a hapless car salesman in 
the 1996 movie ``Fargo'' likes it that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``This last year was tough,'' Macy said. ``I did four movies in  
a row. I would end on Friday and begin another one on Monday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Macy had three movies out last fall, was in this year's  
star-studded ``Mystery Men,'' and on Sunday, a movie he co-wrote 
and starred in called ``A Slight Case of Murder'' premieres on TNT. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also scheduled to appear in several episodes of ABC's  
``Sports Night'' and is preparing to do an off-Broadway revival of 
David Mamet's ``American Buffalo.'' He also has four more films 
coming up, including Miramax's ``Happy, Texas.''

<HEADLINE> Train Crash Cuts Sewage Tanker </HEADLINE>

<P>
	GALISTEO, N.M. (AP) -- A Los Angeles-bound passenger train sliced  
into a truck hauling sewage, splattering blue, disinfectant-laden 
liquid onto the train, but leaving the truck driver with only minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The tank ``just spewed like a balloon,'' sending 300 gallons of  
blue-tinted liquid and toilet paper into the air, said Santa Fe 
County sheriff's Deputy Joe McLaughlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorenzo Mendoza, 35, of Pecos, was treated at St. Vincent

</P>
<P>
	``He's lucky it hit the back of the truck,'' McLaughlin said.  
</P>
<P>
	The accident delayed the Chicago-to-California Southwest Super  
Chief and its 160 or so passengers for 1 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators had not determined whether Mendoza saw the train  
or tried to speed across the tracks ahead of it. There are no 
traffic barriers or flashing lights at the crossing.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 8, Marlins 6 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Luis Gonzalez hit a two-run homer in the 10th  
inning, and the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Florida Marlins 8-6 
Saturday, reducing their magic number for clinching the NL West to 
eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, in a 2-for-33 slide before the home run, became the  
third Diamondback with 100 RBIs this season. Jay Bell has 103 and 
Matt Williams has 132. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Johnson struck out seven in six innings, raising his major  
league-leading total to 342, the sixth-highest total in a season, 
one more than Nolan Ryan fanned in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, which has won 10 of 13, increased its lead to seven  
games over second-place San Francisco, which lost to San Diego 
11-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell led off the 10th with an infield single off Hector Almonte  
(0-1). Gonzalez then hit a 1-2 pitch into the pool in right-center 
field for his 25th homer of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Swindell (4-0) pitched the 10th for the win.  
</P>
<P>
	Mike Lowell homered twice for Florida, which has lost eight of  
nine. His three-run shot off Matt Mantei with two outs in the ninth 
put the Marlins ahead 6-5. Mantei had not allowed a home run since 
Arizona acquired him from Florida on July 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona tied it in the bottom half on Henley Frias' leadoff  
triple off Antonio Alfonseca and Damian Miller's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson blanked the Marlins until Lowell hit a two-run homer in  
the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Finley hit his career-best 31st home run and Miller also  
homered for the Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks took a 4-0 lead in the fourth against Brian  
Meadows on rookie Erubiel Durazo's first career triple and Finley's 
two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Johnson has pitched a career-high 255 2-3 innings. He  
pitched 255 1-3 in 1993 for Seattle. ... Next up for Johnson on the 
single-season strikeout list is Bob Feller, who struck out 348 in 
1946. Ryan set the record of 383 in 1973. ... Lee had four hits. 
... Tony Womack stole his major league-leading 68th base in the 
fifth inning. ... Umpire Kerwin Danley, who took a foul ball off 
his foot in Colorado earlier in the week, skipped his turn behind 
the plate and instead worked first base for the second straight 
game. ... Arizona purchased the contract of C Rod Barajas from 
Double-A El Paso of the Texas League and placed LHP Brian Shouse on 
the 60-day disabled list. Barajas hit .318 with 14 homers and 95 
RBIs for the Diablos this season.

<HEADLINE> Indexes, Stocks Not on Same Page </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If your favorite stocks lagged this past month  
while the Dow Jones industrials and the Nasdaq composite index 
soared to new records, you're not alone. 
</P>
<P>
	For several months, a relative handful of stocks have driven  
market indexes higher while the vast majority of issues turned in 
middling-to-poor performances. Many analysts, particularly the 
technical strategists who gauge the market's strength by crunching 
numbers, fear that all is not well beneath the lofty levels of most 
indicators. 
</P>
<P>
	``The broader market has not been participating,'' said Brian G.  
Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in 
Kansas City, Mo. ``There are a number of signs that not all the 
planets are aligned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow offers perhaps the clearest illustration of the market's  
lack of consistency. The average of 30 blue-chip stocks is up 17.7 
percent so far this year, slightly ahead of its 16.1 percent gain 
in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But the performances are widely divergent among the stocks that  
comprise the Dow. Computer maker Hewlett Packard is up 47.6 percent 
for the year to date, while retailer Sears, Roebuck has plunged 
20.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 has been similarly unbalanced. So far  
in 1999, the top 15 stocks in the S&AMP;P 500 have accounted for 70 
percent of the total gain in the index, said James M. Griffin Jr., 
chief investment strategist at Aeltus Investment Management in 
Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the market's bad breadth developed as a few prized  
stocks -- mostly technology companies like Microsoft, Intel and 
Cisco Systems -- continued their runaway growth while fears of 
rising interest rates and inflation began depressing the broader 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Performance this year has been concentrated in the same tech  
names we love to love if we own them and love to hate if we 
don't,'' Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
	To illustrate the market's narrow advance, analysts point to the  
New York Stock Exchange's advance-decline line, a ratio that 
compares the number of stocks that rise in any given session to the 
number of stocks that fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The advance-decline line peaked in April 1998, when the strong  
U.S. economy lured many buyers into the market. By this summer, 
however, declining stocks outnumbered advancers in nearly every 
session. That held true even on days when the Dow posted 100-point 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	That worries analysts, because it suggests that investors lack  
confidence in the broad market. With only a handful of stocks 
leading the market, one bad break in the form of a poor earnings 
report or leadership change can send market averages plummeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stock market history tells us that narrow markets can endure  
for a long time, but eventually they develop into a problem for 
investors,'' said John A. Mendelson, of Schwab Capital Markets &AMP; 
Trading Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffin said the narrow market may be especially vulnerable in  
the face of rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve has already 
raised rates twice since June in a bid to stem inflation, and may 
do so again if policy-makers determine that higher rates would hold 
the nation's economic growth to sustainable levels. The Fed's next 
meeting is Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	While keeping inflation under wraps is important to investors,  
higher rates could also leave many traders with less money to pour 
into the stock market. In addition, rising rates hurt stocks by 
increasing a company's borrowing costs, and by boosting the returns 
available on other investments, such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the money becomes less abundant, you have to choose your  
favorites,'' Griffin said. ``You can drive stocks up at a slower 
rate, but some will undoubtedly fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP;  
Sons Inc., has noted the sluggish performance of most stocks, yet 
remains optimistic about the market's underlying strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is still a bull market,'' Goldman argued. ``The stock  
market is supported by solid fundamentals with a healthy economy, 
low inflation, low interest rates and strong corporate earnings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His advice? ``In a selective market, be selective.''  
</P>
<P>
	This past week, the Dow ended 224.80 points lower. A gain of  
66.17 Friday left the blue-chip index at 10,803.63. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq fell 17.44 over the course of the week. The index  
gained 62.90 on Friday to close at 2,869.62. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index lost 16.24 for the week, rising  
16.94 Friday to close at 1,335.42. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, which reflects the performance of  
small-company stocks, lost 6.74 for the week, closing at 434.45 
after gaining 4.20 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, which represents the  
combined market value of all NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues, 
ended the week at $12.183 trillion, off $164.66 billion from last 
week. A year ago, the index was $9.361 trillion.

<HEADLINE> New Jersey Towns Battle Floyd Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOUND BROOK, N.J. (AP) -- It happened so fast that people didn't  
have time to take pets, or even shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Muddy water from the Floyd-swollen Raritan River raced through  
this low-lying town and others near it early Friday, engulfing 
homes to their top floors, killing two people, leaving fires raging 
for hours in downtown buildings and forcing nearly 2,000 to leave 
by boat or helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were literally picking people off the rooftops,'' said  
Denise Coyle, the director of the Somerset County Board of 
Freeholders. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three deaths were blamed on the flooding in the state,  
including a 75-year-old woman and her 50-year-old son who refused 
to let police evacuate them, Gov. Christie Whitman said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 2 1/2-year-old boy found waist-deep in floodwater, crying alone  
near a car, was reunited with his parents Friday afternoon after 
police took him to a nearby hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never seen anything like this,'' said Whitman, who  
announced that President Clinton had declared an emergency 
situation in New Jersey because of the flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Bound Brook, located about 35 miles west of New York  
City, was the New Jersey area worst hit by Floyd-related flooding, 
it wasn't the only one. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as a million people in Essex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset,  
and Union counties were told to boil their water, at least through 
the weekend, after floodwaters overwhelmed the Elizabethtown Water 
Co.'s main water treatment plant in Bridgewater. 
</P>
<P>
	About 140,300 homes and business remained without electric  
service early today. Utility officials estimated that more than 
100,000 customers would not have their power restored until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The floods curtailed long-distance phone service to nearly 1  
million people, mostly in Passaic and Bergen counties, and knocked 
out all service to another 35,000. It even prevented some ATM and 
credit card transactions -- across the nation -- because a key 
telephone switching center in Rochelle Park flooded. 
</P>
<P>
	The floodwaters receded Friday in Bound Brook. Authorities  
prepared search teams to enter 200 waterlogged homes to look for 
anyone who may still be inside today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it looks like a big mudslide,'' Somerset County emergency  
management director LeRoy Gunzelman said this morning. ``The 
water's gone, and there's mud and debris all over the roads. The 
structures have to be tested today to see if they're even safe 
enough for the search and rescue team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flood shocked and devastated even those who were veterans of  
many floods in those low-lying communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's happened to them so many times,'' said Karen  
Fritz of Bound Brook. ``We figured the water would go down. The 
water never went down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scenario was familiar to Mary Straub, 67. She lost her home  
to a flood in 1971 and rebuilt it in the same spot. Authorities 
said it may be days before she is allowed to see the damage of this 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very devastating, really,'' Straub said while sitting a  
high school converted into a temporary shelter. ``You can't believe 
it's going to happen to you a second time.''

<HEADLINE> IRS Seizes Frankel Estate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service has seized  
an estate owned by Martin Frankel, the financier accused of bilking 
insurance companies out of hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, who has been in custody since his Sept. 4 arrest in  
Germany, owned two estates in Greenwich. The first, a 4-acre 
property valued at $3 million, was taken by the FBI in May on 
allegations it served as headquarters for Frankel's money 
laundering and investment fraud enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS expropriated the second estate, valued at $2.5 million,  
alleging it was bought with money that had been wired from the same 
Swiss bank account into which Frankel deposited $44 million of the 
stolen insurance funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The seizure order, based on a complaint by the IRS's Criminal  
Investigations Division, was signed Sept. 10 by U.S. District Judge 
Dominic J. Squatrito in New Haven. 
</P>
<P>
	Copies of the order have been sent to Frankel's former  
bodyguard, David Rosse, and a former Greenwich landlord, Cheryl 
Lacoff, who both have claims against the property. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosse and Lacoff have until next week to file notice of intent  
to litigate with the government to recoup money from Frankel 
through the IRS's eventual sale of the property.

<HEADLINE> Kasparaitis May Leave U.S. To Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Darius Kasparaitis, discouraged by the slow  
movement of contract talks with the Pittsburgh Penguins, plans to 
leave for Switzerland on Monday to train with Ottawa Senators 
holdout Alexei Yashin. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players are represented by agent Mark Gandler.  
</P>
<P>
	Kasparaitis, a defenseman recovering from reconstructive knee  
surgery, said he and the Penguins are about $300,000 apart in 
yearly salary, but that he has been making all the concessions. The 
Penguins' initial offer was $1.2 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating. It's killing me,'' Kasparaitis said. ``I'm  
trying to keep my head up and I want to come back to Pittsburgh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins general manager Craig Patrick suggested the team won't  
make a new offer any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've extended ourselves as far as we're going to extend  
ourselves,'' Patrick said. ``I don't know if there is a line in the 
sand, but we've made a substantial offer, by our estimation. 
Obviously, not by theirs. And that's as far as we can go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasparaitis, who has been working out on his own in New York, is  
the Penguins' last remaining restricted free agent who has not 
reached terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, $300,000 isn't that big of a deal,'' Kasparaitis  
said. ``But I'm the only one who keeps going down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Kasparaitis isn't threatening to stage a long holdout like  
Petr Nedved, who stayed out for 17 months before the Penguins 
traded him to the New York Rangers in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not Petr Nedved,'' Kasparaitis said. ``Petr's a single  
guy. My wife's got to go shopping. I hope to get this down soon.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: GOP Tax Plan Hurts Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Renewing his veto threat, President Clinton  
said Saturday that the Republicans' 10-year, $792 billion tax cut 
plan would result in ``some of the worst cuts in education in our 
history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the nation's 31 Republican governors joined with  
GOP congressional leaders in promoting their tax package. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Republicans send me a bill that doesn't live up to our  
national commitment to education, I won't hesitate to veto it,'' 
the president said in his weekly radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on behalf of Republicans, Gov. Jim Geringer of Wyoming  
argued for a massive tax cut funded though projected budget 
surpluses over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why not give the money and our government back to the  
people?'' Geringer said in the GOP's radio address. ``He accused 
Clinton of seeking to ``spend every spare dollar of the surplus ... 
and obligate more of your family's income for the next 10 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. J.C. Watts, chairman of the House Republican Conference,  
also issued a statement touting the GOP's plan for education 
improvements. Watts, R-Okla, said they will allow control of 
education to remain with parents and teachers and not ``some 
clock-puncher in the massive Department of Education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republican tax-relief package meets America's priorities  
by making crucial investments in education,'' Watts said, citing 
proposed expansion of pre-paid tuition plans and expansion of 
tax-free savings accounts for education. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts called Clinton's remarks ``a last-ditch effort to spin the  
American people out of their desire for real tax relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton contended the Republican proposal would shortchange  
the nation's school children and their future workplace success as 
they begin ``the last school semester of the 20th century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using part of a projected 10-year surplus, the Republican tax  
bill would reduce all income tax rates by 1 percentage point; cut 
capital gains taxes; gradually eliminate estate taxes and the 
alternative minimum tax; ease the ``marriage penalty'' paid by many 
two-income couples; expand pension laws; and give breaks for 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton contends it would draw away money needed to preserve  
Medicare and Social Security and to ensure adequate spending on 
education and defense. Tax cuts, he says, should be targeted at the 
middle class and come only after those priorities are met. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the Republican proposals would require cuts in  
federal aid to education of more than 50 percent over the decade 
and force a 20 percent reduction next year alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``If carried out this plan would lead to some of the worst cuts  
in education in our history,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton asserted that a cut of that size would possibly lead  
next year to laying off 5,000 of the new teachers hired under his 
class-size reduction initiative, eliminate after-school and 
summer-school programs for 50,000 students and reduce chances for 
future success for more than 10 million students in the nation's 
poorest communities. 
</P>
<P>
	He then made his threat to veto a GOP education bill explicit.  
</P>
<P>
	``If it undermines our efforts to hire high quality teachers to  
reduce class size or increase accountability in our public schools, 
I'll veto it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it fails to strengthen head start, after-school, and summer  
school programs, I'll veto it. If it underfunds mentoring or 
college scholarship programs, I'll veto it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If it sends me a bill that turns its back on our children and  
their future, I'll send them back to the drawing board,'' Clinton 
said.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Rookie Debuts With Tampa Bay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Tampa Bay's Jim Morris, a 35-year-old  
left-hander, became the oldest rookie in the majors in 29 years 
when he struck out Royce Clayton in the eighth inning of Saturday 
night's 6-1 loss to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris relieved with two outs and struck out Royce Clayton on  
four fastballs in the mid-90s. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the oldest rookie since 36-year-old Minnie Mendoza with  
Minnesota in 1970 and the oldest rookie pitcher since 41-year-old 
Diomedes Oliva with Pittsburgh in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest,''  
Morris said. ``It was an unbelievable experience. It made me feel 
young. I recommend it for anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, who had a large contingent of family and friends in the  
stands, said he had little control when he was warming up in the 
bullpen in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was everywhere in the bullpen,'' he said. ``I was just  
trying to keep my heart from exploding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he was told his fastball registered in the mid-90s, Morris  
said, ``To tell you the truth, I never can tell how hard I'm 
throwing. I'm just trying to get guys out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris was given the ball that was in play at the time as a  
keepsake. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild had said before the game he  
did not want Morris to make his major league debut on the day he 
was called up, but Rothschild then decided to put in Morris right 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came in and got the out,'' Rothschild said. ``He threw hard  
and looked like he was putting the ball where he wanted it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, a native of Brownwood, Texas, was teaching chemistry and  
physics at Regan County High School in West Texas about 3 1/2 months 
ago when he was given a tryout by the Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, taken by Milwaukee with the fourth overall pick the 1983  
amateur draft, went 3-1 in 18 relief appearances at Triple-A Durham 
of the International League. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays also brought Julio Franco back to the major  
leagues when they purchased the contract of the 14-year veteran 
from Durham. 
</P>
<P>
	Franco, 38, signed with Tampa Bay in spring training and was  
assigned to the Devil Rays' affiliate in the Mexican League, the 
Mexico City Tigers. Franco led the Mexican League with a .423 
average and a .656 slugging percentage, then hit .269 in seven 
playoff games for Durham. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay also called up first baseman Steve Cox from Durham and  
activated right-hander Cory Lidle from the 60-day disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room, Tampa Bay designated outfielders Rich Butler and  
Carlos Mendoza, right-hander Mickey Callaway and left-hander 
Terrell Wade for assignment. The Devil Rays have 10 days to trade 
them, place them on unconditional release waivers or assign them 
outright to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay also said Durham manager Bill Evers will be with the  
major league club as a coach for the rest of the season.

<HEADLINE> Expos 4, Braves 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Dustin Hermanson won his fourth straight start  
and Brad Fullmer hit a go-ahead, two-run double as the Montreal 
Expos scored four unearned runs off Greg Maddux to beat the Atlanta 
Braves 4-3 Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux (18-8) has lost consecutive starts after winning eight in  
a row. He allowed eight hits, struck out eight and walked one in 
his fourth complete game of the season, the 92nd of his career. His 
ERA, which had been 5.02 on May 21, dropped to 3.35. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta, seeking its eighth straight division title, began the  
night two games ahead of second-place New York in the NL East. The 
Braves have lost five of seven. 
</P>
<P>
	Hermanson (9-12) allowed all three runs and 11 hits in eight  
innings, struck out five and walked two. Ugueth Urbina pitched the 
ninth for his 38th save in 46 chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Two errors by second baseman Bret Boone and one by Maddux did in  
the Braves, who led 3-1 with two outs and none on in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Bergeron singled and Jose Vidro hit a slow grounder up the  
first-base line. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux failed to pick up the ball on his first attempt, then  
tried a back-handed, overhead toss that first baseman Ryan Klesko 
could not handle. Bergeron advanced to third on the error and Vidro 
wound up on second. 
</P>
<P>
	Vladimir Guerrero followed with an RBI single, and Fullmer's  
double down the first-base line put Montreal ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Boone's 20th homer and Ryan Klesko's RBI double put the Braves  
ahead 2-0 in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Vidro reached on an infield single in the fourth and advanced on  
a throwing error by Boone. One out later, Boone made another bad 
throw on Fullmer's grounder, allowing Vidro to take third. He 
scored on Michael Barrett's grounder. 
</P>
<P>
	Boone hit an RBI single in the bottom half.  
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Braves will top 3 million Sunday, the third straight  
year they've topped the mark and the fifth time in the 1990s. 
Saturday's sellout was the 19th of the season. ... Since his July 
15 recall from Triple-A Ottawa, Fullmer is hitting .323 
(66-for-204) with six homers, 21 doubles and 35 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Senate Said Eyeing NFL Drug Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The chairman of the Senate's Caucus on  
International Narcotics Control reportedly has begun an inquiry 
into how the NFL handled the cases of 16 players who failed drug 
tests in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported Sunday that Sen. Charles E. Grassley  
of Iowa has requested a copy of a videotape made at an NFL Players 
Association meeting four years ago. During that meeting, Doug 
Allen, the union's assistant executive director, said a number of 
players were not punished for violating the league's substance 
abuse policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL later confirmed that 16 players were not suspended as a  
concession to the union during negotiations on a stronger 
drug-testing policy. Those players, however, continued to be 
monitored and tested under the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Times, Grassley sent a letter to Sportsolution,  
which shot the videotapes, saying: 
</P>
<P>
	``How the United States deals with drug abuse and addiction  
domestically reflects on our efforts and credibility in the 
international arena. No group -- especially one with such high 
visibility as the players of the National Football League -- should 
be allowed to hide drug use behind negotiations or posturing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the tapes reveals what I fear they do, the public deserves  
to know.''

<HEADLINE> Report: O'Dowd Won't Get Brewer Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A former Cleveland Indians executive withdrew  
his name from consideration for the Milwaukee Brewers' general 
manager job, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan O'Dowd was considered a leading candidate for the job, the  
paper reported, citing an unidentified Brewers source. 
</P>
<P>
	No reason for the move was given, but there were reports that  
O'Dowd spent Friday night in Denver, where he could become the 
general manager of the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dowd, a former assistant general manager with Cleveland did  
not return telephone messages left at his home Friday by the 
Journal Sentinal. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendy Selig-Prieb, Brewers president, declined to comment on  
O'Dowd's status. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will tell you that our search is going extremely well,''  
said Selig-Prieb, who began her search after Sal Bando's 
reassignment to an adviser's role Aug. 12. ``We're very pleased 
with where we are right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other candidates for the job are Chicago White Sox assistant  
general manager Dan Evans and Omar Minaya, a senior vice president 
for the New York Mets, the Journal Sentinel reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper reported that Evans is currently considered to be the  
top candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Aug. 12, manager Phil Garner was fired, as the Brewers  
appeared headed for their seventh straight losing season.

<HEADLINE> Mayo Study Offers Hope for MS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP) -- A small group of previously untreatable  
multiple sclerosis patients got a dose of hope from a study at the 
Mayo Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released Friday suggests that some patients with MS and  
related diseases may benefit from exchanging their blood plasma. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study of 19 patients who had their blood removed, mixed  
with new plasma and returned to their bodies, 42 percent 
experienced moderate to marked improvement, including recovery of 
arm and leg functions and ability to speak. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that future studies will determine why this treatment  
works in some patients and not others,'' said Dr. Brian 
Weinshenker, a Mayo Clinic neurologist and the study's lead 
investigator. 
</P>
<P>
	He stressed it is not a cure and not for everyone with MS.  
</P>
<P>
	Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, often disabling disease of the  
central nervous system that afflicts more than 300,000 Americans, 
the National Multiple Sclerosis Society estimates. Symptoms range 
from numbness in the limbs to paralysis and loss of speech and 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflammation and breakdown in the protective, fatty insulation  
around the nerve endings and spinal cord cause attacks in some 
patients. Most patients are treated successfully with steroids, but 
up to 10 percent don't respond. They are the ones who might be 
helped by the new treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure was effective for eight of the 19 patients,  
initially, but five had recurrent attacks within six months of the 
procedure. The research will be published in the December issue of 
Annals of Neurology. 
</P>
<P>
	Audrey Penn, deputy director of the National Institute of  
Neurological Disorders and Stroke, which sponsored the study, 
called it promising, but said the sample size was too small to 
consider it accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Vaughn, a 43-year-old construction worker from Fairmont,  
Minn., underwent the surgery in October 1996 and called it ``a 
miracle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn said he had always been in excellent health until he woke  
up one autumn morning and couldn't move his right leg. Within a 
week, he was paralyzed from the waist down. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors told him he had an inflamed spinal cord and that he  
likely would never walk again. He later was diagnosed with 
transverse myelitis, which has symptoms similar to MS. 
</P>
<P>
	Within two to three weeks of beginning treatment, he was able to  
wiggle his toes and soon could walk with a cane. He now enjoys most 
normal activities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most major medical centers can perform plasma exchanges without  
hospitalization, but it is expensive. A total of seven treatments, 
as used in the study, would cost about $18,000, including the 
replacement plasma. 
</P>
<P>
	Because it still is considered experimental, the costs may not  
be covered by insurance.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 13, Astros 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Darren Oliver won for the first time in seven  
starts and the St. Louis Cardinals chased 20-game winner Mike 
Hampton in the fourth inning in a 13-6 victory over the Houston 
Astros on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hampton (20-4) missed a chance to tie Boston's Pedro Martinez  
for the major league lead in victories. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros lost their third in a row and had their NL Central  
lead cut to 2 1/2 games by Cincinnati, which beat Pittsburgh 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Hampton was handed a three-run lead in the first but lasted just  
3 1-3 innings, his shortest outing of the season. He was charged 
with eight runs. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, the Cardinals roughed up the NL's other 20-game  
winner -- Houston's Jose Lima -- in an 11-8 win. Lima left during a 
nine-run fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire played six innings and was 1-for-3 with an RBI  
double for the Cardinals, remaining at 56 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	J.D. Drew tied it with a three-run homer in the second, and the  
Cardinals knocked out Hampton during an eight-run fourth that put 
them ahead 11-4, on just five hits. Astros pitchers walked three, 
hit a batter and Hampton sent one runner home on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Second baseman Russ Johnson contributed to the inning with two  
unsuccessful behind-the-back forceout attempts, with both flips off 
line. One was ruled a hit and the second was an error; he was 
yanked in a double switch later in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Howard had an RBI single as a pinch-hitter in the fourth,  
reaching base safely for the eighth straight plate appearance. The 
streak ended when Howard, who was 4-for-4 on Friday, reached on an 
error in the sixth. He started a new one with a two-run homer in 
the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	The first five Astros batters reached base safely in the first  
against Oliver (8-9), including a two-run single by Carl Everett 
and an RBI single by Ken Caminiti. Oliver, who struck out eight and 
walked five, allowed only one run the last five innings to win for 
the first time since Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	A sellout crowd of 45,536 pushed the Cardinals' attendance above  
3 million for the fourth time in franchise history, with six home 
games to go. They've topped 3 million the last two years because of 
McGwire mania. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Drew's 12th homer was his first since Aug. 11. He tied his  
career best with four RBIs. ... Cardinals OF Ray Lankford, who had 
minor rectal surgery on Wednesday, didn't start for the fifth 
straight game but grounded out as a pinch-hitter in the seventh. 
... Caminiti was 2-for-3 with an RBI single and is batting .386 
(27-for-80) with 27 RBIs in the last 20 games.

<HEADLINE> NFL Boss Stays Out of Sanders Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue is not expected  
to get involved in talks to get Barry Sanders to end his retirement 
now that his dispute with the Detroit Lions is headed for 
arbitration, the running back's agent said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	David Ware said he had spoken to Tagliabue before the Lions  
filed papers to have a portion of Sanders' signing bonus returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commissioner was very understanding and empathetic but  
indicated that he would not get involved in terms of a dispute 
between the Lions and Barry, but he would welcome the opportunity 
to welcome Barry to return,'' Ware said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamont Smith, Sanders' other agent, asked Tagliabue in a letter  
Monday to help settle the Lions' grievance against Sanders, aimed 
at recouping $5.6 million of the signing bonus the Lions contend 
Sanders owes them. 
</P>
<P>
	Ware said since Tagliabue does not get involved in these kinds  
of disputes, an arbitrator will be appointed. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the question of whether Sanders owes the Lions any money  
is discussed, the arbitrator would have to decide on a number of 
procedural issues -- one being the timeliness of the filing of the 
grievance by the Lions, Ware said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter Friday to the NFL Management Council, Smith argued  
that the Lions waived their right to file a grievance because they 
didn't do it within 45 days of Sanders' failure to report for a 
mandatory minicamp. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could decide that Barry owes the Lions nothing or he could  
decide that Barry owes them something between the amount $7 million 
and $5 1/2 million roughly,'' Ware said. ``I think this case could go 
either way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Lions spokesman Bill Keenist declined to discuss  
any of the latest developments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to comment on anything other than to state  
again that we respected Barry's wishes to retire and have proceeded 
accordingly since,'' Keenist said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, who needs only 1,458 yards to break Walter Payton's  
career rushing record, disputes Detroit's claim that he is required 
to repay a portion of the bonus if he doesn't play. 
</P>
<P>
	An NFL spokesman also confirmed Saturday that Tagliabue told  
Ware on Sept. 2 that he was willing to talk with Sanders if it 
would help the running back return to the Lions, but not if he 
wanted to play for another team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commissioner said he would be willing to talk to Barry if  
it would be constructive, but he didn't want to get between Barry 
and the Lions,'' said Greg Aiello, NFL vice president of public 
relations. ``He called (Lions vice chairman) Bill Ford and told him 
about the conversation and never heard back from David Ware or the 
Lions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aiello said an arbitrator has yet to be appointed, nor has there  
been a date set to hear the Lions' grievance -- a proceeding he said 
might not happen for ``four to six months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is still unknown whether the 31-year-old Sanders wants to  
play again. Ware said last week that Sanders was ``ready to 
consider it, in the right situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like for him to play tomorrow. But that's Barry's call,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ware and Smith said Sanders should be granted free agency or  
traded if he repaid $5.6 million of his $11 million signing bonus, 
which the Lions contend represented the unfulfilled portion of the 
six-year contract he signed in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Lions received the payback, they could use the money  
against the salary cap for other players. The Lions have said they 
have no interest in releasing or trading Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have your money back, why should you still have the  
right to dictate where he works,'' Ware asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders did not collect a $1.7 million deferred payment due this  
fall on the original bonus. He also forfeited his 1999 base salary 
of $3.125 million and a reporting bonus of $250,000 by leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue said at an Economic Club luncheon in Detroit last  
month that the Lions had not asked for salary cap relief in the 
case and that the NFL would not grant it if they did ask. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to work this out. We remain committed to working  
this out for the best interest of the Lions, Barry and the NFL,'' 
Ware said.

<HEADLINE> Crews Search for the Stranded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Rescue teams in boats and helicopters set  
out again today to hunt for people marooned by the worst North 
Carolina flooding in decades, as people up and down the East Coast 
dealt with the damage left by Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	A Navy helicopter roared overhead this morning as dozens of  
people walked and rode bicycles to downtown Tarboro to watch the 
Tar River crest about 24 feet above its 19-foot flood stage. The 
bloated river lapped at businesses three blocks from the riverbank. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen anything like this in my life,'' said Maryann  
Harris, who owns three downtown businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1,500 people remained stranded today, some on roofs  
or in trees, across a broad swath of the eastern half of the state. 
In Edgecombe County alone, about 3,500 people had been rescued by 
today, said Kenny Johnson, a county emergency management official. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 38 people died -- including 13 in North Carolina -- when  
Floyd churned up the East Coast. Thousands of homes and businesses 
were damaged and nearly a million people were without electricity. 
The much weakened storm sped through Maine on Friday and entered 
the Bay of Fundy off Nova Scotia in late evening. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bound Brook, N.J., serious flooding from the Raritan River  
forced police to rescue more than 1,000 people Friday, many of them 
from second-floor windows or off porch roofs. Nearly 8,000 people 
spent Friday night in emergency shelters in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never seen anything like this,'' New Jersey Gov.  
Christie Whitman said. President Clinton declared an emergency in 
the state, allocating federal funding to help deal with the 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4,000 people were left homeless by flooding in  
southeastern Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Some North Carolina rivers swollen by rain from Hurricane Floyd  
earlier in the week approached flood levels not seen for 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jim Hunt appealed for use of all private helicopters in the  
western part of the state, and additional helicopters were due 
today from Texas, Florida and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Professional rescuers were joined by neighbors in motorboats.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is neighbor rescuing neighbor in a lot of situations out  
there,'' said North Carolina emergency management spokeswoman Renee 
Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way we have a firm number to the number of people  
who are waiting. We assign a flight to pick up a certain number of 
people and they find others along the way. This is a 
find-people-as-you-find-them situation,'' Ms. Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,000 people sought refuge Friday night in 86 shelters in  
eastern North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Several rivers including the Tar, Neuse, Cape Fear and Roanoke  
were expected to crest near record levels in the next several days 
as they inundated entire towns, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm that came ashore early Thursday dumped 15 inches of  
rain on the state's coastal plain. Coming on top of an 8-inch 
rainfall from Hurricane Dennis less than two weeks earlier, the 
effect was devastating. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're looking at is flooding of historic proportions,''  
said state meteorologist Ron Wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Parts of Interstates 95 and 40, the state's busiest highways,  
remained closed by high water and about 250 roads were listed as 
impassable across the eastern third of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in New Hanover County and Wilmington, where Floyd  
dumped at least 15 inches of rain, said Friday the storm destroyed 
160 homes and caused nearly $24 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200,000 customers in North Carolina remained without  
electricity. Late Friday, the entire city of Greenville and its 
48,000 electric customers went black when the rising Tar River 
short-circuited a critical transmission station. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, more than 65,000 customers remained without power  
Friday night in Pennsylvania; 145,000 in New Jersey; 35,000 in 
Vermont; 200,000 in Maryland, 95,000 in Virginia and 80,000 in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	In Virginia, more than 118,000 people in Portsmouth and parts of  
Chesapeake and Suffolk had no drinking water because a pumping 
station was flooded. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Lynn Schum of Lima, Ohio, had been stranded at a Holiday  
Inn in Jacksonville, N.C., for three days after she and nine others 
were evacuated from their vacation cottage at Topsail Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tomorrow, it's either Topsail or home -- come hell or high  
water,'' she said.

	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Sebastian Janikowski kicked five field  
goals and Florida State forced six turnovers as the top-ranked 
Seminoles defeated No. 20 North Carolina State 42-11 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Janikowski, whose 27 field goals last year was two short of an  
NCAA record, has nine field goals in the first three games for 
Florida State (3-0 overall, 2-0 Atlantic Coast Conference). He also 
kicked five last year against Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles are 56-2 in the ACC as they go after an eighth  
straight conference title. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina State (3-0, 0-1) upset the Seminoles 24-7 last  
year behind quarterback Jamie Barnette. But on Saturday, Barnette 
had four passes intercepted, one returned 47 yards for a touchdown 
by Abdual Howard, and lost a fumble in his own end zone that Jamal 
Reynolds recovered to increase Florida State's lead to 32-11. David 
Warren had stripped the ball away from Barnette. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State led 18-3 at the half on a 1-yard touchdown run by  
fullback Dan Kendra and four field goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Janikowski, a left-footed junior, kicked field goals of 30, 47,  
22 and 31 yards. He also ran down N.C. State's Clayton White, who 
intercepted a 2-point conversion pass thrown by holder Marcus 
Outzen after a poor snap. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Minor scored on a 2-yard run that gave Florida State a  
25-3 lead early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Janikowski added a 47-yarder in the fourth quarter.  
</P>
<P>
	Kent Passingham's 22-yard field goal that briefly tied the game  
3-3 in the first quarter and Rahshon Spikes' 3-yard run in the 
third quarter accounted for the Wolfpack scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnette, who threw for 287 yards against Florida State last  
year, was 10-of-25 for 129 yards on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Weinke, who had six passes intercepted in last year's  
loss, had two passes intercepted Saturday and failed for the first 
time in his career to throw a TD pass.

<HEADLINE>  WWII Resistance Leader Dies at 90 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Leo Valiani, an opponent of fascism who helped lead  
the resistance movement in Italy during World War II, died of 
cancer Saturday. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Valiani, who had been hospitalized until recently, died at his  
home in Milan, Italian news agencies said. 
</P>
<P>
	An early opponent of dictator Benito Mussolini, Valiani spent  
five years in prison for anti-fascist activities during the 1920s 
and 1930s. He later took refuge in Mexico, returning in 1943 during 
World War II when he took over the resistance movement in northern 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, he was named a senator-for-life by then President  
Sandro Pertini, a fellow member of the resistance. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Titans QB McNair Out Six Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee Titans starting quarterback  
Steve McNair will undergo back surgery Sunday to repair a ruptured 
disc and will be out of the lineup for six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran Neil O'Donnell, signed as a free agent just before  
training camp, will start Sunday for Tennessee (1-0) against the 
visiting Cleveland Browns (0-1). 
</P>
<P>
	McNair flew Saturday to Los Angeles, where Dr. Robert Watkins  
will perform the procedure at University Hospital at the University 
of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve's message to his teammates was that he's sorry,'' coach  
Jeff Fisher said. ``That shows exactly what Steve's about, he feels 
like he let them down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNair missed two weeks of practice during training camp and two  
exhibitions with spasms and stiffness in his back, and the team 
treated him with injections and exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	He rebounded to throw for a career-high 341 yards in the Titans'  
season-opening victory against the Cincinnati Bengals. In that 
game, he tied his career-high with three touchdown passes and 
rallied Tennessee for the 36-35 victory with 10 points in the final 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair sat out Thursday's practice when he woke up with more  
spasms and stiffness. He returned to practice Friday when the 
injury apparently occurred. A battery of tests that evening 
revealed the damage, which will be repaired with a procedure called 
a micro-discectomy. 
</P>
<P>
	Watkins previously has operated on the backs of NFL quarterbacks  
Joe Montana and Troy Aikman. McNair is expected to spend several 
days recuperating in Los Angeles before returning to Nashville 
later in the week. His rehabilitation will begin almost 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair had played through a variety of injuries as Tennessee's  
starter the past two seasons, but his streak of 34 consecutive 
starts -- the fourth-longest current streak among NFL quarterbacks -- 
will end. 
</P>
<P>
	He also will miss games on the road against Jacksonville on  
Sept. 25 and San Francisco Oct. 3, at home against Baltimore on 
Oct. 10 and a visit to New Orleans on Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans' bye is Oct. 24, which could allow McNair to return  
to the lineup Oct. 31 against the St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Injuries are part of the game and you have to go on,'' Fisher  
said. ``The unfortunate part is that it occurred after his career 
game. Obviously he was off to a great start.''

<HEADLINE> Banned Pastor Says He'll Go On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A Methodist pastor suspended for one year for  
performing same-sex marriages says he will continue to officiate at 
the unions in defiance of church law. 
</P>
<P>
	``My ordination requires me to be in ministry to all persons  
without discrimination,'' the Rev. Gregory Dell said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He was reacting to a decision Friday by a denomination committee  
upholding the verdict that he violated church law by presiding over 
the ``holy union'' of two men last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell's one-year suspension, which began in July, could be lifted  
early if he agrees to comply with the church law banning same-sex 
ceremonies, or if the law is changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell refused, calling the prohibition ``unjust'' and ``grounded  
in bigotry.''

<HEADLINE> Pro-Pot Rally Held in Boston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Roughly 40,000 people packed the Boston Common  
Saturday for the 10th annual rally in support of the legalization 
of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they arrested 72 people at the rally, most on drug  
possession charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been coming here since I was 14,'' said Faith Pinkos, 19,  
of Providence, R.I. ``I don't smoke myself, but I don't find 
anything wrong with it. It's not as dangerous as alcohol. It's not 
hurting anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Activists with the Committee to Reform Marijuana Laws used this  
year's gathering to collect signatures for a proposed November 2000 
ballot question that would decriminalize the possession of 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	The organizers need to collect more than 57,100 voter signatures  
in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	If they collect those signatures and the Legislature doesn't act  
on their proposal, they must collect additional signatures in the 
spring before their proposal can go on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed law it would still be a criminal violation to  
provide marijuana to a person under 18.

<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Ansil Elcock scored the deciding goal of a  
shootout Saturday night as the Columbus Crew defeated the New 
England Revolution 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Cunningham, Stern John and Robert Warzycha also converted  
in the 4-1 shootout for the Crew, while Joe-Max Moore found the net 
for New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither team scored in regulation. Columbus is 17-11 while New  
England (10-19) has won just twice since the All-Star break. The 
Revolution are trying for the fourth and final playoff spot in the 
Eastern Conference and are fifth, one point behind Miami, which 
plays San Jose on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the shoot, New England coach Walter Zenga had to be  
restrained by Revolution officials after getting into an argument 
with referee Ted Covaciu.

<HEADLINE> Plane Skids Off Runway in Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANNON, Ireland (AP) -- An Aer Lingus jet arriving from New York  
rolled off the end of the runway at Shannon airport this morning 
after landing in high winds, but none of the 317 passengers aboard 
was injured, the airline said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no injuries and no need to make an emergency  
evacuation,'' said Dan Loughrey, director of corporate affairs for 
Aer Lingus. Earlier reports that the plane skidded off the runway 
were incorrect, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The passengers aboard Aer Lingus flight EI112 were kept aboard  
the aircraft for an hour. The plane's undercarriage was damaged but 
the fuselage was not affected, according to Shannon air traffic 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	The McDonnell Douglas MD11 aircraft, operated for Aer Lingus by  
World Airways, landed in strong winds and rain and rolled off the 
runway, Loughrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the passengers, the aircraft had a flight crew of  
three and about 10 cabin crew, Loughrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight originated at John F. Kennedy airport in New York,  
and was to fly on to Belfast, Northern Ireland. The 34 passengers 
going to Belfast were transferred to buses, Loughrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The airport was closed and several flights, including two other  
flights arriving from New York and Boston, were diverted because of 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Transport, the Irish Aviation Authority and  
Air Lingus were investigating.

<HEADLINE> Bias Case Costs Transit Agency $5M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A state transit agency has been ordered to pay  
$5.5 million to a black employee who was subjected to years of 
pranks and racial slurs by supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority foreman Hiram  
Clifton, 49, was awarded $500,000 for emotional pain and suffering 
and $5 million in punitive damages, the Boston Globe reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	MBTA officials said they would appeal the Suffolk Superior Court  
jury's verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifton, who worked at the agency's Charlestown equipment yard,  
said his white supervisors fired bottle rockets at him, wrote 
racial slurs on his locker, squeezed toothpaste on his lunch, and 
routinely addressed him with profanity and derisive nicknames. 
</P>
<P>
	He still works for the MBTA, but in a different area.  
</P>
<P>
	The verdict is the latest blow against the MBTA, which has been  
assailed by charges of racism and sexism in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	MBTA officials acknowledged that civil rights complaints have  
been unusually high at times at the 6,500 member organization. But 
Diane Wong, the MBTA's head of organizational diversity, said new 
anti-discrimination policies are working.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Asst. Coach Has Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama assistant basketball coach  
Robert ``Rah'' Scott will begin chemotherapy treatment this week 
after being diagnosed with stomach cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family and I know that God is on our side as we attempt  
this fight,'' the 41-year-old Scott said in a statement released by 
the university. ``I have always been a strong and determined 
individual. I'm looking upon this with none other than a positive 
attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama coach Mark Gottfried said Scott will continue to be a  
part of the coaching staff as long as his health permits. He said 
Scott ``is more than a co-worker, he's one of my best friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he's a fighter,'' said Gottfried, who brought the  
former Alabama star back as part of his staff last year. ``I'm 
going to support him and pray for him, and we'll celebrate when he 
beats it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Birmingham, Scott was a two-time captain at Alabama  
in 1979 and 1980. After playing overseas for six years, he served 
as a high school coach before becoming an assistant coach at UAB in 
1996. He returned to Alabama in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott is the second Alabama assistant coach to battle cancer.  
Kermit Koenig, an assistant under former coach David Hobbs, was 
diagnosed with cancer during his first season. Koenig currently 
works with the basketball's Tide Pride program. 
</P>
<P>
	Gottfried said assistant Philip Pearson would take Scott's place  
on recruiting trips, but said he did not anticipate any staff 
changes this season.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that she's finally won an Emmy, soap opera  
queen Susan Lucci is setting her sights on a Tony. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``All My Children'' star, who captured her first Emmy this

</P>
<P>
	If a deal is worked out, Lucci will replace current leading lady  
Bernadette Peters for three weeks beginning Dec. 21 while Peters is 
on vacation, the Post said. Peters won a Tony for the role this 
year. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Blames Guns for Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying that the repeated mass murders of  
innocent Americans has been the most painful thing he has had to 
face in office, President Clinton on Saturday said the easy 
availability of guns bears as much or more responsibility as does 
human evil. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, addressing the annual dinner  
of the Congressional Black Caucus, said that some have attempted to 
minimize the role of firearms in tragedies such as the murders 
Wednesday night of seven people in a church in Fort Worth, Texas 
and the suicide of the alleged gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course something horrible happened to that man's heart when  
he walked into that church in Texas. But we cannot use that as an 
excuse,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He asserted that the solution is a sharing of responsibility and  
a refusal to duck facts, not a search for scapegoats or an attempt 
to blame all gun murders simply on human evil. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NRA (National Rifle Association) and that crowd has got to  
stop using arguments like this to avoid facing our shared 
responsibility,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said tragedies such as this year's spate of school shootings  
and the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City has made 
the search for answers imperative. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the killing of innocent people en masse in America has  
been the most painful thing that (the vice president ) and I and 
our families have had to endure in discharging our duties for 
America,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He called on the country '' to make this election year about  
assuming responsibility, not ducking it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their back-to-back speeches, Gore raised the issue first.  
</P>
<P>
	``Too many hearts have been broken,'' he said, adding that some  
have tried to explain the killings ``by saying a sudden wave of 
evil has swept the county .'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My religious tradition says evil has always been with us and  
we need to meet evil with good,'' the vice president said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it is clear there is a pressing national need to get  
guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to act and not just talk,'' Gore said. ``We want to  
move our feet and lift our hands and work together.''

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Boat Collision Kills 30 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAGOS Nigeria (AP) -- Thirty people have died in a passenger boat  
collision on a river near the southeastern Nigerian coastal city of 
Calabar, a Lagos newspaper reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident occurred Thursday when two passenger boats  
approaching the Calabar jetty from opposite directions, crashed 
into each other after one of them lost control, the Saturday 
Champion newspaper said, citing police sources. Rescuers pulled 
four survivors out of the water, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokesman Joseph Eze, told the paper that a police had  
opened an investigation into the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Both boats had been packed with traders and produce. Boating  
accidents are common in Nigeria where vessels, used widely by 
traders in coastal and inland areas, are usually overcrowded and 
rarely carry lifejackets.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Damian Jackson and Quilvio Veras each homered  
and drove in three runs to lead the San Diego Padres over the San 
Francisco Giants 11-5 Saturday, stopping the Giants' six-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco dropped seven games behind NL West-leading  
Arizona, which beat Florida 8-6 in 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson hit a sacrifice fly in the second and had a two-run  
homer off Mark Gardner (4-11) in the fourth that gave San Diego a 
4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Veras homered leading off the first to tie the score and added a  
two-run single in a seven-run sixth that made it 11-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Sterling Hitchcock (12-12) allowed one run and four hits in six  
innings, getting 13 outs on grounders. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Gwynn was 2-for-4 to raise his career hits total to 3,051  
and needs two to tie Rod Carew for 18th on the career list. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner, making his first start since Aug. 28, pitched in place  
of Livan Hernandez, who has a strained rib cage. Gardner gave up 
four runs and five hits in four innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Bonds hit his 32nd homer in the first inning, raising his  
career total to 443 and moving past Dave Kingman into 22nd place on 
the career list. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego sent 13 batters to the plate during the sixth, which  
included a three-run double by Wally Joyner, and RBI singles by 
Gwynn and Phil Nevin. San Francisco helped with a walk, two hit 
batters and an error. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco added three runs in the seventh against Carlos  
Reyes on pinch-hitter Jay Canizaro's two-run homer and Charlie 
Hayes' RBI double. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Bonds has hit 50 career home runs against San Diego, more  
than he has against any other team. ... Veras' leadoff homer was 
the sixth of his career. ... Ellis Burks was back in San 
Francisco's starting lineup after missing two games because of sore 
knees. ... The Padres won for just the 22nd time in 65 games 
against teams with winning records.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Cook Convicted in 2nd Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A part-time cook's murderous crime  
spree that terrorized fast-food restaurant workers across Tennessee 
in the spring of 1997 brought two more convictions Saturday, with a 
third trial still to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Dennis Reid was already under the death penalty for two  
murders before he walked into Montgomery County Criminal Court, and 
he's scheduled to be back before a jury to face three more murder 
charges in November. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest case, Reid, 41, was accused of kidnapping Michelle  
Mace, 16, and her boss Angela Holmes, 21, after a holdup at a 
Baskin-Robbins ice cream store on the night of April 23, 1997. 
Their bodies were found the next day at a state park a few miles 
away. Their throats had been slashed. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid could get the death penalty for the slayings of the  
Baskin-Robbins workers. Sentencing beings Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen-year-old Sarah Jackson and restaurant manager Steve  
Hampton were the first the victims, found riddled with bullets in a 
Nashville Captain D's the morning of Feb. 16, 1997. Nearly $7,500 
was missing from the restaurant. Reid was given the death penalty 
in their slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, Homes and Miss Mace were killed.  
</P>
<P>
	A month to the day after the Baskin-Robbins kidnappings, four  
McDonald's employees in suburban Nashville were stabbed -- three to 
death. This time there was a survivor who identified 41-year-old 
Reid as the killer.

<HEADLINE> Vail, Colo., Mayor Is Quitting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- In a resort town where many people have  
second homes worth $1 million, a project to erect affordable 
housing for town employees has created a battle so contentious it 
has already claimed one casualty: the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rob Ford, a proponent of the housing initiative, has given  
notice that he will resign at the end of his two-year term in 
November. He will also quit the City Council, which appointed him 
as mayor in 1997, despite two more years to go. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's planned departure has become the subject of a new  
debate. Some have cheered it while affordable housing proponents 
are calling him a quitter. But Ford acknowledged difficulty 
continuing amid the deluge of complaints, some of them X-rated, as 
he strolled through city streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to go home at night when people are railing at you  
all day,'' said Ford. ``I was tired of getting yelled at ... (but) 
that was a small part of it. I skied the lowest number of times in 
the 25 years I've lived here. I came here to bike and ski.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford added, ``For a $1,000 a month, I figure I was getting $2.50  
an hour,'' noting that contentiousness and seemingly endless 
hearings had turned the mayor's job into a full-time job, leaving 
him no time to pursue his real estate and investment interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Like resort communities from Lake Tahoe in California to Taos,  
N.M., Vail has grappled with soaring housing prices. Most workers 
who earn lower wages -- police officers, firefighters, and even some 
doctors and lawyers -- live in towns as much as 30 miles away, where 
prices are lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford was first elected to the seven-member Vail Town Council in  
1995. He and the council held meetings to identify top priorities 
among residents. Number one was affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said it has become increasingly difficult to run the town's  
government with many key employees living outside of Vail. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people don't live in the community they don't become  
attached to the community,'' Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
	The council approved four housing projects, which triggered  
immediate, and very vocal, opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	For one project, the city donated land designated as open space,  
hired developers to build the condos and sold them to approved 
buyers to cover the cost of the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Project opponents are glad to see Ford go.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think his decision to quit is correct. But he should leave  
now, today, not wait until November,'' said Diana Donovan, who has 
opposed the housing project on open space. 
</P>
<P>
	Several groups have filed lawsuits to block that project's  
construction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe it is illegal to use this land for anything but  
open space,'' Ms. Donovan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are trying to cram affordable housing down our throat,''  
she added, contending Ford represents the views of business people, 
not residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Kayo Ferry, a coffee shop owner and president of the Vail Valley  
Merchants Association, supports Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he should have quit, quite to the contrary,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ferry said Ford's departure will delay solving the housing  
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Tom Steinberg, the town's first resident doctor and a former  
council veteran, believes the housing impasse stems from the 
``NIMBY'' factor: ``Not in my back yard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said everyone supports affordable housing, unless it  
is going to be built next to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``People seem to complain as soon as they come here,'' he said.  
``If you're working in a factory you don't have time to moan and 
complain. Here you just have to take 10 minutes off your tennis 
game.''

<HEADLINE> No. 12 Ga. Tech 41, Central Fla. 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Still upset about losing to No. 1 Florida State,  
Georgia Tech took out its frustration on another team from the 
sunshine state Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Hamilton rushed for a career-best 100 yards and two  
touchdowns, passed for 161 yards and a score and guided the No. 12 
Yellow Jackets to a 41-10 rout of Central Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Central Florida knew what they were getting  
into,'' Hamilton said. ``We needed a win. We needed the taste of 
victory in our mouths again. Unfortunately for them, they were the 
next team in the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Gregory, Tech's third-string tailback a week ago, made his  
first college start because of injuries and rushed for 150 yards 
and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yellow Jackets (2-1) piled up 318 yards on the ground  
against Central Florida (0-3), the second time this season they 
have surpassed 300 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous week, Hamilton passed for 387 yards and four  
touchdowns -- both career highs -- and rushed for a TD against the 
Seminoles. It wasn't enough to prevent a 41-35 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last week was such a bitter pill,'' he said. ``We were so  
eager to get a win tonight. There was nothing Central Florida could 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton scored on runs of 9 and 6 yards, sandwiched around a  
6-yard touchdown pass to Russell Matvay. The senior quarterback 
rushed 12 times and completed 12-of-18 before leaving the game 
early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory, a sophomore, was inserted in the lineup after Tech's  
top two runners went down. Joe Burns suffered a season-ending 
broken leg against Florida State and Phillip Rogers didn't play 
because of a bruised shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good that we have some depth to get that done,'' coach  
George O'Leary said. ``But the key factor is the offensive line 
that's blocking for them. And, obviously, there's Joe Hamilton. He 
makes plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't matter who was running for the Yellow Jackets, whose  
massive offensive line (average weight: 300 pounds) thoroughly 
dominated Central Florida's defensive front. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were drooling out there,'' Hamilton said. ``They wanted  
to run the ball. They wanted to stay out on the field. Any time 
they're like that, you want to run the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory handled most of the load, carrying 22 times and scoring  
on runs of 7 and 2 yards. Freshman Mike Kitchen, playing his first 
game, had 63 yards on eight carries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're clicking together and we've got good chemistry,'' tackle  
Jon Carman said. ``It all seemed to come together tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Central Florida has one game left in what has to rank as the  
most brutal opening schedule in college football. The Golden 
Knights came to Atlanta after losses to No. 14 Purdue and No. 4 
Florida and return to the state next weekend to meet No. 11 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tech beat us in every phase of the game,'' coach Mike Kruczek  
said. ``I can finally make that statement about our opponent. In 
our first two games, we gave the game away. Tech is a better 
all-around team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Knights got off to an impressive start, driving 80  
yards in 10 plays after the opening kickoff. Vic Penn completed six 
straight passes and Edward Mack scored on a 14-yard run, bursting 
through a gaping hole in the center of the Tech line without being 
touched. 
</P>
<P>
	Tech, averaging 42 points per game, had to punt on its first two  
possessions but finally evened the score after a line-drive punt 
and Marvious Hester's 16-yard return set up the offense at the 
Central Florida 21. Three plays later, Gregory scored his first TD 
from the 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Tech began to pull away in the second quarter. Hamilton scored  
his first touchdown from the 9, breaking one tackle and dragging 
three defenders into the end zone. After Javier Beorlegui kicked a 
39-yard field goal for Central Florida, Gregory gave the Yellow 
Jackets a 21-10 lead at halftime with a 2-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton accounted for two more touchdowns in the second half,  
passing to the wide-open Matvay in the third quarter and running in 
from the 6 with 12:02 remaining, his final play of the game. 
Freshman Luke Manget added the first two field goals of his career, 
from 32 and 37 yards.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Woody Woodward won't return next year as  
Seattle's general manager. Are the Mariners headed for an offseason 
of upheaval? 
</P>
<P>
	CEO John Ellis said he will be in charge next season, Chuck  
Armstrong will return as president, Lou Piniella will still be the 
team's manager and there are no plans to try to unload the 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	As Woodward announced his retirement Friday, Ellis denied the  
impending departure was just the tip of an iceberg in Seattle, 
where the owners are facing $100 million in cost overruns on new 
$517.6 million Safeco Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about persistent rumors that billionaire Paul Allen was in  
line to buy the Mariners and that Ellis might be on his way out, 
Ellis said, ``I think the answers are the same as they were the 
last several months. There is no change in my status. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as the sale of the team to some other consortium,  
that's a rumor that somebody must have contrived because there's 
never been any hint of that nor is there any indication on the part 
of any owner that they want to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, the team president, emphasized that Piniella, not Ken  
Griffey Sr., would manage the Mariners next season, refuting a 
report from Cincinnati that the only way to keep Ken Griffey Jr. 
would be to hire his father as manager. Griffey Sr. is a coach with 
the Reds and played with his son in the Mariners' outfield in 1990 
and `91. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know Lou Piniella is our manager,'' Armstrong said. ``Lou  
Piniella is signed through the year 2000. I think Lou Piniella is 
the best manager in baseball. I hope Lou is here managing for a 
good number of years to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement that Woodward, 56, was stepping down after 11  
seasons as Seattle's GM caught everybody by surprise, but maybe it 
shouldn't have. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Mariners moved into their new ballpark in July, the  
team is having its second consecutive disappointing season after 
winning the AL West in 1995 and `97. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodward denied he was pushed out.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had another year on my contract that was still in place,''  
he said. ``When John Ellis and Chuck Armstrong talked to me about 
my present deal, it called for the ability of either the club or 
myself to elect to stop this period of general manager and move 
into a part-time consulting position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I chose to make the move now.''  
</P>
<P>
	Woodward, the longest-tenured general manager in the majors, ran  
the Mariners for three ownership groups. He will retire Oct. 31 and 
take a Florida-based assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is purely Woody's decision,'' Armstrong said. ``I  
understand his decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong hopes to fill Woodward's job by the end of October.  
Lee Pelekoudas, Woodward's right-hand man and the vice president of 
baseball administration, said he would be a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodward said he was worn down by the job.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's never-ending,'' he said. ``It's really a 13-month-a-year  
job. It's come down to that. If you're not working on contracts or 
free agent status or minor league free agents or player 
development, you're suffering through every loss and every tough 
win. It eventually gets a little tough. Eleven years of it is a lot 
of years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodward hired his good friend, Piniella, to manage the Mariners  
in 1993. Under Woodward and Piniella, the Mariners had enough 
success in 1995 to help secure public funding for Safeco Field, the 
most expensive ballpark in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	By leaving at the end of October, Woodward won't be blamed if  
the Mariners can't re-sign superstars Griffey Jr. and Alex 
Rodriguez. Both players' contracts are up at the end of the 2000 
season. If the Mariners can't get them to agree to new deals, they 
may be forced to trade them this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey had no comment on Woodward's departure.  
</P>
<P>
	Last season, the Mariners were forced to trade Randy Johnson to  
Houston just before the trading deadline rather than lose him as a 
free agent at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the presence of Griffey and Rodriguez, two of baseball's  
top players, the Mariners took a 72-74 record into their final 
homestand on Friday night and were in third place in the AL West 
for the second straight year. They started the season with a $53 
million players' payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's never enough money,'' Ellis said. ``I'm sure Woody and  
anybody else would agree that there's never enough money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodward's departure brings speculation about the future of  
Piniella, who will no longer have a strong supporter in the front 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's not talk about my situation,'' Piniella said. ``This is  
Woody's day.''

	LOUDON, N.H. (AP) -- Jeff Burton has said all along that too much  
emphasis is placed on qualifying for Winston Cup races, and that 
starting far back in the field does not drastically reduce the 
chances of a top finish. 
</P>
<P>
	And he proved that two months ago at New Hampshire International  
Speedway, when he started 38th yet won the Jiffy Lube 300 for the 
third straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	So, defeatism won't be part of his package when he straps  
himself into his Ford and starts 37th Sunday in the Dura Lube 300. 
But he's getting tired of not knowing why he struggles so much in 
qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real frustrating, because when you think you're starting  
to learn something you haven't learned a thing,'' said Burton, 
whose three career NHIS victories and five overall this year match 
the circuit-best numbers of Jeff Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton has been thrilling plenty of fans with his back-to-front  
dashes when he qualifies poorly. But he doesn't want to keep doing 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton's fate is far better than that of three-time series  
champion Darrell Waltrip, who failed to make the field for the 
third time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Others who failed to qualify were Derrike Cope, Dick Trickle and  
Andy Belmont. Making the field on owner points were Burton, Kenny 
Wallace, Brett Bodine, Chad Little, Dave Marcis, Rich Bickle and 
Jimmy Spencer. 
</P>

<P>
	BAD TIMES: Auto racing is like the legitimate stage in many  
ways, where regardless of circumstances the show usually goes on. 
Still, drivers are not oblivious to tragedy that strikes others and 
the danger they encounter each time they race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be lying to you if I told you I didn't think about it for  
a moment,'' Kenny Wallace said in discussing the death Sept. 11 in 
Monterey, Calif., of CART rookie Gonzalo Rodriguez. ``I think as a 
race car driver you think about it and then purposely get it out of 
your head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No driver can afford -- nor do they have the idle time -- to be  
preoccupied during a race. But Wallace says they accept tragedies 
as inevitable in motorsports. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know the risks out there,'' he said. ``That's why we  
all hope for the best and prepare for the worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the drivers don't dwell on it in discussions with one  
another. 
</P>
<P>
	``When there's a death in racing, basically it's a short-witted  
conversation like what happened and how we can prevent it,'' 
Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	PIT STOPS: Jeff Gordon's unsuccessful run at a record-tying  
third straight Winston Cup title was short-circuited long ago by 
poor finishes. But when he's been on, it's been vintage Gordon. 
Although he's sixth in the series standings, no one has led more 
races, laps or miles. ... A victory by Dave Marcis would be the 
first from the 43rd -- and now last -- spot on the grid since Fonty 
Flock came from that far back in the field to win in Raleigh, N.C., 
in 1953. ... Seven-time Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt has 
completed 2,692 of a possible 2,700 laps in nine previous New 
Hampshire races. ... Gordon's victory last August in the CMT 300 is 
the only one by a polesitter on the picturesque New England track. 
... Rusty Wallace won the first New Hampshire race after starting 
33rd on the grid in 1993. ... Two-time series champion Terry 
Labonte makes his 628th consecutive start, extending his own NASCAR 
record for perseverance. ... Wallace won the inaugural Loudon event 
in a Pontiac in 1993. The only Pontiacs to finish among the top 
five since were those of John Andretti last year and Bobby Hamilton 
in 1997. ... Shawn Parker, a crew member for Mark Martin, has been 
fined $5,000 for pulling an official out of the way while NASCAR 
was detaining the Ford on pit road on Sept. 11 in Richmond, Va. ... 
Ken Schrader is thinking about his two children as he contemplates 
his new ride next year with MB2 Motorsports. ``What could be better 
than Daddy having a sponsor that gives them free M&AMP;M's,'' Schrader 
said. ... Presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole will be the grand 
marshal Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Uranium Worker Tests Said Ignored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PADUCAH, Ky. (AP) -- A recommendation 14 years ago that workers  
at a uranium processing plant be studied for exposure to highly 
radioactive plutonium was apparently never followed, a U.S. 
Department of Energy spokesman says. 
</P>
<P>
	A department task force in 1985 reported that plutonium  
contamination in the uranium ash shipped from the Paducah Gaseous 
Diffusion Plant -- then run by the DOE -- far exceeded levels allowed 
by law, spokesman Steven Wyatt told The Courier-Journal of 
Louisville for its Saturday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the task force called for a study but the ``exposure  
assessment'' was never done on the workers who actually processed 
the contaminated uranium. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyatt said the agency did a study assessing worker exposure to  
plutonium and other highly radioactive isotopes in 1992, but it 
didn't included workers who processed the contaminated uranium. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-year study, by IT Corp. of Washington, D.C., analyzed  
urine samples from 16 longtime employees who worked in various 
production areas and concluded ``the overall exposure potential ... 
for Paducah workers is not significant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department recently acknowledged, in response to a  
whistle-blower lawsuit filed in June by three Paducah employees, 
that workers were not adequately informed about the plutonium -- 
which can be lethal if even microscopic amounts are inhaled -- and 
were not properly trained to protect themselves from radiation 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department has known for more than a decade that  
plutonium in ash -- the residue left from preparing uranium for 
processing into fuel for nuclear bombs and power plants -- generated 
at Paducah from the 1950s until 1977 was hundreds of times above 
government safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1985 report found that ash from Paducah had plutonium levels  
up to 700 times higher than the Energy Department considered safe 
for handling without protection and training. 
</P>
<P>
	It's still unclear what levels of plutonium the Paducah workers  
were and are exposed to. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Energy Department announced that it would begin  
a more comprehensive study of worker exposures, in response to new 
findings that there have been shortcomings in the plant's worker 
health and environmental safeguards.

<HEADLINE> Pickens Back As Starter for Bengals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Carl Pickens is the Cincinnati Bengals' career  
leader in receptions and touchdown catches. So it's only natural 
that Pickens -- fresh from signing a five-year contract -- is a 
starter again. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is Carl's team,'' wide receiver Willie Jackson said. ``I  
realize that. He's making all the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson started last Sunday in the Bengals' season opener at  
Tennessee, after Pickens ended a holdout by signing a contract only 
two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson caught five passes for 60 yards in the 36-35 loss. It  
was his best day since catching a career-high eight passes for 69 
yards in 1996 while playing for the Jacksonville Jaguars in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickens, a Pro Bowl receiver with the Bengals after the 1995 and  
`96 seasons, signed a five-year, $23.25 million deal Sept. 11 -- 
after he threatened to skip the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickens saw limited action last weekend against the Titans.  
</P>
<P>
	Jackson is in the final year of a two-year contract he signed  
with Cincinnati as a free agent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals plan to keep using Jackson often.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just have to be ready to make a play,'' Jackson said. ``The  
more you play, the better you keep playing. I haven't had a lot of 
opportunities to be an every down player, but I know I can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bengals rookie quarterback Akili Smith, embarrassed about his  
lack of production last week when inserted after starter Jeff Blake 
had to leave the game with cramps, has been studying the playbook 
harder this week. Blake will start Sunday against San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from trying to play better his next time out, Smith hopes  
to look good if he is called upon to play against San Diego, the 
team from his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a Chargers fan in the winning seasons and the losing  
seasons,'' said Smith, a San Diego native. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 6 years old when his Bengals mentor, offensive  
coordinator Ken Anderson, directed the Bengals to a victory over 
the Chargers in the January 1982 AFC championship game in 
Cincinnati. The game was dubbed the ``Freeze Bowl'' because it was 
played in bitterly cold weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he would love a chance to play against the Chargers.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be real strange because I grew up watching those  
games and now I'm watching on the other side,'' Smith said. ``If I 
get the opportunity to play, I want a good showing.''

<HEADLINE> Brewers 7, Cubs 4, 14 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa swung his way into history Saturday,  
becoming the first major league player to reach 60 homers twice. 
Still, he couldn't keep the Chicago Cubs from yet another loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, who hit 66 last season while finishing four behind Mark  
McGwire, connected for No. 60 Saturday against Milwaukee's Jason 
Bere. 
</P>
<P>
	But Milwaukee's Ron Belliard hit a solo homer in the 14th inning  
and the Brewers added two more for a 7-4 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's historic homer came on a 2-2 pitch in the sixth, a drive  
that just went over the wall in center field and produced an 
ovation that lasted several minutes. Sosa crossed the plate and 
pointed to the sky and then went to the dugout and was hugged by 
teammate Glenallen Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, he emerged from the dugout for a curtain call and  
blew his trademark kisses to the crowd that had come to see one 
thing -- Sosa end a home drought and make the history books. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa had gone seven games and 33 at-bats without a homer since  
Sept. 9 and there was little doubt he was pressing. But he picked 
on his favorite pitching staff to end the skid. He has five homers 
against the Brewers this season after hitting 12 off Milwaukee a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	After his homer, Sosa, who once sold oranges and shined shoes in  
his beloved homeland, held up a sign to the TV camera: ``I Love You 
Dominican Republic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He got another standing ovation when he went to right field for  
the seventh, doffing his cap and waving to the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``SAM-MEE! SAM-MEE'' they chanted. Sosa, who salutes the fan  
when he takes his position before every home game, again took his 
cap and recognized the ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Babe Ruth had come the closest to two 60-homer seasons. He hit  
59 in 1921 and became the first to reach the mark in 1927, when he 
finished with 60 in a 154-game season. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Maris hit 61 homers in a 162-game season in 1961. No one  
else reached 60 until last year, when McGwire and then Sosa staged 
their friendly but spirited competition, with McGwire pulling away 
on the final weekend of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Sosa leads McGwire by four and they'll go  
head-to-head six times in the final two weeks, beginning Monday 
when the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals open a three-game 
series at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa hit No. 60 in his 148th game this season. Last year he  
connected for his 60th in the 149th game. That also came off a 
Milwaukee pitcher, Valerio De Los Santos. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa popped out and struck out before homering in his third  
at-bat. When he came to the plate for the fourth time in the 
seventh, Milwaukee's Hector Ramirez buzzed a pitch inside and sent 
Sosa sprawling to the dirt, prompting loud booing from a crowd 
announced at 39,304. Sosa then worked a walk, and the Cubs went on 
to score the tying run on Shane Andrews' bases-loaded infield 
single. 
</P>
<P>
	With Mark Grace at first, Sosa singled off Bob Wickman to put  
runners at first and third with no outs. Wickman struck out Henry 
Rodriguez and got Andrews on a shallow flyout but walked Hill and 
Lance Johnson, forcing in the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Reed struck out, ending the inning, but Wickman and Brewers  
manager Jim Lefebvre were ejected by plate umpire Greg Gibson after 
Wickman said something to Gibson as he left the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs loaded the bases in the first on a single and two walks  
but Sosa popped out to second. Andrews drew a walk two batters 
later to force in Chicago's first 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers got a run in the first off Micah Bowie on Marquis  
Grissom's double, Mark Loretta's single and fielder's choice 
grounder by Jeromy Burnitz. 
</P>
<P>
	A walk, single and two-run double by Robinson Cancel put the  
Brewers up 3-1 in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnitz gave the Brewers a 4-3 lead with a leadoff homer in the  
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Belliard connected off Mark Guthrie (0-1) with one out in the  
14th and Brian Banks added a two-run triple. Kyle Peterson (2-6) 
got the win with three innings of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Sosa hit his 56th last season off Bere when the  
right-hander was with the Reds. ... The Brewers are the only NL 
team to have a winning record on the road yet a losing record 
overall. ... The Cubs are 11-36 since Aug. 1. ... The game lasted 4 
hours, 44 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Americans Thrive in Boom Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW CANAAN, Conn. (AP)-- Scott Hobbs, building contractor for the  
ultra-rich, crosses a muddy construction site and pulls open a 
plywood box marked ``Fragile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside is a 5,000-pound, antique bathtub carved from a single  
block of Carrara marble. Hobbs will set it in the master bath of a 
$7 million house in this leafy Connecticut town. It's a bathtub for 
the new Gilded Age. 
</P>
<P>
	No one's prospered more from this country's nine-year economic  
boom and roaring stock market than the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	By almost any count, the well-to-do are flush with cash, and the  
very well-to-do have multiplied their fortunes. The number of 
American households worth $1 million or more jumped 37 percent to 
4.1 million since 1995. Those with $10 million or more rose 45 
percent, to 275,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A 150-foot yacht, once a head-turner, barely merits a glance as  
it sails through St. Tropez. Million-dollar weddings, with guests 
flown in on private jets, keep party planners busy. Hermes' most 
popular handbag sells out in less than a day, at $4,200 and up 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, there's the bathtub. Rare, beautiful and probably for the  
owners' eyes only. Such one-of-a-kind luxuries are exactly what 
those at the very top of the boom seek to quietly set them apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer billionaire Paul Allen ordered a recording studio -- for  
his yacht. Julie Taubman served ``pommes frites'' -- french fries -- 
and margaritas when she married the son of shopping mall magnate 
Alfred Taubman this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of our clients do want to be different,'' says Scott  
Hobbs, president of his family's contracting business. ``We're not 
building the same house over and over again. They want something 
that's personalized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He re-covers the bathtub, tucked in a corner of the five-car  
garage, and steps into the shell of the 20,000-square-foot hilltop 
house where nearly 50 workmen are toiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Saws whine nearby as he skims through a thick book of plans for  
the 18-month project, a family home for a 40-ish couple and their 
three children. Hobbs points out plans for the billiard room, home 
theater, and wine cellar. The husband and wife, who refused to be 
interviewed to safeguard their privacy, will have matching 16- x 
12-foot walk-in closets. 
</P>
<P>
	Just five years ago, Hobbs was building 5,000-square-foot  
houses. Now his average house is double that, and many more clients 
choose only the best materials: $1,000 door hinges, $10,000 
gold-plated faucets and custom-made cabinets even in the laundry 
room. 
</P>
<P>
	Not since the early 20th century has the country experienced  
such mansion-building. Today's grandest houses rival the great 
Vanderbilt and Astor homes of the first Gilded Age, a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palm Beach mansions designed by architect Jeffery Smith  
average 20,000 square feet, and in recent years, nearly 20 homes 
built in that region range from 23,000 to 64,000 square feet. Bill 
Gates' well-publicized house near Medina, Wash., spans 40,000 
square feet -- about two-thirds the size of a football field. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Allen Kramer, a Broadway producer, spends five months a  
year in her new 44,000-square-foot oceanfront home in Palm Beach. 
``I never think anything is too big -- until you have to staff it,'' 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
	The house, where she has a staff of six, is in ``perfect  
proportion'' to the neighborhood, Mrs. Kramer said in an interview 
in her New York office as her Shih Tzu dog napped on her lap. 
</P>
<P>
	Off in Sturgeon Bay, Wis., custom yacht builder Palmer Johnson  
is building six yachts ranging from 115 feet to 165 feet. Commonly 
used just a few weeks a year, such yachts cost up to $2 million 
annually just for upkeep and crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good old days are now,'' company president Mike Kelsey  
says with a chuckle. ``We're enjoying it while it lasts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mega-yachts and mega-mansions, of course, are still as rare as  
the multi-million dollar bonuses that top CEOs earn or the stock 
market payouts that Internet startups have been reaping. But 
farther down the economic pecking order, fortunes are also fatter. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 20 percent of American households -- about 54 million  
people -- saw their income rise nearly 40 percent to an average 
$102,000 in the last two decades, according to data from the 
Congressional Budget Office. In contrast, the lowest 20 percent of 
households saw after-tax income fall 12 percent to $8,800. (The 
average American household earns about $47,400.) 
</P>
<P>
	That means millions of people have millions to spend, and they  
do, particularly for luxuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 16 percent of new homes were 3,000 square feet or  
larger -- more than double the number in 1986, according to the 
National Association of Home Builders. Sales of boats longer than 
24 feet rose 40 percent in the last two years to $1.7 billion. 
Their average price? $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Down feathers, hand-harvested from the nests of Icelandic Eider  
ducks, fill The Company Store's new limited edition $2,300 pillow. 
That's right, a bed pillow. More than a dozen have been sold so 
far, says vice president of manufacturing David Pipkorn. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a real cachet in a product that's very rare and hard  
to come by,'' he says. ``Maybe it's an investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet The Company Store is no exclusive boutique. It's a bedding  
catalog, savvy enough to move into the booming mass market for 
luxuries for the rich -- and the wannabes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some buyers of Hermes' hot-selling Kelly handbag -- named after  
movie star Grace Kelly -- save up for the purchase, says company 
spokeswoman Marina Luri. ``The thing they have in common is that 
they aspire to one,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent shipment of four Kelly bags sold out at the  
company's New York store in less than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Martha Stewart peddles her wares at Kmart, and  
middle-class women buy Fendi bags, the elite don't feel quite so 
elite. ``It creates the problem for them of distinguishing 
themselves,'' says Harvard economist Juliet Schor, author of ``The 
Overspent American.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muffie Potter Aston agrees. A New York socialite married to a  
top plastic surgeon, she's also an executive at upper-crust jeweler 
Van Cleef &AMP; Arpels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fendi, Prada and Tiffany are everywhere,'' says Mrs. Aston, in  
an interview in a private room of the jeweler's Fifth Avenue salon. 
``There's a certain snob appeal to knowing you have the most finely 
crafted boat or handbag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Removing a $370,000 diamond and ruby brooch from a wall case,  
Mrs. Aston emphasizes the craftsmanship of the settings. Customers 
no longer demand the largest, most glittering gems, as they did in 
the 1980s, she says. ``Tastes have changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Showy is out. And so is precedent -- an exciting trend for book  
dealer Kenneth Rendell, who fills libraries for Bill Gates, among 
other luminaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of his clients today don't fill their libraries with proper  
proportions of Ernest Hemingway and Charles Dickens. Sometimes, 
they don't even fill them with books. One recent client preferred a 
library devoted to aviation-related letters and manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
	``A large number of my clients got where they are by being  
individuals, and they come to collecting with ideas,'' says 
Rendell. ``There's no sense of caring about what other people think 
or have done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Individual tastes also keep New York party planner Polly Onet  
busy. Her clients, including Julie Taubman, want one-of-a-kind 
celebrations -- a tough order when society guests have seen it all, 
says Onet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes more imagination and planning to get it to the point  
where people are walking away saying `Wow!','' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, in the pursuit of the artful, competition also comes into  
play. No matter how tasteful, mansions and mega-yachts do make 
statements, sometimes rubbing others the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
	``They move here with one or two kids and build a 10- or  
12-bedroom palace,'' says John Moffly IV, editor of the glossy 
monthly Greenwich Magazine. ``It's absolutely overbuilding in terms 
of need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's discussing the furor in Greenwich, Conn., a wealthy suburb  
near New Canaan, over new mansions, especially those built on small 
lots. The same battle is brewing in many suburbs nationwide, fueled 
by the same issue: new money. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenwich town officials passed a law in December reducing the  
house size allowed on most lots and restricting the size of homes 
on 2- and 4-acre parcels for the first time. A few residents are 
fighting back with a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Essentially what they're trying to do is stop the town from  
changing,'' businessman Al Small, who's leading the lawsuit, says 
over coffee at the Greenwich Starbucks one morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago, he bought a ranch house, tore it down and built  
a slightly larger house -- something he feels others should have the 
right to do. 
</P>
<P>
	But local realtor David Ogilvy says mansion-builders can't  
always do as they please. ``Some people forget that the town is a 
patchwork that fits together,'' he says. Too many people ``build as 
though they're the only house on the street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Far from this fray, 83-year-old Eileen Slocum pauses by an  
ancestor's portrait in her mansion in Newport, R.I. She's 
considering whether a new Gilded Age has changed her world of beach 
and yacht clubs, servants and impeccable manners. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, new families come. New fortunes are made. But mostly only  
those with old connections join Newport society, she gently 
explains. Even new things don't have currency in her circles. Her 
friends are too busy preserving the old. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea is to hold on to them now and maintain them and keep  
them recovered,'' she says. ``I don't see much acceptance of the 
modern and ultramodern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, Muffie Potter Aston voices a different worry about  
a world where change and new things do hold sway. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have gotten spoiled when the best is available in so  
many places,'' she says. ``The scary part of the economy being so 
good so long is that people are such collectors they don't even 
notice what they have anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Hobbs sees that, too. He looks at photos of the mansions  
he's built and their finely crafted interiors. 
</P>
<P>
	``People get used to having things. Once you have an exercise  
room, you can't go back,'' he muses. ``Well, you can but ... you 
don't want to.''

<HEADLINE> Miss Kentucky Crowned Miss America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Miss Kentucky Heather Renee French  
was crowned Miss America 2000 on Saturday night, becoming the first 
woman from that state ever to wear the crown. 
</P>
<P>
	French, 24, of Maysville, Ky., covered her face with her hands  
when co-host Marie Osmond announced her as the winner. She hugged 
the first runnerup and outgoing Miss America Nicole Johnson before 
lowering her head to receive the crown. 
</P>
<P>
	She then took the traditional walk down the runway, smiling and  
waving. 
</P>
<P>
	The first runnerup was Miss Illinois Jade Smalls. The second  
runnerup was Miss Pennsylvania Susan Spafford. Miss Maryland Keri 
Schrader and Miss Texas Yanci Yarbrough rounded out the top five. 
</P>
<P>
	French, a fashion design student at the University of  
Cincinnati, sang ``As If We Never Said Goodbye'' for her talent 
offering. 
</P>
<P>
	She plans to spend her year as Miss America campaigning for  
outreach for homeless military veterans. Her father, Ronnie French, 
52, is a veteran who was wounded in Vietnam and she volunteers at a 
Veterans Administration hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined her on stage after the crowning, and they embraced for  
about 30 seconds. He gave her a big kiss. 
</P>
<P>
	``You cannot imagine the feeling that is running through my  
entire being right now,'' she said. ``This is such a dream come 
true, I can honestly tell you. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father, I hope he was able to withstand that cheering crowd  
out there, because for millions of veterans in this country, this 
was a victory,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For winning, French gets a $40,000 college scholarship and a  
years' worth of clothing from New York design houses, but she has 
to live out of a suitcase -- Miss America typically travels 20,000 
miles a month during her reign. 
</P>
<P>
	Her victory capped a bizarre week in which Hurricane Floyd, a  
strike by hotel workers and the pageant's decision to drop a 
50-year-old ban on divorce and abortion threatened to upstage the 
annual Convention Hall spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, she hails from a state whose pageant director has  
been most critical of the decision to loosen the rules regarding 
women who've had divorces and abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	``She made the top 10,'' Miss Kentucky Pageant executive  
director Libby Taylor said earlier in the evening, after the top 10 
were announced. ``They haven't cut my throat yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pageant, hosted by newcomers Donny and Marie Osmond,  
promised plenty of new twists. 
</P>
<P>
	The most controversial one wasn't in effect this year, but that  
didn't stop Marie Osmond from making fun of it at the beginning of 
the show. The new Miss America plans to split the scholarship 
money, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's going to share it with her ex-husband,'' Osmond said.  
</P>
<P>
	And for the first time since Miss America took to the airwaves  
in 1954, viewers saw only five of the contestants perform talent 
routines, instead of 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated by declining TV ratings, pageant officials opted to  
cut the number of baton twirlers, tap dancers and pianists who try 
their luck on the stage in hopes of speeding up the show and 
holding onto viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Also cut were the traditional musical production numbers  
featuring contestants. In their place were profiles of some of the 
women, a video retrospective of Miss America -- the icon -- through 
the 20th century and a pre-recorded performance by vocal group 98 
Degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The swimsuit competition was still in. This year, the women  
picked their own suits (only thongs were banned) and decided 
whether to wear shoes or go barefoot. 
</P>
<P>
	Pageant officials have decided to drop a nearly 50-year-old ban  
on divorce and abortion. The Miss America Organization, which runs 
the annual beauty pageant, voted in June to strike the ban to 
comply with anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
	But pageant officials put the changes on hold after outraged  
state pageant directors who like Miss America the way she is went 
to court to block them. 
</P>
<P>
	In any event, the changes weren't in effect for this year's  
contest.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced for Kennedy Hoax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A man convicted of selling forged documents  
supposedly written by John F. Kennedy was sentenced to 10 years and 
three months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge called Lawrence X. Cusack III a ``man without  
scruples who would sacrifice any person or institution in the 
service of his greed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Denise Cote also ordered him to repay  
investors who sunk $7 million into the bogus stories. 
</P>
<P>
	Given an opportunity to speak before sentencing, a visibly  
flustered Cusack declined as he took off his glasses and rubbed his 
hands over his eyes. One of his lawyers handed him a tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	Cusack, 48, of Fairfield, Conn., was convicted in April of 13  
mail and wire fraud charges alleging he cheated investors of about 
$7 million between 1993 and 1997 with his false claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the false stories were claims that the president had set  
up a trust for Marilyn Monroe's mother to buy silence about their 
rumored affair and bogus proof that the president had covered up a 
secret marriage and divorce prior to his marriage to Jacqueline 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents nearly led to a chapter in Seymour Hersh's book,  
``The Dark Side of Camelot'' -- until their authenticity was 
challenged and the Pulitzer Prize-winning author deleted the 
chapter prior to publication. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors proved that one letter purportedly signed by Kennedy  
included zip codes that did not exist in the early 1960s and 
another that used a typeface created in the 1970s.

<HEADLINE> Records Shed Light on Atlanta Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Newly released records of Atlanta Olympics  
officials portray some International Olympic Committee members as 
``dishonest'' and ``sleaze bags'' and show that Atlanta officials 
bidding for the 1996 Games knew about such reputations early on. 
</P>
<P>
	That is in contrast to the picture the organizers painted of  
themselves earlier this week, as they argued they were neophytes in 
a potentially corrupt system while admitting several violations and 
possible crimes in courting IOC votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents were included in eight boxes released Friday by  
Atlanta organizers who fought for months to keep them secret. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight boxes also contain dossiers on each IOC member,  
including several mentions of who could be bought and who would 
welcome gifts or extra travel. 
</P>
<P>
	One memo said an IOC member is ``greedy ... and can be bought.''  
</P>
<P>
	There is one direct reference to an IOC member's sexual  
preference, and several other indirect references. 
</P>
<P>
	The dossiers were compiled by a paid consultant who previously  
worked on Anchorage, Alaska's unsuccessful bid for the 1994 Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Other references to the IOC's corrupt reputation include a memo  
dated Aug. 8, 1988, written by committee member Horace Sibley. 
</P>
<P>
	In it, Sibley described a conversation with RJR Nabisco  
executive John Martin, who previously negotiated Olympic network 
television rights for ABC and described IOC members as ``sleaze 
bags.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said they could not be trusted and were not the kind of  
people RJR Nabisco wanted to associate with, Sibley wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Sibley also wrote that the bid committee was ``fully aware of  
this ... and we were on our full guard in our effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And England IOC member Mary Glen-Haig thought ``cities spend too  
much money and bring out the worst in some of her dishonest 
colleagues,'' according to a memo from former Atlanta Olympics 
chief Billy Payne dated May 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The boxes were released after a prolonged legal struggle between  
Payne and several Atlanta news organizations, which sued to have 
the records opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Before relenting, Payne argued that the files contained  
information given to organizers in confidence and unsubstantiated 
gossip never acted upon. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta officials delivered a report to Congress earlier this  
week detailing possible violations during their bid -- including 
three possible crimes and two college scholarship offers. 
</P>
<P>
	The report amended a previous accounting given to a  
congressional investigation opened in the wake of the Salt Lake 
City scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	In making the report public Thursday, former Attorney General  
Griffin Bell denied any systematic vote-buying system like that of 
Salt Lake City, where organizers paid IOC members with cash and 
college scholarships during their successful bid for the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	But a high-ranking IOC member Friday said Atlanta bidders plied  
voters with lavish gifts and travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you read the memos, it is quite clear to see what  
(Atlanta's) intention was,'' IOC executive committee member Jacques 
Rogge said in a telephone interview from his home in Belgium. 
``They had this kind of seducing attitude, even with people whose 
reputation, honesty and character was absolutely beyond any doubt. 
It was a pattern of trying to seduce people -- and not vice versa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Italian IOC member Mario Pescante, secretary general of the  
European association, accused the Americans of ducking 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't we hear about the bid leaders who prepared this  
strategy to obtain votes?'' Pescante asked. ``Why don't the 
Americans take the responsibility for the people who organized this 
strategy of bribery and corruption? Who started this? They did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't accept this position from the United States,''  
Pescante added in a telephone interview from Rome. ``They are 
always against our movement. They don't have the humility to 
criticize their own behavior.''

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Seek Jerusalem Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Palestinian negotiators will insist  
on reaching agreements with Israel on thorny issues such as 
Jerusalem's status and the return of Palestinian refugees in a 
final peace accord, the new chief Palestinian negotiator said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yasser Abed Rabbo, who was appointed last week to lead  
negotiations with Israel on a final peace agreement, said that the 
Palestinians will not accept leaving any so-called final status 
issues to later stages of the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has suggested that the most  
hotly disputed issues be resolved through long-term interim accords 
that would defer a final arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issues cannot be separated,'' Abed Rabbo told a  
conference, insisting that an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank 
is inextricably linked to evacuation of Jewish settlements, an 
agreement on the status of east Jerusalem, and ``the main and 
fundamental issue of the return of refugees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians demand, at least in principle, that some 3  
million refugees be allowed to return to areas they fled or were 
forced to leave in the 1948 Mideast war and that are now part of 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak has said that some refugees should be allowed to resettle  
in Palestinian areas, but not in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Jerusalem, Israel has said it will never relinquish  
sovereignty over east Jerusalem, which it captured from Jordan in 
the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians claim that Jerusalem should 
be the capital of a future Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides have until February to draft a framework for a  
final peace deal and until next September to sign the final 
agreement. Negotiations opened this week, with both sides staking 
out maximal positions on issues like Jerusalem, refugees, final 
borders, Jewish settlements and water rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Another senior Palestinian official, meanwhile, said Israel  
handed the Palestinians half a percent less of the West Bank than 
it should have in the most recent troop pullback. 
</P>
<P>
	Saeb Erekat, who negotiated the signing of the latest interim  
peace agreement under which the Palestinians were to receive 11 
percent of the West Bank, said that Israel withheld 5.6 square 
miles when it handed over what it said was 7 percent of the West 
Bank last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Erekat wrote to his Israeli counterpart Gilead Sher, complaining  
that Israel did not take into account parts of the Dead Sea and 
Jerusalem totaling about 78 square miles when it calculated how 
much land to give over to Palestinian civilian control. The areas 
in question were captured by Israel in 1967, along with the West 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make sure that the size of the West Bank, as far as  
we're concerned, is (calculated according to) the June 4, 1967 
border,'' Erekat told The Associated Press, adding that the issue 
would be raised in committee meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak spokesman David Ziso rebuffed the complaint issued four  
days ago, saying that Israel gave the Palestinians 7 percent of the 
West Bank ``according to precise measurements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Erekat's claim, the Palestinian Cabinet said following  
its late night meeting Friday that Israel had fulfilled its 
obligation in the land handover. Erekat said that engineers noticed 
the error only after Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat signed the 
maps approving the transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Saturday, Israel announced a two-day closure on the  
Palestinian areas for the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, which 
begins Sunday evening. Beginning midnight Saturday, tens of 
thousands of Palestinians will be barred from going to their jobs 
in Israel, the army said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel often seals the Palestinian areas before holidays in an  
effort to prevent attacks.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jeff Agoos scored the winning goal as D.C.  
United beat the New York/NewJersey MetroStars 2-1 in a shootout 
Saturday night and extended their unbeaten streak to a team-record 
10 straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno's 42nd-minute goal, his fifth in the eight games, put  
United ahead 1-0. Richie Williams and Ben Olsen assisted on 
Moreno's 10th goal of the season. He has been involved in 10 of the 
past 11 goals for United in a five-game span. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Villegas tied it in the 48th minute, getting his third  
goal of the season off assists by Ramiro Corrales and Eduardo 
Hurtado. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaime Moreno and Agoos connected in the shootout for United  
(22-7), which has the best record in the league and is 17-1 against 
conference opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Kelly scored in the shootout for the MetroStars (6-23),  
who have lost 12 of 13 and 18 of 20. In their previous game, the 
MetroStars beat Columbus 2-1 to stop a 12-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C.'s Roy Lassiter, who has 17 goals this season, had a goal  
disallowed when he was called offsides with just over 10 minutes 
remaining.

<HEADLINE> Injured Piazza Misses Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Piazza did not start the New York Mets'  
game Saturday night against the Philadelphia Phillies because of a 
bruised left hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza left Friday night's game before the second inning after  
being hit in his catching hand by a foul ball from Ron Gant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels better than last night,'' Piazza said before  
Saturday's game. ``The swelling has gone down, but there is a 
little numbness in the thumb. Doctors said that's normal for the 
injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza, the Mets most dangerous hitter, is hitting .314 with 35  
homers and 114 RBIs. The Mets can ill afford to be without for him 
for long as they pursue Atlanta in the NL East and try to hold off 
Cincinnati for the wild card. 
</P>
<P>
	``No question, it's frustrating,'' Piazza said. ``I've been  
through this before. I want to make sure I go in when I know I can 
play rather than not being able to feel the bat in my hand and try 
to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza is expected to play Sunday, but with a day off Monday,  
the Mets could wait to bring back the All-Star catcher until they 
begin a three-game series Tuesday at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to come back until I know I can contribute,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Floyd-Spurred Floods Recede in N.J. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOUND BROOK, N.J. (AP) -- Record flooding caused by Hurricane  
Floyd's torrential rain receded Saturday, leaving a layer of 
reddish mud and residents anxious to return to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Several streets remained closed in the Raritan River town and  
National Guardsmen barred residents from returning to their homes, 
saying building inspectors needed to make sure it was safe to enter 
the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Christie Whitman toured shelters in Somerset, Bergen,  
Passaic counties, saying she expects the damage to top $100 
million. The governor also got an earful from angry evacuees in 
Lodi who demanded to know when they could return home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll do everything we can,'' Whitman said. ``Unfortunately,  
it won't be easy and it won't be quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 300 people remained in shelters in Lodi.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in these clothes since Thursday,'' said Charnett  
Hillireo. ``I have a 4-year-old here. He's going nuts. He didn't 
fall asleep till 4 a.m. He just keeps crying, `Mommy, I want to go 
home.' Who's going to help us?'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Police said a 75-year-old woman and her son, 50, were  
found dead in their flooded home in Bound Brook. New Jersey had a 
third death, at Little Falls, but officers did not have details. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service said the Raritan River crested at a  
record 14 feet above flood stage at Bound Brook and Manville. It 
was more than 4 feet above the record levels of Tropical Storm 
Doria in 1971 and a February flood in 1896. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton on Saturday declared eight New Jersey counties  
federal disaster areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bound Brook police said a curfew would be set for the flood area  
to stop people from returning to potentially unsafe homes and to 
prevent looting. The curfew was to last from 7 p.m. Saturday to 7 
a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 74,000 New Jersey homes and business remained without  
electricity Saturday night. Utility officials estimated that 
service would be restored to most of those customers by Sunday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 500,000 customers of Elizabethtown Water Co. were told to  
boil their water, because the company's treatment plant in 
Bridgewater was flooded and company officials feared it might be 
contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Powers, 40, stood outside the house he and his wife  
had moved into in May, grateful that the mortgage company insisted 
they buy flood insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time I groused, but now that the basement is flooded,  
for $700 I can't complain,'' Powers said.

<HEADLINE> Bahamians Reflect on Hurricane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- The waitress smiles, but fatigue circles  
her eyes. While serving customers in a Nassau cafe, Erica Wilson's 
mind wanders to family she hasn't been able to contact since 
Hurricane Floyd hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking a break on her Saturday morning shift, Wilson said she is  
concerned about relatives on Grand Bahama whose phones have been 
down since Floyd battered the island with 150-mph winds. 
</P>
<P>
	She is also weary because Floyd's handiwork has left her without  
water and electricity for five days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't even flush the toilet,'' Wilson said. ``I get up in  
the dark, and have to have my clothes ready for this morning shift. 
``I've got two kids. Imagine that, with no water and no 
electricity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Power has been restored to about 80 percent of New Providence  
Island, home to the capital of Nassau and half the country's 
310,000 people. However, residents were still scrambling for clean 
drinking water and ice to fill coolers used as temporary 
refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Bahamians are just grateful that so few people were killed  
or injured here before the storm moved on to the United States. 
Only one confirmed death in the Bahamas has been blamed on 
Hurricane Floyd -- a Nassau woman who was electrocuted Thursday when 
power was restored to her home. A man on Grand Bahama was swept to 
sea during the storm Tuesday and is missing and feared dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the worst affected islands -- Abaco, Cat, San Salvador  
and Eleuthera -- are still largely without electricity and phone 
service. Businesses and the government have begun shuttling water, 
food and plastic tarps to those islands. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is still tallying the number of lost homes and  
surveying other damage in this 700-island archipelago. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents who haven't had electricity since Monday gathered on a  
public dock to drink and talk. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing else to do,'' said Gregory Neely, 26, with a  
beer bottle in one hand and an unopened one in the other. ``It 
isn't all that bad. We just have to rough it for now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Audrey Grant, 12, didn't mind though. ``We get a day off from  
school,'' she said. ``What could be better than that?''
