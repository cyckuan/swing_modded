<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Executes Car-Bombing Criminals of U.S.-Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 31 (Xinhua)--Saudi Arabia today beheaded four
criminals for the November bombing near a U.S. military compound
in the Saudi capital of Riyadh which killed seven innocent persons,
reports reaching here from Riyadh said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reports said the four criminals
identified as Abdulaziz bin Fahd, Bin Nasser Al-Mothem Khalid Bin
Ahmad, Bin Ibrahim Al-Sa'eed, Riyakh Bin Suleiman Bin Is'haq
Al-Hajeri and Muslih Bin Ali Ayedh Al-Shemrani were beheaded this
morning according to the Sharia (islamic laws). All of them are
Saudi nationals.
</P>
<P>
The four detonated a car-bomb at a U.S.-run Saudi National Guard
training center on November 13, 1995, killing five Americans and
two Indians and wounding about 60 others.
</P>
<P>
They were arrested last month by the Saudi police and
confessed on state television to their involvement of the crime.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Saudi Interior Ministry said the Ministry
"Affirms the keenness of the government of the custodian of the two
holy mosques (the King) on guarding the security, safety and
stability of this country,"
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month following the four were arrested and
convicted of the crime, some radical Islamists had threatened to
retaliate against the americans staying in Saudi Arabia if the
criminals were executed.
</P>
<P>
It caused concern among the Americans who feared that they
might fall victims in possible retaliation accident by the
radical Islamists.
</P>
<P>
Since the November bombing, many of the residential compounds
of villas where Americans live have been putting under strict
security measures and are still guarded by members of the Saudi
National Guard.

<HEADLINE> Intensive Arab Contacts on Situation following Netanyahu's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The victory of Likud party leader
Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli elections has prompted intensive
contacts among Arab leaders to examine the present situation in
the region and future prospects.
</P>
<P>
Syrian official sources said that Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad today met with visiting Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa in Latakia, Syria in the wake of a telephone call Thursday
evening by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak during which the two
Presidents discussed the latest developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
President al-Assad received another phone call Thursday evening
from Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, and the two leaders discussed
the current situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on May 26, President Mubarak sent a letter to al-Assad,
which "dealt with certain Arab issues," as revealed by a Syrian
official source. Later on May 28, President Assad had a telephone
conversation with President Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
These contacts are taking place within the context of the
ongoing consultation and coordination among Arab states with
regard to the consequences of the Israeli elections on the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports reaching here from Cairo said that further
meetings are due to take place early next month among Arab leaders
with the aim of achieving Arab conciliation and clearing of the
Arab atmosphere, the ultimate target being the formulation of a
comprehensive Arab vision. Such a vision may define the basis of
cooperation, coordination and the common Arab action in the coming
stage.
</P>
<P>
Such Arab efforts include the holding of a tripartite summit at
the Jordanian town of Aqaba early in June, to be attended by
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Jordanian King Hussein and
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Hrawi disclosed Thursday that Lebanon
would be facing new challenges in case the Likud won the post of
prime minister. He said, however, that the Israeli elections
would impose a new dynamism with regard to the Lebanese and Syrian
tracks and to the peace process in general, though it could be
very slow.
</P>
<P>
Syria has been criticizing the Labor and Likud parties for
their adherence to expansionist ambitions, arguing that both Labor
and Likud want to maintain the occupied Arab territories, control
Arab water resources, uphold Jewish settlements and adopt the same
attitude towards the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts are of the view that the intensive Arab
contacts do reflect Arab anxiety over a slow-down in the peace
process after Netanyahu emerges victorious in the Israeli
elections.
</P>
<P>
They attribute this anxiety to the fact that the Likud policy
could be less oriented to peace as compared to the Labor party
platform. The Arabs actually fear that Israel, under a Netanyahu
government, may return to the policy of intransigence, shunning
compromise as much as it can.
</P>
<P>
Other observers, however, believe that the maintenance of the
Middle East peace process is of paramount importance no matter who
wins the Israeli elections. They argue that the establishment of
peace is in the best interest of all states in the region and for
the good of peoples all over the world.

<HEADLINE> (Urgent)Benjamin Netanyahu Elected Israel's New PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 31 (Xinhua) --Opposition leader Benjamin
Netanyahu defeated Prime Minister Shimon Peres in Israel's
election, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu won 50.4 percent of the votes, compared to 49.5
percent for Peres, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu spokesman Shai Bazak said the candidate would not
claim victory before Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Peres, 72, has not appeared in public since Wednesday's
election. His defeat will probably mean the end of a political
career that spanned five decades, including two stints as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leaders have expressed concern that a Netanyahu
victory would slow or paralyze negotiations over the final status
of the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Jerusalem, reports said.
</P>
<P>
``Maybe the next government will hesitate and postpone,'' said
Mustafa Natche, the Palestinian mayor of the West Bank town of
Hebron. ``Maybe there will be a continuous delay in all the
fields. This will be dangerous for the peace process.''

<HEADLINE> HK's Economic Growth for 1996 at Five Percent: Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's economic growth rate
of gross domestic product (GDP) for 1996 will maintain at five
percent, same as the forecast released in March, according to the
May update of the official economic forecast.
</P>
<P>
The forecast released today said that gradual recovery in
consumer demand, revival in private sector building activity, and
continued heavy investment in infrastructure projects are expected
to render a stronger growth momentum in the domestic sector.
</P>
<P>
In addition, sustained robust growth is envisaged for exports
of services. These should offset the more moderate growth forecast
for exports of goods.
</P>
<P>
The forecast of consumer price inflation this year is also kept
unchanged from the March forecast of 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending seemed to be bottoming out in the first
quarter, as reflected by the improvement in retail sales, the
smaller decline in retained imports of consumer goods, and signs
of a further increase in demand for consumer services, according
to the forecast.
</P>
<P>
It said that along with the pick-up in both stock and property
markets, sentiment in the local economy improved in recent months.
Prices and turnover in the stock market were significantly higher
in the first quarter than in the preceding quarter.

GENEVA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A two-day international conference
on refugees and migrants within the former Soviet Union ended here
today after adopting a document guiding efforts to tackle the
thorny issue in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The meeting produced no concrete measures to assist the 9
million displaced people in the Commonwealth of Independent States

binding.
</P>
<P>
It will be useful for the countries concerned in formulating
policies, a top official of the International Organization for
Migration told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Some donor countries had clearly indicated that they would
provide technical and financial supports for future actions, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 84 countries and regions, 28 international
and intergovernmental organizations, and more than 100
non-governmental organizations took part in the CIS Conference on

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Spending Up Slowly in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Consumer spending in U.S., which
shot up by 3.6 percent in the first quarter, rose just 0.1 percent
in April, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said consumer spending totaled 5.11 trillion
dollars at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in April, up from 5.1
trillion in March.
</P>
<P>
The rate was much slower than the 1.3 percent jump in February
and the 0.5 percent increase a month later. Consumer spending had
dropped 0.5 percent in January due largely to severe weather.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending represents about two-thirds of the nation's
gross domestic product. The Commerce Department reported Thursday
the fastest growth in consumer spending in more than two years had
driven the U.S. economic expansion at a 2.3 percent annual rate
during the January-March period of this year.
</P>
<P>
The department also reported that U.S. personal incomes rose
0.5 percent in April to an annual rate of 6.36 trillion dollars,
up from 6.33 trillion a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The advance was identical to the previous month's gain but a
bit less than the 0.8 percent increase in February.
</P>
<P>
But disposable income--income after taxes--fell by 0.5 percent
in April, the largest decline since a 4.1 percent drop in January
1994, due to a higher tax rate for some Americans.
</P>
<P>
The combination of incomes and spending meant that Americans'
saving rate--savings as a percentage of disposable income--was 3.7
percent, down from 4.4 percent in March and the lowest since a 3.4
percent rate in April 1994.
</P>
<P>
The income and spending figures were not adjusted for
inflation. When adjusted, disposable income fell 0.9 percent after
edging up 0.1 percent the previous month and rising 0.5 percent in
February. Spending fell 0.2 percent following March's 0.3 percent
advance.

<HEADLINE> Bhutanese Refugees Resume Peach March on Bhutan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Bhutanese refugees today resumed
their peach march on Bhutan with the aim to secure repatriation of
nearly 100,000 Bhutanese living in eastern Nepal.
</P>
<P>
A group of 207 refugees including 29 women left Damak in east
Nepal today for Bhutan through Indian territory, Nepal's official
news agency RSS said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Appeal Movement Coordination Council (AMCC), a
Bhutanese refugee organization based here, the marchers had
received a two-day orientation training before their departure.
</P>
<P>
The AMCC launched the peach march movement in January but
suspended it two months ago after Indian police arrested nine
groups of nearly 800 marchers on the Nepal-India border when they
were trying to cross the border into Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
Most of the arrested were released later after Indian courts
ruled that the arrests were illegal.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the group of marchers would bypass the
traditional routes this time to avoid possible arrests by Indian
border police.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100,000 Bhutanese refugees, mostly of Nepali origin,
began to live in eastern Nepal six years ago when Bhutanese
authorities forced them to flee their country.
</P>
<P>
Seven rounds of bilateral talks between Nepal and Bhutan in the
last three years made no progress in the solution of the refugee
problem.

<HEADLINE> Germany Advocates Greater European Role in NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Europe will perform "independent
actions without the intervention of the United States" in the
future, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said today before a
meeting of NATO foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from the 16 member countries of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), scheduled to meet in Berlin
on Sunday, will focus their discussions on the restructuring of
the alliance, especially the strengthening of Europe's
independence in defence.
</P>
<P>
NATO is a transatlantic military alliance that includes the
United States, Canada, and some European and Scandinavian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Berliner Morgenpost (Berlin Morning Post),
Kinkel said the upcoming meeting will discuss how to expand
Europe's operating capabilities in security policies, which will
lead to its greater independence in defence affairs.
</P>
<P>
Under a new formula for the command of the Allied forces, he
said, NATO will give the West European Union greater authority in
military command and planning.
</P>
<P>
Strengthening the European pillar is a meaningful complement to
the alliance, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel also suggested that after the June 16 Russian general
elections, NATO should carry out its promised dialogue with Moscow
and establish a "special relationship" with it.
</P>
<P>
NATO, while planning to expand eastward to include some member
countries of the defunct Soviet-led Warsaw Pact bloc, has proposed
to develop a "special security partnership" with Russia. But
Moscow has turned down the proposal.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee,
today praised a nationwide scheme which has seen millions of poor
children helped by youngsters in wealthier areas.
</P>
<P>
The praise came as the world celebrated International
Children's Day.
</P>
<P>
Hu spoke highly of the mutual assistance program which was
launched in 1990 by the Central Committee of Communist Youth
League.
</P>
<P>
The "Hand-in-Hand" Program aims at helping children in
poverty-stricken areas to get more assistance from pupils of
wealthier regions.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 22 million children in urban and rural areas
have taken part in the program. Altogether 23 million books,
magazines and other periodicals have been donated to poor areas,
and more than 10,000 small libraries have been established.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to donations from children in rich regions, more than 30
"Hand-in-Hand" primary schools have been set up across the
country. The total number of participants in the program will
reach 30 million this year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a get-together of exemplary children, teachers and
parents from around the country, Hu said that the program has
achieved abundant social benefits, and helped the children learn a
lot in "the school of society."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that closer attention should be paid to the
children's education, in order to guarantee a healthy development
of the whole nation in next century.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Though Beijing Opera is loosing its
popularity in modern Chinese cities, the residents in Taizhou are
singing its praises.
</P>
<P>
In the small city, the birth place of Mei Lanfang, the most
famous Beijing Opera artist in China, people not only cherish him
as a local hero, but also perform the opera regularly in the
streets or at theaters.
</P>
<P>
"We have had many books about Mei published, and we will
continue to play his repertoires," said Xu Yingyue, chairman of
the Mei Lanfang Research Society of the city, in east China's
Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The best cinema in Taizhou has named itself after Mei, and the
largest company in the city -- also the largest air conditioner
manufacturer in China -- even has put the master's name in its
trademark.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 names of places, firms and products, or even
cuisine, have something to do with Beijing Opera, or at least with
Mei Lanfang, according to city statistics.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin has paid a visit to the city, and
praised the city's efforts in promoting Beijing Opera.
</P>
<P>
Mei, a male artist who usually played female roles in Beijing
Opera, died 35 years ago. He had developed the theory of the
200-year-old art, a combination of lyrics, recitation and martial
arts.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Opera faces a threat from modern entertainment like
television and electronic games. One of the major concerns is that
young generations have become indifferent to the legacy of Mei,
except in Taizhou where the great master's name lives on.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Police Intensify Exchanges with Foreign Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 Chinese police
officers have been sent overseas to track down the latest
techniques and know-how in police work.
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Public Security says that 204 delegations
have headed abroad during the past ten years, in a move to
intensify scientific and technological exchanges with foreign
police.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the ministry said in Beijing that the
exchanges provided Chinese police with better access to advanced
scientific and technological achievements abroad, accelerating
the development of China's police and law enforcement system.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ministry has also hosted more than 1,100
experts from abroad during the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
In anti-explosion techniques the ministry has invited over 30
experts from such countries as the United States, Germany, and
Australia to lecture, with audiences of mainly police offices from
across the country topping 3,000.
</P>
<P>
In order to keep in touch with the latest police-related
information, the ministry has sent delegates to a dozen
international conferences in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The official also noted that certain police-related
technological networks have improved the Chinese police capability
to process information and make precise decisions.
</P>
<P>
He added that a computer network, exclusively built for police
work in more than 80 cities around the country, has played a
positive role in the field of firearms management, criminal
records, as well as stolen vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Police globally tend to rely more on the development of science
and technology, and international exchange and co-operation has
become the trend of the time for the same reason that the struggle
between police and criminals in modern times has become a contest
of intelligence, as well as science and technology.

<HEADLINE> HABITAT Chief Stresses Importance of Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Second United Nations
Conference on Human Settlements (HABITAT II) is aimed to bring a
"new concept of partnership" in seeking solutions to urban
development problems, the General Secretary of HABITAT II told a
press conference today.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wally N'Dow said that unlike previous large-scale
U.N. conferences, the HABITAT II will be a conference of
partnership, opening "a new era of working together in support of
human settlement development."
</P>
<P>
Such an inclusive approach, based on partnerships between
governments, NGOs, communities, households and the private sector
will help solve complicated human settlement questions, N'Dow
said.
</P>
<P>
Through the two-week conference, also known as "city summit",
N'Dow said that the first outcome to seek is to raise "public
awareness" on urban problems and developments.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he pointed out, is to introduce strategies,
especially means of financing, which fit different levels of
shelter requirements for the poor, for the not so poor and even
for the rich.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the conference will be a "classroom of ideas" for
problem-solving, N'Dow told reporters. All participants can learn
and utilize best practices and programs that have been successful
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The final expectation, the HABITAT II chief added, is that
governments will commit themselves to the key issues related to
shelter provision for the poor and to the improvement of urban
environment.
</P>
<P>
N'Dow quoted Turkish organizers as saying that some 40 heads of
states or governments are expected to attend the final stage of
the event.
</P>
<P>
So far, 6,000 official delegates, 6,000 NGO participants and
morn than 3,000 journalists have reportedly registered for the
meeting.

<P>
TIANJIN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The way was cleared today for a new
engine giant with Japan's Toyota Motor Corporation tying the knot
with the Tianjin Automobile Industrial Group.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Toyota Motor Engine Company has a registered
capital of 248 million US dollars, with both parties investing
half of the money.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture is expected to begin to produce auto engines
at the beginning of 1998, and turn out 150,000 engines a year. The
engines will mostly be used in local Charade cars, but some will
also be exported.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yingji, general manager of the new company, said that the
joint venture has pushed the cooperation between Tianjin and
Toyota from producing parts to building engines.
</P>
<P>
Hiroshi Okuda, president of Toyota Motor Corporation, promised
to bring his firm's advanced technology and management knowhow to
the joint venture to ensure success.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Lichang, mayor of Tianjin, China's third largest city,

<HEADLINE> GCC Holds Ministerial Meeting Aimed at Setting up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A ministerial meeting of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states is going on at Saudi Arabia
Capital Riyad today to speed up the process of the proposed
establishment of a unified tariff system, reports from Riyad
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Finance Ministers of the six GCC countries who arrived Riyad
Friday night for the meeting today expressed their hope to follow
closely the present world economic trend which tends to form
regional economic blocs, Local Kuwaiti News Agency (KUNA) reported
from Riyad.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural speech at the meeting this morning, Omani
Minister of National Economy and deputy Director of Financial
Affairs Ahmed Abdul Nabi Macki indicated GCC would, through a
unified custom tariff system, follow the way of setting up
economic bloc aimed at pursuing free trade and investment in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting shed light on the obstacles hindering unifying the
tariffs among the GCC countries, KUNA said.
</P>
<P>
The long proposed system has eluded them for years and delayed
a planned common market among them. The meeting aimed at bridging
the gap between their customs tariffs on foreign imports is in
line with a decision by the GCC summit last December to pursue
contacts to reach a single customs tariff.
</P>
<P>
The GCC Finance Ministers had met in Riyad before the Summit to
drive at a joint formula on tariffs, yet different points of view
regarding the percentage and period required for the unified
tariffs hindered reaching a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
Customs tariffs in the GCC vary widely, with Saudi Arabia and
Bahrain imposing duties of more than 20 percent on some imports
and the United Arab Emirates and Oman levying below five percent.
</P>
<P>
Official sources at the meeting was reportedly saying that the
ministers will try to bring their points of view close together in
a way to contribute to global economic situation.
</P>
<P>
The sources said a technical joint committee had concluded
several meetings during which it classified 800 commodities out
of 1,200 covering those to be taxed or exempted.
</P>
<P>
A joint meeting with Foreign Ministers of the GCC countries is
scheduled to be held tonight to make further efforts in thrashing
out the obstacles hindering a final agreement on the proposal
floated several years back.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Four Nights of Power Blackout End in Sri </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 1 (Xinhua)-- Four nights of power blackout ended
in Sri Lanka this evening following the release of a government
communique.
</P>
<P>
The power blackout began on Wednesday following a strike staged
by 14,000 employees of Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) including
engineers and accountants, who demanded a halt to a proposed
privatization of their establishment and wanted a wage hike.
</P>
<P>
The government's refusal to the workers' demands led to the
power blackout and water supply cutoff throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The whole country came to a standstill since mid-day Wednesday
with commercial establishments and schools closed.
</P>
<P>
On Friday the government promulgated emergency regulations
declaring electricity an essential service, and some strike
leaders were arrested.
</P>
<P>
The government issued a communique this afternoon calling upon
all striking workers to return to work.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that all employees of the CEB are called
upon to report for duty before 6:00 p.m. today. Employees failing
to report for duty by the time will be deemed to have vacated
their posts and be liable for the confiscation of their movable
and immovable properties.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the strike the country experienced four to six hour
power cuts daily due to the failure of the South West Monsoon to
supply the country's catchment areas and reservoirs with
sufficient water to operate power generators.
</P>
<P>
Despite the resumption of power supply it is anticipated that
limited power cuts will continue for an extended period until the
rains come, informed sources said.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Scientist Locates Polycystic Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot scientists at the
Institute of Neurology and Genetics have scored a great medical
success in locating the gene that causes the development of
polycystic kidney disease.
</P>
<P>
The location of the polycystic gene will greatly assist in the
prompt diagnosis and better treatment of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Molecular biochemist and geneticist Constantinos Deltas, who
located the gene after a four-year research, was quoted by Cyprus
News Agency as saying today that this is one of three known genes
that cause the disease.
</P>
<P>
Only some 15 percent of the polycystic kidney disease cases are
attributed to this gene, he said.
</P>
<P>
One gene had been identified and located two years ago, while a
third gene which has been identified is still to be located,
Deltas said.
</P>
<P>
He also explained that if either of the parents is a sufferer,
there is a 50 percent chance for the disease to be transmitted to
the embryo through this gene.
</P>
<P>
According to Deltas, the research for the location of the gene
was conducted as part of an international program headed by
American professor Stefan Somlo, who will be visiting Cyprus in
June.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot kidney specialist Alkis Pierides and molecular
biologist Stavroula Xenophontos also contributed to the research
for the location of the gene.
</P>
<P>
The results of the research have been published in the
scientific magazine "Science". It is considered to be one of the
greatest successes of the Institute of Neurology and Genetics
scientific team. This research is funded by the U.S. National
Institutes of Health.

<HEADLINE> Tears Of Joy at China's School for Waifs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Liu Hong ran away from home in
Sichuan three years ago after a family quarrel. After tramping
around many cities in China, he arrived in Shanghai and settled
down.
</P>
<P>
Liu was then told he would have to go to school.
</P>
<P>
"I could not believe when I heard that they would send me to a
school. But when I was finally in the classroom, I felt that my
soul was re-located after years of roaming," Liu wrote in his
diary.
</P>
<P>
Liu recalled how he fled from home after the row and in 1994 he
drifted to Shanghai and was picked up by the city's Center for the
Education and Protection of Homeless Children.
</P>
<P>
Liu told Xinhua that he received comfort at the center, and his
true wish now is to be re-united with his family soon.
</P>
<P>
Most street urchins the center receives share the same feelings
as Liu.
</P>
<P>
Now, the center has 27 street children, aged between 12 and
16. Most of them are illiterate or poorly educated. They have
roamed the country for between two and eight years, and 90 percent
of them have conducted illegal acts like theft.
</P>
<P>
"However after staying at the center for several months they
have changed a lot," said Cheng Linxiu, who is in charge of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Set up in March this year, the center is being run by three
teachers, who previously worked in ordinary schools, now helping to
get rid of the bad habits of the homeless children and re-build
their confidence in life.
</P>
<P>
Classes on morality, sanitary information, and labor skills
have been opened for the students, plus simple military training,
to overcome their slackness.
</P>
<P>
New chairs and desks have been added, and all the children have
been given new clothes. Additionally, the children were all sent to
clinics, where skin diseases could be cured.
</P>
<P>
At the very beginning many students were on "full alert" and
often told lies to the teachers, fearing that the center had
something to do with officialdom. But several days later, 17
children told the teachers their true names, ages and addresses,
some of them even reported their illegal acts.

<TEXT>
<P>
Many children said that the teachers were even better than
their parents.
</P>
<P>
Yang Xianfa, 13, had tramped half of China's territory since
leaving home in May last year. He even went to Hong Kong. The
center tried its best to help re-build contact with Yang's
parents, who had already spent 20,000 yuan to find their son - the
equivalent of five years pay for a Chinese worker.
</P>
<P>
When Yang's father picked up his son at the center tears fell down
on his face. Other children also were moved at the scene, saying
they also would prefer to go back home.
</P>
<P>
Over recent weeks, eight students have been picked up by their
parents, and everyone said he or she would not come to other
cities aimlessly.
</P>
<P>
"Waifs remains a phenomenon emerged in a rapidly changed
society and economy, and it has caused great concern among the
government and the public," said Zhou Changgeng, a teacher at the
center, who previously taught moral lessons at a middle school
for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Every year large numbers of "floating population" find their
way to Shanghai. Most of them, from rural areas, think there
is a bigger chance of making money in the metropolis.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 the United Nations Children's Fund launched a
cooperation program with the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs to
help waifs.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Shanghai, two cities in north China also have
set up protection and education centers for waifs. And it is
expected that similar organizations will spring up in most
provinces and cities in China before the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Dengue Fever Kills 18 in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- An outbreak of dengue fever, a
cholera-like disease, killed at least 18 people and afflicted
hundreds of others in Central Java and Southern Sumatra,
Indonesia, in the past month, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
In Tegal, Central Java, five were killed by the disease, while
171 others were hospitalized for further treatment, the official
Antara news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the disease, which has been hitting Jambi, capital
of Southern Sumatra province since January this year, has claimed
at least 13 lives, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever, an acute tropical disease transmitted by
mosquitoes, leaves its victims with fever, rash and severe pains
in the joints and back. The cholera-like disease, known locally as
"muntaber", causes vomiting and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
The disease has been detected in several regions, including
Jakarta, since early this year, but due to limited awareness among
the people, it spread out quite easily.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta alone, some 18 people have also died of dengue fever
between January and May, down 25 percent over the same period of
last year, the report quoted a health spokesman as saying.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai-S'pore Economic Ties Brought To Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa wound up his official visit to Singapore and left for
home today with closer economic and trade links between the two
countries freshly forged during the three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the result of his visit, Banharn told a press
conference on Friday that the economic ties between Thailand and
Singapore had been brought to a higher plane.
</P>
<P>
Banharn said the purpose of his trip to Singapore was to
strengthen the relationship with Singapore leaders. Observers here
noted, however, that with an accompanying delegation of 82
members, which included not only cabinet ministers and
high-ranking government officials, but also business leaders, the
visit had an economic focus.
</P>
<P>
Banharn said the challenge lying ahead was to boost joint
development of the Mekong Basin and the trans-Asia railway, the
two projects which were among the web of initiative launched at
the ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Summit and
the Asia-Europe Meeting in March this year.
</P>
<P>
At the start of his visit here, the Thai Prime Minister told
the local press that he always considered that Singapore is one of
the richest ASEAN countries both in terms of financial and human
resources.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore's advantage lies in its greater investment powers
and technological capacity, which could be of great potential to
assist in different areas of development, such as transportation,
telecommunications, information network, trade and investment, and
training.
</P>
<P>
"We would certainly welcome their active involvement and
contribution both from the government and private sector" of
Singapore, he said.
</P>
<P>
After their talks, Banharn and his Singapore counterpart Goh
Chok Tong announced their agreement that the buoyant private
sectors of the two countries should pursue new business
opportunities in each other's country, and also move on to invest
jointly in the emerging Mekong region.

<TEXT>
<P>
Urging teamwork in the resource rich but still virgin Mekong
region, Goh said, "there is also tremendous scope for co-operation
in the Mekong Basin Development Project. Our private sectors can
combine their resources and relative strengths to achieve more
than if they go on their own.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand and Singapore can play a catalytic role with other
like-minded countries to accelerate the economic growth of the
Mekong region."
</P>
<P>
The Mekong region encompasses Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam,
Cambodia, Laos and the southern province of Yunnan of China.
</P>
<P>
Before his arrival here on Thursday, Banharn also told local
media that he would invite the Singapore private sector to invest
more in Thailand, especially in the Eastern Seaboard and the
Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand growth triangle.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan, who was on the delegation
accompanying Banharn, said the seaboard, 120-km from Bangkok, was
attractive especially for basic industries. Deep-sea port
facilities and energy supply were available, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore government responded positively to the Thai
invitation. Banharn said a Singapore delegation led by a minister
would go to Thailand in November to visit and assess the
investment potential of the eastern seaboard industrial zone.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore minister would also discuss the proposed
co-operation in developing a high-speed rail network in the
region, particularly a link to Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The planned trans-Asian railway system would integrate ASEAN
with the Mekong states, and help bring prosperity to both regions,
Deputy Prime Minster Amnuay Viravan said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to bilateral economic co-operation, the Thai Prime
Minister said one more objective of his visit was to see for
himself the level of development and prosperity that Singapore has
achieved.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, I was very much impressed by the level of economic
development attained by Singapore despite its small population and
land area," he said.

<HEADLINE> "Dialogue Stone" Found in Temple of Heaven </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have found a
new voice-transmitting stone at the Imperial Vault of Heaven
located inside the Temple of Heaven in this Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The "Dialogue Stone" was tested Friday for its authenticity by
12 Chinese experts of ancient architecture, cultural relics and
acoustics.
</P>
<P>
It is yet another acoustic discovery in the Temple of Heaven,
following the Echo Wall, Triple Sound of Voice Stone and the
Circular Mound.
</P>
<P>
The Dialogue Stone was first found in 1994, while Chinese
researchers were measuring the size of the West Auxiliary Hall of
the Imperial Vault of Heaven.
</P>
<P>
It is the 18th slate stone on the paved path that leads to the
main hall of the Imperial Vault of Heaven.
</P>
<P>
Researchers say that the voice of a person who stands on the
stone and speaks can clearly be heard 36 meters away at the
northeast corner of the East Auxiliary Hall or at the northwest
corner of the West Auxiliary Hall, which are both attached to the
Imperial Vault of Heaven.
</P>
<P>
Further tests have shown speech can be heard from the stone
even when the area is crowded and noisy. However, the human voice
is not audible in other places under same conditions.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 and 1995, Chinese researchers conducted five studies of
the new acoustic phenomenon at the Imperial Vault of Heaven.
</P>
<P>
Yu Wenguang, head of the research program, said the Dialogue
Stone transmits speech through the reflection and convergence of
sound waves and through echoes.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraq began to export its first
quantities of oil late Thursday night via a pipeline ending in
Jihan harbor of Turkey after signing an oil-for-food deal with the
U.N. on May 20.
</P>
<P>
The oil will reach the world market over the coming days, Talal
Ashor Kanaan, General Manager of the Iraqi Petroleum of the North
Co., was quoted today as saying by the local daily El-Gomhuria.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rafed Mohammed Yassin el-Dabbouni, General Manager
of the Iraqi Petroleum of the South Co., announced the completion
of his company's facilities and final preparations for the export
of Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
The company is ready to provide the required quantities and
brands of crude oil for export and local industrial installations,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will resume its oil exportation by mid June at a rate of
800,000 barrels a day, 450,000 of which will be exported via
Jihan, Turkey, and the rest 350,000 barrels, via el-Bakr
sea-port, south Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the U.N. reached an oil-for-food deal on May 20, which
allows Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over a
six-month period to buy food and other humanitarian goods for its
people, who have been suffering for nearly six years due to a
sanction imposed on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in
1990.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Boost Program to Protect Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has decided to name June 1
and 2 "micro-nutrient days" with a view to boost a program to
protect children from iodine, iron and vitamin A deficiency, a
report said today.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, which was launched in 1988 to prevent
micro-nutrient deficiency, more than 90 percent of children
between six months and five years old, and 80 percent of
post-natal mothers have been given vitamin A so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Pregnant women in 100 communes of 10 provinces have been
provided with iron tablets, and all residents in mountainous areas
(about 50 million people) and 50 percent of those in plains have
used iodized salt, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Before 1988, 50 percent of Vietnamese children under five years
old were malnourished, 94 percent of the country's population
lacked iodine, and 50 percent of the women lacked iron, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
According to UNICEF, Vietnam ranks first in the world in
reducing mortality rate among children under five years old, the
report added.

<HEADLINE> Cypriots Warned against Smoking Habits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Around 850 Cypriots will die this
year as a result of their smoking habits while another 48,000
long term smokers will have 20-25 years cut from the life
expectancy.
</P>
<P>
This was warned here Friday by the General Director of the
Ministry of Health, Achilleas Patzinakou, in a statement marking
World No Tobacco Day, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The statistics are in line with the World Health Organization
report that estimates about 62 million people will die from
smoking-related diseases by the end of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Patzinakou said 600 new cases of cancer reported every year in
Cyprus were a result of smoking and out of every 100 lung cancer
cases 90 were caused by smoking.
</P>
<P>
He said that "there is a tragic picture at our hospitals where
not only visitors can be seen smoking but patients and even worse
doctors and other medical staff."
</P>
<P>
The official said during the coming year, measures would be
taken to implement the law in medical clinics and draw up a bill
outlawing smoking in schools.
</P>
<P>
This year's World No Tobacco Day is dedicated to sports and
the arts in the hope that big names in both fields will lead the
way in promoting healthy lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization organized this year's events in
conjunction with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the International Olympic Games
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus Cancer Association and Friends have published a
directory on how to stop smoking.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus Non-Smokers' League have organized events up to
June 7, including the banning of selling cigarettes in army
canteens combined with a series of lectures.
</P>
<P>
The events will also feature the distance running, bicycle
rally and an exhibition titled Art Against Smoking, sponsored by
the Ministry of Health in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> 309 Scientific Workers Receive Poverty-Reduction Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 300 scientific workers
were awarded today for their efforts to reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
Liang Changjian, a research fellow with the Agriculture and
Animal Husbandry Department of Henan provincial government, and
eight other experts were given 1995 "outstanding contribution
awards" for their roles in three poverty-reduction programs in
Henan, Hunan and Shaanxi provinces.
</P>
<P>
Liang and two other experts are in charge of a program of
technology research and promotion of large-scale sericulture in
the Dabie mountainous area. The program has helped
poverty-stricken farmers produce 420 million yuan in economic
returns after the sericulture technology was promoted in nearly 60
counties in central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The three programs were given 15,000 Hong Kong dollars each by
Zhenhua Poverty-reduction Fund, which were launched by the Society
of Hong Kong Scholars and the State Science and Technology
Commission in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 300 Chinese scientific workers were given the 1995
"poverty-reduction service awards", with each of them receiving
about 2,400 Hong Kong dollars in subsidies.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the fund said the fund was designed to
subsidize and encourage scientific workers to help lift poor
farmers out of poverty and promote local economies with their
expertise.
</P>
<P>
Among the people present at the award-presenting ceremony were
Professor Ng Cling-Fai, sponsor of the fund and former president
of the Society of Hong Kong Scholars, and 13 other members of the
society.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guangying, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, or the country's top legislature, said
at the ceremony that the Chinese population living in abject
poverty was reduced to 65 million in 1995 from 250 million in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The vice-chairman said China has mapped out plans to wipe out
abject poverty by 2000 and lift the remaining 65 million people
out of poverty.

<HEADLINE> Iran Inaugurates Fifth Parliament under Hard Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran today inaugurated the Fifth
Islamic Consultative Assembly (parliament) with a hard and Islamic
line as its melody for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
More than 240 elected deputies were sworn in to the 270-seat
parliament today in the presence of President Hashemi Rafsanjani
and cabinet ministers as well as other high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei did not appear in the
two-hour opening ceremony of the new parliament, but he sent his
message to the parliament, stressing once again the Islamic
principles and values in all decision-making processes in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei reiterated that the Islamic Republic of Iran does not
want any kind of development that does not take into
consideration or contravenes these principles, adding that any
desired kind of development should be inspired by Islamic
principles.
</P>
<P>
He indirectly criticized the Rafsanjani government in the
opening ceremony with the presence of more than 100 foreign
ambassadors, saying "there are creeping tendencies within the
nation which try to move its government apparatus toward
liberalism and Westernization in particular."
</P>
<P>
But he called on the deputies not to use the parliament to
create friction with the government or insult the government, and
he also stressed cooperation between the parliament and the
government.
</P>
<P>
President Rafsanjani did not argue with Khamenei on any
issues in the opening ceremony and said that development should
not be in contravention of principles of the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Today's opening ceremony did not mention about the election of
the new parliament speaker.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, a hardliner
and speaker of the previous parliament, and Abdullah Nouri,
former interior minister in Rafsanjani's cabinet, will compete for
the post.
</P>
<P>
The elections for the fifth term of the Islamic Consultative
Assembly were launched on March 8 and finally ended on April 19 after
runoff elections.
</P>
<P>
During the elections, the two factions -- the liberal camp
headed by moderate President Rafsanjani and the conservative camp
headed by former parliament speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri --
fought a fierce battle in a bid to gain the majority in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Although it is still early to comment with certainty about the
composition of the new parliament, it can be sure that
the parliament is still dominated by the hard-liners backed by Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts predicted that the conservative faction
occupies about 50 percent of the 270-seat parliament, the
pro-Rafsanjani moderate faction about 30 percent, the left wing
known as the Followers of the Iman's Line 10 percent and the
independents about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, they noted, the right-wingers have the majority in
the new parliament, but it is already clear that they have lost
their power of absolute domination and monopoly for ever.
</P>
<P>
In other words, they will no more be able to impose their
views on other factions. The fundamentalists and liberals will
counter face to face in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The local press issued editorials and commentaries, urging the
deputies to keep their election promises.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily Tehran Times said in its editorial that
the nation expects the two main groups in the parliament to avoid
ambiguity and clarify their plans for achieving the goals of
social justice and socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
Reminding that none of the contenders is a well-knitted
organized political party, the paper also called on the two
groups to form political parties to increase the accountability
of their group.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Hebron Issue Again Surfaces for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The curtain has drawn for the
Israeli general elections with Likud Party leaderBenjamin
Netanyahu elected as the next prime minister, the West Bank town
of Hebron again surfaced as one of the most pressing issues for
the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Some incumbent ministers from the Labor Party were reportedly
in favor of Prime Minister Shimon Peres ordering a redeployment of
the Israeli troops in Hebron before the next government, to be
headed by Netanyahu, takes over the reins so as not to risk a long
delay in the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Hebron is the last West Bank town the Israelis were supposed to
pull out in accordance with the PLO-Israeli peace agreements, and
the Palestinians were worried about the delay in a possible
Israeli pullout under the administration of Netanyahu, who is
widely-viewed as a hardliner compared with Peres.
</P>
<P>
Under the accords, Israel handed control of two-thirds of Gaza
and one-third of the West Bank to the Palestinians, with a promise
to pull back more troops over the next 18 months. Talks on the
final status of the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem began in May.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat convened a
meeting of his senior aides and top officials to discuss the new
situation in Gaza Friday evening, only hours after the
announcement of Netanyahu's victory in elections.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources here said that Arafat wanted to know about
the timetable for the Israeli redeployment before the Netanyahu
cabinet is approved by the Knesset, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu cabinet is widely believed to be a right-wing one,
</P>
<P>
Arafat and his senior officials demanded the Israeli side to
honor all of the agreements signed in the past and continue the
final-phase negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued early today, the PA cabinet and the PLO
Executive Committee said they would respect the Israeli
electorate's decision and urged the international community to
increase efforts to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Concerns over Hebron from both the ministers of the Labor
government and the Palestinian officials are fairly
understandable, as Shas (a ultra-Orthodox religious party which
won 10 seats in the outgoing elections) leader Aryeh Deri said he
hopes there will be unspecified delay in the Hebron pullout under
the Netanyahu cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The view of Deri, a potential coalition partner for Netanyahu,
is considered as carrying considerable weight, analysts here say.
</P>
<P>
David Levy, widely considered to be nominated as foreign
minister of the Netanyahu government, also suggested that he
favors a delay in the pullout.
</P>
<P>
In line with the Oslo agreement, the Peres cabinet decided
earlier this month that the Hebron pullout would occur around
June 12, when the Israeli forces would withdraw from 85 percent
of the city but maintain control over an area where some 400 Jews
live.
</P>
<P>
Peres later delayed the pullout due to a series of suicide
bombings in Israel.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Hebron Issue Again Surfaces for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was speculation that Netanyahu is unlikely to oppose
Peres' taking such a decision to pull out the Israeli troops,
because Netanyahu then would not have to tackle the hot potato of
Hebron -- he would not have to decide between adhering to the
agreement signed by Israel and bearing a brunt of coalition
pressure from those opposing the move.
</P>
<P>
And further, should the pullout not succeed, Netanyahu could
always blame Peres for taking the decision.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here maintain that Netanyahu will seek to avoid
making new policy decisions, especially about the peace process,
until he and his top aides have familiarized themselves with
classified documents about the negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Before then, it is only natural for Netanyahu to declare his
commitment to the peace process so as not to cause a panic in the
Middle East and the United States, the major broker of the peace
march.
</P>
<P>
Hanan Ashrawi, a prominent Palestinian woman activist who
served as spokeswoman for the Palestinian team for three years,
said that she believes the world pressure would persuade
Netanyahu to honor accords signed by the Labor government.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think that the simplistic polarization of saying
that Labor is God's gift for peace and Likud is ... the end of
peace," she said, stressing that the Likud victory does not
necessarily mean an end to the peace moves with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
This is true. Soon after the announcement of Netanyahu's
victory Friday afternoon, his chief advisor on foreign policy,
Dore Gold, telephoned Mohammed Abbas (Abu Mazen), the Number 2 in
the Palestinian Authority, to express Netanyahu's committment to
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In the telephone call, Gold said that Netanyahu will create a
mechanism for continued negotiations with the Palestinian
Authority after he forms his government.
</P>
<P>
This move was apparently aimed to pacify the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the near future, Netanyahu is unlikely to take
measures running counter to what the U.S. strongly advocates and
bolsters, though he may make a good bargaining.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the prime minister-elect said that Netanyahu,
who received a higher education in the U.S. and served once as
Israel's ambassador to the U.S., is expected to travel to
Washington and explain his policies to President Bill Clinton so
as to ensure the U.S. economic aid and political support to
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Ghana to Liberalise Oil Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Ghanaian government has planned
to liberalise its importation of crude oil and petroleum products
within the next three months.
</P>
<P>
The decision, which forms part of the government energy reform
program, will remove the monopoly from the Ghana National
Petroleum Corporation (GNPC), the sole importer of crude oil and
petroleum products in the country, said a report reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Tema Oil Refinery (TOR), Ghana's largest refinery factory,
said the procurement of crude and refined oil products required
to make up for its shortfalls would be through competitive
tenders.
</P>
<P>
Oil companies will be given a chance to import these imputs
and share the cost, according to the refinery.
</P>
<P>
And the margins for the oil marketing companies would be set
and reviewed to forestall undue price hikes.
</P>
<P>
The new policy is a first step toward achieving the regulation
and restructuring of the oil industry in Ghana.
</P>
<P>
''The measure is essentially an attempt to ensue full cost
recovery based on current crude prices and exchange rates as well
as the processing costs,'' said a Ghanian energy official.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 oil companies and businesses which were supposed to
prove their technical and financial capabilities, experience and
ability to supply and their bankers, had put in applications.
</P>
<P>
Ghana currently consumes some 1.8 million tonnes of crude oil
a year, while the refinery has the capacity to process 1.2
million tonnes.

MACAO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Vice President of the European
Commission Leon Brittan said here today that its cooperation with
Macao has great potential even after 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said after a one-day visit to Macao that the agreement
signed four years ago between Macao and the European Commission is
a good one and has great potential "that has not been exhausted."
</P>
<P>
"It is still in the early stage of using it," he said. "And I
hope that after 1999 it will continue to be a constructive basis
for cooperation between Europe and Macao."
</P>
<P>
Macao and the European Commission signed a trade and
cooperation agreement in Luxembourg in June 1992 and it went into
force on January 1, 1993. A joint committee was also set up.
</P>
<P>
According to the five-year agreement, the two sides will begin
wide-ranging cooperation in such fields as trade, communications,
information, environmental protection, finance, customs and
fishery.
</P>
<P>
Brittan discussed with Macao government officials the
possibility of establishing a Macao-Europe Management Institute in
Macao soon. Both the Macao government and the European Union
support the idea.
</P>
<P>
Brittan said he had discussed transitional issues with the
governor of Macao and other officials.

DAMASCUS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Syria today reiterated its
commitment to the Middle East peace process on the basis of
land-for-peace principle, a local daily reported.

Following Likud Party leader Benjamin Netanyahu's victory in
the Israeli general elections, the official Tishrin daily noted to
the fact that the peace process hinged, from its very beginning,
upon well-established principles such as land-for-peace.
</P>
<P>
It is also based on the implementation of the U.N. Security
Council Resolutions 242, 338 and 425 and the full Israeli
withdrawal from the Syrian Golan Heights, south Lebanon and the
West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper held Israel responsible for the suspension of peace
efforts in the region, saying that "the equation of the peace
process without sincere Israeli response would be misleading."
</P>
<P>
Israel's adoption of the so-called peace-for-peace formula and
its resort to military aggression have undermined the efforts
aiming at establishing just, comprehensive and lasting peace in
the region, the paper added.

<HEADLINE> Computer Helps Dumb Girl Speak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A special laptop computer made by
the British Telecom (BT) helps 13-year-old dumb girl Holly Potter
to generate human-sounding voice, the Times newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The system can produce many of the intonations and nuances of
normal speech. Potter generates the words by tapping them out on
the computer, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The voice from the computer is actually that of 12-year-old
Charlotte Breen, the daughter of the BT engineer who developed the
system. Charlotte spoke sentences that were picked up by a sensor
on her throat, stored in the computer's memory and manipulated to
produce Potter's vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
The system, programmed into a BT software package called
Laureate, is claimed to be the first of its type, and Potter is
the first user outside the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
Potter has been learning to use the machine since April and has
picked it up quickly. She also uses the laptop in English and
Spanish classes at school.
</P>
<P>
Andy Breen, who leads the BT team working on the system,
said: "The idea is to produce a system that sounds more like a
human being. We aim to help people to forget they are using a
computer."
</P>
<P>
One of the system's most important applications will be to
enable throat cancer victims to conserve their own voices. As
Potter grows, her computer speech will be updated with "older"
voices.
</P>
<P>
BT is now negotiating a licensing agreement to make the system
available to the public, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Press Warn against Expansionism of Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today still
kept silent about the result of Israeli elections but local press
warned Islamic countries of pitfalls from Netanyahu premiership.
</P>
<P>
Two English papers today commented on the recent victory at
the Israeli polls of Likud candidate Benjamin Netanyahu, saying
that this was a manifestation of Israel's expansionism.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Iran is happy to see the failure of
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres for the fact that the Middle
East peace process would at least slow down and would reduce the
pressure on Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, the Islamic Republic is also worried about the
expansionism of the Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
Both Iran News and Tehran Times, with strong background of
Iran's Foreign Ministry, warned the Islamic countries of the
dangers to regional security and stability.
</P>
<P>
English daily Iran News noted in its editorial that "the
victory of Netanyahu is a victory for extreme religious factions
in Israel."
</P>
<P>
The paper recalled that the Likud Party in its election
manifesto promised not to return the Golan Heights to Syria and
make Jerusalem the capital of Israel. It also pledged that it
would refuse to honor and recognize several commitments made by
the previous Israeli administration to Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
In the light of these developments, the editorial stressed, it
becomes an absolute necessity for Islamic countries to unite and
ward off the common enemy.
</P>
<P>
The paper advised the Islamic states to reject the ploy of
U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration to Islamic nations
and weaken their unity.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Europe, it noted that this is the right time for the
continent to revise its policies in support of the so-called
Middle East peace process, saying "it has become clear that
Israeli society does not favor peace. It actually voted for
hostility, intolerance, expansionism and hatred."
</P>
<P>
"To accept the peace process under the present circumstances
is to accept an imposed peace," it wrote, concluding that such
kind of peace would "serve only as the first step toward the next
all-out Arab-Israeli war."
</P>
<P>
The Tehran Times said that Netanyahu can bury the peace process
and shake Israeli foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
It noted that even while dealing with the Labor Party of
Shimon Peres, Arafat and his colleagues did not really score any
tangible victory.
</P>
<P>
With the Likud Party's victory, "probably, Arafat and his
colleagues will...realize that they have really sold out the
Palestinian cause to Israel, keeping Palestinians prisoners of the
Zionist regime," it wrote.
</P>
<P>
It concluded by saying that the best solution to the crisis in
the Middle East is the implementation of U.N. resolutions calling
for unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied
territories.

<HEADLINE> India's New Government to Continue Economic Reforms: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- India's new Prime Minister D.
Deve Gowda, who was sworn in here today, said that his United
Front (UF) coalition government would continue the economic
reforms initiated by the previous Congress government headed by
P.V. Narasimha Rao.
</P>
<P>
Talking informally with newsmen after the swearing in ceremony
at Rashtrapati Bhavan (presidential palace), he said that when he
became chief minister of Karnataka state in 1994, he stood by the
former prime minister (pointing to Rao) who was the author of the
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
"I will continue to stand by the reforms and will sort out
differences with friendly parties," he said. Some of the left
parties in his 13-party United Front have been vehemently critical
of the Rao government's economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
"As far as global investments were concerned, I fully agree
with Mr. Rao that they are important," Gowda added.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein: Peace Process to Go Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan today
expressed optimism that the Middle East peace process will go on
under Israel's new right-wing government, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
The king said he looks forward to working with the Israeli
prime minister-elected Benjamin Netanyahu, who defeated the
incumbent Prime Minister Shimon Peres by a slightly majority of
50.4 percent to 49.5 percent in the election held Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first direct election for the premiership in the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed there are great chances regarding the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He added that there is no reason to pin too much emphasis on
the Israeli election and to say that Israel will move away from
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The king received a phone call from the hardliner Netanyahu
Friday night, according to the English-language daily, Jordan
Times.
</P>
<P>
The king and the Israeli newly-elected prime minister exchanged
views about the peace process and the need to "follow the path of
peace for the better of the region."
</P>
<P>
He congratulated Netanyahu and voiced hope for his success in
reaching a just, comprehensive and lasting peace for the
generations to come.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian government also voiced optimism that Jordan's
relations with Israel will not be affected by the election defeat
of Peres by Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"The Jordanian government dealt with Shimon Peres as a
representative of the State of Israel and not in a personal
capacity," said acting Prime Minister and Minister of Higher
Education Abdullah Ensour Friday, quoted by Jordan News Agency,
Petra.
</P>
<P>
While asserting that the election of Netanyahu as the prime
minister will not damage Jordanian-Israeli relations, Minister of
Information Marwan Muasher told Jordan Times that the peace
process will go ahead.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that peace has become a strategic option for all
parties concerned and, as such, we will continue to work with the
Israeli government," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that it will continue with a pro-peace
policy that would soon witness a resumption of the Palestinian,
Syrian and Lebanese tracks according to the principles set by the
Madrid (peace conference)," he added.

<P>
TOKYO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Health and Welfare Ministry
has distributed a brochure on the "mad cow" disease to municipal
and prefectural offices, the Kyodo News Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Questions and Answers About Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy," the booklet covers such topics as the safety of
imported beef from Britain, where a recent outbreak of mad cow
disease occurred, and how people may be affected by the disease.
</P>
<P>
Information from World Health Organization (WHO) reports and
British authorities has been incorporated into the booklet, Kyodo

</P>
<P>
Scientists believe there is a link between the disease and its
human equivalent, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, a debilitating and
deadly ailment that damages the brain.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials are hoping to quickly distribute the booklet
to those in the meat importing business and to overseas travelers,
Kyodo said, noting that so far copies of the booklet have been

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Waits to See Formation of New Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz has described the current situation as a stage "of waiting
to see the formation of a new Israeli government and its peace
orientations."
</P>
<P>
"The question raised now is which majority will make up the
coalition, or whether it is a majority in the new Israeli
parliament," the foreign minister told reporters at the Beirut
International Airport Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz came back to his country after an official visit to
Germany and France, which lasted 11 days.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the Likud Party,
defeated incumbent Prime Minister Shimon Peres by a razor-thin 0.9
percentage point to become the first directly elected Israeli
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"The second question is how Netanyahu will act," Boueiz
said. "And from now on, he is not a candidate with slogans for the
election campaign, but a ruler and a custodian of file, and is
forced to cope practically with the things far away from the
auction in the electoral contests."
</P>
<P>
"In an addition to that, another question is of whom the new
(Israeli) government will make up," the Lebanese foreign minister
noted.
</P>
<P>
In light of the answers to all of these questions, he said: "We
and others can make a judgement on the (Israeli) policy and take
suitable stands."
</P>
<P>
Although Netanyahu has said that he still upholds the peace
process, it means nothing because the bases (of the peace process)
which he see are bases different from those on which we had made
our minds and agreed in Madrid (peace conference)," Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating Lebanon's position, the foreign minister said, "the
peace should be based on the principle of land-for-peace and the
implementation of Resolutions 242, 338 and 425, and should be a
just and comprehensive one."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that if Netanyahu executed the proposals on
which his election campaign had been based and by which he
had attacked Peres' government, his election would be a
"negative element in the peace process in the region."
</P>
<P>
"But the position of the candidate Netanyahu could be
different when he became the ruling Netanyahu," Boueiz said.
"And the special position of Netanyahu could change when he
is forced into coalition and union by which he forms the
parliamentary majority."

<HEADLINE> Jordan Shows Mixed Feeling Toward Netanyahu as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The election of Likud bloc leader
Benjamin Netanyahu as Israel's new prime minister was widely seen
here as a blow to the Middle East peace process but not to the
Jordanian-Israeli relations.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information Marwan Muasher said Friday that Jordan
was "confident" that the newly elected Israeli prime minister
would resume the pro-peace policy pursued by his predecessor
Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Jordan does not expect its ties with the
Jewish State to be affected by Likud victory in Israel's first
direct election held Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have signed a peace treaty with the State of Israel and not
with one party," said the minister, who was the first Jordanian
ambassador to Israel before being appointed as the minister of
information of the new government in February.
</P>
<P>
Acting Prime Minister Abdullah Ensour also repeated the
assertion.
</P>
<P>
Ensour said Jordan's relations with Israel will not be affected
by the election failure of Peres by Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"The Jordanian government dealt with Shimon Peres as a
representative of the State of Israel and not in a personal
capacity," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that bilateral relations will not be damaged
in any way during Netanyahu's mandate," Ensour said, noting that
the hard-line Likud leader had visited Amman twice since the
signing of the Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that Jordan had kept its channels of
communication open with Netanyahu while it maintained a neutral
stand toward the Israeli elections in order not to be perceived as
favoring one side over the other.
</P>
<P>
But most Jordanian have sounded more pessimistic that the new
Likud premier will uphold the peace strategies of outgoing Peres.
</P>
<P>
They maintained that the re-emergence of the hard-line
rightwing in Israel after four years in the shadows showed that
Israelis were not yet ready to reach a just, comprehensive and
durable peace settlement with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
People interviewed by Xinhua expressed shock or sadness by the
defeat of Peres despite popular anger against him for ordering the
17-day assault against Lebanon in April and a blockade against the
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Some Jordanians see the defeat of Peres as the result of his
flawed policies and election campaign, while others blamed
Palestinian militant attacks against Israelis for the victory of
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"It (the election of Netanyahu as the new prime minister) will
mean hard times for Palestinians and Syrians. It is a major blow
to the whole peace process," a shop-owner told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Some commentators said that the peace process will indeed be
derailed under Netanyahu's leadership and that the
Jordanian-Israeli model of "warm peace" sought by the former
leadership in Israel and the Jordanian leadership will collapse
under Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"If (Yitzhak) Rabin's assassination seven months ago had
lowered the tempo of peace between Israel and Jordan from warm to
lukewarm, then Peres' defeat might transform it from lukewarm to
cold...," the Arabic daily Al Rai quoted a well-known columnist
Fahd Fanek as saying.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion in the Kingdom is largely influenced
by developments in the Israeli-Palestinian track, given that the
strong presence of Jordanians with Palestinian origin in the
Kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Stockfeed Prices to Go Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Prices of Zimbabwe's stockfeeds
will go down soon following the reduction in the selling price of
maize by the Grain Marketing Board (GMB).
</P>
<P>
The board's maize selling price was reduced in early May from
214.5 U.S.Dollars to 155 U.S.Dollars per tonne.
</P>
<P>
Stockfeed Manufacturers Association Chairman Michael Collins
said on Friday: ''We have just had a meeting with the Commercial
Farmers Union that we will be adjusting prices accordingly and we
will be working on it."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Commercial Poultry Producers Association Chairman
John Smith said the reduction in prices would be most welcome and
anticipated that the adjustments would be proportional to the
reduction in selling price of maize.
</P>
<P>
''Maize selling price has gone down by just below 50 percent,
so we will expect an adjustment of around 25 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
This year Zimbabwe's maize got a bumper harvest of 2.6 million
tonnes while it received 840,000 tonnes last year.

<HEADLINE> Wakashio Bank to Begin Operating in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Wakashio Bank, set up by Sakura Bank
to take over the operations of the collapsed Taiheiyo Bank, will
begin operating in September, Shunsaku Hashimoto, president of
Sakura Bank, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new bank will be capitalized at 40 billion yen (370 million
U.S. dollars) and will be wholly owned by Sakura Bank, a major
commercial bank in Japan, the Kyodo News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
Wakashio Bank will apply to the Finance Ministry for a banking
license in early June, Hashimoto said.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said Friday that Taiheiyo Bank's uncollectible loans
are estimated at 180 billion yen (1.67 billion dollars) "at
present."
</P>
<P>
To deal with the bad loans, Sakura Bank and three other
commercial banks -- Sanwa, Fuji and Tokai banks -- will give up
their claims on Taiheiyo Bank totaling nearly 100 billion yen (926
million dollars), while the troubled bank will use its remaining
capital of around 40 billion yen (370 million dollars) for partial
coverage of the loss, Hashimoto said.
</P>
<P>
The remainder will be covered by contributions from Deposit
Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
Sakura, Sanwa, Fuji and Tokai banks each have a 5 percent
equity stake in Taiheiyo Bank, a Tokyo-based regional bank.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts estimate Taiheiyo Bank's bad loans have totaled
240 billion yen (2.22 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Taiheiyo Bank has some 40 branches, mainly in the Tokyo
metropolitan area, and employs around 900 people.

NEW DELHI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- India's new Prime Minister H.D.
Deve Gowda, who was sworn in here today, often calls himself a
"halli gowda," which means a"village farmer".
</P>
<P>
Born on May 18, 1933, to a teacher's family in a tiny village
in Karnataka state, Gowda started political life as a member of
the opposition after obtaining his diploma in civil engineering.
</P>
<P>
He became the irrigation minister in Karnataka state in 1983
and was first elected to India's Lok Sabha (lower house) in 1991.
He became the chief minister of his home state in 1994.
</P>
<P>
After the 13-day-old government of the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) resigned on May 28 for lack of support in the parliament,
Gowda's United Front was invited by President S.D. Sharma to form
a new government.
</P>
<P>
Regarded as a strong-handed man, Gowda is now being challenged
by the fluid situation in India and divergent views among his
13-party United Front.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's crude palm oil
(CPO), tin and rubber markets ended the week mixed with CPO price
lower, tin price higher, while the rubber prices in see-saw
trading.
</P>

were sidelined ahead of the long weekend. The market was closed on
Friday for the Wesak Day.
</P>

dollars) per kg. However, the turnover for the week dropped to 366

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Provide New Hope for Cancer Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese research into stomach cancer
has provided clues that could prevent the spread of secondary
cancers.
</P>
<P>
A 15-member scientific research group at Hubei Medical
University, headed by Professor Liu Xuefeng, has been studying
stomach cancer, the most common malignant tumor, since 1988.
</P>
<P>
Scientists in the group created the new technique of producing
DNA from a trace of paraffin, and used the techniques of PCR and
ODN to measure the extent of cancer proliferation for the first
time in China.
</P>
<P>
They concluded that the mutation of a gene, called " H-ras
Gene Condon 12G-T" was the main cause for the metastasis.
</P>
<P>
How long a cancer patient can survive after the removal
operation depends on whether the cancer cells have been removed
completely.
</P>
<P>
If the doctors can operate using the theory, they hope to be
able to remove the cancer cells wholely, and extend the patient's
life.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Peace Talks Delayed, Fresh Fighting Erupts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Talks between Russian
representatives and Chechen rebels have been delayed today, just
several hours after the rebels threatened to boycott them unless
Russian troops stopped attacks, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Slipchenko, spokesman for a Russian government
commission on the Chechen crisis, confirmed that the talks, due to
start on June 1 to discuss details of a peace deal reached earlier
in Moscow, have been postponed because of some "technical
difficulties." But he did not give a new date.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the rebels raised the "clearly excessive"
demands that more cars and people be sent to accompany the convoy
carrying rebel delegates to the meeting, the Interfax news agency
said.
</P>
<P>
But hours earlier, a Chechen rebel spokesman said Russian
troops were attacking a rebel base and warned that the meeting,
planned to occur in Mahachkala, capital of the Dagestan region
bordering Chechnya, would be boycotted if the offensive went on.
</P>
<P>
He said Russian troops had surrounded Shali, a village about 30
kilometers south of the regional capital, Grozny, still under
rebels' control, and begun to attack.
</P>
<P>
He said Chechen fighters had returned fire during the renewed
fighting which broke out shortly before a truce included in the
peace deal is due to take effect at midnight today.
</P>
<P>
The battle was confirmed by a Russian military source in
Grozny, who told Interfax that one Russian serviceman was killed
and four others wounded in Shali.
</P>
<P>
A Russian commander in Shali told a Russian television that the
offensive would not be halted unless rebels there gave themselves
up, casting doubt over the fate of the truce.
</P>
<P>
He said all armed rebels led by Chechen military commander
Aslan Maskhadov in the town must surrender their arms before 8
a.m. local time Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Unveils Election Platform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 31 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin today laid
out his long-awaited re-election platform, promising to curb
inflation, achieve non-inflationary economic growth and wipe out
budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, now campaigning in the Ural city of Perm, elaborated
on his policies for Russia's economy, social life, foreign affairs
and security from 1996 to the year 2000 in a 170-page manifesto
issued in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that annual economic growth will exceed 4 percent
by 2000 and the annual inflation rate will drop to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to eliminate budget deficit by 2000, reform
the tax code by 1997, including tax cuts and tax exemptions, and
strengthen tax collection to increase revenues.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said wages and pensions, whose payment often has been
delayed and thus caused strikes, will be raised and inflation-hit
savings compensated. But analysts say the aim is contradictory to
his effort to keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
On foreign policy, Yeltsin, an ardent promoter of integration
among the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), said he will
seek maximum integration among the loose organization, which
consists of all former Soviet republics except the three Baltic
states.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to actively defend the rights and interests of tens
of thousands of ethnic Russians outside Russia proper -- a
post-Soviet foreign policy priority of Russia which has caused
widespread unease among its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
On the prolonged Chechen conflict, Yeltsin said the door is
always open to negotiations with rebels but repeated his hard
stance on the status of the breakaway republic, saying its full
independence will not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
The war had long been seen as a handicap for Yeltsin's
re-election bid until last week when he struck a peace deal with
rebel leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev in Moscow and later paid a
quick visit to the rebel region.
</P>
<P>
In a move to woo a considerable number of young voters in the
June 16 elections, Yeltsin repeated his decision announced earlier
this month to scrap the draft by 2000 and switch over to a
professional army.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here described Yeltsin's platform as old hat except
his bold admission of mistakes made during his five years in
office.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 65, has led his main rival Gennady Gyuganov in opinion
polls since April but his support ratings have been well below 50
percent, a barrier needed to overcome to win a clear victory. A
runoff is very likely between Yeltsin and Gyuganov, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> BNP Protests Remarks of British MP on Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The former ruling Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) Friday strongly protested the latest
statement by British MP David Steel who questioned the prospective
fairness of the country's elections scheduled for June 12.
</P>
<P>
Steel made the statement Thursday before leaving Dhaka at the
end of a week-long mission in Bangladesh as head of a three-member
delegation of the Sweden-based International Institute of
Democracy Election Assistant (IDEA).
</P>
<P>
He told a news briefing that the delegation were still
skeptical of a fully free and fair election on June 12 in
Bangladesh in view of the "past record of lack of democratic
practice and culture as well as election irregularities."
</P>
<P>
A BNP spokesman described Steel's remarks as "unwanted and an
interference in the internal affairs of Bangladesh" and urged the
government to forbid all foreigners to make any statement
interfering into the country's internal affairs and tarnishing the
nation's image.
</P>
<P>
"It was the 200-year British colonial rule that demolished our
societies, exploited us mercilessly and hanged hundreds of
patriotic sepoys in the name of quelling insurgency," the BNP
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed concern that Steel's remarks might destablize
the situation in Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Opposition Stages Hunger Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Some 100 Albanian opposition
candidates, who boycotted last Sunday's general election, went on
a hunger strike today to press their demand for the annulment of
the election and the resignation of senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
Candidates from the Center Pole, a partnership between the
Social Democratic and Democratic Alliance parties, first started a
hunger strike in the Democratic Alliance's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
An hour later, leaders of the nation's largest opposition
group, the Socialist Party, started an indefinite fast.
</P>
<P>
"The candidates for parliament of the Center Pole started a
three-day hunger strike to protest against the violation of their
right to be elected freely and honestly," said Neritan Ceka,
leader of the Democratic Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Nine opposition parties, including the Socialist Party, the
Democratic Alliance and Social Democratic Party, withdrew half
way through the election, citing alleged government manipulation
and harassment.
</P>
<P>
On Monday the ruling Democratic Party claimed a clear victory
in the election, but opposition parties accused the Democrats of
fraud, citing serious irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party staged a demonstration in Skanderbeg Square
in central Tirana Tuesday, but the government sent riot police to
break up the mass rally.
</P>
<P>
Socialist leader Servet Pellumbi immediately demanded the
resignation of President Sali Berisha and other senior government
officials, charging they were responsible for violent acts against
the Socialists.
</P>
<P>
Berisha denied the accusations. "I would like to express my
conviction that no journalist or citizen should be maltreated,"
Berisha said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian Central Electoral Commission, acknowledging
irregularities in three constituences, said elections will be held
there again. But major opposition parties called on the electorate
to boycott the poll's second round.
</P>
<P>
"We will start a dialogue with Berisha only if elections are
cancelled and repeated under international monitoring," Ceka
said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Chicken Exports Expected to Earn Less </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports of frozen
chicken are expected to bring in less than 400 million US dollars
in revenue this year, some 60 million dollars below the target, a
leading Thai export predicted today.
</P>
<P>
The figure is the lowest in three years, said the Charoen
Pokphand (CP) Group.
</P>
<P>
The country's frozen chicken exports recorded only 41,967 tons
in the first four months of the year, down 19 percent from the
same period last year, the CP Group said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts blamed the drop on higher production costs, which they
said have made Thai chicken less competitive than those from the
United States and Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Set to Fight Auto Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A quarter of all petrol and diesel
powered vehicles in China's largest city Shanghai failed exhaust
emission tests - giving rise to the city's problem of mobile
chimneys.
</P>
<P>
Now auto pollution has become the major concern of the
government of China's largest city, Shanghai, following mass
coverage in local media about the problem of car exhausts.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report on local television, Shanghai now
has 400,000 automobiles and 370,000 mopeds and scooters. At least
100,000 of them failed state standards for exhaust gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the contents of carbon monoxide,
hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxide in the air at some major
intersections in the city goes beyond acceptable levels.
</P>
<P>
It said that the municipal government of Shanghai has put auto
pollution control on the list of its ten major targets for 1996,
requiring relevant departments, including the municipal committee
of science and technology, environmental protection bureau, and
public security bureau, to take immediate action.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that air pollution resulting from more than half
of the city's automobiles could be solved within three to four
years by attaching catalytic converters to vehicles.
</P>
<P>
An official with the environmental bureau said that they are
modifying the carburetors of the mopeds and scooters for full
burning of gasoline, and promoting lead-free gas and LPG among the
drivers.
</P>
<P>
According to the official the bureau also stipulated that all
Santana sedan cars produced in 1996 and any motor vehicles
applying for Shanghai plates must have catalytic converters fitted
to ensure cleaner exhaust emissions.
</P>
<P>
The bureau will also step up roadside checks and suspend the
licenses of drivers whose cars are found to have no purifying
devices.
</P>
<P>
"Our target for this year is to clean the exhaust gases of
100,000 motor vehicles, and to help 80 percent of the city's
automobiles meet the state standards for exhaust emissions," he
claimed.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 people have found
that their midriffs have been reduced by two to six cm in 15 days
after starting to use a new kind of slimming soap.
</P>
<P>
The soap is a new product from the Shanghai Jieshi Daily-Use
Chemicals Factory and a group of medical researchers.
</P>
<P>
The Jieshi slimming soap is made from root of red-rooted salvia
and many other kinds of Chinese medicinal herbs. The soap can help
remove excess fat by infiltrating into the subcutaneous tissue to
promote blood circulation and the decomposition and discharge of
fat.
</P>
<P>
Tests have shown that the soap does no harm to the human body,
but can moisten the skin.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 boxes of such soap have been bought by
Japanese businessmen.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, there are two overweight boys and three
overweight girls per 100 Chinese children these days.

<P>
BANGKOK, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's ruling partner
Prachakorn Thai (Thai Citizen) Party (PTP) has announced its
decision to quit the government but said it would not join the
opposition, the Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said PTP leader Samak Sundaravej would inform Prime
Minister Banharn Silpa-archa of the PTP's withdrawal when Banharn
returns from his visit to Malaysia and Singapore today.
</P>
<P>
The PTP will formally quit the coalition on June 15, Samak said
at a campaign rally here Friday, held to back the party's
candidate in the Bangkok governor election scheduled for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Samak, also a deputy prime minister, said he was not pulling
out his party in protest against the latest cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
He nevertheless noted that Banharn should have consulted him
while working on the new line-up.
</P>
<P>
In the latest shake-up announced Wednesday, Banharn gave the
Nam Thai (Thai Leadership) Party (NTP) an extra portfolio although
the PTP and the NTP have the equal number of seats in the House of
Representatives.

TIRANA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Albania was officially accepted
today as a full member of the Central European Initiative

</P>
<P>
The decision was announced at a CEICO session held today in the

<HEADLINE> Work Starts on Sichuan-Tibet Highway Tunnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The construction of an 8.66-km
tunnel, which will be part of the highway connecting southwest
China's Sichuan Province and the Tibet Autonomous Region, has
started.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel will be dug through Mount Erlang in Sichuan
Province. The existing highway around the mountain is too
dangerous due to landslides and especially in rainy, foggy or icy
weather.
</P>
<P>
In addition to a highway connecting Tibet and Qinghai Province
in northwest China, the Sichuan-Tibet highway serves as a vital
land link between the plateau region and other inland areas in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel will be the longest highway tunnel in China, and the
construction will be rather difficult, as the geological structure
is very complicated, engineers said.
</P>
<P>
With the central government providing 90 percent of a total
investment of 400 million yuan (about 48 million US dollars), the
tunnel is expected to be completed by 1999.
</P>
<P>
By that time vehicles commuting between Tibet and Sichuan will
save 25 km on the journey, but what is more important is that the
trip will be much safer.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Children under Good Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese children are enjoying
happy, healthy growth thanks to the government's effort to
facilitate their survival, education, health and living, a
by-lined article on today's China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Of China's 1.2 billion people, 300 million are children under
the age of 16, making up one-fifth of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
The annual average decrease in infant mortality in China since
1990 stands at 6.5 per cent. For children under five the average
decrease has been 5.85 per cent, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
Children's education always takes precedence in China's
educational development. In 1995, 98.5 per cent of school-age
children attended school.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, a campaign has been carried out to
popularize compulsory nine-year schooling, which now benefits 91
per cent of the country's children.
</P>
<P>
The Hope Project initiated in 1989 had collected donations
worth nearly 700 million yuan by the end of last year, which have
funded the establishment of 2,074 Hope primary schools and enabled
more than 1.25 million drop-outs to return to classrooms.
</P>
<P>
Another project, the Spring Bud Programme, received 9.97
million yuan of donations over the past year and helped more than
100,000 girls in poor areas to resume schooling in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a series of measures have been adopted to prevent
congenital disability, including a comprehensive immunization
program, supply of iodized salt and a program to treat polio
victims, train deaf or dumb children to communicate, and perform
cataract operations.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, China had set up 1,379 special-education
schools for blind, deaf and mentally disable children.
</P>
<P>
Local governments set up 73 welfare homes for children, housing
8,900 orphans and abandoned disable children. The homes boast
qualified doctors, therapists and nutritionists, as well as
clinics, rehabilitation rooms, emergency treatment rooms,
laboratories and pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the achievements, however, a survey in February
suggested that half of the 1,500 families polled in six cities in
central and eastern China were worried about the current social
environment for children.
</P>
<P>
The problems were: money worship engendered by the rush towards
the business culture, the doting attitude of many parents towards
their only child, and a decrease in positive instruction and
guidance for children by their schools.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President to Resign If Proving Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- President Ernesto Samper
would resign if the Chamber of Representatives accuses him of
connecting with drug money to finance his electoral campaign in
1994 before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Local radio Radio Cadena Nacional (RCN) said that Samper has
written two letters and will publish one of them in accordance
with the decision made by the Chamber of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
In the first letter the president said he would resign
immediately if the Chamber of Representatives has grounds to
accuse him before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
In the second one he asks the Senate to approve a referendum to
define his fate if he is cleared of the charges.
</P>
<P>
A group of prominent lawyers has been working quietly for two
months advising the president and studying the possibility of the
referendum, said RCN.
</P>
<P>
The advisors reached an agreement that if the Chamber of
Representatives clears the president, the letters will be sent to
the Senate for approval of the referendum, which would be carried
out in August.
</P>
<P>
If the referendum is held, Interior Minister Horacio Serpa
Uribe would resign to defend the president.
</P>
<P>
According to other options made by the president's advisors, if
the president is proved innocence, he would continue his
presidency by forming a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
A third proposal from the majority of Liberals in the Congress
said the government would be made up of Liberal Union members and
people close to former President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo.
</P>
<P>
Samper's 1994 campaign is reported to have received nearly 6
million U.S. dollars from the Cali cocaine cartel, the biggest
drug syndicate in the world.

<HEADLINE> Drought Continues in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Severe drought continues to blister
north China with no relief in sight, threatening water supplies, 7
million hectares of crops, and vast areas of farm land, according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Drought has swept most of north China, and Shandong and Henan
Provinces in east and central China, with less than 15 mm of
precipitation over the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River, China's second longest river, has dried up
five times in different sections on its lower reaches in Shandong.
</P>
<P>
More than 11 million people in Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, and
Shandong Provinces, and the Beijing and Tianjin areas, face
drinking water shortages, along with over 16 million head of
livestock.
</P>
<P>
Many areas in midwestern Shandong have seen no rainfalls since
this spring, making it impossible to seed some 533,000 hectares of
farm land, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The situation is similar in Datong and Shuozhou in Shanxi
Province, as well as in Hebei Province, where some 700,000
hectares of farm land, or one fifth of the total area to be seeded
this spring, turned unusable because of the lack of rainfall.
</P>
<P>
A record 357,000 square kilometres of grassland in the midwest
pastoral area of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are useless,
posing an additional threat to herds there.
</P>
<P>
In parts of northeast China's Heilongjiang and Jilin Provinces,
more than 360,000 hectares of paddy fields have been left unused
due to shortages of irrigation water, as most of the small local
rivers have dried up.

2,800-Year-Old Vegetable Seeds Unearthed in Shaanxi
</P>
<P>
XI'AN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Vegetable seeds, 2,800 years old,

TAIYUAN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A village in central China's Shanxi

<HEADLINE> Scientists Describe Sun's Interior Smooth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Other than what astronomers had
imagined, the interior of the sun, unlike its surface, is
comparatively smooth, an international science team said today.
</P>
<P>
"While the sun's surface is constantly resonating, there are
regions below the surface that appear to be smooth and flat," said
Dr. Douglas Gough of Cambridge University, co-author of a report
in today's Science.
</P>
<P>
He was reporting the findings of six solar optical
observatories around the world called GONG -- Global Oscillation
Network Group.
</P>
<P>
"This tells us a great deal about the universe because what is
true of the sun is true of countless thousands of millions of
other stars," Gough said. "The sun is a typical, normal star."
</P>
<P>
As seen from the earth, the sun's outer regions rotate
approximately every 27 days. But at about 100,000 miles below the
surface, there is another region that rotates 5 percent more
slowly.
</P>
<P>
"There appears to be a shear effect at the point where the
fast-rotating region meets the slow rotating region," Gough
said. "It causes the interior part of the sun to be comparatively
smooth and flat."
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing extraordinary about these rotation
speeds. The sun, like the earth, began spinning when it was formed
thousands of millions of years ago, and it continues to spin
because there is nothing to stop it spinning," he continued.
</P>
<P>
But the difference between the two bodies is that the whole of
the earth rotates together because it is a rocky body, while the
sun, being made of gas, rotates at different speeds.
</P>
<P>
The smoothness of the sun's inner layers is in contrast to
that of its outer surface, which is so violent that parts of it
jump up and down at speeds of a quarter of a mile per second.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Trade Minister to Visit Seven Latin American Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A government delegation headed by
Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation Wu Yi
will pay a month-long visit to Cuba, Mexico and five other Latin
American nations to explore new ways for furthering its trade and
economic ties with those countries.
</P>
<P>
This will be the largest team ever led by a Chinese foreign
trade minister to the region, an official with the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec) said.
</P>
<P>
The countries the delegation will visit also include Peru,
Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, China's biggest trade partner
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that move is part of the efforts China has
been making to implement the policy of market diversification for
its foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhiquan, director of the Moftec's American and Oceania
Affairs Department said that China attaches much importance to
developing its mutually-beneficial trade and economic co-operation
with Latin American countries, which has been advancing at a quick
pace since the early 1990's.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese customs, trade volume between China
and the region last year rose by 30 percent to 6.11 billion US
dollars, making up 2.1 percent and 1.3 percent of their total
foreign trade volume respectively.
</P>
<P>
Great potentials are yet to be tapped for further developing
trade and economic co-operation between China and Latin American
countries as their economies are strongly complementary to each
other, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that Wu's visit will serve to promote
mutual investment between China and the Latin American region
while enhancing bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, Chinese enterprises have launched 160
solely-invested business or joint ventures in 24 countries and
areas in the region, with an actual investment of 300 million Yuan
Renminbi, while Latin American-funded businesses in China number
nearly 200, with an actual investment of 300 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Pledges to Work With New Israeli Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher today pledged to work together with the new Israeli
government led by Benjamin Netanyahu in search for a stable peace
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who joined U.S. President Bill Clinton in
congratulating Netanyahu on his election victory, said that bonds
between Israel and the United States were "enduring and
unshakable."
</P>
<P>
"They will remain as strong in the future as they have been in
the past," Christopher said at a news conference shortly after
Netanyahu was declared winner in the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state said that President Clinton and he
were looking forward to "establishing good working relations" with
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had been in contact with Arab leaders who were
unsettled by the victory of conservative hardliner Netanyahu, who
opposes giving up any Israeli land for peace as agreed by outgoing
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
Christopher disclosed that he had spoken earlier in the day
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa, and had sent telegrams to all the Arab capitals
urging them not to "prejudge" the new government in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process was the crucial issue in Israel's
prime ministerial race, and Natanyahu's election was widely
expected to radically alter its course strongly backed by the
Clinton administration.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
today appealed to the government of Croatia to make the Amnesty
Law comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made after the council was briefed on the
current field situation by Jacques Paul Clein, chief of the U.N.
Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and
Western Sirmium.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press by Security Council President

</P>
<P>
"They once again appeal to the government of Croatia to make

</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on the background of the appeal, Clein
said it is important that the Croatian government gives a clear

</P>
<P>
"What we are concerned about is the majority of the population
who became involved in the conflict and have a cloud hung over
their heads," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Unless we remove that cloud, I think we will have a difficult
time in terms of reintegration process," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The New York Stock Market went
down sharply today, with the Dow Jones industrial average sliding
50.23 points to 5,643.18.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts and Fed insiders made estimates that recent
strong housing and other economic data might prompt the Fed to
raise interest rates to cool a bit the economy, which they
believed was growing at an inflationary pace. It was the major
cause for the downturning market.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Commerce Department said new-home sales shot
up 6.7 percent in April. Further, sales and inventory trends
within a gross domestic product report raised concerns that the
economy is inflationary.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year Treasury bond dropped 1 point and finished late in
the day at 6.99 percent today.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said this morning that personal income
rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent in April, outpacing a 0.1
percent growth in personal consumption expenditures. Wages and
salaries rose 0.5 percent, which analysts said could be
troublesome if it continues to rise.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues led advancers by a narrow 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume was 350.64 million
shares.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indexes were mostly lower, except the Nasdaq
composite, which rose 8.38 to 1,241.86 on strength in semiconductor

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Vietnam Cooperating Well on MIA Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
assured the U.S. Republican-controlled Congress that Vietnam was
cooperating well with the United States in accounting for
Americans still listed as missing in the Vietnam War two decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was required to make a clear statement on Vietnam's
cooperation in a budget bill passed by the U.S. Congress before he
can spend additional money on maintaining U.S. diplomatic
relations with Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
Despite strong oppositions by the conservatives in the U.S.
Congress, the Clinton administration established diplomatic ties
with Vietnam in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But the issue of prisoners of war (POWs) and U.S. servicemen
listed as Missing in Action (MIA) in Indochina is still very
sensitive among the American conservative lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said in the statement that Vietnam was cooperating in
good faith in resolving so-called MIA "discrepancy cases" where the
fate of American servicemen believed captured alive was unknown,
in recovering and repatriating remains and in efforts to provide
documents.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Official to Attend Florence Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Gojko
Klickovic said today the Serb authorities would attend as a
separate delegation with equal treatment the upcoming meetings on
the implementation of the Dayton accords.
</P>
<P>
After talks with envoys of international mediator Carl Bildt,
Paul Johns and Louis Selope, in the Serb capital of Pale,
Klickovic said they had discussed preparations for the meetings in
Sarajevo on June 6 and in Florence, Italy, on June 13-14.
</P>
<P>
The conference on Bosnian issues will be attended by foreign
ministers from about 50 countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Serb entity of Republika Srpska would be represented at the
Florence conference as a separate delegation and have its name on
the plate where the delegates will be seated, the Serb premier
said.
</P>
<P>
The Serb authorities did not send representatives to the
Brussels meeting in mid-April on the reconstruction of Bosnia
because it refused to attend the conference within a joint
delegation headed by Muslim-Croat federation officials.
</P>
<P>
Klickovic also said that the Florence talks would cover matters
of repatriating refugees and renewing and reconstructing both
entities in Bosnia -- Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat
federation.
</P>
<P>
Another high-level meeting, to be attended by the leaders of
Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, will be convened Sunday in Geneva to
discuss mainly general elections in September, the Mostar crisis
and cooperation with the Hague tribunal about the trial of war
criminals in the former Yugoslavia.

FIFA formally awarded the 1999 women's world championship to the
United States in Zurich on Friday, as the only other two
contenders -- Chile and Australia -- never submitted a formal bid.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was virtually lost in the drama surrounding

event in history," U.S. Soccer Federation president Alan
Rothenberg said in a release.
</P>
<P>
"While hosting the women's World Cup will require an entirely
different approach than the staging of World Cup USA 1994, we plan
to take advantage of all the resources available to us to ensure
the 1999 event establishes a new benchmark for women's
international soccer."

Only one venue used for the 1994 World Cup, Washington's Robert

<HEADLINE> Business Opportunities Lure Foreign Banks To Pudong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Lured by the possibly of more
business opportunities, foreign banks are queuing up for a
foothold in the financial trade zone in Shanghai's Pudong
Development Area.
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai is China's financial center and Lujiazui in Pudong is
the core of the center." said Lance Browne, of the Standard
Chartered Bank.
</P>
<P>
"We have formerly applied for permission to open a branch in
the zone which we deem as very important for our future business."
</P>
<P>
The appeal Lujiazui financial trade zone holds for foreign
banks, according to Lin Yuli, deputy president of the People's
Bank of China Shanghai Branch, lies in the preferential policies
the central financial authorities have granted to Pudong and the
zone.
</P>
<P>
These privileges include allowing foreign banks in Pudong to
handle Renminbi business on a trial basis once the ban is lifted;
to permit overseas financial institutions registered in Lujiazui
to open branches in Shanghai city proper and the Waigaoqiao bonded
zone, and to allow Pudong to take in more foreign banks and
Sino-foreign insurance firms.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, to make the Lujiazui financial trade zone more
enticing, the Shanghai municipal government has decided to set up
or move important trade and financial houses in the zone such as
the Shanghai grain and oil futures trading market, the Shanghai
Securities trading market, China Foreign Exchange Trade System and
trading centers for metal, coal, property rights and technology.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Standard Chartered Bank, Lin said, a dozen
overseas financial institutions have made similar applications.
</P>
<P>
However, Fuji Bank of Japan became resident in Lujiazui in
August last year, becoming the vanguard of foreign banks seeking a
foot in the area. And TM International Bank of Thailand moved its
headquarters in China from Shantou in Guangdong Province to Pudong
at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Lin predicted that more foreign banks are expected to join the
Pudong experience when the preferential policies are materialized,
and infrastructure in the zone is improved.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the zone revealed that financial activities in
Lujiazui has continued to grow in recent years. By the end of last
year the zone had 67 billion yuan in deposits and 53.3 billion
yuan in outstanding loans. The securities transaction volume
totaled 2660 billion yuan and insurance coverage stood at 58.5
billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> CD Producers Benefit Most from China's Anti-Piracy Campaign (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- "The Lion King", which attracted
tens of thousands of Chinese moviegoers, has sold 1.4 million
copies of its scores in China.
</P>
<P>
The CD from the US's Walt Disney Company, maker of the cartoon
movie, was a record for sales of a foreign-made CD in the Chinese
market.
</P>
<P>
Zang Yanbin, deputy director of Shanghai's Audio-Visual Press,
which was in charge of releasing the disk, attributed the success
to China's efforts at combatting pirated CDs.
</P>
<P>
Over the last few years China has been unremitting with the
punishing of intellectual property rights (IPR) violations,
working hard to perfect its system of IPR protection.
</P>
<P>
Zang said that large and middle-sized cities across the country
have provided telephone hotlines for people to report IPR
infractions, and teams of inspectors have been formed for IPR
protection.
</P>
<P>
Wholesale video and audio markets were examined and sales
people were trained to know the products they were selling. Some
companies selling video and audio products were even
re-registered, and those found to be violators of IPR rules had to
discontinue their business.
</P>
<P>
The news media also encouraged people to buy only CDs or laser
disks produced under copyright.
</P>
<P>
The government sent inspectors to CD and LD factories, and six
factories were closed when it was found that they had been
pirating products.

Encouraged by the success of "The Lion King", Disney decided to
sell more copyrights of books, tapes, and music CDs of Disney
classics, including "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs", "The Little
Mermaid", "Aladdin" and "Beauty and the Beast," Zang said.
</P>
<P>
The orders that the Shanghai China Record Company received at a
recent audio-visual products fair require 1.7 million CDs, LDs,
and tapes this year, an increase of 30 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Zang's company will have to work even harder, since it received
orders for 2.5 million copies, twice as many as it received last
year.
</P>
<P>
Orders received by both the Shanghai China Record Company and
the Shanghai Audio-Visual Press were for nearly half of all
overseas CDs produced this year in China. The two companies
obtained copyrights to these products through the normal copyright
process.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20 record companies from Japan, the United States,
Germany, Holland, Sweden, Hong Kong and Taiwan have visited
Shanghai for copyright negotiations.
</P>

<P>
CARACAS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Some 27,000 persons die of diseases
caused by cigarette smoking in Venezuela every year, doctors said
today on the No Tobacco Day.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 30 percent of all kinds of cancer and 90 percent
of lung cancer in active and passive smokers are linked to the
toxic residue of cigarette smoking, said the doctors from the
Anti-Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco smoking is the cause of the 3.5 million deaths a year
in the world and the second leading cause of death after
cardiovascular diseases, they added.
</P>
<P>
The doctors said the commemoration of the No Tobacco Day
creates consciousness in the world against tobacco addiction and
helps prevent diseases.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan Health Ministry said that last year 42 percent
of smokers abstained from smoking on the No Tobacco Day.

LHASA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region plans to
afforest some 66,000 ha of barren land, close 132,000 ha of
hillsides to facilitate afforestation and develop 1,320 ha of
economic trees in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
A local official said, "The move is part of an ambitious plan
to develop the region's forestry."
</P>
<P>
It is learned that leading officials in Tibet's prefectures and
major cities have signed contracts obliging them to achieve the
afforestation goals.
</P>
<P>
These goals include the protection of forestry resources and
the improvement of the ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
The official also said that the achievement or otherwise of the
goals will be an important factor when considering promotion for
local officials.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region's government attaches great importance to
the work because the development of forestry is closely
associated with people's living environment, which has been
deteriorating globally, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Eighty Yunnan Eye Patients Cured by Orbis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The flying eye doctors will be
leaving Kunming in southwest China tomorrow after giving the gift
of sight to dozens of "blind" Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
When their plane takes off they will be waving goodbye to an
army of grateful patients - many able to see for the first time in
years.
</P>
<P>
A typical example is 65 years old Su Shunhua who said: "I
feel excellent," as she walked down from the steps of the plane at
Kunming airport.
</P>
<P>
Su had undergone an operation to remove cataracts from her eyes.
</P>
<P>
Su, who comes from Kuiyuan City in southern Yunnan, was the
80th and last patient to have serious eye diseases treated by
a team of 26 eye doctors sent by the Orbis International Flying Eye
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Since they arrived in Kunming on May 11, the doctors from 12
countries have treated patients suffering cataracts, glaucoma, and
other serious eye diseases.
</P>
<P>
"All these treatments and operations have been successful,
bringing sight back to patients," one of the doctors claimed.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Shumin, vice-governor of Yunnan, met some of the doctors
to extend hearty gratitude on behalf of the 40 million people of
Yunnan, and invited them to revisit Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
During their 20-day stay in Kunming, the doctors also held a
seminar and trained 260 eye doctors and nurses.
</P>
<P>
He Zhiqiang, governor of Yunnan, said that the trained doctors
and nurses had promoted the prevention and treatment of eye
diseases in Yunnan, and will help more patients out of darkness.
</P>
<P>
Due to social and economic reasons, he said, there are still
180,000 people in Yunnan suffering from eye diseases.
</P>
<P>
Orbis International Flying Eye Hospital consists of over 600
first-class oculists from 29 countries. The hospital staff have
cured 18,000 patients aboard their planes, helping most to recover
their eyesight.
</P>
<P>
Since 1982 it has paid 17 visits to China. During its first
visit to Yunnan in 1992 it helped train more than 200 oculists,
who are now playing key roles in the province's battle against eye
diseases.

<P>
TOKYO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Japan's jobless rate again hit a
record high of 3.4 percent in April after easing in February and
March, the government said today.
</P>
<P>
The climb was due largely to a sharp increase in the
unemployment of women aged 25 to 34, the Management and
Coordination Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment totaled a record 2.35 million in April, up
210,000 or 9.8 percent from the same month of the previous year
and breaking the previous record of 2.3 million set in January.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate for men reached 3.3 percent in April, up
from 3.2 percent in March, while that for women hit a record 3.7
percent compared with three percent of the previous month,
surpassing the former record of 3.5 percent also set in January.

<P>
Labor Minister Takanobu Nagai said today he would ask officials
in charge of employment in each prefecture to create more jobs.

<HEADLINE> Ozone Destruction May Peak By the Year 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The quantity of ozone-destroying
chemicals in the atmosphere is declining for the first time, which
means the ozone destruction should peak by the end of the decade,
researchers reported in Science magazine.
</P>
<P>
In the new findings, ground-level measurements on three
continents and on two Pacific islands detected an outright
reduction in chlorine concentrations, the component of the
industrial chemical most responsible for ozone destruction, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The researchers also predicted that the peak of ozone
destruction in the stratosphere should come sometime from 1997 to
1999, and sometime after that, the ozone shield should begin to
recover.
</P>
<P>
The research team had been monitoring the chemistry of air
samples collected in the continental U.S., Canada, Australia,
Antarctica, Samoa and Hawaii. Measurements of chlorine peaked in
1994, and began to decline for the first time in last year.
</P>
<P>
The stratospheric ozone layer forms a natural barrier against
the Sun's ultraviolet radiation, excessive levels of which cause
skin cancer in humans and harm many plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
Scientists discovered in the 1980's that the gaseous chemicals
released in the ground-level atmosphere eventually migrate high
above earth t the stratosphere, where they cause a chemical
reaction that destroys ozone molecules.

JERUSALEM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat will hold a joint meeting between the PA cabinet and
the PLO Executive Committee in Gaza this evening, according to a
report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's media adviser Babil Abu Rudainah told reporters that
the meetings will discuss the recent developments. He did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The PA has been following up closely the Israel's general
elections. But Arafat declared that the PA would not take sides
with any prime ministerial candidate and party. He also issued a
directive to PA officials banning comments on the results of the
elections.
</P>
<P>
But some PA officials still gave their comments on the
preliminary results Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tayyib Abdul Rahim, the director-general of the Presidency,
said: "These are preliminary results, and even if (Prime Minister
Shimon) Peres lost, the new government must continue the peace
path as the Palestinian-Israeli agreement is an international
one."
</P>
<P>
"All the parties have to commit it in order to implement this
agreement. President Arafat is very interested in the results and
he is following up the announcement of them, because they will
decide the Israeli future relationship with the PA," he added.
</P>
<P>
PA Finance Minister Muhammad Zuhdi Nashashibi said that the
Israeli elections were not voting on the peace process, but
voting to decide who will continue the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Child Malnutrition Serious in Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Child malnutrition is severe in
developing countries, leading to substandard weight for about 174
million children under 5 and stunt for 230 million, according to a
recent report issued by the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Besides poor physical and cognitive development, malnutrition
can also result in lower resistance to illness. It is blamed for
54 percent of the 12.2 million deaths among children under 5 in
the developing world in 1993.
</P>
<P>
WHO estimates that globally, basic needs for energy and protein
are not met for over 800 million people, more than 2,000 million
people lack essential micronutrients, and hundreds of millions
suffer from diseases caused by unsafe food or unbalanced food
intake.
</P>
<P>
Currently, over two-thirds of the world's malnourished children
live in Asia, particularly in South Asia, followed by Africa and
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The number of malnourished children is on rise due to
stagnation of nutritional improvement and rapid growth in
population in some regions such as South Asia and sub-Saharan
Africa, said WHO.
</P>
<P>
More than half the young children in South Asia suffer from
protein and energy malnutrition, about five times the prevalence
in the Western hemisphere and more than twice that in the East
Asia. The prevalence is about 30 percent in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO, measures including breast-feeding especially
during 18 months from birth, appropriate complementary feeding,
nutrition education for behavioural change, micronutrient
deficiency control and maternal nutrition can all help reduce
child malnutrition.

ABU DHABI, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 600 Indians are deported
from Dubai every month for overstaying or staying without travel
documents or visa, according to diplomatic sources in the Gulf
today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that 49 Indians, all illegal entrants, were
put on a cargo launch bound for Gujarat, India last weekend. They
are all victims of unscrupulous travel agents in Dubai and India.
</P>
<P>
"The Dubai government pay about 110 U.S. dollars per person to
the launch operators for the deportee's food and transport,"
Prabhu Dayal, Counsel General of India in Dubai said, adding that
two to three launches carry the illegal entrants back home every
month.
</P>
<P>
Many people illegally enter the United Arab Emirates (UAE),
one of the richest countries in the region, to seek job. Some of
the illegal immigrants are jailed in the "Al Taweelah" prison
located between Dubai and Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
One third of the detainees are Indians, the rest being
Pakistanis, Iranians and other nationalities.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Urges More Use of Home-made Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
said today that priority should be given to the use of China's
home-made equipment.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remark at a national tele-conference held to
mobilize people in the domestic machine-building sector to
participate in the national campaign to improve product quality,
optimize structure and enhance development capability.
</P>
<P>
He noted that careful feasibility studies and consultations
should be conducted before the import of major equipment and the
introduction of investment projects with bright market prospects.
</P>
<P>
Some key projects will be launched to manufacture large-scale
equipment vital to the national economic development, he added.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that China has made big progress in
the machine-building industry since the policy of opening up and
reform was initiated in 1979.
</P>
<P>
But the industry still lags far behind that of developed nation
and the rising demand from the national economic development in
terms of product quality, structure and development capability, he
continued.
</P>
<P>
Therefore efforts must be made to reversing out-moded practices
which were merely in pursuit of growth rate and quantity, he said,
adding that the passive situation in which China's
machine-building industry relies too heavily on foreign
technologies must be changed in order to blaze a new path of
development ensuring fairly high growth rate and good performance.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that self-dependent development capability is vital
to machine-building industry, and it does not mean closing the
country to international intercourse, nor rejecting advanced
technologies.
</P>
<P>
China's machine-building industry has been quite successful in
the introduction of advanced technologies in the past decade or
so, he said.
</P>
<P>
But mere reliance on foreign technologies to the neglect of
fostering self-depending development capability will not "bring us
modernization" and will hinder future development, the
vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
Bao Xuding, minister of machine-building industry, admitted that
China's machine-building industry is plagued by such problems as
worsening production and marketing ratios, increasing stock
pile-ups and loans in arrears.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister home-made machinery products have
lost large market shares during the 1990s and they only accounted
for 69 percent of the domestic market last year.
</P>
<P>
The demand for some products has been increasing rapidly, but
home-made products have lost large shares of the market in the
meantime.
</P>
<P>
He urged all departments concerned to make even greater efforts
to reverse the situation and bring the industry onto a sound
development track.

<HEADLINE> SSTC Helps Lift six Million People Out of Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Nearly six million people in three
former Chinese revolutionary bases have been lifted out of poverty
thanks to the efforts by the State Science and Technology
Commission (SSTC) and local governments.
</P>
<P>
The people are part of the 10 million poverty-stricken farmers
in the Dabie mountainous area, Jinggang mountainous area and
northwestern Shaanxi Province, which were important revolutionary
bases used by the Communist Party of China against the ruling
Guomingtang government between 1920 and 1940.
</P>
<P>
The areas, including parts of the provinces of Anhui, Hubei,
Jiangxi, Hunan and Shaanxi, remain poor because of their
unfavorable natural conditions. Nearly 10 million people did not
have enough to eat or sufficient clothing to wear even in 1986.
</P>
<P>
SSTC offered in 1986 to help counties in the Dabie mountainous
area listed by the Central government as poverty counties to
escape their poverty.
</P>
<P>
So far the commission has allocated a total of 56.5 million
yuan in aid, together with 320 million yuan in poverty-relief
loans, or subsidized loans earmarked to the three areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the commission, SSTC and local science and
technology departments helped local government formulate
poverty-reduction strategies, which put emphasis on the use of
science and technology and labor-intensive industries.
</P>
<P>
The industries involve agriculture, production of silk, tea,
edible fungi, medical herbs, fresh and dried fruit and livestock
farming.
</P>
<P>
Officials say both the poverty-ridden farmers and local
governments have benefited from the rapid development of those
industries as their incomes or revenues have grown.
</P>
<P>
By 1995 the annual per capita income in the Dabie and Jinggang
mountainous areas rose to nearly 1,100 yuan, compared with only
260 yuan in the Dabie mountain area in 1986 and 375 yuan in 1990
in Jinggang mountainous area.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Lilan, executive vice-minister of SSTC, said
poverty-reduction through science and technology is an important
part of China's anti-poverty strategy.
</P>
<P>
China announced in early 1990s a plan to eliminate absolute
poverty by 2000 by taking a series of effective measures.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 65 million rural residents throughout the
country still live under the poverty line.

<HEADLINE> UK Global Trade Deficit Falls in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Record exports, combined with a fall
in imports in March helped Britain cut its deficit on trade with
the rest of the world from 1.3 billion pounds (2 billion US
dollars) in February to 802 million pounds (1.2 billion US
dollars), ahead of City expectations.
</P>
<P>
According to figures published by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS), total exports increased by 3.5 percent in March,
taking the value of goods sold internationally to an all-time high
of 13.8 billion pounds (20.7 billion US dollars). Imports fell by
0.5 percent to 14.6 billion pounds (21.9 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, it is in Europe that Britain's performance has
produced the biggest surprise. The deficit with European Union
(EU) countries shrank from 416 million pounds (624 million US
dollars) to 126 million pounds (189 million US dollars) in March,
thanks to a 4.1 percent jump in exports.
</P>
<P>
But the deficit in the first quarter of this year widened to
3.5 billion pounds (5.3 billion US dollars) from 3.2 billion
pounds (4.8 billion US dollars) in the last quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
There was also concern over figures showing that the trade
deficit with non-EU countries increased sharply in April to 868
million pounds (1.3 billion US dollars) from 676 million pounds (1
billion US dollars) in March, although half of the increase was
because of a big jump in aircraft orders.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said Thursday that it believes the trend in the deficit
is "broadly flat", but many economists fear that the recent
pick-up in consumer activity will lead to the deficit widening
later in the year as the country sucks in imports.

<HEADLINE> Over 26,000 Angolan Refugees to Return Home From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Over 26,000 Angolan refugees will
be repatriated to their home country from Zambia soon after a
government of national unity is formed in Angola, a U.N. refugee
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Acting representative Benedict Akinola of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Zambia said that on the
Zambian side all logistics for the repatriation has been almost
completed.
</P>
<P>
He said the construction of the road from Meheba refugee
settlement in the North-Western Province of Zambia to Kamapanda
on Angolan border have been completed.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals and schools in Angola are being rehabilitated for
the refugees to be repatriated, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the Angolan government of national unity is
formed in July this year, the repatriation will start in the next
month and the exercise is expected to last three to six months.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace accord signed here in 1994 by the Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and the Angolan
government, Angolan refugees will be repatriated. During the
civil war which broke out soon after the country's independence
in 1975, about three million Angolans fled the country. But since
the end of the war in 1994, growing numbers of Angolan refugees
have been returning home.

<TEXT>
<P>
PESHAWAR, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani and his new ally Gulbuddin Hekmatyar decided to contact
all Afghan factions for a durable and amicable solution to the
Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed today by Ustad Qareeb Urrahman Saeed,
official spokesman of Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar Group) led by
Hekmatyar, the former Afghan prime minister and ex-rival of
Rabbani, while talking to Xinhua here in the northwest of
Pakistan.

Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar Group) set up a joint commission
comprising three nominees from each party.
</P>
<P>
The commission will establish contacts with all Afghan factions
for the setting-up of an interim coalition government acceptable
to all parties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Afghan leaders have been invited by the Taliban
Islamic militia in their stronghold in the southern Afghan city of
Khandahar to discuss the recently signed agreement between the two
former rivals of Rabbani and Hekmatyar.
</P>

interim government they will move towards the holding of election
and transfer of power to the elected people.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement between Rabbani and Hekmatyar was not
against any party, but in case anyone attacks them, they have the
right to defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
He said since the signing of the agreement, a joint military
commission has been formed and powers of the Defense Ministry have
been withdrawn from Rabbani's right-hand man Ahmed Shah Masood.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Urges Stability of Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
today urged the central bank to invest more into economic
research and analysis to help bring stability into the country's
financial system.
</P>
<P>
He said while the government has tried to balance the
country's fiscal and monetary policies, the Reserve Bank of
Zimbabwe should help maintain the confidence of the financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe was speaking as he officially opened the towering new
Reserve Bank Headquarters in the capital which will house all
central bank operations.
</P>
<P>
''The enlargement of the financial institutions and other
market participants requires maintenance of a solid financial
sector through prudential supervision and the guarantee of sound
banking services for the benefit of the public at large,'' said
Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
''To do this effectively the bank must continue to invest in
its economic research and analytical capabilities so as to
guarantee the stability of our financial system and maintain the
confidence of our financial markets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
On the country's economic indicators, Mugabe said he hoped the
inflation rate would continue to fall which would make it
possible for interest rates to fall and give impetus for better
economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate in Zimbabwe is currently 24.3 percent and
interest rates are around 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe urged the governors from southern African central
banks to share on their research capabilities and cooperate in
order to achieve sustainable regional growth which would help
Zimbabwe as it entered the second phase of the economic
structural adjustment program starting this year.

<HEADLINE> Germany, Kazakhstan Agree to Expand Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan and Germany today
agreed to make full use of their potential for furthering their
all-round cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Visiting German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel held talks with
Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev today on how to strengthen
bilateral economic cooperation and provide assistance to ethnic
Germans living in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
President Nazarbayev told Kinkel that the two countries should
work out plans for large-scale political and economic cooperation
and in this regard it is of great importance for Germany to
increase investment in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel told a press conference after the talks that Bonn wants
to speed up its cooperation with kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
He said he had discussed with President Nazarbayev the issue of
the 500,000 Germans living in Kazakhstan and they both hoped that
these people would stay in the Central Asian country and serve as
a bridge for closer German-Kazakh relations.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Germans living in Kazakhstan are descendants from
farming stock exiled to the central Asia republic during World
War Two. The size of the ethnic German community in the country
has shrunk by more than half as a result of emigration mainly to
Germany over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel, who arrived here early today for a one-day visit, also
met with Kazakh Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin, Foreign
minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
He also designed an agreement with Tokayev on providing
assistance to the ethnic Germans and guaranteeing the respect of
their minority rights.

<HEADLINE> EC Calls for More Action to Combating Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) today
called on the member states of the European Union (EU) to take
more action to help people stop smoking.
</P>
<P>
On Friday's World No-Smoking Day, Padraig Flynn, European
Commissioner for public health matters, said that EU members need
to take more "decisive action" to discourage people from beginning
to smoke and to encourage smokers to stop.
</P>
<P>
He also condemned the relentless onslaught of advertising and
promotional measures aimed at recruiting new young smokers.
</P>
<P>
"The combination of seductive advertising, often paradoxically
associated with sporting events, and nicotine addiction
all-to-often serve to over-shadow the dangers to health of
smoking," Flynn said in reference to recent allegations of the
manipulation of nicotine levels by tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
The Commissioner underlined that the EC remains committed to
its proposal for a Council directive to ban tobacco advertising.
</P>
<P>
He also undertook to investigate claims that the existing TV
tobacco advertising ban is being flouted by tobacco company
sponsorship of televised sports events.
</P>
<P>
Flynn said that the EC will soon present a report on the
application by the member states of a 1989 Council Resolution on
smoking in public places.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council decided today to extend the mandate of the United Nations
Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) for three months until August
31.
</P>
<P>
With a resolution adopted unanimously, the Security Council
expressed its grave concern at the collapse of the cease-fire, the
resumption of hostilities and the spread of fighting into the
previous safe area of Monrovia and its environs.
</P>
<P>
The council condemned all attacks against personnel of the
Monitoring Group of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOMOG), UNOMIL and international organizations and agencies
delivering humanitarian assistance as well as the looting of their
equipment, supplies and personal property, and called for the
immediate return of looted property.
</P>
<P>
It called upon the Liberian parties to implement fully and
expeditiously all the agreements and commitments they had already
entered into, in particular the Abuja Agreement, and in this
regard demanded that they restore an effective and comprehensive
cease-fire, withdraw all fighters and arms from Monrovia, allow
the deployment of ECOMOG, and restore Monrovia as a safe haven.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also stressed that continued support by
the international community for the peace process in Liberia,
including the participation of UNOMIL, was contingent on the
Liberian parties' demonstrating their commitment to resolve their
differences peacefully and on the fulfilment of the conditions
mentioned above.
</P>
<P>
The recent fighting broke out in suburbs of Monrovia on April 6
and quickly escalated and spread to central Monrovia. Thousands of
civilians, including United Nations and other international
personnel, were caught in the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali noted recently
that the faction leaders in Liberia had clearly demonstrated their
disregard for the aspirations of the Liberian people for peace,
who have suffered from a civil war lasting over six years.

between the two peoples."
</P>
<P>
The orchestra's conductor, Wolfgang Sawallisch, said in an
interview before the concert that to return to Beijing with
Beethoven's symphony is "a challenge" for the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
Sawallisch, who conducted the orchestra's concerts in China in
1993, said Beethoven's symphony is "a language that everybody in
the world can understand," adding that it is a "unique
opportunity" for the orchestra to play four of Beethoven's
symphonies in two concerts.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Pastoral Symphony, the artists also
performed the overture to Leonore opera and the No. 4 Symphony.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Sawallisch will conduct the orchestra to present
Beethoven's another two symphonies, No. 2 and No. 3.
</P>

becoming the first foreign symphony orchestra to visit this
country.
</P>
<P>
Chinese organizers of the concert said they hope the orchestra
will return again in the year 2000, the 100th anniversary of its
founding.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The petrol price will be
increased by 13 cents a liter from June 5, South Africa's Central
Energy Fund (CEF) announced today.
</P>
<P>
Diesel will go up by five cents and illuminating paraffin by
four cents at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The CEF attributed the price hike to the deterioration of the
Rand against the US Dollar and international price increases.
</P>
<P>
In a statement responding to the price hike, the Consumer
Council said the 13 cents price increase will have a devastating
effect on consumer spending patterns.
</P>
<P>
Consumer Council Director Ina Wilken said the increase will
create a ripple effect on all commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
Wilken condemned the latest increase, saying it seems as if
both business and government are insensitive to the plight of
consumers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Automobile Association said it is gravely
concerned about the price hike.
</P>
<P>
The increase should be seen as an opportunity to urgently
examine deregulation of the oil industry, said the association.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Sets Up Legal Assistance Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A center for legal assistance was
set up today in Chengdu, capital city of southwest China's Sichuan
Province. It puts the province in the lead across the country in
the establishment of a legal assistance system.
</P>
<P>
Legal assistance is a system under which the state offers
financial assistance, such as reducing court fees, or paying
lawyer's fees, to extremely poor citizens in certain lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
Stipulations concerning the setting up of the system were
included in the new Criminal Procedures Law and China's first law
on lawyers, both passed by the Eighth National People's Congress,
China's legislature, this year.
</P>
<P>
The legal assistance center of Sichuan, which is to standardize
and legalize the practice of legal assistance, will be responsible
for examining applications, appointing institutions and
individuals in charge of legal assistance, and engaging law firms
or lawyers appointed by the courts in legal assistance work.
</P>
<P>
Today also saw the establishment of a legal assistance fund,
with a one-million-yuan donation from a local industrial company,
which will safeguard the implementation of the system financially.
</P>
<P>
Law experts pointed out that the emergence of legal assistance
in China is a sign of government efforts to give full protection
to the people's legal rights.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Jobless Rate Returns to Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Japan's jobless rate reversed a
falling trend in February and March and jumped back to a record
high of 3.4 percent in April, official figures showed today.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted jobless rate, which had been at the
record 3.4 percent from November to January, fell to 3.1 percent
in March.
</P>
<P>
But the number of the jobless hit a new high of 2.35 million in
April, a slight increase from the previous record of 2.3 million
set in January but up nearly 10 percent from the same month a year
ago, said the figures released by the Management and Coordination
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency attributed the rise in April's overall jobless rate
to a sharp increase in the number of jobless women aged 25 to
34. Unemployed women in this age group rose from 5.1 percent in
March to a record 6.1 percent, or 320,000.
</P>
<P>
The number of university graduates still out of work rose by
20,000 to 220,000, which pushed up the overall jobless rate, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate for men reached 3.3 percent in April, up 0.1
percentage point from March, but the figure for women rose to a
new high of 3.7 percent, up 0.2 percentage points from the record
in January.
</P>
<P>
An official at the agency said the higher unemployment rate
signaled economic recovery, which may have encouraged many women
to quit their jobs and begin searching for better work.

LAGOS, May (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Minister of Information and
Culture Walter Ofonagoro yesterday called on non-aligned nations
to seriously tackle the attempt of the West to marginalize the
third world.
</P>
<P>
The western world is trying to do so through their "highly
biased one-sided flow of information", the minister said at the

non-aligned countries.
</P>
<P>
Kim Chol Myong, chairman of the IGC, also called for a

The third world should also join hands to pursue the

</P>
<P>
The IGC meeting, which started on Monday in the Nigerian
capital of Abuja, was attended by 36 countries.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Namibia, Russia Sign Military Aid Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Namibia and Russia have signed
a military cooperation agreement, under which Russia will assist
Namibia Defence Force (NDF) with training and equipment, the South
African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement followed Namibian Defence Minister Philemon
Malima's visit to Russia in April and subsequent negotiations
between the two countries, said the report.
</P>
<P>
A Namibian newspaper in Windhoek on Friday quoted Malima as
saying that the agreement provided for training of NDF officers by
Russian armed forces either in Namibia or Russia, repairing and
maintenance of equipment procured from Russia and cooperation in
other military fields.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister declined to go into details about what
kind of equipment namibia was interested in obtaining.
</P>
<P>
Malima pointed out that namibia is a young country in terms of
establishing a defence force and said that when south africa
withdrew prior to namibia's independence in 1990, all military
equipment was withdrawn as well.
</P>
<P>
''Namibia was left without even a single helicopter, without a
single vessel to patrol the coast and without armoured
equipment,'' said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would increase the combat readiness of the NDF
and also support the ''military industrial complex'' of Russia,
said Sergei Svechnikov, Chairman of Russia's State Committee on
Technical-Military policy, who has signed the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Germany, Kazakhstan Agree to Expand Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan and Germany today
agreed to make full use of their potential for furthering their
all-round cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Visiting German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel held talks with
Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev today on how to strengthen
bilateral economic cooperation and provide assistance to ethnic
Germans living in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
President Nazarbayev told Kinkel that the two countries should
work out plans for large-scale political and economic cooperation
and in this regard it is of great importance for Germany to
increase investment in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel told a press conference after the talks that Bonn wants
to speed up its cooperation with kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
He said he had discussed with President Nazarbayev the issue of
the 500,000 Germans living in Kazakhstan and they both hoped that
these people would stay in the Central Asian country and serve as
a bridge for closer German-Kazakh relations.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Germans living in Kazakhstan are descendants from
farming stock exiled to the central Asia republic during World War
Two. The size of the ethnic German community in the country has
shrunk by more than half as a result of emigration mainly to
Germany over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel, who arrived here early today for a one-day visit, also
met with Kazakh Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin, Foreign
minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
He also designed an agreement with Tokayev on providing
assistance to the ethnic Germans and guaranteeing the respect of
their minority rights.

<HEADLINE> UK Global Trade Deficit Falls in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Record exports, combined with a fall
in imports in March helped Britain cut its deficit on trade with
the rest of the world from 1.3 billion pounds (2 billion US
dollars) in February to 802 million pounds (1.2 billion US
dollars), ahead of City expectations.
</P>
<P>
According to figures published by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS), total exports increased by 3.5 percent in March,
taking the value of goods sold internationally to an all-time high
of 13.8 billion pounds (20.7 billion US dollars). Imports fell by
0.5 percent to 14.6 billion pounds (21.9 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, it is in Europe that Britain's performance has
produced the biggest surprise. The deficit with European Union
(EU) countries shrank from 416 million pounds (624 million US
dollars) to 126 million pounds (189 million US dollars) in March,
thanks to a 4.1 percent jump in exports.
</P>
<P>
But the deficit in the first quarter of this year widened to
3.5 billion pounds (5.3 billion US dollars) from 3.2 billion
pounds (4.8 billion US dollars) in the last quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
There was also concern over figures showing that the trade
deficit with non-EU countries increased sharply in April to 868
million pounds (1.3 billion US dollars) from 676 million pounds (1
billion US dollars) in March, although half of the increase was
because of a big jump in aircraft orders.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said Thursday that it believes the trend in the deficit
is "broadly flat", but many economists fear that the recent
pick-up in consumer activity will lead to the deficit widening
later in the year as the country sucks in imports.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Defeats Peres to Become New Israeli PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Likud challenger Benjamin
Netanyahu today defeated Shimon Peres by a razor-thin 0.9
percentage point to become the first directly elected Israeli
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, 46, garnered 50.4 percent, or 1,501,023 votes,
against Peres' 49.5 percent, or 1,471,566 votes, after the
counting of all ballots was finished this afternoon, according to
the Central Election Committee.
</P>
<P>
Peres, 72, the outgoing prime minister, immediately telephoned
Netanyahu to congratulate him on his success and wished him good
luck. Peres said he would assure an orderly transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters later on, Peres said that he still
supports the peace process, vowing to continue working for peace
and is "against any attempt to stop it".
</P>
<P>
Within minutes of Netanyahu's election as Israeli prime
minister, U.S. President Bill Clinton also telephoned Netanyahu to
congratulate him on his election success and pledged to work with
the new Israeli leader.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also called Peres to express deep personal regard and
appreciation for his leadership on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
As for the elections of the 120-seat Knesset (parliament), both
the Labor and Likud, the two leading parties, had lost some
ground, with Labor's share of seats reducing from 44 to 34, and
Likud's from 40 to 32.
</P>
<P>
The biggest winner of the elections is Yisrael Ba'aliya, the
new Russian immigrant party, which gains seven seats from
none. Other winners are two major religious parties, with the
Shas getting 10 seats and the National Religious Party nine seats.
</P>
<P>
The leftist Meretz, the coalition partner of Peres'
government, appeared to be a loser, whose seats reducing to nine
from 12. The Hadash won five seats, while the United Arab List,
United Torah Judaism and the Third Way gained four seats
separately. The far-rightist Meledet won two seats.
</P>
<P>
About 3 million Israeli voters cast their ballots on Wednesday
to elect, for the first time, the prime minister and the 120-seat
Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Under the Basic Law, Netanyahu is required to form a government
within 45 days after the official publication of the election
results.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that Netanyahu is not expected to have any
trouble in forming a coalition government. He has already had
consultations with the religious parties and the centralist
Yisrael Ba'aliya.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the win by Netanyahu, widely regarded as a
hardliner, could possibly set back the ongoing Middle East peace
process pursued by Peres' government.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu promises to continue seeking peace with Israel's
Arab neighbors, including the Palestinians, but he puts security
as a priority of his government.
</P>
<P>
He vows to expand Jewish settlements in Palestinian
territories, oppose the establishment of a Palestinian state and
refuse to relinquish the Golan Heights seized from Syria.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat will
meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordanian King
Hussein in Jordan's Red Sea resort of Aqaba Wednesday to assess
the possible implications of the Israeli elections.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Reactions from Palestinians, Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Likud block leader Benjamin
Netanyahu defeated Labor Party's Shimon Peres by a razor-thin 0.9
percentage point, thereby winning the race for premiership with an
imminent prospect of changing the political set-up of the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
Reactions from Jews and Palestinians differed over the results
of the Israeli elections, which were announced this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The changes in the Israeli hierarchy are certain to exert
profound influence over the Israeli relations with the Arabs, the
Palestinians in particular, and over the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli cab driver told Xinhua that Netanyahu's election
tallied with his wishes.
</P>
<P>
The driver, who did not reveal his name, described Netanyahu
as "the hope of Israel."
</P>
<P>
Asked why he likes Netanyahu, he cited three reasons: First
of all, Netanyahu is young and energetic, which is especially
true compared with Peres.
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, Bibi (Netanyahu's nickname) has done everything
successfully," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, Netanyahu is a "super fighter," because he joined an
Israeli commando task force in 1967 to salvage dozens of Israeli
hostages held in Uganda. The operation was successful, with the
sacrifice of only one commando who is Netanyahu's elder brother,
Yoni Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
He said his family and relatives all supported Netanyahu in
the race for the premiership.
</P>
<P>
Another middle-aged Jew, who said his name is "Israel," said
today in Jerusalem that he champions Netanyahu because "he is
good to Jews" and adamantly defends Jewish interests.
</P>
<P>
Asked why he did not support Peres, "Israel" said Peres has
given "too much" to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Today, he gives this, and tomorrow he gives that," he
complained, in a reference to the Israeli withdrawals from the
West Bank and Gaza in accordance with the PLO-Israel peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
Moshe Modhat, a 57-year-old Jewish man, said his family was
split over who should be supported for the premiership in the
elections campaign.
</P>
<P>
"I and my wife have lost and my sons and daughters won," he
noted, saying that the old couple supported Peres and their
children for Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Reactions from Palestinians, Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palestinians hold different opinions over the election results,
some of them showed indifference to the race.
</P>
<P>
Several Palestinian officials maintained that the Israeli
elections are an internal matter and the Palestinian Authority is
ready to deal with whoever plays the first fiddler in the Israeli
government.
</P>
<P>
According to Elias M. Freij, mayor of Bethlehem, the
Palestinians will deal with the Israelis on "an objective basis."
Bethlehem is only 10 kilometers south of Jerusalem,
</P>
<P>
Freij made the remarks in an exclusive interview with
Xinhua over the prospect of the Israeli-Palestinian relations
under a new Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question that some people think Peres is more
flexible than Netanyahu in handling the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations, Freij said: "I doubt this."
</P>
<P>
He maintained that there are no substantial differences
between Peres and Netanyahu in their policies with the Arabs,
especially the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Hanan Ashrawi, a prominent Palestinian activist who served as
spokeswoman for the PLO team in three years of negotiations
with Israel, held that the Likud victory does not necessarily
mean an end to peace moves with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi, now a member of the Palestinian legislative council,
said the world pressure would persuade Netanyahu to honor the
accords signed by the Labor governments under Yitzhak Rabin and
Peres.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think that the simplistic polarization of saying
that Labor is God's gift for peace and Likud is ... the
end of peace," she said.
</P>
<P>
A 60-year-old Palestinian shop owner in eastern Jerusalem said
he thinks there is no difference between Peres and Netanyahu in
handling the Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
"They all want to kill us, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The owner, who identified himself as Gamal, told Xinhua that he
does not care who heads the Israeli government, a group of his
neighbors supported his argument.
</P>
<P>
"All of this were Palestinian," he said, pointing to the hills
and buildings around his shop. "If anyone is good, he should
return all of this to us."
</P>
<P>
Anyway, a number of Palestinians interviewed said they think
Peres is a little bit better to Arabs and Palestinians, compared
with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
But surprisingly, Jamil Salahat, a Palestinian mini-bus driver,
said that Netanyahu is better than Peres.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu is straight-forward, Peres is round-about," he
explained, saying that Peres is irresolute, hesitant in dealing
with many things, such as settlements and the withdrawal of
Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
He complained that Peres has dragged things too long. "Israelis
should have pulled out of Hebron and other places long ago," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Workers were seen Thursday removing and clearing away posters,
fliers and other campaign propaganda that littered the streets in
both Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Today, there were no more signs of
campaigning except for a small number of remaining posters and
streamers.
</P>
<P>
Three hours before the announcement of the final elections
results, the campaign headquarters of the Likud Party in Tel Aviv
were totally evacuated, and Netanyahu was said to have gone home
to spend the Sabbath with a confidence of winning the intense
race.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Speaker Sees Nothing New in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri,
commenting on results of the Israeli elections, said tonight that
he did not see anything new in what took place in Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We do not differentiate one Israeli prime minister from
another," Berri told reporters at the end of a meeting with
President Elias Hrawi and Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
"The manner could be different, but the aggression and the
occupation remain the same," the Shiite house speaker added.
</P>
<P>
Berri accused the Clinton administration of making a mistake by
agreeing with Israel to hold the elections on the expense of
delaying the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We tell the Americans that they made a mistake when they
agreed on the date of the Israeli elections being held in advance
of the resumption of the peace negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Berri underlined that a cease-fire understanding, which his
country reached with the Jewish state on April 26, was still
effective, and called for a commitment to the understanding.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-broked understanding ended 16 days of Israeli
military strikes in southern Lebanon in which some 200 Lebanese
civilians were killed.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's three top leaders held the meeting in the Beirut
Presidential Palace tonight to discuss the situations in the
region in light of the results of the Israeli general elections.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Israel later this afternoon said that Benjamin
Netanyahu, leader of the rightwing Likud Party, had been elected
to the prime minister after defeating Shimon Peres, the incumbent
prime minister and head of the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
Amin Hafez, chairman of the Lebanese parliamentary committee
for foreign affairs, said today that the results of the Israeli
elections "expressed a refusal of the Israeli public opinion for
the model of the Madrid Peace Conference.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the results of the elections "strengthened a
legitimacy of the (Lebanese) resistance against the Israeli
occupation and the legitimacy of the Intifadha (Palestinian
uprising) in West Bank."
</P>
<P>
Sheik Naim Qassem, the deputy leader of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, described Netanyahu as a "terrorist
and murderer," and vowed that Shiite Moslem guerrillas will step up
their campaign to drive Israel out of the border strip it occupies
in south Lebanon.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 31 (Xinhua)-- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
today reiterated the government's commitment to further stimulate
private sector' participation in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Opening the Copperbelt Agriculture and Commercial Show in the
northern city of Kitwe, Chiluba said the private investors should
be encouraged to take up the challenges of improving the
country's agricultural sector because the government will soon
disengage from taking an active role in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba urged the farming communilty to make full use of the
farming incentives in this year's budget including the zero-rate
tax on agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The newly created credit scheme combined with the agricultural
sector investment program will further benefit the farmers, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to the farmers to take diversificaction of
crops seriously in order to reduce independence on maize
production.
</P>
<P>
Varieties of agricultural products and other commodities are

<TEXT>
<P>
LASAKA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A bomb blasted in the headquarters
of the local "Times of Zambia" newspaper in the northern city of
Ndola at small hours this morning, the local television reported
this evening.
</P>
<P>
The blast, which occurred at about 04:00 hours, has caused
minor damages to the building which houses the newspaper
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Newspaper publishing was disrupted and no copies of the daily
were on sale in streets today.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, nobody has claimed responsibility for the blast.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, a bomb explosion occurred on the wall fence of
the State House in capital Lusaka, which left several small holes
on the wall.
</P>
<P>
The Black Mamba, a secret group, claimed responsibility for
the blast on the outer brick wall of the State House.
</P>
<P>
The secret group has demanded the government to withdraw the
controversial new constitution which bars former president
Kenneth Kaunda from contesting presidency in this year's general
elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKAKA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali suggested that nations should cooperate through the
United Nations to maximize the uses and minimize the obstacles of
globalizations, the semi-official Anatolia news agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali, who is staying in Turkey for Habitat II, made
this suggestion at a conference held today by the Strategic
Research Institute of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia quoted Boutros-Ghali as saying that although there
were positive aspects of the inevitable globalization which the
world is going through as the world people approach the 21st
century, there existed some dangers such as "globalizing crimes
and environmental pollution," which had to be dealt with as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali said that the struggle against these problems
was even beyond the power of a group of states, adding that
the benefits and constraints which emerge from globalization
emphasized the importance of non government organizations (NGOs)
and local administration, and that states should allocate more
authority to them.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the U.N. felt itself responsible for
helping those countries in their post-war reconstruction
periods to develop.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said here today that a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle
East should be based on the Israeli complete withdrawal from the
occupied Arab territories and the emergence of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Cairo Radio today, Moussa said,
"Any peace without this condition will be incomplete and
unacceptable to anybody."
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptian man in the street has a certain identification of
peace. I, myself, will never be satisfied without the rise of the
Palestinian state and the resolving of the issues of Jerusalem,
Palestinian refugees, the Israeli settlements, Israeli-Arab
borders and water," he added.
</P>
<P>
"There must be a balanced solution for all these issues," he
said, adding that "an imbalanced peace would not be just,
permanent or comprehensive, so it would be unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"The Arab stance should be clear-cut and be based on the fact
that we will never accept peace with Israel at the expense of the
Arab rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Syrian-Israeli track of peace, he said that a certain,
but not sufficient, progress has been achieved on this track.
</P>
<P>
He said he expects the talks on this track to be resumed soon.
As for the Lebanese-Israeli track, he attributed its tension to
the existence of the Israeli occupation in south Lebanon.

Lesotho, the South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Gaborone on Friday, SADC

effect. Mbuende said it would cover the progressive elimination of
obstacles to the free movement of people, goods, capital and labour
within the region.

Allowing investors and tourists to move freely in the region
could only benefit economic development, said Mbuende, adding fears
of mass migration were unfounded.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Prospects for South Africa's
development were seriously undermined by the large-scale deprivation
of children in the past, President Nelson Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
Launching a national program of action for children in Pretoria
on the eve of the Children's Day, Mandela said one out of every eight
children would die before their fifth birthday, and a quarter of
those surviving grew up physically stunted.
</P>
<P>
The national program of action set out the priorities and the
framework to assist the government to realise the goals for the
healthy growup of the children.
</P>
<P>
Funds for the program would be raised from the government, society
and the international aid community.
</P>
<P>
Mandela stressed that South Africa had the accumulated knowledge,
the technologies and the communications capacities to protect the
normal growth and development of almost all children at relatively
low cost.
</P>
<P>
Reducing malnutrition, diseases and illiteracy was among the most
achievable and fundamental of development's challenges, said the
president, adding ''children are our nation's future''.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, Mandela said: ''having a specific integrated
program to ensure the survival, protection and development of south
Africa's children is therefore a vital element in building an
economically dynamic and healthy nation.'' enditem

ISTANBUL, May 31 (Xinhua) -- More than 400 municipality
officials from all over the world met here in the past two days,
discussing how to take an active role in responding to the
challenges facing human beings living in cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
The World Assembly of Cities and Local Authorities was
sponsored by the United Nations within the framework of the
HABITAT II, or the Second U.N. Conference on Human Settlements.
</P>
<P>
The official agenda of HABITAT II, also known as "City
Summit", is due to start on June 3 and will last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The associations of cities and local authorities of the world
have been lobbying strongly for the City Summit to recognize and
promote their rights and role in the fight against poverty,
ignorance, insecurity and environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the local officials, HABITAT Secretary General Wally
N'Dow said the success of the conference "is very important
about your mandate."
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting of local authorities finalized a draft
declaration, which will be presented to HABITAT participants
on June 4.
</P>
<P>
The declaration asks the states to recognize the driving role
of cities and local authorities in sustainable development and to
implement policies toward mobilizing more resources for urban
development.
</P>
<P>
Local officials also called for worldwide cooperation between
local authorities at national, regional and international level.
</P>
<P>
Dai Zhiguo, the Vice Mayor of southern Chinese city of
Guangzhou, said such a meeting was a good opportunity to exchange
views on problems such as population explosion, traffics and
environment.
</P>
<P>
"We can learn from each other the experiences on the topics to
avoid detours," said Dai.
</P>
<P>
The governor of Tokyo, Yukio Aoshima, called at the gathering
for greater participation by local residents.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Southern Africa would remain
poor until it organised itself to attract foreign investment to
convert its resources into wealth and economic growth, Mineral
and Energy Affairs Minister Pik Botha said today.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his last speech to the national assembly in Cape
Town before retiring at the end of June, Botha said President
Nelson Mandela's message on privatisation during his state visit
to germany last week had already had an effect on potential
investors.
</P>
<P>
''We need a new beginning in southern Africa, a new
commitment. We will need money and skills from elsewhere. But we
can offer business and trade and profits in return,'' said the
outgoing minister.
</P>
<P>
In achieving this, southern Africa had to accept and implement
the fundamental requirements for industrial growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
These included:
</P>
<P>
-- a stable political climate with reduced corruption and

<HEADLINE> UK, Ireland Urge IRA Again to Restore Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
described the results of the Northern Ireland elections this
evening as "a great boost for the peace process" in the
conflict-torn province.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued from Downing Street, Major also urged the
Irish Republican Army (IRA) to announce an unequivocal cease-fire
as a necessary condition for its political wing Sinn Fein to take
part in the planned all-party talks on the future of Northern
Ireland on June 10.
</P>
<P>
In the elections, Sinn Fein, as the fourth biggest party,
gained 17 seats in the coming forum and took 15 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Irish Prime Minister John Bruton shared Major's
position insisting that Sinn Fein should not take part in the
all-party talks if there is no new IRA cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Bruton said that he was looking forward to all-party talks and
wanted every party there, according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
But the Irish premier dismissed Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams'
claim that votes for his party gave it a mandate to sit at the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
However, Adams called again for a place at the coming all-party
talks.
</P>
<P>
He argued that if Major ignored the election results, there
would be no peace settlement of the conflict in Northern Ireland,
according to a BBC TV report.
</P>
<P>
"If we are not involved, they won't have proper peace
negotiations," he claimed.
