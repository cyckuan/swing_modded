<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Turkey would begin the
next round of their talks on September 9 with the aim of bringing
about the greater involvement of the other ministries connected
with the issues up for discussion, Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after receiving the members of the Turkish delegation
which participated in bilateral talks in Athens on Thursday and
Friday, Papandreou said that both he and his Turkish counterpart,
Ismail Cem, described the climate of this week's talks in Ankara
and Athens as "good and constructive."
</P>
<P>
The process had reached the point it had was in itself an
achievement, he said, adding that the process would be a long one
and it was too early to make any assessment of the talks to date.

<P>
CAIRO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Four vehicles crashed on a Red Sea
highway on Saturday, leaving three people dead and 24 injured,
including 10 Dutch tourists, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred when a truck, a tourist bus, a mini van

<HEADLINE> Policeman, Suspected Militant Killed in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A policeman and a suspected Muslim
militant have been killed in southern Egypt during a gun battle in
the first such clash this year, the government said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The shoot-out took place early Friday in the village of Dairout
after security forces opened fire at a truck when it refused to
stop and sped through a checkpoint, injuring one occupant,
Interior Ministry security sources told the country's Middle East
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The others in the truck returned fire, killing one policeman
and injuring another, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The police forces "chased the criminals" and besieged them in a
nearby village and shot one of them dead, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources did not say whether there were other people in the
truck or if the injured man was caught.
</P>
<P>
Dairout is some 330 kilometers south of Cairo in Asyut
Governorate, once a hotbed of an armed insurgency by Islamic
militants who were attempting to oust Egypt's secular government
and replace it with a strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
gunmen in the truck were believed to belong to Al-Gamaa
Al-Islamiya, or Islamic Group, the country's most violent militant
group.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic rebellion has been largely crushed by the
government through tightened security measures across the country
and Friday's incident was the first since Al-Gamaa declared a
cease-fire in March. More than 1,200 people, mainly policemen and
militants, have been killed in the insurgency since 1992.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Two road accidents occurred in Iran
on Friday, killing a total of 20 and injuring another 26,
according to the Islamic News Agency Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Twelve people were killed and 22 injured when a bus run head-on
into a truck trailer in the vicinity of the town of Abadeh in the
southern Fars province.
</P>
<P>
Traffic experts determined the cause of accident, which took
place at 6:00 Friday morning, as veering of the trailer due to
sleepiness of the driver.
</P>
<P>
The trailer's driver was killed on the scene.
</P>
<P>
Another accident happened Friday afternoon when a passenger car
collided with a minibus on the road from northeastern city of
Mashhad to Sabzevar in the northeastern province of Khorasan,
leaving eight people dead and four others injured.
</P>
<P>
Local police blamed the accident, in which seven passengers of
the automobile were killed instantly, on the automobile driver's
negligence in turning too much to the left on the road.

<HEADLINE> Below 10 PC African Women in Decision-Making </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Pan-African Women Organization
said Saturday that less than 10 percent of women are currently in
senior positions at decision-making institutions in most of the
African countries.
</P>
<P>
Niepu Troare, executive secretary in charge of the
organization's education and training, revealed this here in the
Angolan capital when marking African Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
Even in sub-Sahara African countries, she said, the percentage
is merely a symbolic 13 percent. That's why the organization was
discontented about the state of African women.
</P>
<P>
Take the example of Tunis in north Africa, only 9.5 percent of
the 163 members of parliament are women. In her home country
Guinea, only 11 out of the total 125 MPs are women.
</P>
<P>
As an observer of the Organization of African Unity, the
Pan-African Organization will in the future commit itself to
helping African governments make and implement policies to improve
the social status of African women, said Troare.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as member of the United Nations Economic and Social
Council, her organization will lobby unremittingly for women's
participation in social development and try to influence the
council on the resolution of certain major issues.
</P>
<P>
She also suggested that all African countries set up special
ministerial institutions on women's affairs and policies.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Opens Fatah Meeting to Seek Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
chaired a meeting of the Fatah movement in Cairo Saturday in the
first step toward unifying Palestinian ranks ahead of the final
status talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in years that the meeting of the Fatah
central committee includes three top party officials who are
opposed to Arafat's peace deals with Israel. The Fatah movement,
led by Arafat, is the main faction of the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO).
</P>
<P>
By meeting them, Arafat apparently wants to get his own house
in order before beginning reconciliation talks with other PLO
factions opposed to the 1993 Oslo agreement that has formed the
basis of Arafat's off-and-on peacemaking with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The three Fatah officials, namely Director of the PLO Political
Department Farouk Qaddoumi, Fatah military leader Mohammed Jihad,
and Mohammed Ghoneim, in charge of the movement's organizations,
are barred by Israel from entering the Palestinian self-rule areas
and have not attended the previous Fatah meetings held in the Gaza
Strip since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Arafat called Saturday's meeting in Cairo to facilitate their
attendance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before the meeting started, Palestinian
Planning Minister Nabil Shaath termed the meeting "a good occasion
to meet" the members of the Fatah leadership who "have not
selected to go back home."
</P>
<P>
Shaath expressed hope that every Palestinian will return to the
Palestinian land.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is scheduled to meet on Sunday in Cairo with a
representative of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, a key hard-line faction of the PLO, based in Damascus,
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will meet with Nayef Hawatmeh, leader of the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, another Damascus-based
faction, again in Cairo, on August 7.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria
earlier in the day and held talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on Israel's proposals for changes in the last October's
Wye River Accord.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian cabinet has already rejected the Israeli
proposals to skip over parts of the accord, including one of two
Israeli troop pullbacks in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Wye accord stipulates three Israeli troop pullbacks from a
total of 13.1 percent of the West Bank, but it was suspended after
only being implemented the first of the three-phase withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll in Saudi Tent Fire Climbs to 44 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of a tent blaze
in eastern Saudi Arabia climbed to 44 on Saturday as two
fatally-wounded women died at a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
Earlier official Saudi statement said that the fire, which
broke out Wednesday in a tent during a wedding ceremony at
Al-Qudaih village in Qatif, killed 42 people and wounded over 130
others, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the number of those still in hospital dropped
to 109 after some discharges and deaths.
</P>
<P>
The bride who has been in intensive care at a local hospital
since Wednesday, will be transferred, along with three others in
critical condition, to a hospital in the capital of Riyadh, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Thirty bodies have already been buried, while 10 more are
still unidentified due to severe burns.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Health Minister Ussama Shabakshi said that King Fahd and
Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz had ordered that everything
possible to be done to treat the injured.
</P>
<P>
The Governor of the Eastern Province and King Fahd's son,
Prince Mohammad Ibn Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz, had offered over half
million U.S. dollars in compensation for the families that lost
relatives in Wednesday's tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The fire was reportedly caused by an air-conditioning unit
that exploded, sending the burning tent crash down on the wedding
party in the Saudi village.
</P>
<P>
People in the Gulf Arab states, including Saudi Arabia,
still retain the tradition of holding wedding parties in
temporarily-erected tents vulnerable to flames.

<HEADLINE> New Port to Be Constructed in S. Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government Friday
signed an agreement in principle on the construction of Dobela
Port along the Indian Ocean coast in the south.
</P>
<P>
The deal was signed here between the Public Corporation of
Mozambique's Ports and Railways and the Dobela Development
Corporation of Britain, the Mozambique News Agency reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The port is situated in Matutuine county of Maputo Province,
and about 70 kms away from capital Maputo.
</P>
<P>
The project has a total investment of 515 million U.S. dollars,
60 percent of which will come from the British company, while 40
percent come from the Public Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Jose Antunes, head of the Dobela Development Corporation, said
the new port will cut short the transport distance of ore export
from South Africa's Mpumalange mines by 1,000 kms. At present it
takes about 1,500 kms for the products from the mines to be
exported via Maputo Port to the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The Mpumalange mines produce mainly coal, magnetite and
phosphate. Once the products are exported through Dobela Port,
they will bring about an average 130 million dollars in profit to
Mozambique every year.
</P>
<P>
The new port will occupy 20,000 hectares in land. It is part
of the plan of establishing a special economic zone in the area.
The zone boasts of creating about 10,000 jobs in the first ten
years of its existence.

<HEADLINE> No Explanation Can Cover Up Aim of "Two-States"  (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The allegation in Koo's written speech concerning Lee Teng-hui'
s "special state-to-state relations" statement is weak because
this statement radically violates the "one China" principle and
changes the nature of relations across the Straits, the commentary
said.
</P>
<P>
Although Lee did not dare to openly amend the so-called Taiwan
"Constitution" and "Law" immediately, his attempt to split Taiwan
from the motherland is obvious in the "two-states" statement.
</P>
<P>
This destroys the "one China" principle, the basic of stable
development on relations across the Straits, the commentary
pointed out, saying that at the beginning of Lee's government, he
agreed with the "one China" policy. The Taiwan authorities in 1991
specifically defined its policy as one in which both the mainland
and Taiwan are Chinese territory, and a manual published in Taiwan
in 1994 on relations across the Straits insisted on the "one China
" policy, and opposed the ideas of "two Chinas" and "one China,
one Taiwan." According to the manual, relations across the Straits
is an internal issue.
</P>
<P>
Now Lee has failed to keep the faith, changing his words, and
this demonstrate his nature as a deep-rooted separatist, the
commentary noted.
</P>
<P>
Developing relations across the Straits and realizing peaceful
unity can only be based on the "one China" policy. Without this
policy, the interests of Taiwan compatriots and the Chinese nation
will be deeply hurt.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten year, every time relations across the Straits
became strained or retrogressed, this was a result of Lee's
malicious intent to destroy the "one China" policy. Facts show
that Lee is the biggest stumbling block in the development of
relations across the Straits and China's peaceful unification.
</P>
<P>
According to Koo's written speech, the purpose of Lee's "
special state-to-state relations" statement was to "advance the
level of dialogue" and "establish mechanisms for democracy and
peace." The commentary refuted this as a lie made by Lee to the
Chinese people and the world.
</P>
<P>
Sophism cannot help Lee cover his true nature as a separatist,
the commentary emphasized, noting that people concerned with the
development of relations across the Straits still remember that
Lee repeatedly and deliberately set obstacles in the course of
efforts to improve and develop relations across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
After the Taiwan authorities and SEF refused to conduct
political negotiations with ARATS or implement the common
understanding reached by ARATS and SEF last year, Lee Teng-hui
made his "two states" statement, thus damaging the basis for
dialogue and negotiations between the two sides, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The "two states" statement by Lee Teng-hui has brought about a
tense relationship between the two sides and jeopardized the peace
and stability of the Asian-Pacific Region, adding that he has been
deemed a "troublemaker" by the international community, the
commentary concluded.

LONDON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A leading member of Progressive
Unionist Party warned Saturday that the murder of a Belfast
taxidriver is proof that the IRA ceasefire is starting to unravel.
</P>
<P>
David Ervine, whose party has links with two of the main
loyalist paramilitary groups, the Ulster Volunteer Force and Red
Hand Commando, said loyalists believed the IRA's ceasefire was
beginning to "fray" following the murder of Charles Bennett in
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
"I think we are beginning to see things fraying at the edges.
That certainly is impressing on the minds of loyalism that the
Good Friday Agreement might not be the vehicle that delivers."
Ervine told Radio Ulster on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"And I think the more that sense of pessimism exists, the worse
things are going to get." he said.
</P>
<P>
Charles Bennett, 22, was found lying shot in the head behind a
social club in west Belfast on Friday, with a cloth over his face
and his hands tied behind his back. He had been missing for five
days.
</P>
<P>
Police had been searching for him all week after he was
reported missing last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Both the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and
unionists have blamed republicans for the murder. Police claimed
that the murder bore all the hallmarks of a paramilitary-style
execution.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban militia
Saturday captured Bagram, the only air base of the anti-Taliban
forces led by former defense minister Ahmad Shah Masood, reported
Pakistan Television Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The loss of Bagram, some 50 kilometers north of the capital
Kabul, will probably turn out to be a major blow to the Masood
forces, analysts here observed.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who control nearly 90 percent of Afghanistan,
launched a major offensive Wednesday against the opposition forces
to extend their rule to the rest of the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has been raging north of Kabul for three days as the
Taliban managed to seize Nejrab, one of the seven entries into the
Panjsher valley, the opposition forces stronghold, and made
progress towards Bagram.
</P>
<P>
The militia had captured some mountains surrounding Bagram
before they launched a successful attack from Bulemadak Saturday
afternoon, according to informed sources.

<HEADLINE> Bio-gas Plants Popular in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Bio-gas plants are gaining
popularity in Dhading district, central Nepal, as an alternative
source of energy for such purposes as cooking and lighting,
reported the official RSS news agency Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The farmers are finding the bio-gas plant useful for protecting
 forests and the environment as it is almost smokeless. Housewives
prefer bio-gas because it is easy to use and does not need to
bother much about maintenance.
</P>
<P>
Another benefit from bio-gas is that it ensures regular supply
of compost for manuring farmland, thereby making farmers
self-reliant, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 500,000 bio-gas plants are now installed across
Nepal and are popular with farmers.
</P>
<P>
More plants are to be installed in the Himalayan Kingdom with
loan investment of various enterprises and undertakings, RSS said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal is an agricultural country, where farmers account for 80
percent of its population of 22 million. So the development of
bio-gas plants is meaningful both in energy-saving and in
environmental protection.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Police Free Women Demonstrators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian police have
released all the women who participated Friday in an illegal
demonstration in capital Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Regional Police Commander Alfred Gewe told reporters here
Saturday that the women were set free hours after they were held
during the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration led to an unrest in which many people on the
street were wounded after rioters began to threw stones, bottles
and pieces of iron at the police.
</P>
<P>
To disperse rioters, policemen fired tear gases and used
pistols, dogs and horses.
</P>
<P>
Gewe said the released women confessed before the law enforcers
that fundamentalists told them to wear hijab, or Moslem headgear,
to make the event colorful and enhance the spirits of the
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
The women were seized along with 75 men who took part in the
riot in areas close to the Manyema Mosque in the downtown Kariakoo
area on Friday afternoon, after mid-day prayers.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Tanzanian Minister of Education and Culture Juma
Kapuya tabled a move before the National Assembly or parliament,
demanding the right for Moslem girls to wear hijab in schools and
when attending Friday prayers.
</P>
<P>
Kapuya, himself a Moslem, later withdrew the move amid concerns
of the majority of members of parliament, who claimed that
Tanzania is a secular country in which students in common schools
are supposed to wear school uniforms when attending classes.
</P>
<P>
Kapuya's change of position has caused wide protests from
Moslems and the riot was ensued.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Vice-President Omar Ali Juma urged people to maintain
peace and security in the country and guard against those who use
religious forums to fulfill their ill intentions.
</P>
<P>
Meeting sheiks and imams in Dar es Salaam, Juma said laid-down
procedures should be followed when people wish to present their
grievances to the government. He said Friday's demonstration was
not the best way.
</P>
<P>
"Since Tanzania has been identified with a haven of peace,
people in the country are proud of peace and tranquillity and we
regard this as the only wealth we possess," he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president expressed his concern over individuals who
are determined to disrupt the country's peace by inciting hatred.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent grievances presented by Moslems to the
government are being dealt with and some of them will be solved
immediately but others will take time.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the sheiks condemned Friday's demonstration
as a hooligan affair. They said Moslems should be engaged in
activities according to the Koran.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Moslem leaders asked the government to
form a coordination body so as to enable Moslems to channel their
grievances smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-President directed the Dar es Salaam Regional
Commander to determine who were accidentally rounded up in the
Friday demonstration and set the innocent free as soon as
possible.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Swift Vote On Patients' Rights Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday urged Congress to pass the Patients' bill of rights to
expand patients' right under managed health care plans before
Congress starts a long August recess.
</P>
<P>
"The American people sent us to Washington to get work done,
and Congress shouldn't go on summer vacation without voting on the
patient's bill of rights," Clinton said in his weekly radio
address.
</P>
<P>
"This bill should be debated and voted on this coming week,
before Congress adjourns for the summer. If that happens, I
believe the bill would pass." Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The call for patient's rights legislation has intensified in
recent years as Americans have become increasingly frustrated
with cost-conscious managed health care plans.
</P>
<P>
The Senate has passed a bill without the support of the Clinton
administration and Democratic lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has threatened to veto the measure because it covers
only a limited segment of the population and gives far fewer
protections of patients' right than Democrats advocate.
</P>
<P>
The most controversial issue has been whether patients should
have the right to sue Health Managed Organization (HMOs), which
Democrats generally support and most Republicans oppose.
</P>
<P>
The House was expected to vote on a similar bill this week, but
action was derailed when some Republican lawmakers announced their
support for the Democratic version.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Calls for Regional Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa
Saturday called for regional economic integration to protect the
collective interests in the process of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Opening the 73rd Zambia agricultural and commercial show here,
Mkapa said his country "attaches great importance to regional
economic integration as a vehicle of our economic liberation. It
is also an important mechanism of protecting our collective
interests in the process of globalization."
</P>
<P>
Regional integration not only creates bigger markets for the
industries but also provides a more attractive economic space for
foreign investment, said Mkapa, who arrived here Friday for a
three-day visit to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"As we enter the next millennium, the world is undergoing
fundamental changes that have impact, both negatively and
positively, on the economies and development of our two countries,
and the whole of the African continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa urged African countries to fight against developments
that clearly are going to marginalize them, or make them net
losers in the evolving world trade regime.
</P>
<P>
He called on poor countries to demand collectively for better
terms and level playing field at the Ministerial Meeting of the
World Trade Organization to be held next November in Seattle, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"But, at best these will be temporary and should serve as
incentives for redress action by us. We must, therefore, seek to
work hard to reduce the negative impact of globalization on our
economies while maximizing the positive aspects by programed
resort to collective self-reliance and regional economic
integration," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Southern African Industrial Development Strategy is geared
to reduce dependence on imported manufactured products from
outside the region. It is also aimed at increasing intra-regional
trade from five percent to 12 percent of the total trade by the
year 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president suggested that Tanzania and Zambia should put in
place a legal and administrative framework to facilitate the
promotion of trade and economic ties.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa invited investors and entrepreneurs from Zambia to invest
in Tanzania, particularly in the field of textiles and garments,
mining, tourism, agriculture and agro-industry.
</P>
<P>
He called on developed countries to immediately reduce the debt
poor countries owe them and increase development assistance to the
poor states.
</P>
<P>
"Africa can, and must, rise again. Our hour is at hand," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have the natural resources. We have much better policies
and new democratic and visionary leadership in the majority of
African countries. We have our earnest and development aspiring
people."
</P>
<P>
"We can, and must aim higher and work harder toward the
realization of a better world, and a better life, for the Africans
of the new century," the Tanzanian president said.

<HEADLINE> Team Halti Wins Mild Seven Outdoor Quest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALI, China, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Team Halti of Finland won the
Mild Seven Outdoor Quest here on Sunday in Just 23 hours, taking
home the lion's share of the 200,000 U.S. dollars prize money.
</P>
<P>
"The course was much harder than those of last year's," said a
jubilant but exhausted Petri Forsman, who also was a member of the
winning squad in the 1998 race.
</P>
<P>
"And the competition was also much tougher. We had to go harder
than we ever thought possible." he added.
</P>
<P>
Team Eco-Internet finished second, 19 minutes behind Halti in
22:48:48. Team Red Bull-Buff from Spain was third in 23:20:53. All
the teams were forced overcome bad weather in early morning, but
were rewarded with brilliant blue skies and voluptuous white as
they crossed the finish line.
</P>
<P>
Team Mild Seven surprised the field by finishing fourth in the
day's race and climbed from ninth to seventh place overall with a
total time of 23:53:44.
</P>
<P>
The final-day race began with six-kilometer run through a
traditional Bai village at the base of the Gangshan mountains. The
start staggered, so Halti's seven minute overall lead meant they
started exactly seven minutes ahead of the second place finishers,
the Eco-Internet.
</P>
<P>
Eco-Internet pulled even with Halti at the end of the day's
second stage, a 35-kilometer kayak on Lake Er-Hai. But confident
Halti never faltered ascending into the mountains for a two-hour
trail run, that saw athletes clip themselves up to ropes and then
rappel down a 10-meter cliff face the next minutes.
</P>
<P>
The last obstacle for the leading Halti to overcome was a two-
kilometer paddle in Chinese oar boats around Er-Hai before they
sprinted across the finish tape with all the teammates arms in
arms.
</P>
<P>
"The course today was incredibly tough, especially after these
athletes raced so hard for three days previous. Team Halti is to
be commended for such a marvelous performance," race Executive
Director Nick Freyer said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Women's Water Polo Team Celebrate Historic Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A proud Canadian women's
water polo team are still celebrating their Friday's historic 8-6
victory over the United States in the Pan American Games.
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't be better, " beamed Team Canada's Ann Dow." This
medal makes me forget about all the hours we put into this game. I
am so happy and proud."
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in the Pan Am history that women's water
polo medals were awarded.
</P>
<P>
"It means women's water polo is up and running," said Marie
Claude Deslieres. "We now own the first Pan Am Games gold medal
for women's water polo."
</P>
<P>
The game was not as close as the score indicated. Canada's
tenacious defence was in full gear, limiting the Americans to
perimeter shots, and when the ball did get through, Canadian
goalkeeper Josee Marsolais was usually there to stymie the attack.
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased with all our team," said coach Daniel
Berthelette who at the game's end jumped fully clothed into the
pool.
</P>
<P>
"We know the USA is a good team and we completely cut off their
counter attack."
</P>
<P>
USA coach Guy Baker was gracious in defeat.
</P>
<P>
"Canada controlled the game from the beginning," said Baker, "
We buried ourselves early and never recovered."
</P>
<P>
It was a golden moment for the undefeated Team Canada. "This is
a great day," said Sandra Lize. "My mother became a grandmother
for the first time today, and I got a gold medal for my first
nephew."
</P>
<P>
The victory celebration will be short-lived. The team returns
to the pool in Montreal in just three days to get ready for a
tournament in Italy in two weeks.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait renewed Sunday its
condemnation of Iraq for its 1990 invasion, holding Baghdad
responsible for the lost Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait is holding the Iraqi regime responsible for the
deteriorating condition and depression among Arab peoples since
the (invasion) disaster," said Deputy Prime Minister and Minister
of State for Cabinet Affairs Mohammad Dheifallah Sharar after the
cabinet's weekly session.
</P>
<P>
Sharar, who is also minister of state for national assembly
affairs, made the remarks on the eve of the ninth anniversary of
the Iraqi invasion, which will be observed Monday.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990 and were ejected
by a U.S.-led coalition force after a seven-month occupation of
the small Gulf emirate.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi occupation "violates all Islamic principles and
international conventions," Sharar was quoted by the Kuwait News
Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti minister also called for an immediate release of
the Kuwaitis and third country's nationals allegedly held in Iraqi
jails. Over 600 Kuwaitis were reported being held in Iraqi
prisons.

MANILA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A total of 174 people were
rescued, but dozens are still missing after a passenger boat
caught fire off Cebu Island in the Central Philippines Saturday,
the Coast Guard said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report by the Coast Guard said that three people
were killed and 162 were missing in the sea disaster.
</P>
<P>
But the latest report from Cebu said that 174 passengers and
crew members have been rescued so far by fishermen, but 64 are
still missing.
</P>
<P>
Fire broke out hours after the ferry M.V. Rosalia II pulled out
of Cebu early Saturday on a trip to Masbate Island. Passengers
abandoned the vessel after seeing smoke out of the engine room.
</P>
<P>
M.V. Rosalia II was carrying 210 passengers and 28 crew when it
left for Masbate.
</P>
<P>
Rescue work is still going on. Ferries are a popular form of
transport in the Philippines, a country of more than 7,000
islands.

<HEADLINE> Blair Resolves to End N.Ireland Drumcree Impasse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
is intensifying his efforts to end the Drumcree marching in
Northern Ireland, the Downing Street confirmed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Blair's chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, will attend talks next
week aimed at ending an impasse over the annual Drumcree parade
that has become a flashpoint for Northern Ireland tensions, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Powell will return to Belfast, the capital city of the northern
province, and have talks with both sides in the dispute over
whether Protestants should be allowed to parade through a Catholic
enclave each July to mark a centuries-old battlefield victory.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister is determined to find an accommodation.
These talks reflect that," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The parade passed off last month with only minor incidents
after authorities blocked off the controversial part of the
marchers' route. But Protestant Orangemen have continued protests
in the area.
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting to renew contacts next week with the parties
involved in Drumcree. Powell will be involved in that," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to say exactly who Powell would meet or where
the talks would take place.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we are renewing contacts is a reflection of the
prime minister's determination to reach accommodation over this
issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Drumcree issue raised tensions at talks last month chaired
by Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and aimed at
brokering a deal over guerrilla disarmament in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Although both Blair and Ahern devoted their efforts, they were
still unable to break the deadlock over disarmament, and
Protestant Unionists pulled out of a power-sharing executive with
Catholics aimed at bringing an end to decades of sectarian
conflict in Northern ireland.

<HEADLINE> One Congolese Rebel Faction Signs Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 1 (Xinhua) --The rebel Movement for the
Liberation for Congo (MLC) fighting to topple President Laurent
Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) signed here
Sunday the cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Pierre Bemba, who gave a signature on the document, was
praised as a "tremendously responsible" leader by Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who mediated the cease-fire agreement, said that it is
a right step toward resolving the conflict in DRC.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed on July 10 by all the six warring
countries involved in the 11-month war in the central African
country. But the rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy (CRD) and the
MLC did not sign because of the disagreement within CRD over who
would on behalf of the group.
</P>
<P>
CRD split into two factions in May this year -- one led by
Emile Illunga and the other by Ernest Wamba Dia Wamba.
</P>
<P>
After signing the agreement Bemba told the press that by
signing the agreement his MLC wants to give peace a chance in his
country. "The region needs a real peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
He condemned President Kabila for unfulfilling his promise to
pursue democratization in his country and construct his country.
</P>
<P>
Representative of the Ugandan President, Kahinda Otafiire, who
 attended Sunday's signing ceremony, denied his country's
involvement in the wrangle within CRD.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want anybody to be left out," said Otafiire, adding
that his country's stance is that everybody should sign the
cease-fire agreement if he wants to bring peace in DRC.
</P>
<P>
Uganda backs both the faction led by Wamba and MLC while Rwanda
 backs the one led by Emile Illunga.

ISLAMABAD, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban militia
Sunday continued their northward march and captured Charikar,
capital of Parwan province, some 60 kilometers north of Kabul,
Afghan sources told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the fighters of the militia captured Charikar
and pushed further northwards to enter Jabalus Siraj at 3 p.m.

At least 75 rockets launched from the opposition positions have

<P>
The advances of the student militia have confined the
opposition fighters to mountains. The Taliban are now likely to
attempt to capture Panjsher via Gulbahar, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
The Panjsher Valley has always been a stronghold of Masood and
even the former Soviets failed to capture it during the Afghan war
in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Controlling nearly 90 percent of the country, the Taliban last
Wednesday launched a major offensive in a bid to wipe out the
opposition and extend their rule to the northeast provinces held
by the Masood forces with heavy fortifications.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Commentary on Political Nature of Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency, China's
largest official news organization, today published a commentary
titled, "Getting a Thorough Grasp of the Political Nature of Falun
Gong".
</P>
<P>
Learning the political nature of Falun Gong, an illegal
organization under the control of Li Hongzhi, will help people
understand that the fight against Falun Gong cult is a serious
ideological and political struggle, according to the commentary.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong is a political force opposed to the Chinese
Communist Party and the central government. It preaches idealism,
theism and feudal superstition. It established stations at all
levels to form a highly-organized illegal system, and even
penetrated some important Party and government organizations, the
commentary says.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi and Falun Gong under his control instigated its
practitioners to besiege and attack press organizations and Party
and government institutions and organized large-scale illegal
gatherings to put pressure on the Party and government, and even
gathered more than 10,000 Falun Gong practitioners around the
Zhongnanhai compound on April 25, where the headquarters of the
Party and government organizations are located. These facts show
the political nature of Falun Gong, which is unconstitutional,
anti-government and anti-society.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong cult tried to persuade people to give up their
ideals and pursuits, and eschew social practice, which militates
against the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics,
the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
A clear line of demarcation needs to be drawn between the
ordinary practitioners and the core organizers and propagandists
of Falun Gong; between ordinary core members and the small number
of behind-the-scenes plotters and organizers who harbor political
intentions; between those people who have realized their mistakes
and wish to correct them, and the diehards; and between those who
did wrong before the central authorities' ban, and those who did
so afterwards, the commentary points out.
</P>
<P>
The majority of Falun Gong practitioners who have broken away
from the illegal organizations should be reunited with society and
educated, the commentary says.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Term Inter-Faction Dialog Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
opened a dialog here on Sunday with a faction opposed to the Oslo
Accord, an effort to unite Palestinian ranks ahead of the final
status talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's meeting with representatives of the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) was the first of its kind since
the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the first peace
accord with Israel in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The talks broke for lunch after three hours. Participants of
the two sides expressed satisfaction with the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the break, Nabil Shaath, the
Palestinian planning minister and a member of Arafat's delegation,
described the session as a success.
</P>
<P>
"Today we have laid the cornerstone for a successful national
dialog," Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
He said Arafat's Fatah party, the only major PLO faction to
support the Oslo accords, and the PFLP have agreed to "extend the
dialog to include other Palestinian groups and make it
comprehensive."
</P>
<P>
Head of the PFLP delegation, Abu Ali Moustafa, who is also the
party's deputy leader, told reporters that "we are now on the
right path," referring to the meeting with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
While reiterating the PFLP's opposition to the 1993 agreement,
Moustafa termed the Oslo accords as "a thing of the past." "We are
in front of a political reality and we are keen to look to the
future," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for the reinvigoration of the PLO regardless of the
differences of the Palestinian factions.
</P>
<P>
The Fatah movement, the most powerful faction in the PLO, hopes
that its renewed links with the PFLP will encourage other
anti-Oslo factions to return to the Palestinian mainstream.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is scheduled to meet Nayef Hawatmeh, leader of the
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), in Cairo
on August 7.
</P>
<P>
The DFLP and PFLP are two of the eight Damascus-based
Palestinian factions opposed to the Oslo peace accords.

BAGHDAD, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Transport and
Communications Minister Ahmed Murtadha Ahmed said Sunday that the
communication stations which were repeatedly attacked by
U.S.-British warplanes are civil stations and not military ones as
the Americans claimed.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed said the civil stations that provide services to Iraqis
were severely damaged and some of the staff were killed or injured
in the strikes, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that the repeated air strikes since last December led
to the break of communications between some Iraqi provinces.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday and Friday, U.S. and British warplanes attacked
some civil and service installations in northern and southern
no-fly zones in Iraq, killing 17 civilians and injuring dozens of
others, said INA.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. said its warplanes attacked military targets in the
no-fly zones, not civil installations as Iraqi claimed.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were set up by the U.S.-led western allies
following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched airstrikes against Iraq
last December, their warplanes have been regularly attacking Iraqi
military and civilian targets, causing severe civilian casualties
and property damage.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Defense Ministry announced Friday that U.S. warplanes
had attacked Iraqi targets 108 times so far this year.

<HEADLINE> Head of China's Buddhist Association Refutes Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Zhao Puchu, head of the Buddhist
Association of China, said here today that he firmly supports the
decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
to crack down on the illegal Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Zhao, also vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said in a
hospital that it is highly necessary for the party to get rid of
this "big disaster" for the people and remove this "big cancer"
for the society.
</P>
<P>
He said that Falun Gong deceives its followers by misusing
Buddhist terminology.
</P>
<P>
He said that the publications of his association and some other
Buddhist magazines in other parts of the country have criticized
Falun Gong's fallacies in the past few years, and the articles
were attacked by Falun Gong devotees, headed by Li Hongzhi, and
some other illegal organizations.
</P>
<P>
During a symposium held by the association last year, the
participants said Falun Gong runs counter to Buddhism and the
Communist Party of China's policy of freedom of religious belief.
</P>
<P>
Zhao stressed the importance of promoting cultural and ethical
progress in the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
He urged the strengthening of science education and improvement
of the quality of all the people.
</P>
<P>
He called on religious circles to pay attention to self-
building and unite with people from other walks of life, in an
effort to help maintain social stability and soundly push forward
the socialist cause into next century.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Russian FMs Discuss Mideast Peace March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Sunday consulted over the telephone with his Russian
counterpart Igor Ivanov the latest developments in the Mideast
peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone conversations proposed by Ivanov, the two
ministers reviewed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Tuesday and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat on Saturday in Egypt's Mediterranean port of
Alexandria on the implementation of the Wye accord, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Israeli former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
signed the Wye accord last October in Washington, under which
Israel should have pulled out its troops from another 13.1 percent
of the West Bank by the end of last January. But Netanyahu
suspended the accord in December only after the finish of the
first of the three-phase withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Barak has proposed to combine the third troops pullout with the
final status talks that should have started by May 1996. Arafat
has rejected the idea and insisted on a quick implementation.
</P>
<P>
The two officials also dealt with Barak's visit to Russia on
Sunday, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa expressed hope that Russia would continue to play an
active role in the Mideast peace process. For his part, Ivanov
confirmed that Russia remained committed to supporting a
constructive dialog with all parties in the region.
</P>
<P>
Russia, along with the U.S., is a sponsor of the Arab-Israeli
peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Shandong to Use Overseas Funds for Higher Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province is
to set up a dozen institutions of higher learning with overseas
funds over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The deputy governor of the province, Shao Guifang, said that
overseas enterprises and individuals are encouraged to fund these
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors who establish or expand universities and
colleges in the province will enjoy a series of preferential
policies, such as free use of land and low-interest loans, Shao
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Shao, her province has decided to raise the total
number of private universities and colleges to 120 by the year
2005, from the existing 105, as part of its efforts to ease the
shortage of institutions of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
Only one third of some 300,000 high school graduates in
Shandong are able to enter universities each year.
</P>
<P>
The province has taken steps in recent years to step up the
development of higher education, such as by allowing individuals
to invest in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, China is giving top priority to education by
pursuing the policy of reform and opening-up and vigorously
implementing the strategies of revitalizing China through science
and education, Shao noted.

<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Today's Liberation Army Daily
front-paged an editorial titled, "We are a Force that Can Never be
Defeated", to mark today's 72nd founding anniversary of the People
's Liberation Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
The editorial pointed out that the PLA, under the absolute
leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and equipped with
scientific theories, is a strong pillar of the people's democratic
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stressed that the history of the past 72 years
shows that the PLA is a steel "Great Wall" defending the
motherland, and is an invincible force.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that the 72nd founding anniversary of the
PLA comes at a momentous period for the country's reform and army
building.
</P>
<P>
The invasion of Kosovo sounded a warning that peace does not
yet prevail in all parts of the world, and the threat of war is
still present.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the editorial said, Lee Teng-hui's recent
remarks draw attention to the machinations of the splittist forces
in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the PLA has an arduous task to maintain social
stability at a time when people of all walks of life are refuting
the sinister claims of the Falun Gong cult, an illegal
organization, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stressed that the PLA will continue to be led by
the army-building theories of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping,
listing political education as the top priority while reinforcing
the armed forces with science and technology.

after nearly seven hours of play, only 11 of the 36 scheduled
games had ended in a draw.
</P>
<P>
Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, president of the sponsoring Federation
Internationale des Echecs, made the ceremonial first move for

Karpov and former FIDE champion Garry Kasparov, who claims to
be the current world champion, refused to play because of disputes
with the federation. Viswanathan Anand of India was unable to
attend because of other commitments.

<HEADLINE> Allied Signal Co. Confident of Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The chairman of the board of
directors of Allied Signal (China) Investment Co., Francis Yuen,
said China enjoys the company's confidence as an important place
for marketing and development.
</P>
<P>
Allied Signal Co. of the U.S. is one of the 30 companies which
comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Index. The American magazine
Fortune has twice chosen the company as the best aviation industry
company in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
"We are confident about the Asia-Pacific region, despite the
impact of the Asian economic crisis," Yuen said here recently. "
China has seen its economy boom in recent years, which is
important to us. We are seeking collaborators inside China to
build a steady basis for future development by combining our
specialties with China's advantages."
</P>
<P>
He added that he hoped that China would continue to adopt
stable policies, and never stop developing. He said that he
believed that after overcoming the difficulties cropping up in the
process of the ongoing reforms, China will resume stable
development in 2003, when even more foreign investment is expected
to pour into the country.
</P>
<P>
Allied Signal Co. entered China in 1994, with only 20 staff;
now it has 13 branch companies in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Suzhou and
Nanjing on a solely-owned and cooperative basis. And the number of
staff has increased to more than 1,000, while the investment has
topped 300 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Yuen said that the company will focus on the engineering,
electrical and chemicals sectors in the near future.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the company has offered scholarships to some
famous Chinese universities in order to foster more talented
people.

<HEADLINE> German Businessman Imprisoned Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- German businessman Helmut Hofer
who had been released on bail following charges of having illegal
relations with an Iranian Muslim woman, was imprisoned again on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was sent to the Iranian famous Evin prison in Tehran
because of his contacts with "certain suspicious foreign
elements" and possibility of his escape from the country, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Saeed Nobari, an official from the Tehran's justice department
said that the Iranian security forces had reported to the court on
Hofer's relationship with certain suspicious foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Following receiving the report and conducting necessary
investigations, the branch No. 1406 of Tehran public court issued
an arrest warrant for Hofer in order to prevent him from fleeing
the country, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was arrested in September, 1997, at Tehran international
airport upon his arrival from Germany with an Iranian woman who
was waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced to death by a local court in Tehran in
January, 1998. According to relevant Iranian laws, non-Muslim men
are forbidden to have any sexual relations with Muslim women.
</P>
<P>
Hofer appealed the court ruling by claiming that he has
converted to Islam before meeting the Iranian woman.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Supreme Court in December turned down the sentence
on Hofer early this year and returned the case to local court for
retrial.
</P>
<P>
The German businessman was released on bail from prison in
April, hours after the German special envoy and Chancellery
Minister Bodo Hombach arrived in Iran to discuss Hofer's case and
bilateral relations with Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder last November appointed
Hombach as his special envoy in charge of Hofer's case and Bonn
has repeatedly called on Tehran to set Hofer free.
</P>
<P>
Germany has been the biggest trade partner of Iran, but the
relations between the two countries have been strained since
April, 1997 after a Berlin court accused Iranian leaders of
sponsoring terrorist assassinations against Iranian dissidents in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The death sentence against the German businessman Hofer
blocked a rapprochement between Tehran and Bonn.

biological weapons, asserting that the army has no knowledge about
such weapons.
</P>
<P>
General Mohamed Osman Yassin, spokesman of the Sudanese Armed
Forces, said western media's reports on the use of such weapons by
the Sudanese Army are "absolutely false and full of fabrications,"
Sunday's Sudanese daily "Al Rai Al Am" reported.
</P>
<P>
Yassin predicted that circulation of such reports are a prelude
to military action against the Sudan, adding the Sudanese Armed
Forces are alerted to all possibilities.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the huge military concentrations by Uganda
along the Sudanese borders are still in place and that the
Sudanese Armed Forces are carefully observing such movements.
</P>
<P>
Yassin announced that the Sudanese forces promptly interfered
and restored situation to normal in the Unity State which was
the scene of bloody conflicts between the forces of Rayak Mashar,
Chairman of the Coordination Council of the Southern Sudanese
States, and the forces of Faolino Matib, the pro-government
southern opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
Yassin said that the two parties were urged to get together to
reach a final settlement, asserting that the Sudanese Army is in
control of the situation and that petroleum-rich areas are
absolutely secure.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman accused certain organizations operating in relief
activities of providing the Garang-led popular army, the
government's principal opposition faction, with arms, military
equipment.

<HEADLINE> 2,000-Year-Old Tomb Discovered in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A large ancient tomb dating back
to the Warring State Period (475 B.C.- 221 B.C.) was found
recently in the southeast portion of northern China's Shanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
The tomb is 7.3 meters long, 6.8 meters wide and 12 meters deep.
A large quantity of relics were in the tomb, including bronzeware,
ancient weapons, jade articles, musical instruments, pottery,
lacquerware, and other rare artifacts.
</P>
<P>
Local archeologist said a set of nine pieces of bronzeware
indicates that the tomb's occupant must have been of high position
in the ancient State. These nine items are thought to have been
worn specially by royalty in the Warring States Period.
</P>
<P>
Archeologist also said this discovery will provide valuable
material for the study of the three ancient states of Han, Zhao,
and Wei.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Meets With Palestinian Faction Representative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
met here on Sunday with a representative of a faction opposed to
the 1993 Oslo peace accord in a bid to unite Palestinian ranks
ahead of the final status talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's meeting with Abu Ali Moustafa, the No. 2 of the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), was the
first since the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) led by
Arafat signed the first peace accord with Israel in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before the meeting, Moustafa, leading a
six-man PFLP delegation, said his team has come with the hope that
a consensus may be reached to realize "even the minimum of the
Palestinian rights."
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that PFLP leader George Habash refuses to meet
with Arafat until the latter admits that the revocation of
the Palestine National Charter is a mistake.
</P>
<P>
In November, the Palestinians formally revoked parts of the
charter that called for the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Habash's demand is "not an obstacle on the
road to dialog. It is not a precondition."
</P>
<P>
Moustafa reiterated PFLP's opposition to the Oslo agreement,
but said the group has now viewed it as "a political reality."
</P>
<P>
Nabil Shaath, Palestinian planning minister and member of the
central committee of the Fatah movement, told reporters that the
Palestinian mainstream welcomes the talks with the PFLP.
</P>
<P>
Shaath said the Palestinians are close to opening the
negotiations for a final peace deal with Israel, a step which he
said needs support of all Palestinian groups.
</P>
<P>
Fatah, also led by Arafat, is PLO's most powerful movement,
which is the only major force in favor of the Palestinian-Israeli
peace deals.
</P>
<P>
Arafat met the PFLP delegation only hours after he chaired a
five-hour meeting of Fatah's central committee that included a
rare attendance by three of the committee's members opposed to the
Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
The three members, namely PLO Foreign Minister in-exile Farouk
Kaddoumi, Fatah military leader Mohammed Jihad, and Mohammed
Ghoneim, in charge of the movement's organization, are barred by
Israel from entering the Palestinian self-rule areas, where the
central committee meetings are normally held.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the Fatah meeting, Faisal Husseini, an aide of
Arafat, said the committee discussed efforts to seek a national
reconciliation with the rest Palestinian groups.
</P>
<P>
Arafat hopes to hold reconciliation talks with other radical
factions. He is scheduled to meet Nayef Hawatmeh, leader of the
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), in Cairo
on August 7.
</P>
<P>
The DFLP and PFLP are two of the eight Syrian-based Palestinian
factions opposed to the Oslo accord.

<HEADLINE> Investment Called For in Saudi Phosphoric Acid Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Engineering Department of the
Saudi Foundation for Consultative Services on Saturday called for
investment in the phosphoric acid industry in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Opportunities for such investment are available as soon as the
Jalamid phosphate project is implemented, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is at present importing 800 million rials (213
million U.S. dollars) worth of phosphoric acid annually for the
production of compound fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
The Engineering Department in a recent study estimated raw
phosphate resources in Hazm Jalamid, northern Saudi Arabia, at 213
million tons.
</P>
<P>
The local Iqtissadiya newspaper quoted an official of the
department as saying that 2.9 million tons of phosphoric acid
could be produced annually upon the completion of the Jalamid
project.

<HEADLINE> Fishing Moratorium in South China Sea Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIHAI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A two-month fishing moratorium
imposed in the South China Sea, the first of its kind in that
region, came to an end today.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen held traditional lion and dragon dances in this
coastal city in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region from midnight
yesterday to celebrate the lifting of the ban. Then, some 1,700
fishing boats were launched today. They will return in about one
week.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17,095 fishing boats from Guangdong and Hainan
provinces, as well as Guangxi, were affected by the fishing ban,
designed to protect local fish resources, according to the Bureau
of Fisheries Management and the South China Sea Fishing Port
Administration.
</P>
<P>
During the moratorium, only seven boats were caught defying the
ban, which was much better than expected. A fisherman told Xinhua
that most of his fellows supported the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
"Fish stocks are shrinking, and so we have had to go further
and further out to sea to look for fish," he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 90,000 fishing boats were affected by this year's
moratorium, imposed on the country's Yellow, Bohai, and East and
South China sea areas. The action is expected to help control the
country's marine output at last year's level of 14.96 million tons,
according to Li Jianhua, deputy director of the Bureau of
Fisheries of the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is planning to introduce a fishing quota
system that is used in developed countries to sustain its fish
resources.

<HEADLINE> Mali Troop Starts Leaving S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Mali started withdrawing its
troops in the West Africa Peace Keeping Force (ECOMOG) from Sierra
Leone, according to reports reaching here from Freetown Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-Colonel Chris Olukolade, spokesman for the
Nigerian-led ECOMOG force, said Saturday in Freetown that
500-strong Malian contingent had received order to withdraw from
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A senior presidential aide of Sierra Leone's President Tejan
Kabbah Saturday commented that the Malian withdrawal plan had
taken his government by surprise. "But we still appreciate what
they have done for us. "
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal follows a peace deal signed in Togo on July 7 by
Sierra Leone President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and rebel leader Foday
Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
Malian troop's pullout was believed to be linked with lack of
funding and the domestic pressure after a recent S. Leone rebel's
attack on Malian troops in the town of Port Loko. ECOMOG sources
said that up to 10 Malian soldiers were killed in the attack and
up to 10 captured.
</P>
<P>
Malian troops arrived in Sierra Leone in February to reinforce
the Nigeria-dominant ECOMOG force after rebels came close to
taking Freetown in January.
</P>
<P>
An ECOMOG commander in Freetown said that a phased withdrawal
of all the ECOMOG force was planned from August 26, but "We have
received no instructions on that from the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) secretariat."
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS set up ECOMOG to end the civil war in neighboring
Liberia, and in 1997 the troop's mandate was expanded to help
defense Sierra Leone's elected government from the rebels'
assaults.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the 14000-strong ECOMOG troops are Nigerian, with
about 2,000 Guineans and several hundred Ghanaians.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Senate President Alleges Plot to Bring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Senate President Chief
Evan Enwerem said that some unspecified persons had embarked on a
campaign to bring him down and to ridicule his high office.
</P>
<P>
At a reception held by the governments of the nine eastern
states Saturday in his honor in Owerri, Imo State, he noted "there
is a planned massive design to bring me down. It is all blackmail
and it is not true."
</P>
<P>
The Senate president said that security operatives had been
alerted and had embarked on intensive investigation to bring the
perpetrators to book, according to a Sunday Times report.
</P>
<P>
He told Nigerians that he was credible with unblemished records
to lead the Senate, adding "be rest assured that it is all
blackmail to bring me down".
</P>
<P>
Enwerem's alarm came a few days after the disgraced former
Speaker of the House of Representatives, Alhaji Ibrahim Buhari,
was convicted of forgery and perjury charges by an Abuja Chief
Magistrate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Power and Steel Minister Chief Bola Ige said
Saturday in Ibadan, capital of Ogun State, that the opposition
Alliance for Democracy would do battle with any nationality who is
opposed to the cleansing exercise currently being embarked upon by
President Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that there were indications that those
opposed to his positive changes were now going about like wounded
lions, adding that they want to reverse the trend of the positive
things.

CAIRO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are brief economic
news from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- The new King of Morocco Mohamed VI has proclaimed that
his Kingdom will pursue the policies of economic liberalism,
market economy, political pluralism and decentralisation, and will
establish a state based on rights and law, while, devoting greater
 attention to the social dimensions.
</P>
<P>
According to Sunday's Arab daily "Al Hayat", King Mohamed VI,
in his first speech from the throne, on Friday evening said that
he will be personally concerned about the eradication of poverty,
promotion of social solidarity program, improvement of education,
dealing with the problem of unemployment among youths, and caring
for the Moroccan community abroad and helping them overcome
whatever obstacles facing them.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- An economic report has called for reconsideration
of norms and laws that govern trade exchanges between the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states and other Arab states, with the
aim to facilitating the quick movement of commodities, alleviation
of restrictions on transport measures and cost among Arab states
in future.
</P>
<P>
Today's Egyptian daily "Alam Al Yom" reports that geographic
distribution of last year's trade of the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) has revealed that the European Union, USA and Japan have had
the biggest share in trade. At the same time, the report added,
Asian countries particularly China are assuming mounting
importance with regard to trade. As for the share of the Arab
states and the GCC states in the UAE foreign trade over the past
five years, it remained static.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi Airways has announced a 25 per cent reduction on
its regular fare flights from Jedda to Cairo and Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
The local "Iqtissadiya" economic newspaper quoted well-informed
sources as saying that the Saudi Airlines reduced prices of its
Jedda-Cairo-Jedda flights to correspond with the reduction of
Egypt Air prices from July 15 to August 15 during the annual
Egyptian tourism and shopping fair.
</P>

shifting of many clients to Egypt Air flights, pointing out that

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Border Trade Picking Up Steam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Trucks loaded with timber,
chemical raw materials, steel, clothing, fruits and vegetables are
busily running back and forth via Suifenhe, the biggest border
crossing in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the local port-of-entry administration committee
said that the total volume of transported cargo in the first half
of this year was 980,000 tons, an increase of 14.9 percent over
the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guangheng, deputy head of the Heilongjiang Border Trade
Bureau, said that the province's trade volume with Russia in the
first six months was 695.4 million U.S. dollars-worth, or a 24.68
percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The overall Sino-Russian trade volume in the first five months
of this year topped 2.2 billion U.S. dollars-worth, 0.7 percent up,
of which exports accounted for 430 million U.S. dollars-worth, and
imports were 1.82 billion U.S. dollars-worth, according to the
latest statistics from the General Administration of Customs. Last
year, Russia ranked the eighth- largest among China's top ten
trade partners.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sino-Russian trade volume in 1998 was only 5.48
billion U.S. dollars-worth, or 10.5 percent down, due to the
impact of the Asian financial crisis and the devaluation of the
ruble.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Russian border trade, starting in the mid-1980s,
experienced a rapid growth at first, but later decreased by a
large margin due to financial turbulence in Russia. As a result,
barter trade developed into spot transactions in 1994. Now it has
entered a second phase, featuring rapid development and the
preponderance of paper pulp, timber, chemical raw materials and
non-ferrous metals, accounting for more than 70 percent, among
China's total imports from Russia. At the same time,over 90
percent of China's exports to Russia are textiles, clothing, food,
light industrial products and construction materials.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that there are now 606 enterprises in
Heilongjiang engaged in border trade, of which the annual trade
volume of 30 exceeds 20 million U.S. dollars-worth.
</P>
<P>
"This positive trend has made the two state governments
confident that Sino-Russian border trade will progress in a
positive way." said Zhang Jinhe, deputy mayor of Suifenhe city.

grumbled about for years.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old forward also has been an All-Star 11 times, has
two Olympic gold medals and ranks among the league's career
scoring leaders.
</P>
<P>
Malone played in 49 of 50 games last season, missing one due to
suspension. He averaged 23.8 points in 1999, his lowest since 1986-
87, his second year in the league. His rebounding average was down
to 9.4, lowest since his rookie year.
</P>
<P>
Malone led the Jazz to a 37-13 record last season, but it ended
on a bitter note when Utah was eliminated in the Western
Conference semifinals by the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
In the series-clinching loss, Malone finished with a career
playoff-low eight points on 3-of-16 shooting.

<HEADLINE> Defense Pact with US Opposed by Most Nigerians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Nigerian, a mainly government-dominant newspaper, said one
of its survey shows that most of the participants of the survey
believe that the proposed pact amount to a humiliation of the
Nigerian military and ungraceful endeavor to find favor with the
western powers.
</P>
<P>
The survey covers former governors, retired military, lecturers
and other members of the public, most of whom contend that the
fear of the Nigerian military which gave vent to the proposal was
not justifiable because the military was now ashamed of the
legacy it left behind after several decades of rule and that the
civil populace was no longer in the mood for another military
interregnum.
</P>
<P>
Coonel Madaki, a former governor, told the survey staff of the
paper that a defense pact could mean a short cut to political
tyranny.
</P>
<P>
However, those in support of the proposal said that Nigeria
would benefit from it if the country is to play effective
leadership on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
The proposed pact was submitted by some senators last month and
had been under debating in the county's top legislature. A high
ranking government official said Friday that the current
administration will not consider signing such a pact, according to
the country's newspapers published Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Exports 5.3 Billion Dollars in 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh exported goods worth 5.3
billion U.S. dollars during the 1998-99 fiscal year ending June 30
this year, Commerce and Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed said here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The figure registered a growth of 2.7 percent in value compared
with that of the previous year, and a shortfall of 5.4 percent for
the target of 5.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports stood at 5.16 billion dollars in fiscal
1997-98, 4.42 billion dollars in 1996-97 and 3.8 billion dollars
in 1995-96, the minister told reporters at the conference room of
the Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Despite global economic meltdown and nearly-three-month-long
devastating floods, the country's export performance in the last
fiscal was quite satisfactory in terms of growth and target, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the shortfall of 300 million dollars in the
target to global recession and financial losses inflicted by
floods hitting the country in 1998. "We could export only nine
months in the last fiscal due to devastating floods," he said.

<HEADLINE> Botswana's Death Penalty Hanging on Test Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A hearing in Botswana's High
 Court Monday -- to rule on whether two convicted killers will be
executed -- will have a lasting effect on the issue of capital
punishment in Botswana.
</P>
<P>
It will confirm or change forever the treatment and trials of
those charged with capital offences.
</P>
<P>
The men were granted an 11th-hour stay of execution in January,
when a court ruled that execution by hanging constituted cruel
punishment, and that all laws prescribing executions by hanging
are invalid, according to Sunday World newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Judges said a four-year delay in carrying out the sentence of
death passed on the men was itself cruel, unjust and
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Application for the stay was brought by Ditshwanelo, the
Botswana Center for Human Rights, with Brian Spilg as leading
counsel.
</P>
<P>
The two men have already won an amendment to prison rules to
allow them to hold confidential discussions with their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Attorney-General Phandu Skelemani has conceded that if some of
the allegations are proved, new trials could be ordered.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers argued that the evidence on which Gwara Brown
Motswetla, 28, and Thabologang Phetolo Maauwe, 30, were convicted
in 1995 for killing a farmer, whose ox they had allegedly stolen,
was largely circumstantial. It was alleged they burnt the farmers
body, but no body, only charred bones, were found.
</P>
<P>
The verdicts and sentences were upheld by the Court of Appeal
and appeals for clemency to the President of Botswana were
refused.

<HEADLINE> 2 Iraqis Convicted of Attempted Murder of Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Two Iraqi nationals were sentenced
to prison terms by a Jordanian court Saturday for attempting to
murder an Iraqi diplomat in Amman in January 1998, Jordan Times
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Qassem Mohammad, 24, was sentenced to 10 years in jail with
hard labor and his collaborator Jafar Numan, 28, was given a
7.5-year term for attempting to assassinate Iraqi Charge
D`affaires in Jordan Rahim Tahir in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The two men shot at Tahir near his house in Amman with an
unlicensed gun, but missed the target and were arrested two weeks
later.
</P>
<P>
The court said the two culprits were hired by Tahir's
mother-in-law, identified only as Houileh, who paid them 20
million Iraqi dinars (then almost 13,000 U.S. dollars) for the
murder.
</P>
<P>
Houileh, who was being tried in absentia, had claimed that
Tahir had an affair with another woman and was about to marry her.
</P>
<P>
The verdict by the court will be automatically reviewed by a
higher court within 30 days, Jordan Times said.

ISLAMABAD, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban have
consolidated the positions at the strategic Bagram air base which
they captured Saturday night from the opposition Northern Alliance
forces.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces captured the Bagram air base and the
surrounding heights Saturday night and now they are consolidating
the positions, Taliban chief representative to Islamabad
Saeed-ur-Rahman Haqqani told Xinhua Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Bagram air base is located in Parwan province, 50
kilometers northeast of capital Kabul. It is just outside the
Panjsher valley stronghold of opposition commander Ahmad Shah
Masood.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban fighters have also captured intersection outside
the Bagram air base. They launched attacks from Shakardara and
Guldara and entered Qarahbagh district before overrunning Bagram,
said reports reaching here from Kabul Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that about 200 people, including 17 Taliban
fighters, have been killed while a large number of others injured.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Robot Soccer Puts Chinese World Cup Dream in Sight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese men's national soccer
squad has tried six times and failed in as many bids for the World
Cup finals, and the 2002 premier event maybe still a long shot for
them after just four spots were allotted to Asia.
</P>
<P>
But Chinese scientists may help put China on the world soccer
map and the robots soccer will bring the Chinese fans closer to
the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
The Niuniu team, set up by the Shenyang-based Northeastern
University of China, has booked a finals ticket for the 16-team
fourth Robot Soccer World Cup, an annual event to be run from
August 8-4 in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Xu Xinhe, an official with the International Robot Soccer
Confederation executive committee, played down the prospect for
China for the robot soccer has just gained ground in the soccer-
crazy country.
</P>
<P>
"Compared to the United States and South Korea, we still have a
long way to go. We mainly want to enhance our experience as strive
for results as good as possible." said Xu.
</P>
<P>
"And we till want to make it a chance to promote the bid for
the 2001 World Cup by Shenyang." added Xu.
</P>
<P>
Every World Cup team involves three robots about 15 cms in the
diameter-roughly the size of a tea-cup -- playing on a pitch the
size of a table tennis table. An overhead camera monitors the game
and sends signals to the robots telling them how to move.
</P>
<P>
The RoboCup has attracted an increasingly large following since
it started in Nagoya, Japan in 1997 with 40 teams participating.
</P>
<P>
China has thought the robot soccer merely as a toy to develop
children's intelligence until after the Japan RoboCup when China
took it seriously and launched its research, five years behind the
world tide.
</P>
<P>
While Chinese experts painted a rosy picture, saying that China
is able to become a "robot soccer powerhouse" in the future..
</P>
<P>
"We have lagged well behind in hardware research but we still
have an upperhand in the software development. As long as the
hardware improves, China can gain a spot among the robot soccer
favourites." said Hong Bingrong, president of the Chinese Robot
Association (CRA).
</P>
<P>
Hong's prediction was not ungrounded as more than 30
institutions of higher learning in China have tried their hands in
developing soccer-playing robots and the country has worked out
its own hardware system.
</P>
<P>
China pushed the robot soccer drive by setting up the CRA early
in April and planned to stage the first national competition in
October.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Invite Private Sector to Build Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to encourage
investment in energy projects, Egypt plans to invite the private
sector to build two power stations, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is scheduled to open the bid early next year for the
contracts to build the power stations in the Red Sea town of
Safaga and Sharm el-Sheikh in southern Sinai, Minister of
Electricity and Energy Maher Abaza said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The contracts for building the two 650,000-kilowatts-per-hour
power stations will be issued under BOT (build-operate-transfer)
system, Abaza said.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, the investors are allowed to own and operate
a project for a period of time after constructing it. When the
operating period expires, the project should be transferred to the
Egyptian government.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Electricity Authority has done feasibility studies
for the two projects, which will be linked up to the national
unified power grid, the English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"The Safaga and Sharm el-Sheikh power stations are part of the
ministry's plan to build up to 15 private-run stations at a total
investment of 7.5 billion Egyptian pounds (2.21 billion U.S.
dollars)," Abaza said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed power stations will increase to six the number of
the private sector-run stations in Egypt, according to the
newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Major Chinese Tourist City Focusing on Marine Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Qingdao City, a major tourist
attraction in east China's Shandong Province, has set the goal of
becoming a center of marine industries.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao Mayor Wang Jiarui said that both domestic and overseas
investors are especially encouraged to help develop marine
resources using new and high technologies.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, Qingdao has listed the raising and
processing of marine aquatic products, island tourism,
shipbuilding, shipping, and production of pharmaceuticals and
chemicals as key development areas.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that his city boasts many advantages for creating a
marine economy.
</P>
<P>
The city is home to 25 marine research institutes, which employ
more than 5,000 professionals, or 40 percent of the country's
total marine research personnel.
</P>
<P>
The Qingdao Port has become the third largest port of the
country, with an annual handling capacity of 100 million tons of
cargo.
</P>
<P>
This year, the city opened the Qingdao Marine Technology Trade
Center, which focuses on the trading of marine development
technologies, exchange of information concerning marine industries,
and technical services.
</P>
<P>
Faced by the problems of a growing population and a shortage of
onshore resources, China has stepped up efforts to develop its sea
areas. Many coastal provinces, such as Shandong, Zhejiang, Fujian
and Guangdong, are working to turn their marine economy into a
major economic growth area in the years to come.

ABU DHABI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Untied Arab Emirates (UAE)
Sunday called on Iraq to comply with the relevant United Nations
resolutions in exchange for the lifting of sanctions imposed on it
following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by the official Al Ittihad newspaper in an

Kuwait on August 2, 1990.

Neither conflicts nor war of words would do the Iraqi people
any good, said the editorial.

<P>
The paper said the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was a "big mistake"
for which both the Kuwaiti and Iraqi people paid dearly.
</P>
<P>
While Kuwaitis have managed to recover quickly from the shock,
the Iraqis are still crippled by the economic sanctions imposed by
the international community, it noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe
has raised 85 million U.S. dollars from a number of international
banks over the past few months to support the country's exports
and imports despite the down rating Zimbabwe has received by most
overseas banks, The Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
The bank managing director, Gideon Gono, told the paper Saturday
that the export and import lines of credit are expected to boost
the country's foreign exchange position which has been negative
resulting in the substantial devaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar.
</P>
<P>
He said his bank had managed to raise the 85 million U.S.
dollars package from a number of international banks that he
visited in April and May this year to drum up support for export
and import lines of credit for the bank's clients.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Three banks from the United Kingdom, two from
 Germany, two from France, two from the Middle East and
Switzerland had confirmed their support and some of these

<HEADLINE> Australian Lamb Farmers Take Anger to U.S. Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Australian lamb producers Sunday
took their anger over U.S. import barriers to the U.S. Embassy in
Canberra, beginning a one-month protest against Washington's
decision before the embassy.
</P>
<P>
Around 30 farmers and their families lit barbecues and hoisted
placards in a park opposite the embassy's main gates as Australian
Federal Police and Protective Service officers stood guard.
</P>
<P>
Australian Agriculture Minister Warren Truss threw his support
behind the protest.
</P>
<P>
"This action demonstrates to the world that the United States
is not fair dinkum about fair trade and does not practice what it
preaches," Truss said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"I support the lamb producers' protest and the Australian
government will fight to have this decision overturned within the
World Trade Organization," he said.
</P>
<P>
The protesters were the first contingent of farmers who will
come from all parts of the New South Wales (NSW) state over coming
weeks to protest against the U.S. decision to hold lamb imports at
1998 levels and impose a tariff of 9 percent on current tonnage.
</P>
<P>
NSW Farmers' Association President John Cobb said the
protesters wanted to remind U.S. Ambassador Genta Hawkins Holmes
and President Bill Clinton that the United States had acted in
defiance of its own free trade rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
The protest was mostly peaceful, although a small group of
farmers did attempt to charge the gates of the embassy as a car
exited.

<P>
CANBERRA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea (PNG) will
privatize state assets in a bid to pay off a massive public debt
of 2.2 billion kina (845 million U.S. dollars), AAP said.
</P>
<P>
PNG's Prime Minister Mekere Morauta was quoted as saying on
Sunday that his government had established a privatization
commission to implement the program.
</P>
<P>
Morauta said the privatization program was part of his
government's strategy to resurrect PNG's struggling economy.
</P>
<P>
"All sale proceeds will be used to retire public domestic debt,
which has reached the skyrocket figure of 2.2 billion kina," he
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that we repay this debt as quickly as
possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Sale of government assets is virtually the only way we can
achieve this," Morauta added.
</P>
<P>
Morauta did not specify which government assets were earmarked
for sale but they are likely to be in the telecommunications,

<HEADLINE> Jordan Tightens Enforcement of Seat Belt Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian police Sunday started to
enforce a seat belt law strictly in order to check the climbing of
traffic accidents in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the law passed in 1984, drivers and front seat passengers
in all vehicles are required to fasten their seat belts while
traveling on highways and in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Drivers who fail to do so are expected to be fined up to 50
dinars (70 U.S. dollars) or even have their licenses revoked after
the law is strictly enforced, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
Police surveys conducted during the past few months showed
only 3.7 percent of drivers in Jordan were using seat belts while
driving, while other drivers largely neglected the 1984 law.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics by the Traffic Department, 612 people
died and 171,777 others were injured in 43,343 road accidents in
1998 in the kingdom with a 4.77 million population.
</P>
<P>
Studies indicated 60 percent of the death rates and injuries
in car accidents could be reduced if the drivers and front seat
passengers had fastened their seat belts.

<HEADLINE> Sampras, Agassi to Crash in Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Top-seeded and defending
champion Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras will renew their longtime
rivalry Sunday when the two Americans square off in the finals of
the Mercedes-Benz Cup tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
Agassi out-hit unseeded and unheralded Andre Ilie of Australia
6-4, 6-2 in a baseline slugfest Saturday night in the second semi-
final after second-seeded Sampras outclassed Aussie qualifier
James Sekulov 6-0, 6-2 in the day match to earn a place in the
record books.
</P>
<P>
With the 55-minute semi-final victory, Sampras jumped past
Australian Patrick Rafter into the number one spot in the ATP Tour
world rankings. On Monday, Sampras will begin his 271st week at
the top, breaking a tie with Ivan Lendl for the all-time record.
</P>
<P>
The match gave Sampras his 16th consecutive match victory, a
stretch in which he lifted his sixth Wimbledon crown. The 12-time
Grand Slam champion, who has finished a record six straight years
at the top, reflected on his latest milestone.
</P>
<P>
Agassi has won 17 of his last 18 matches, including a French
Open title in his latest summer surge. His only loss came at the
hands of Sampras in the Wimbledon final.
</P>
<P>
Agassi took the opening set with a lone service break in the
fifth game and continued the pressure. Ilie committed three double
faults in the fifth game to give Agassi a 3-2 edge. Another break
made it 5-2 before the American served out the 67-minute match.
</P>
<P>
Sampras looked nearly invincible, yielding just 12 points in
the 23-minute opener, and added two more games before Sekulov got
on the board.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old, 236th-ranked Aussie, who had never won an ATP
Tour match, had a career week despite his loss, beating fifth-
seeded Thomas Enqvist of Sweden and 1996 champion Michael Chang of
the United States.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Face Food Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Millions of Kenyans face the
prospect of hunger by the end of this year following a massive
shortfall in the supply of two household staple foods.
</P>
<P>
Seven million bags of maize (90-kilogram bag) and five million
bags of wheat will have to be imported if famine is to be
averted, the Sunday Standard newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Investigations showed that between now and the harvest of the
current season crop, Kenya needs to import some 180,000 tons of
maize.
</P>
<P>
Another 450,000 tons of maize and about the same amount of
wheat will have to be imported next year because experts predict
this season's produce will not meet the country's food needs.
</P>
<P>
Last week Kenyan Agriculture Minister Musalia Mudavadi said the
country faced a shortfall of two million bags of maize between
July and end of October, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The minister blamed bad weather for the deficit, saying the
long rains between March to June were generally poor for the
maize-growing Nyanza Province and Western Kenya where just about
seven million bags were produced.
</P>
<P>
The bad weather in Coast, North Eastern and Eastern provinces
and low-lying areas in Central Province led to a total crop
failure for the second consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the poor rains, production of the two leading
cereals this season below annual average because of crop damage
caused by army worms, mainly in Rift Valley Province in central
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Cereals and Produce Board of Kenya said
 Wednesday that its stock of commercial maize had dwindled to
700,000 bags from 2.3 million bags at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
To solve the impending food shortage, the Kenyan government
announced last Thursday to lower duty on imported maize from 32.5
percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mudavadi asked traders in the country to source their maize
from the member states of the Common Market of Eastern and
Southern Africa where the duty is two percent.

<HEADLINE> USA Recovers to Deliver More Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Untied States
recovered from their shutout defeat in the track and field
yesterday to score a seven-gold day in the 13th Pan Am Games here
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Three of the four cycling gold on offer went into the American
pockets while in the men's and women's modern pentathlon, the
Americans made a sweeping victory.
</P>
<P>
The American sailors contributed the rest.
</P>
<P>
Now the United States, who were denied any gold in the ten
athletics finals yesterday, had a commanding 69 gold medals, with
Cuba less than half of them standing second on 33 gold. The hosts
Canada, who had a modest day which saw them pull in three gold,
all from sailing, placed third with 31 gold medals.
</P>
<P>
Today saw another country got off to the gold medal standings
table as Carla Malatrasi and partner E. Figueroa Suarez won a
catam hobie 16 open sailing title.
</P>
<P>
Velizar Iliev led an American 1-2 finish in the men's
pentathlon, collecting 5,299 points from all five events of
shooting, fencing,swimming, riding and running to become the
champion of the argueably most demanding event.
</P>
<P>
His woman teammate took the historic title of the women's event
as she garnered 4,992 points to triumph in the Pan Am women's
pentathlon competition, which was first contested in the Games
history.
</P>
<P>
The American cycling upstart Erin Veenstra struck another gold
after her yesterday's 3,000m individual pursuit title, winning an
easy game over her Mexican opponent Belen Guerrero to capture the
25km points women's race.
</P>
<P>
In the Olympic sprint men's event, the American trio Christian
Arrue, Johnny Bairos and Martin Nothstein crossed the line with a
blistering 47.129 seconds, leaving their Cuban opponents a distant
second at 47.899.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Nothstein afterwards came off his third Pan Am
cycling victory, adding a men's keirin gold to his team and
individual sprint titles.
</P>
<P>
In the men's madison cycling final, Argentine Gabriel Curuchet
and partner Juan Curuchet defied the odds to win the race from
their mighty US rivals James Carney and Brian Whitcomb, preventing
an American clean sweep in today's cycling competitions.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the men's volleyball semi-finals, Cuba came from
one set behind to beat Argentina 28-26, 22-25, 16-25, 22-25 to
reach the final, where they will take on Brazil, a 25-16, 27-25,
25-16 winners over Canada.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Lindsay Davenport made light
work of Amy Frazier on Saturday to meet Venus Williams in the
final of the 500,000 U.S. dollars Bank of the West Classic tennis
tournament for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
Titleholder Davenport eased past error-ridden Frazier 6-0, 6-4
in less than an hour in Saturday's semi-finals as second-seeded
Williams won seven straight games during her 6-1, 6-4 victory over
Amanda Coetzer.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, who has a 7-1 record against Williams, claimed the
title of the tournament last year before she took the U.S. Open
crown and the No. 1 ranking.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, who has never lost to Frazier in six matches, played
nearly flawless tennis although her serve became inconsistent in
the last few games of the match.
</P>
<P>
Frazier had six double faults in the opening set and made 18
unforced errors in that set, compared to just five winners.
</P>
<P>
The second semi-final was tied 1-1 in the first set when
Williams began slamming winners from all over the court and won
seven straight games.
</P>
<P>
The American led 4-1 in the second set when Coetzer rallied to
win three consecutive games before Williams recovered to break
Coetzer's serve and then served out the match.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- India will not withdraw the
Most-Favored Nation (MFN) status to Pakistan in the wake of the
Kargil conflict.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister Ramakrishna Hegde said Sunday that India does
not have any proposal to withdraw the MFN status to Pakistan as he
replied to a question on whether India would consider withdrawal
of MFN status due to the Kargil operations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistan is still to reciprocate though India had
given MFN status to it several years ago, adding "We would still
prefer to wait."
</P>
<P>
Asked if India would consider using the security provisions
under World Trade Organization to slap trade sanctions against
Pakistan, Hegde said, "No."
</P>
<P>
Under Article 22 of WTO, a country can impose trade sanctions
against another in the event of aggression or security threat to
it.

<HEADLINE> EDS-More Added Highlights of Major Beijing-based Newspapers (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
 Liberation Army Daily
</P>
<P>
-- Today's editorial to mark the 72nd anniversary of the People
's Liberation Army (PLA) said the PLA, under the absolute
leadership of the Communist Party of China, is an army armed with
scientific theory, a strong pillar of the people's democratic
dictatorship, an iron great wall for protecting the socialist
motherland, and an invincible force that can be trusted by the
Party and the people.
</P>
<P>
The 72nd anniversary of the PLA came at an unusual time, with
the Army facing both opportunities and challenges, as well as
hopes and difficulties, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo crisis shows that the world is not peaceful and
tranquil and that war is not a distant issue. Lee Teng-hui's
recent remarks on so-called "special state-to-state relations"
have aroused China's serious concern about the separatist force on
the Taiwan island. And the case of the Falun Gong cult, an illegal
organization, has set a serious task for the army to maintain
social stability.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that in short, the Army has two basic tasks:
to win in every battle and to maintain its true quality.
</P>
<P>
It expressed the Army's determination to continue to take Mao
Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping's military thinking as its guide
and comprehensively carry out President Jiang Zemin's instructions
on army building.
</P>
<P>
People's Daily
</P>
<P>
-- The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) reached its goal
of downsizing the army by 500,000 last year, according to Chinese
Defense Minister Chi Haotian.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, vice chairman of the
Central Military Commission, and state councilor, made the remarks
during a reception yesterday marking the 72nd anniversary of the
PLA.
</P>
<P>
-- The newspaper carried a special commentary today co-written
by the newspaper and Xinhua News Agency to reiterate that China
will not accept the attempt by Lee Teng-hui to separate Taiwan
from China with the statement of "special state-to-state relations.
"
</P>
<P>
It said that a written speech by Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), on July 30, which not only
repeated Lee's "two states" statement but also added the words "
fully reflecting the will of people in Taiwan," totally violates
the agreement on "one China" principle already reached by both
sides of the Taiwan Straits in 1992, and was of course rejected by
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
 Xinhua Daily Telegraph
</P>
<P>
-- Officials and people from all walks of life in China
yesterday refuted the fatalistic philosophy propagated by the
Falun Gong cult, an illegal organization, and vowed their
determination to build a scientific philosophy to conquer
ignorance and superstition.
</P>
<P>
 Business Weekly of China Daily
</P>
<P>
--China's auditors are urged to develop sharper eyes to comply
with or benefit from new rules of responsibility under
consideration at the National Audit Office.
</P>
<P>
Auditor-General Li Jinhua said that the office is working on a
new auditing system, which includes auditing principles,
regulations concerning incentives for auditors and rules of
responsibility to improve the quality of audits.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Tourist Arrivals to Hit Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's tourist arrivals this
year will hit an all-time high breaching the 420,000-mark with the
strong performance recorded in the first half of the year,
corporate analysts here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
John Keells Stock Brokers said in a sector review that total
tourist arrivals for the first half at 212,766 was up nearly 23
percent from the 173,145 arrivals recorded during the same period
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The growth received momentum with an increase in Asian arrivals
while a large number of West European arrivals too had helped
improve the picture, the report said.
</P>
<P>
John Keells attributed promotional activities by the government
and several leading tour operators to the increase in arrivals.
</P>
<P>
While West European arrivals clocked a growth of 20.4 percent,
Asian arrivals too recorded a robust 33 percent growth, led by
arrival increases from Japan with 55 percent, and India with 34
percent.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka saw a record tourist arrivals of 407,511 in 1994.
Since then the tourist arrivals have been fluctuating due to the
country's long-running ethnic civil war.
</P>
<P>
It recorded a 4.1 percent increase in tourist arrivals to
381,063 last year after a 21 percent rise in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Tourist Board has predicted a 17 percent rise in tourist
arrivals this year to around 446,000.

Reserve Bank of India said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The fall in the annual rate of inflation is mainly on the
account of a higher base last year due to an abnormal increase in
vegetable prices. For example, the index for vegetables during the
current week is 456.0 compared to 732.1 in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
During the reference week, the rate of inflation fell by 0.23
percentage points to 1.62 percent (Provisional) from 1.85 percent
the week before. In comparison, the inflation rate was higher at
8.22 percent during the corresponding week of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Wholesale Price Index for All commodities
(base:1981-82=100) during the current week rose by 0.1 percent to
357.3 as against 357.0 in the previous week.

<HEADLINE> China Increasing Engineering Projects, Labor Services Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- China's overseas engineering
contracting and labor services businesses have kept growing
remarkably, in contrary to the fact that the country's exporters
are still struggling to recover from the negative effects of the
Asian financial meltdown, today's Business Weekly of China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
China contracted 5.83 billion U.S. dollars worth of engineering
projects and labor services during the first half of this year, a
2.96 percent rise on 1998 figure.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation Minister Shi Guangsheng
called foreign engineering contracting and labor co-operation
businesses "the most promising part of China's foreign economic co-
operation sector."
</P>
<P>
"Global construction investment volume was 3.2 trillion U.S.
dollars in 1998, while Chinese firms only clinched 10.1 billion U.
S. dollars. This indicates we have huge room for further
development," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
China's engineering contracting companies have gathered rich
experience in adapting to market changes, because they have
directly faced international markets since they came into being
during the late 1970s and the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, they successfully shifted their focus to the
emerging Asian markets from the once exuberant Middle-Eastern
markets, which was withering quickly.
</P>
<P>
Since the outbreak of the Asian financial turmoil in 1997, they
have also made big headway in tapping European and American
markets.
</P>
<P>
China Metallurgical Construction Engineering Co. contracted a
engineering project worth of 150 million U.S. dollars in the U.S.
this year. This was the first time that a Chinese engineering
company ever succeeded in the U.S. engineering market.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Government will guide and support a group of big
contractors to bid for large projects in the international markets,
said Shi.

<HEADLINE> Panama Charges U.S. With not Cleaning Contaminated Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Panama Saturday denounced the
U.S. armed forces for not cleaning areas they used for military
purposes before their withdrawal as they should have done in
accordance with the 1977 Torrijos-Carter treaties.
</P>
<P>
The regional U.S. army headquarters formally departed Panama on
July 30, 25 days ahead of the date agreed on, leaving only a few
hundred soldiers until the Panama Canal is reverted at the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry communique published Saturday said that the
U.S. armed forces abandoned the Emperador firing range, the
bombing area of Balboa Oeste and another installation in Rodman in
advance of the dates agreed on, leaving them contaminated.
</P>
<P>
The government reaffirmed its position that the United States
must comply, even after the handover of the Canal on December 31,
1999, with the decontamination process of the areas used for
military purposes, where they have left non-detonated ammunition
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
Under the Torrijos-Carter treaties signed by Panama and the
United States in 1977, the United States ought to take all
possible measures "for the removal of any threat to human life,
health, and security," and hand over those areas free of risks.
</P>
<P>
But the United States has refused to do the job on the excuse
of lack of technologies in this respect.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the transference of the contaminated areas
in advance was a unilateral decision of the United States and
warned that the abandonment of those areas does not exempt the U.S.
government from its responsibility of decontaminating or
compensating Panama for the loss of assets affected by the
contamination produced by the U.S. armed forces activities.

<P>
BELGRADE, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian peacekeepers in Kosovo
Saturday detained a military leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA), but later let him go, according to a spokesman for the NATO-
led Kosovo peacekeeping Force (KFOR).
</P>
<P>
The Russian soldiers stopped Agim Ceku in Kijevo in the German-
controlled southern sector of Kosovo as he was on his way to his
hometown of Pec, KFOR spokesman Major Jan Joosten said.
</P>
<P>
The reason why Ceku was held is that he could not produce his
Joint Implementation Card issued by the KFOR for the KLA leaders
to prove their identity, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
But later, as his identity was confirmed, the Russians released
him.
</P>
<P>
Although the detention was brief, the accident brought tension
between the Russian troops in Kosovo and the KLA, reports said.

<HEADLINE> China Works on New Auditing System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- China's auditors are urged to
develop sharper eyes to comply with or benefit from new rules of
responsibility under consideration at the National Audit Office.
</P>
<P>
Today's Business Weekly of China Daily quoted Auditor-General
Li Jinhua as saying that the office is working on a new auditing
system, which includes auditing principles, regulations concerning
incentives for auditors and rules of responsibility to improve the
quality of audits.
</P>
<P>
He said that the auditing is an increasingly important tool for
the supervision of the national economy and a powerful weapon in
the fight against corruption.
</P>
<P>
"If auditors fail to find problems which turn up years later,
they must bear responsibility," said Li.
</P>
<P>
Responsibility rules are expected to be developed during 2001,
and auditing principles are being drafted and will go into
effected by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Rules concerning incentives for those who discover cases
involving big embezzlements and illegal activities have already
been set up. And rules defining responsibilities are under serious
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Li said if auditors obey the principles, but still fail to
discover problems, they should not bear unlimited responsibilities,
because the system aims not only to make auditors more responsible,
but to protect them.
</P>
<P>
He also highlighted the importance of applying advanced means
such as computer technologies to improve auditing efficiency.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, Chinese auditors face such thorny problems as
local protectionism, which hampers auditing and the publicizing of
auditing reports. Loose financial discipline and fabricated
accounting information also creates hotbeds for corruption.

<HEADLINE> China's Sales of Bus, Luxury Coach Growing Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A rapid extension of expressways
and growth in mass transit in China are pushing sales of buses and
luxury coaches, according to today's Business Weekly of China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
During the first half this year, 15,761 buses and luxury
coaches were sold, up 60.37 percent from the same period last year,
according to figures from China Automotive Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
This is a new record following five consecutive years of growth
and it has been attributed to massive investment in urban public
works, the construction of highways and the advent of peak time
for the replacement of old buses, said the officials with the
association.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 old buses will be replaced by new ones because of
activities marking the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
In three years of time, China will spend at least 250 billion
yuan (30.1 billion U.S. dollars) building roads and bridges within
big cities. The budget for new bus purchases is expected to be at
least 30 billion yuan (3.61 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The growth in tourism and international activities held by
China is expected to bring in more orders for luxury coaches.

<HEADLINE> hke080102 -Feature: High-tech Wave Sweeping Across Southeast Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Two years after a financial storm
hit Southeast Asia, a new wave of high-tech is sweeping across the
region, where the crisis-affected nations vowed to build their own
"Silicon Valleys" to improve their economic competitiveness in the
world.
</P>
<P>
From the Philippines to Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand,
governments are now determined to develop new technologies to
regain their economic strength, which has been weakened by a
two-year old financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Actually, before the crisis took place in mid-1997, countries
like Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines had implemented
ambitious plans for hi-tech centers to improve their
competitiveness. But the crisis somewhat marred these projects,
and the competitiveness of the Southeast Asian economies were
partially affected.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1999 World Competitiveness Report published
last month, Southeast Asian nations, except Singapore, appear to
be losing ground in the global race for a competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
While Singapore is placed at the top of the list of the world's
most competitive economies for the fourth straight year, others
are down from 1997. Indonesia, for instance, is down 22 places,
Thailand 12 notches, and Malaysia seven places.
</P>
<P>
To avert the adverse effects of the crisis, Southeast Asian
countries, taking the advantage of an economic turnaround in
recent months, have speeded up the construction of high-tech
centers.
</P>
<P>
Among the ambitious plans, Malaysia's Multi-media Super
Corridor (MSC), a 15km-by-50km hub for pioneering high-tech
research and development in south of Kuala Lumpur, is the most
remarkable one.
</P>
<P>
"I will admit that it is an ambitious project, but it is not
for us Malaysians to implement alone," said Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad. "We conceived it as a giant test-bed
for everyone to use, every one from everywhere."
</P>
<P>
Microsoft, the most prestigious technology company in the
world, is among the 228 foreign and domestic companies that have
got approval to operate in the MSC, and by 2003, 400 high-tech
companies will operate in the "Silicon Valley."
</P>
<P>
Without the MSC, Malaysia, which tries to transform itself into
a knowledge-based economy in the next century, will remain a
manufacturing-based economy fast becoming too expensive to compete
with less developed neighbors, economists said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Philippines does not like to lag behind its
neighbors. As the second largest producer of computer software
exports in Asia next to India, the Philippines is taking its
competitive advantage in quality price and cheaper labor force to
develop information technology.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Software Association estimates that software
services exports will reach 200 million U.S. dollars by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
A visit to Gateway Business Park, 90 minutes by car south of
Manila, could also find a quite high-tech revolution is under way
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Gateway is becoming a center of assembly and testing of some of
the world's most sophisticated computer chips. California-based
Intel is inside with a 550-million-dollar Pentium assembly and a
testing center. Cypress Semiconductor of San Jose and
Massachusetts-based Analog Devices, both with 200-million-dollar
plants, are also inside the park.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, the government is also planning its "Silicon
Valley." It has allocated 176 hectares of land in the west part of
the island to build a high-tech center.
</P>
<P>
As for Thailand, it is stimulating high-tech development by
improving its education system first.
</P>
<P>
According to Sippanondha Ketudat, former education minister of
Thailand, more than 60 percent of the country's workforce has only
primary education, the same level in South Korea 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Thailand trails well behind the region's stronger economies in
providing engineers and scientists, he said, adding "Malaysia has
three to four times as many researchers as Thailand."
</P>
<P>
Realizing the seriousness of the problem, the Thai government
hopes to have steered through the parliament a bill touted as the
most far-reaching education shake-up in a century by early August.
The bill guarantees access to free education for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
By developing high-tech centers, Southeast Asian countries
could make headway in improving their economic competitiveness if
their dreams could become a reality, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> China Intensifies Punishment for Price Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Planning
Commission (SDPC) today issued a regulation on administrative
punishment for price violations, in a bid to straighten out the
market order and create a better environment for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The overall price indexes in the domestic market have been
declining for more than 20 months, featured by sluggish demand, an
SDPC official said. He also pointed out market irregularities,
including low-price dumping, price fraud, price monopoly, price
discrimination, price drive-up, and other price-related violations.
</P>
<P>
Based on the Price Law, the 20-article regulation further
defines the legal responsibility for price violations, and spells
out in detail concrete punitive measures for businesses that do
not follow government designated prices, price intervention
policies, emergency price steps, or the open price practice.
</P>
<P>
The regulation highlights the importance of protecting the
legal rights and interests of both consumers and businesses, and
requires price law enforcement officials to strictly abide by the
law and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Any law enforcement official who discloses state secrets and
businesses' commercial secrets, abuses their power, trifles with
his/her duty, or does wrong to serve his/her friends or relatives
will be pursued for criminal liability.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also specifies the fines and punishments for
various kinds of price violations, and lists various punitive
measures for unauthorized fee charging.
</P>
<P>
"The new measures will play a positive role in preventing price
irregularities, maintaining a good market order for fair and open
competition, improving consumption and investment environment,
expanding domestic demand, and promoting economic development,"
the SDPC official concluded.

<HEADLINE> Militia Faction Claims Car Bomb Attack in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC) faction Saturday claimed responsibility
for a car bomb attack Friday in the parking lot of a military
installation that fights rural kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
Radio "Caracol" network said that a male voice made the phone
call to the Caracol Medellin press room, claiming the subversive
action that killed eight and injured more than 30 in Medellin, the
second largest city of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The car bomb loaded with 100 kilograms of explosives was
detonated at 15:15 local time (20:15 GMT) from across the military
installation.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Eduardo Herrera Verbel, commander of the Fourth Brigade of
the Army, also said Saturday in Medellin that just 15 minutes
after the attack, a telephone call had claimed the terrorist
attack on behalf of the FARC urban militias.

<HEADLINE> Uruguayan, Argentine Presidents to Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Uruguayan President Julio Maria
Sanguinetti will meet with his Argentine counterpart Carlos Menem
in Buenos Aires Sunday to review the progress of the South
American Common Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
Sanguinetti, Mercosur's present president, will go to Argentina
to watch the soccer game between River Plane and Penarol, Uruguay'
s presidential office said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
His meeting with Menem has come after he phoned several times
Argentine and Brazilian presidents to urge them to discuss the
bloc's crisis caused by a trade conflict between Argentina and
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Recession-hit Argentina had taken unilateral measures to head
off a series of Brazilian exports made cheaper by Brazil's sharp
real devaluation in January. The move triggered the worst
bickering between the two countries since Mercosur began working
as a customs union in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Sanguinetti held that the Argentine decision to cancel trade
safeguards among Mercosur members "prepared the way" to
negotiating "in a better climate."
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, which groups Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay
with Chile and Bolivia as associates, will hold here on August 4
an extraordinary meeting to study the progress of the group.

<HEADLINE> De Bruijn Breaks European Swimming Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Holland's Inge de Bruijn kept her
record-breaking momentum at the European Swimming Championships
here as she set a European record of 24.84 seconds in her 50-meter
freestyle semi-final on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
De Bruijn lowered the mark of 24.88 set by herself last month
and broke a record for the fifth time at the 24th championships.
</P>
<P>
She is yet to challenge in the Sunday's final the world mark of
24.51 set by Le Jingyi of China on September 11, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, De Bruijn set a championship record in the
same event. She has also broken the European records in the 100-
meter freestyle and butterfly and swam a championship record in a
50-meter butterfly heat earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Dutchman Pieter Van Den Hoogenband saw his bid for a record
seven gold medals was dampened at the Euro event as the
Netherlands was disqualified in the 800 relay final.
</P>
<P>
On the anchor leg, Hoogenband finished nearly three body
lengths ahead of his nearest competitor. But officials ruled that
leadoff swimmer Martyn Zuidweg false started by moving on the
blocks.
</P>
<P>
Italy, who finished second, was also disqualified because
Andrea Beccari, swimming the second leg, left early.
</P>
<P>
Germany, which finished third, was awarded the race in 7:19.63,
followed by Britain in 7:19.91 and Russia in 7:25.36.
</P>
<P>
Hoogenband, who can still tie the six-gold medal record set by
Germany's Michael Gross at the 1985 Euros, entered the 50-meter
freestyle final after going one-two with Russian Alexander Popov,
who holds both the world and European records.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's Lars Frolander won the 100-meter butterfly in 52.61,
followed by Britain's James Hickman in 52.97 and Ukraine's Denis
Sylantyev third in 53.04, just beating Franck Esposito of France,
who won the 200.
</P>
<P>
In the 200-meter backstroke, Germany's Ralf Braun came in first
in 1:59.74, Croatia's Gordan Kozulj was second in 2:00.07 and
Emanuele Merisi of Italy finished third in 2:00.50
</P>
<P>
European champion and record holder Agnes Kovacs of Hungary
picked up her third gold by successfully defending her title in
the women's 200 breaststroke, winning in 2:27.12. Beatrice Caslaru
of Romania was second in 2:27.80 and Alicja Peczak of Poland third
in 2:28.93.
</P>
<P>
Camelia Potec of Romania won the 200 freestyle in 1:58.79,
followed by Germany's Kerstin Kielgass in 2:00.09 and Natalia
Baranovskaia of Belarus in 2:00.18.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 10-meter platform diving, Ukraine's Elena
Zhupina took the gold with 338.28 points, Spain's Dolores Saez De
Ibara captured the silver and Russia's Svetlana Timoshinina was
third.

<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
 People's Daily
</P>
<P>
-- The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) reached its goal
of downsizing the army by 500,000 last year, according to Chinese
Defense Minister Chi Haotian.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, vice chairman of the
Central Military Commission, and state councilor, made the remarks
during a reception yesterday marking the 72nd anniversary of the
PLA.
</P>
<P>
-- The newspaper carried a special commentary today co-written
by the newspaper and Xinhua News Agency to reiterate that China
will not accept the attempt by Lee Teng-hui to separate Taiwan
from China with the statement of "special state-to-state relations.
"
</P>
<P>
It said that a written speech by Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), on July 30, which not only
repeated Lee's "two states" statement but also added the words "
fully reflecting the will of people in Taiwan," totally violates
the agreement on "one China" principle already reached by both
sides of the Taiwan Straits in 1992, and was of course rejected by
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
 Xinhua Daily Telegraph
</P>
<P>
-- Officials and people from all walks of life in China
yesterday refuted the fatalistic philosophy propagated by the
Falun Gong cult, an illegal organization, and vowed their
determination to build a scientific philosophy to conquer
ignorance and superstition.
</P>
<P>
 Business Weekly of China Daily
</P>
<P>
--China's auditors are urged to develop sharper eyes to comply
with or benefit from new rules of responsibility under
consideration at the National Audit Office.
</P>
<P>
Auditor-General Li Jinhua said that the office is working on a
new auditing system, which includes auditing principles,
regulations concerning incentives for auditors and rules of
responsibility to improve the quality of audits.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Panamanians held a ceremony
Saturday to remember the late Gen. Omar Torrijos, who played a
leading role in achieving the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from
Panama and the return of the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 people attended the emotion-laden ceremony held
in the capital in memory of the 18th anniversary of the demise of
Gen. Torrijos.
</P>
<P>
Torrijos, who died in a plane crash in 1981, achieved in 1977
with his diplomatic and political ability the signing of an
agreement, under which the United States must pull out its troops
from Panama and return to Panamanian sovereignty the Panama Canal
by December 31, 1999 to end its more than 80 years of occupation.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Foreign Ministry General Secretary Adolfo
Ahumada praised Torrijos for his efforts to win international
support for the Panamanian struggle to recover its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
December 31 of 1999, when the United States will hand over the
interoceanic waterway to Panamanian sovereignty, will be the first
day of an authentic and real national independence, said former
presidential candidate Martin Torrijos, son of the late general.

<HEADLINE> China's Machinery, Electronics Exports Face Uphill Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese machinery and electronics
exporters face an uphill battle in achieving a high growth rate,
the English language newspaper China Daily's Business Weekly
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, China's exports of machinery
and electronic products increased by 2.99 billion U.S. dollars or
9.9 percent from the same period of last year to 33.3 billion U.S.
dollars, according to Chinese customs statistics.
</P>
<P>
A trade official pointed out it will be more difficult for
China to augment its exports of machinery and electronic products.
He listed some major negative factors such as rising trade
protectionism in some countries, more fierce competition from
rivals of other countries and undercutting practices among some
Chinese exporters.
</P>
<P>
China has raised export rebates to 17 percent on four major
kinds of machinery and electronic exports, accounting for 80
percent of machinery and electronics exports each year, the paper
said, adding that the higher rebate rates are expected to reduce
export costs and encourage Chinese exporters to sell more such
products abroad.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government also gave rebates to exports of
equipment and raw materials and granted foreign trade rights and
international engineering contracting rights to those domestic
enterprises who plan to invest overseas to make it a new growth
sector for Chinese exporters, the paper said.

killing upsets in this year's Cosafa Castle Cup, defeating South
Africa on penalties in their quarter-final match in Windhoek,
Namibia on Saturday.
</P>
<P>

lost to their northern neighbours in the annual southern African
championship.
</P>
<P>
South Africa led in the first half with a goal from Pollen
Ndlanya, forcefully heading home from a corner kick in the 32nd
minute.
</P>
<P>
Namibia's equaliser also came from a corner with Johannes
Hindjou getting a close-range touch-in in the 50th minute.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tourist Spots Abandoned in Batam, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The tourist spots in Batam,
Indonesia, looked abandoned on Saturday following the clashes
between residents with killing threats reaching the remote
villages in the island.
</P>
<P>
According to the Antara News Agency, the Melur beach, some 40
kilometers from Batam city, where hundreds of local and foreign
tourists used to spend their holidays on Saturdays and Sundays,
had been closed in view of rumors that a certain ethnic group will
be attacked.
</P>
<P>
At the main entrance to Barelang area, where hundreds of cars
and motorcycles used to come, security personnel suggested
visitors to avoid Melur beach in view of the dangerous situation
prevailing there.
</P>
<P>
The streets in Batam city are also abandoned, while well-armed
security personnel in several shopping centers were standing guard
for any possibilities which would harm the interest of the
population, the Antara News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Batamindo industrial estate where people used to see
thousands of busy workers and employees, is also abandoned, while
several public buses looked practically empty.
</P>
<P>
Some 90 foreign investment companies mostly of Singapore,
employing some 160,000 people, are operating in the Batamindo
industrial estate. Most of the workers involved in the clashes
belonged to certain ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, many stores and shopping centers opened their
doors only half-way, while illegally-built houses of members of
the warring groups have mostly been abandoned by their owners
taking refuge elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Batam, just 35 kilometers southeast of Singapore, is a special
industrial zone and also a popular tourist destination for
Singaporeans. Violent clashes between migrant groups from Sumatera
and Flores in Batam since Thursday had claimed at least 13 lives.

<HEADLINE> Real Madrid Defeats Inter MIlan 3-2 in Friendly Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 31 (Xinhua) -- An injury time strike from Fernando
Morientes gave Real Madrid a 3-2 win over Inter Milan in a
friendly soccer match in Milan on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Both teams fielded strong sides. Inter Milan, under new coach
Marcello Lippi, featured their world record signing Christian
Vieri in attack but were without Brazilian Ronaldo resting after
the Copa America.
</P>
<P>
It was two of Real's new faces who combined to help open the
scoring in the 20th minute.
</P>
<P>
England international Steve McManaman was brought down after a
weaving run down the right and Inter keeper Fabrizio Ferron could
only parry Bosnian Elvir Bolic's fierce free kick with Raul making
no mistake as he followed up.
</P>
<P>
Inter enjoyed the better of the early possession and drew level
in the 30th when Vieri tapped in from close range after Alvaro
Recoba headed a Francesco Moriero cross into his path.
</P>
<P>
But one minute later Morientes latched onto a through ball from
Raul and blasted past Ferron.
</P>
<P>
Inter substitute Andrea Pirlo jinked into the penalty area and
fired a powerful shot past Real 'keeper Bodo Illgner and seemed to
have given Inter a draw.
</P>
<P>
But in injury time a low shot from Real substitute Guti was
pushed out by Ferron and Morientes pounced.

VIENNA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Albert Costa of
Spain defeated top seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia 7-6, 6-2 in
the Generali Open tennis Tournament in Kitzbuehel on Saturday to
set up an all-Spanish final.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Fernando Vicente eliminated Austrian Stefan Koubek 6-4,
6-4 in the other semi-final.
</P>
<P>
Costa, also a winner in Kitzbuehel in 1995 and who has yet to
lose a match on the clay at Kitzbuehel, slugged it out from the
baseline and frequently outwitted Kafelnikov with deceptive drop
shots.
</P>
<P>
Costa, whose victory took his winning streak at Kitzbuehel to
14, has won all his 10 ATP titles on clay.
</P>
<P>
Vicente, the 13th seed, overcame a faltering serve in the first
set to break Austrian number one Koubek in the ninth game.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard shifted up a gear in the second set and took
advantage of numerous unforced errors by his opponent to again
break in the ninth game and serve out for the match.

ROME, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Italian Deputy Prime Minister Sergio
Mattarella confirmed Saturday that the Italian government wants
the Serbian people involved in material and political
reconstruction in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Mattarella was speaking at a conference in Italy's northeast
city of Udine, organized by Caritas, a Catholic charity
organization.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema after Friday's Sarajevo
summit for a Balkans stability pact, he said reconstruction would
be "insufficient and probably ineffective" without Serbian
involvement.
</P>
<P>
He said that Italy could expect to play a major role in Balkan
reconstruction, not just because of geographical vicinity, but
also because of Italy's "close dialogue" with the Balkan
countries.
</P>
<P>
But he also denied that Italy has a pro-Serb stance, saying,
"We distinguish the Serbian government, with its very grave
responsibilities, from the Serbian people, which must pay for its
government's mistakes."
</P>
<P>
According to the deputy premier, in the near future, Serbia
must give itself a government which is "more democratic, more
credible internationally and more respectful of human rights."

<HEADLINE> French FM Appeals to Enterprises to Return to Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine appealed on Saturday to French enterprises to return to
Algeria, because the security situation has improved in that
country after suffering years of bloody conflict between the
government and Islamic groups.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Parisian newspaper Journal du Dimanche
to be published on Sunday, Vedrine said that most of the French
business leaders whom he has met over the past one year told him
that "the climate has changed (in Algeria) because the army and
police have become efficient" in guaranteeing security.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot but encourage very strongly the French enterprises
to return (to Algeria), at least to support their counterparts who
are already there," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that France and Algeria have reached an agreement
on lessening the control of visa issuing to Algerians applying to
go to France.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine visited Algeria on Thursday and Friday, during which he
held talks with Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika on
normalizing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
To endorse a new Franco-Algerian strategic partnership, French
President Jacques Chirac plans to make a state visit to Algeria in
September, according to the French daily Le Monde on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
France and Algeria had disputed for years over how to end the
war between the Algerian government and Islamic militants, which
has killed at least 100,000 people since 1992.

LONDON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- One man was arrested and a rifle
and a handgun were recovered Saturday night as loyalists and
nationalists clashed again in the Northern Irish town Portadown.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of any injuries after the man was
arrested following a confrontation in a Catholic area of the town,
said a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
However, Dara O'Hagan of Sinn Fein, the political ally of the
Irish Republican Army (IRA), reported that a shot was fired in the
area and blamed loyalists.
</P>
<P>
"He was tackled by local people and a shot was fired. I think
one man was grazed in the head. People are very frightened and
shocked by what has happened," she said, believing that the man
was a Protestant.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Portadown, a nationalist man was also arrested after
what police described as "minor disturbances" between Catholics
and Protestants.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland peace process has been placed under review
for the summer period after falling apart over the issue of arms
decommissioning earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has refused to agree to Ulster Unionist Party demands
for decommissioning before being allowed to sit in a devolved
government for the troubled province.

PARIS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Morocco's new king, Mohammed VI, has
promised to pursue the political reform engaged by his father,
King Hassan II, through adopting political pluralism under a
constitutional monarchy.
</P>
<P>
In his first address to the nation on Friday, King Mohammed VI
said that Morocco needs to solve numerous problems, such as
poverty, social inequality, unemployment, and lack of education
and health care for the poor.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed VI, 36, who inherited the Moroccan throne after his
father died of a heart attack one week ago, said that he will
continue to endorse political pluralism, the rule of law, the
respect of human rights and freedom, while guaranteeing security
and social stability in his country.
</P>
<P>
The young king is known for his admiration for the
constitutional monarchy of Spain under King Juan Carlos, who
introduced democracy to Spain after the death of General Franco in
1975.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would continue to support Socialist Prime
Minister Abderrahmane Youssoufi, who was nominated head of
government by King Hassan last year.
</P>
<P>
Youssoufi, 75, had been King Hassan's opponent for decades and
is regarded as the representative of a political alternative of
Morocco.
</P>
<P>
He has been having difficulties in implementing his power as
prime minister because of resistance to his reform policies from
Morocco's conservative forces.

<HEADLINE> IRA Ceasefire "Still Holding", Says Sinn Fein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein Saturday insisted that
the IRA's ceasefire was intact despite the murder this week of a
taxidriver in Belfast and the discovery of a transatlantic arms
smuggling ring in Florida, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The party's chief whip, Alex Maskey, told Reuters that the
IRA's ceasefire was "still holding" despite claims by leading
loyalist David Ervine it was "fraying".
</P>
<P>
Both camps clashed after Ervine, of the Progressive Unionist
Party, which has links to the Ulster Volunteer Force, claimed
loyalists were of the opinion that the IRA's ceasefire was
beginning to "unravel".
</P>
<P>
Ervine said the shooting of the taxidriver Bennett in Belfast
had given rise to suspicions that the IRA was preparing to resume
its paramilitary campaign.
</P>
<P>
However, Maskey responded by accusing Ervine of ignoring
regular loyalist paramilitary violence and recent arms finds in
loyalist areas.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the demand for Sinn Fein to be expelled from
peace talks, saying that certain people are predictably jumping at
every opportunity on every incident to seek Sinn Fein's exclusion
from the Northern Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"This has been the policy of unionism for some time which has
sought to exclude Sinn Finn and indeed arguably other nationalists
from the peace process. Republicans remain committed to the peace
process," Maskey was quoted by Reuters as saying.
