LAGOS, July 28 (Xinhua) - The Nigeria-led West Africa Peace
Keeping Force, or ECOMOG, has put off its final withdrawal from
Liberia to make sure that arms gathered after the country's
seven-year civil war are all destroyed, said an ECOMOG senior
officer in Monrovia Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The officer said that the remaining 1,000 ECOMOG force would
probably leave in August when the destruction of the weapons was
expected to conclude, a report from the Liberian capital reaching

"Once the arms left here are completely destroyed, we will pull
out. As at now, we are still in Liberia," said the officer, who
refused to be named. He added that "the sooner the arms are
destroyed, the quicker we will leave. "
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the final departure could be in mid or late
August.

The ECOMOG troops in Liberia are responsible for collecting the
weapons of past war groups and policed in 1997 multi-party
elections, in which President Charles Taylor, leader of the
former anti-government force, won.

The force had originally been expected to begin its final
withdrawal Tuesday, one day after the ceremonial burning of arms
in the country's capital Monrovia, but there was no sign of
troops' leaving.
</P>
<P>
Taylor and the presidents of Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Mali
attended Monday's ceremony marking the destruction of the
collected arms and the 152nd anniversary of the founding of
Liberia.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The number of refugees in central
Angola's Huambo Province, which suffers the most during the
on-going civil war, has reached 250,000, Paulo Cassoma, governor
of the province said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The governor said because of the frequent attacks by the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),
innocent citizens have flooded into the government-controled
Huambo City and the nearby towns, making the number of refugees
shooting up from 170,000 three months ago to 250,000 at present.
</P>
<P>
Cassama said that the the food in Huambo and the surrounding
towns can only last for one or two weeks, despite intensified
humanitarian food aid by the United Nations and other
international institutions.
</P>
<P>
The renewed civil war since last December has also produced
170,000 refugees in Kuito, capital of Bie province and more than
1.7 million refugees all over the country.
</P>
<P>
SItuations in Huambo are still under the control of the
government, although the UNITA has been launching small-scale

<P>
GAZA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
Chairman Yasser Arafat sent a message Wednesday evening to Chinese
President Jiang Zemin on the latest developments of the Middle
East peace process after his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat handed the message to Liu Zhihai, the Chinese envoy to
the PNA, during their meeting at Arafat's premises here. The two
sides reviewed the latest political situation in the Middle East
and the efforts being made to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, after his meeting with Barak, Arafat also made a
phone call with U.S. President Bill Clinton and sent messages to
French President Jaques Chirac, Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
Jordanian King Abdullah II and Spanish Prime Minister Jose Aznar
on the same issue.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday evening, Arafat met Barak at the Erez Crossing
point. It is their second summit since Barak took office earlier
in the month. However, the two leaders failed to reach an
agreement on the implementation of the Wye Accord.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered interim Wye accord calls for a three-phase
Israeli withdrawal from another 13.1 percent of the West Bank in
exchange for Palestinians' security measures.
</P>
<P>
The deal was signed by Arafat and Barak's hard-line predecessor
Benjamin Netanyahu last October and later frozen by Netanyahu
after the first phase of Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
Barak, while promising to carry out the Wye agreement,
suggested in both meetings with Arafat that the implementation of
the remaining parts of the accord be wrapped into
Israeli-Palestinian final status talks.
</P>
<P>
But the PNA has rejected the proposal and asked the Israeli
government to implement the accord sincerely, accurately and
quickly to pave the way for the final status talks.

<HEADLINE> New Offshore Field Starts Producing oIL in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A new offshore oil field started
operation in Angola, one of Africa's biggest oil producers, the
National Oil Corporation of Angola announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The three wells in the new oil field are expected to turn out
about 7, 500 barrels of oil a day, it was announced.
</P>
<P>
The Banzala oil field, located 19 kms off the coast of northern
Angola's Cabinda Province, is jointly developed by U.S. Cabinda
Gulf Oil Company Ltd, Italy's Agip Angola Ltd, and France's Elf
Petroleum Angola Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Mark Puckett, general manager of the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company
Ltd said that he was very happy with the low cost of development
of the oil field which has taken only 18 months from the signing
of an agreement with the Angolan government to operation.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan oil company said that another five wells will be
put into operation later in the year, and the daily production of
the oil field will be raised to 25,000 barrels, with still another
five wells to join them in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Angola has a daily oil production of 750,000 barrels at present
and the production is expected to be greatly increased in the
coming years as the government is trying hard to attract world oil
giants to help tap its offshore oil in the country.
</P>
<P>
The southern African country is planning to reach a daily oil
production of one million barrels by 2000, and 1.3 million by
2003.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Begins Debate On Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate started debate
on tax cuts Wednesday amid a political battle between the
Republicans and the White House on the issue that could affect
next year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year, 792 billion dollar tax-cut package was proposed by
Senate Republicans but opposed by the White House and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, a strong proponent of the
bill, said he hopes to bring the Senate bill to a vote Friday.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives, on a largely party-line vote,
last week passed a bill that also would provide 792 billion
dollars in tax cut relief over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton and White House officials have stated
repeatedly that the president would veto the Republican bills,
because they are too large, would threaten future efforts to save
Social Security and Medicare, and leave no money for needed
improvements in defense and education.
</P>
<P>
Republicans, however, insist that with the budget surplus
projected at nearly 3 trillion dollars over the next decade, they
can set aside money for Social Security, Medicare and federal debt
reduction and still have 792 billion dollars to return to
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
A bipartisan group of six Democratic and five Republican
Senators, all moderates, put forward a 500 billion dollar
compromise proposal Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But even that tax-cut proposal is too big for President
Clinton to agree. Clinton has said he would accept a tax cut of
around 250 billion dollars and White House officials have made
clear that even a compromise bill of 500 billion dollars would
be subject to a veto.
</P>
<P>
Congressional leaders are likely to wait until after the August
recess to send a bill to Clinton for signature, giving them more
than a month to take the issue to their constituents and try to
drum up support for their largest tax cut proposal in two
decades.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves $39 Million Loan to Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has approved the disbursement of a total of 39 million
U.S. dollars to Tanzania to complete a scheduled three-year loan.
</P>
<P>
The loan has been disbursed according to an arrangement between
the IMF and Tanzania for the country's economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
According to an IMF press release issued here Wednesday, the
Executive Board of the agency based in Washington D.C. approved
the loan Tuesday in line with the terms of the Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF).
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for assisting eligible
members that are undertaking economic reform programs to
strengthen their balance of payments and to improve their growth
prospects. ESAF loans carry an interest of 0.5 percent a year and
are payable over 10 years with a five-and-a-half-year period.
</P>
<P>
Shigemitsu Sugisaki, deputy managing director of the IMF
Executive Board, said in the statement that the board commended
the Tanzanian government for its continued strong macroeconomics
policy implementation.
</P>
<P>
"Despite lower agricultural production due to continuing adverse
weather conditions, appropriately tight fiscal and monetary
policies had allowed the inflation rate to decline to the single
digit for the first time in two decades," Sugisaki said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the IMF board regretted Tanzania's delays in
implementing structural reforms, but the board considers it to be
largely caused by technical factors, reflecting the complexities
of the privatization process.
</P>
<P>
The IMF praised Tanzania's tax reforms and stressed the
importance of further strengthening revenue performance.

<HEADLINE> Former Nigerian Speaker Pleads Guilty in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His arraignment came a day after the country's Justice Minister
Kanu Agabi said the former speaker would be "brought to trial at
the appropriate time" after the police had completed ongoing
investigations into the allegations.
</P>
<P>
"He had already admitted to the offenses and asked the
forgiveness of Nigerians," he pleaded just before the court fixed
August 3 for further hearing, a governmental official told Xinhua
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The former speaker of the House of Representatives, who broke
down in court, confessed he had forged the University of Toronto
certificate claiming he graduated in 1996 and a 1992 national
service certificate, which is mandatory for graduates of the
country's tertiary institutions under 30 years of age.
</P>
<P>
Buhari, who resigned last week over allegations, admitted in
court that he lied about his age, claiming 36 when he was 29.
Under the country's constitution, a candidate for the lower house
must be at least 30 years of age.
</P>
<P>
Buhari's counsel pleaded for mercy, arguing the former speaker
"admitted to the offense before the arraignment."
</P>
<P>
The allegations were first made on July 11 by a Lagos-based
newspaper, which claimed it had evidence that Buhari had lied.
They were submitted to the country's independence national
electoral commission.
</P>
<P>
The former speaker was arraigned before the Chief Magistrate of
the Abuja Magisterial District Alhaji Kolo Wednesday morning and
the Federal Intelligence. The Investigation Bureau of the Abuja
force command, which has been investigating the matter, will be
prosecuting the case, the Post Express, a major Nigerian newspaper
said Wednesday according to its own sources.

The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the
island through a bizonal, bicommunal federation formula, but so
far no tangible results have been achieved.

and 3.3 per- cent respectively, the losses in Rover became a heavy
burden, Dinner said at BMW's headquarters in Munich.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Joachim Milberg, chief of BMW, expected a
1.9-billion-mark deficit in Rover this year, partly owing to the
rising exchange rate of pound sterling.
</P>
<P>
Rover, which is now called "English patient" by BMW staff, was
taken over by BMW in 1994. Sales of Rover cars dropped by up to
one-half during the first six months of 1999, according to Dinner.
</P>
<P>
The British subsidiary is not expected to be profitable before
year 2002, when its parent company finishes the restructuring
procedure, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, BMW said its full-year profits would still reach the
same sum as last year, or 900 million marks.

<HEADLINE> Mir Crew Successfully Unravels Antenna in Space Walk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Two Russian cosmonauts aboard Mir
orbiting station took a space walk Wednesday and unraveled an
antenna they failed to open during a previous space work.
</P>
<P>
The crew commander, Viktor Afanasyev, and the flight engineer,
Sergei Avdeyev, also installed on the outer surface of the station
the SPRUT-6 device, a unique system for studying the effect on the
station of electric and magnetic fields, radiation and space
particles, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
They also installed a device that can detect spots air leaks of
the Mir, a device that experts believe will eventually become part
of the equipment for the International Space Station (ISS).
</P>
<P>
The cosmonauts brought back inside the station many equipment
and materials that had been installed outside the spaceship on
previous expeditions. They will be brought back to the earth for
tests, and the results will be used in building ISS components.
</P>
<P>
The spacewalk, the current crew's third one, was likely the
last one for Mir, as the space station would be left unmanned
after Afanasyev and Avdeyev leave for earth late next month.
</P>
<P>
Unless funds are raised to keep it afloat, Mir will descend
from orbit in February or March next year and sunk in the Pacific
Ocean, Interfax said.

<P>
LONDON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A big international gathering took
place in London on Wednesday to help cement the peace process in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The first of its kind since the government and the
Revolutionary United Front signed a peace agreement in the Togo on
7 July, the meeting was attended by the Sierra Leonean President,
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, and his Finance Minister, James Jonah.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Togo and Nigeria were among some 30
high-level delegations from what's known as the Contact Group for
Sierra Leone, and from international bodies including the UN, IMF
and World Bank.
</P>
<P>
British officials say they're here to help sustain the momentum
towards peace, and decide what steps the international community
should take next. As always, one of the main priorities will be
finding the money to make the agreement work. The peace agreement
signed earlier this month should enable Sierra Leone to begin to
address these massive needs.
</P>
<P>
Britain is expected to announce new pledges of aid to help pay
for Sierra Leone's reconstruction, and for the disarmament and
demobilization of rebel fighters, according to a BBC report.

<P>
KHARTOUM, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa
Osman Ismail welcomed the Egyptian and Libyan initiatives to
achieve reconciliation between the Sudanese government and its
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Upon return to Khatoum from a three-day visit to Kuwait, Ismail
described the Egyptian-Libyan role as positive, saying that it
could speed up the reconciliation process in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Sudan welcomes any foreign role that might unify the Sudanese
and restore stability in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Ismail and the Kuwaiti leaders reached
agreement on the restoration of diplomatic ties at the
ambassadorial level between the two countries and on the opening
of a Sudanese trade center in Kuwait City to promote trade and
investment exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The normalization of the Sudanese-Kuwaiti ties put an end to
the tension in relations between Sudan and most of the Arab Gulf
states since the 1991 Gulf war triggered by Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, according to Ismail.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese-Kuwaiti ties were severed after the Gulf war
because Kuwait accused Sudan of siding with Iraq.

Wednesday wrapped up their annual meetings here with calls for
increased cooperation from their dialogue partners in the
grouping's efforts for regional economic integration.

And many ASEAN member countries joined Singapore in cautioning
people against being complacent at a time when the region's
economies are beginning to take the road to recovery two years

should be continued and the risk of growing protectionism still
exists.

"Both sides (ASEAN and its dialogue partners) emphasized the
need to continue to cooperate for common good," Jayakumar added.

security concerns over the developments in the world, including
the Kosovo crisis, the U.S. missile attack on the Chinese embassy
in Yugoslavia and transboundary problems.
</P>

In the chairman's statement of the ARF, the ministers stressed
the importance of stable ties among the major powers and urged
them to promote dialogue and cooperation so as to maintain
regional stability.

<P>
The ministers expressed deep regret over the "tragic incident
involving the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia in early May."
</P>
<P>
In the AMM joint communique, the ministers reaffirmed their
commitment to the "one China" policy.

HARARE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Workers of the Zimbabwean
Newspapers Group said Wednesday they will strike if they are not
awarded a 40-percent cost- of-living salary adjustment which they
are demanding.
</P>
<P>
Philip Magwaza, chairman of the Harare branch workers'
committee of the Zimbabwean Newspapers, said the workers would
issue a 14-day notice of their planned action Thursday if they
fail to agree on anything with management Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Magwaza said the strike which had been planned for Wednesday
failed to take place to make room for negotiations which however
yielded nothing.
</P>
<P>
Jacob Chisese, general manager of Zimbabwean Newspapers Harare
branch, said disciplinary action would be taken against any worker
who would participate in the planned strike.
</P>
<P>
He said the workers' committee had signed an agreement in
January this year which stated that there would be no salary or
wage adjustment in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Following the tripartite negotiations held last year between
the government, business and labor, the government approved a
20-percent cost of living adjustment to all workers.

<P>
CAIRO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has named one of its top
diplomats as its new ambassador to the United States, a foreign
ministry spokesman said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Fahmi, a former advisor to Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
and currently Egypt's ambassador to Japan will take up his post in
the U.S. in September, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Ahmed Maher el-Seyed who has been serving in
Washington for years will be retiring, the spokesman said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Tuesday appointed 23
ambassadors and consuls, including Fahmi, to head Egyptian
diplomatic missions and consulates abroad, the country's Middle
East News Agency has reported.
</P>
<P>
Fahmi, 46, is a career diplomat and a Middle East expert who
had led Egypt's delegation to the multilateral talks held in line
with the Oslo Accord signed in 1993 but interrupted time and
again due to the differences between Israel and the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Fahmi's father, Ismael Fahmi, was foreign minister under the
late President Anwar Sadat but resigned after he differed with
Sadat over terms of Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is a key U.S. ally in the Middle East and the second
largest recipient after Israel of U.S. military and economic aid,

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Reconstruction, budgetary deficit
and immediate basic needs were identified Wednesday by an
international donor conference as the priorities for outside
financial assistance for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Though no definite money was pledged toward the priorities, the
European Union proposed a need of 300 million euro (315 million
U.S. dollars) as the immediate requirements for reconstruction.
The United Nations Mission in Kosovo proposed a need of 45 million
dollars to cover budgetary deficit, and the UNHCR proposed a need
of 200 million dollars to cover immediate basic needs in the
Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Uncertainty, however, arose about the pledges that were
announced after the one-day conference.
</P>
<P>
The official press release from the European Commission and the
World Bank, the co-hosts of the conference, said that 2.082
billion dollars had been pledged during the meeting but the figure
included funding "already disbursed during 1999".
</P>
<P>
The press release said "a more accurate figure for the global
costs of reconstruction, peace-implementation and recovery will be
possible in October 1999 at the next donor conference".
</P>
<P>
A European Union field investigation team in Kosovo suggested
that reconstruction of houses, schools and hospitals plus
electricity and water supply systems in Kosovo needs 800 million
euro (840 million dollars) alone.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Mining Sector Urged to Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- World Bank representative in Maputo
James Coates Wednesday urged the Mozambican government to reform
its mining sector in a bid to attract more domestic and foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
Coates made the call at a two-day symposium on policy and
strategy for Mozambique's mining sector, which ended Wednesday,
the Mozambique News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Mozambican government to revise its mining policy
to encourage investment.
</P>
<P>
The current mining law of the country cannot meet the needs of
the sector and cannot provide preferential conditions for
investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bank official suggested that the government back off from
direct production and take over mining administration, taxation,
environmental protection and infrastructure enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's mining sector consists mainly individual
craftsmen, which account for over 95 percent of the approximate
52,000 miners.
</P>
<P>
The sector earns about 20 million to 30 million U.S. dollars
in export revenue annually and provides a large amount of jobs for
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Coates urged the government to train miners with advanced
technology and create a good environment for investment so that
the sector could achieve sustainable development.

BONN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The majority of Germans today are not
willing to know more about the country's Nazi past half a century

</P>
<P>
"There are too many people who are not willing to know anything
more about the past and who feel it has nothing to do with them,
just like (the writer Martin) Walser," Ignatz Bubis, chairman of
German Jews' Central Council, told the Berliner Zeitung newspaper.

"I feel the majority of German people thinks so, and it is just

Bubis has since then repeatedly stressed the importance to

<HEADLINE> Two Somalis Sentenced to Death by Islamic Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 28 (Xinhua) --Despite widespread insecurity,
general lawlessness and anarchy in Somalia, there are still a few
places where the rule of law is working in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
An Islamic court in central Somalia's Hiran region Wednesday
shot dead two men in public after they were convicted for killing
two men earlier in the month .
</P>
<P>
The Islamic court of Beletuein started hearing the case
Tuesday. The defendants were accused of killing two men and
wounding two others on a vehicle passing through Jirta Qahno on
the outskirts of Mataban district on July 17.
</P>
<P>
The judge of the court decided that the accused committed first
degree murders and according to the law they should be executed in
public.
</P>
<P>
The defendants and their deceased victims belonged to two
different clans which had reached an agreement earlier that all
civil and penal cases between their clansmen should be solved in
accordance with the Islamic sharia laws.
</P>
<P>
The move Tuesday by the two former enemy clans is opening a new
page for the two clans who since 1994 had been fighting in Hiran
region. In this endeavor, the Islamic courts also gain more
support and popularity.
</P>
<P>
The nomadic clan-based arrogance in Somalia has since the past
nine years been devastating the ordinary civilians in the main
towns of the Somalia. Armed youngsters keep moving around taking
the law in their hands with the feeling that their clan is the
best compared with the rest, a feeling which has created armed
confrontations and revenge-taking operations.

<HEADLINE> South Africa's Mediation in DRC Crisis in Full </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A high-powered South African
delegation arrived in Kigali, Rwanda, late Tuesday in a bid to
have Rwanda use its influence on Congolese rebels to resolve their
internal dispute and sign the Lusaka peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Signed on July 10 by heads of state of six countries involved
in the nearly one-year-old Congolese Conflict.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is led by South African Foreign Minister
Nkosazana Zuma, and is comprised of former foreign minister Alfred
Nzo and former defense minister Joe Modisse, the Rwanda News
Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zuma refused to talk to the press, saying that she had brought
a message for Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu from his South
African counterpart Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
The South African delegation also met Congolese rebels led by
Bizima Karaha, head of the security department, yet no statement
was made. In the early afternoon, the South African delegation
met with Rwandan Vice- President Major General Paul Kagame before
leaving the capital.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in the capital believe that the negotiations were not
easy with Rwanda and the rebels who have so far failed to find
justification for Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, ousted leader of the
Congolese Rally for Democracy, to sign the Lusaka accord.
</P>
<P>
''We asked people in Dar es Salaam why they were insisting on
Wamba, who is an individual like any other Congolese, to endorse
the cease-fire, but (they) failed to provide convincing
arguments,'' Karaha said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, efforts to have rebels solve their differences
are continuing with a meeting of regional heads of state due in
Dar es Salaam early next week.
</P>
<P>
A well-informed source in the State Protocol in Kigali told the
news agency that Tanzanian Foreign Minister is expected in Rwanda
on Thursday, apparently to invite President Bizimungu to attend
the above meeting.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Reiterates Adherence to One-China Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid on Wednesday reiterated the league's adherence to its
one-China policy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Abdel-Meguid stressed that there
is only one China in the world and the government of the People's
Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing
the whole of China.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the 22-nation pan-Arab organization reiterated
that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China.
</P>
<P>
He expressed deep worry over the developments of the tense
situation in the Taiwan Straits, triggered by separatist remarks
made by Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
Lee claimed in an interview with a German radio early this
month that the Taiwan authorities had defined the cross-Straits
relations as "state-to-state, or at least special state-to-state
relations."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has condemned Lee's remarks as an utter
exposure of his premeditated intentions to divide China's
territory and sovereignty, and create "two Chinas," "one China,
one Taiwan" or "Taiwan's independence."
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid voiced concern that the tensions in the Taiwan
Straits may lead to possible interference by foreign forces which
will aggravate the tensions.
</P>
<P>
However, he underlined that the Arab League supports all the
steps taken by the Chinese government in an effort to reunify the
country under the principle of "one country, two systems."

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam Wednesday hailed the 32nd
ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM) and the sixth ASEAN Regional Forum
(ARF) which just concluded in Singapore, saying the meetings were
successful and held in "an intensified atmosphere and frank and
cooperative spirit."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Phan Thuy Thanh said this was the
first time that the annual ASEAN Ministerial Meeting brought
together all 10 Southeast Asian countries, as Cambodia was just
admitted into the ASEAN group in Hanoi in April this year.
</P>
<P>
"The above-mentioned meetings constitute a new important step
of development in the spirit of cooperation and mutual trust to
together cope with the challenges in the complicated political and
economic situation in the region and the world as a whole," Thanh
stressed.
</P>
<P>
She noted that at the AMM, ASEAN foreign ministers considered
and agreed upon a series of important issues relating to ASEAN
cooperation and activities in many fields covering economic
restoration, ASEAN's future development orientation, common
concerns of ASEAN and its dialogue partners, the ARF process, the
implementation of agreements reached at the sixth ASEAN Summit in
Hanoi, and economic, political and security cooperation among
others.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has actively contributed to the success of the 32nd
ASEAN Ministerial Meeting and the sixth ASEAN Regional Forum and
is greatly satisfied with the outcome of these events, the
spokeswoman said.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Drive Up South Africa's Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's annualized
Producer Price Index (PPI) rose to 6.4 percent in June from 6.0
percent in May, largely due to higher international oil prices,
Statistics South Africa said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On a month-on-month basis, the index rose by 0.6 percent, and
by an even larger 0.9 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis.
</P>
<P>
Prices of locally produced commodities rose 5.5 percent
year-on-year in June, 0.4 percentage points higher than the annual
rate of increase in May. The monthly increase of 0.5 percent was
markedly lower than the 1.1 percent month-on-month increase in
May.
</P>
<P>
The 12-cent-per-liter rise in the petrol price and slightly
higher agricultural product prices were responsible for more than
half the monthly increase.
</P>
<P>
Compared with a year ago, the prices of imported goods rose 1.5
percent month-on-month.
</P>
<P>
The June figure of 6.4 percent is slightly higher than the
market expectation of 6.2 percent. However, economists believe
that barring any further oil price shocks, producer inflation has
probably peaked for the year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambians have been urged to change
their negative sexual behavior in order to stem HIV/AIDs scourge.
</P>
<P>
Acting Permanent Secretary of the Finance Ministry David
Diangamo told the dissemination seminar for the 1998 results of
the Zambia sexual behavior survey, that the HIV/AIDs epidemic has
become a serious problem which needs to be addressed aggressively
by all.
</P>
<P>
The results show that 86 percent of people know of the HIV/AIDs
virus in Zambia, and that sexual behavior has not changed
drastically from 1996 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
About six percent know about their HIV status and only eight
percent of the respondents said they had been tested for HIV,
according to the survey by the central statistical office in
conjunction with the country's central board of health.
</P>
<P>
Diangamo told the seminar held here Wednesday that "this state
of affairs calls for concerted efforts by all the people of this
country. It requires increased involvement of all the civil
society, as well as involvement of our cooperating partners."
</P>
<P>
Diangamo called on the central statistical office, the health
ministry and cooperating partners to come up with well designed,
comprehensive, nationwide, representative survey to determine
accurately the incidence of HIV/AIDs in his country, where 20
percent of adult population is HIV positive.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
responded to an appeal by Zambian President Frederick Chiluba to
aid the funding of the Lusaka peace process for the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Mandated by the Southern African Development Community, Chiluba
is leading the process to implement a peaceful solution to the
fighting in the DRC, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Head of the EU delegation to the SADC, Robert Collingwood and
SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende are expected to sign an
agreement under which the EU would fund the process with 2.65
million euros.
</P>
<P>
The signing would take place in Gaborone, Botswana, the sitting
of SADC headquarters, on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"We see this as a significant step toward bringing lasting
peace to the DRC," Collingwood was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Mandating the peace process was the first time SADC had used
its muscle in such a way and the EU welcomes the opportunity to
support its efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Application of the grant had been backdated to May.
</P>
<P>
"This is rare," Colingwood said. "But, coming as it does some
time after the start of the peace process, the EU has agreed some
of the money can be used to pick up debts incurred along the way."

ADDIS ABABA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's Health Ministry

patients across the country.
</P>
<P>
Solomon Metema, an expert of the National Tuberculosis and

the country.
</P>
<P>
TB patients occupy about 30 to 60 percent of hospital beds in
some towns of the country, Solomon said, adding that the number of
TB patients is likely to increase due to the growing rate of
HIV/AIDS infection in the country.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that there are some 2.5 million carriers
of HIV, a virus that leads to the deadly AIDS, in Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> 1.5 Million Zimbabweans Contract HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.5 million Zimbabweans
have contracted the HIV virus which causes AIDS since the pandemic
was first detected in 1985, Health and Child Welfare Minister
Timothy Stamps said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Stamps made the remarks at the opening of a two-day Zimbabwe
Indigenous Economic Empowerment Organization workshop held here to
sensitize small and medium-scale enterprises on AIDS/HIV and
sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
He said more than 400,000 of the people had developed
full-blown AIDS and almost three-quarters had already died.
</P>
<P>
"We have difficulty in identifying HIV infection at an early
stage. The history of AIDS in Zimbabwe is different from that in
the United States and Europe where people can live with AIDS for
years because of early diagnosis and treatment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe and other countries in the region had no funds to buy
the drugs for sustaining life in AIDS patients as they were very
expensive, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, more than 100,000 new AIDS cases would have
occurred in 1999. At present, Zimbabwe has a population of 12.5
million.
</P>
<P>
Stamps said TB cases had ballooned since AIDS was identified,
with 2,040 cases identified in 1985 and 47,077 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
HIV infection and TB facilitated the transmission of TB to
non-HIV people.
</P>
<P>
"In Zimbabwe HIV has entrenched its position within the
population, posing serious challenges unprecedented in our time,"
Stamps said.
</P>
<P>
"The widespread nature of the infection will have an adverse
impact on every segment of economic development in our country."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe had about 475,000 AIDS orphans and the pressure on
children to go to the streets because they could not be
accommodated by the extended family was becoming increasingly
noticeable.
</P>
<P>
Stamps said if the epidemic was uncontrolled, life expectancy
at birth would be reduced to 20 years in the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
He added that between 50 and 70 percent of bed occupancy in
hospitals was taken up by AIDS patients.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Denies Selling Arms to Rebels in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Wednesday denied
allegations that it was supplying military equipment to the rebels
fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
South African High Commissioner to Zimbabwe Jeremiah Ndou said
in an interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency that South Africa
only sold arms to Rwanda before the war in the DRC broke out.
</P>
<P>
He said the reasons for trading with Rwanda were economic and
not to trigger or fuel the war as had been alleged.
</P>
<P>
"We never sold arms to the rebels. The fact, of course, is
South Africa has been trading with African and many other
countries. It has always been for economic reasons," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In Africa we sold hard-core arms to countries like Rwanda and
Namibia before the war broke out in the DRC. After the war
started there were never any arms traded with those countries."
</P>
<P>
"We have a policy which says that we can't trade with countries
which are involved in a war -- countries which are going to
utilize the arms for the continuation of the conflict and this
includes parties involved. We are serious about this," Ndou said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, together with Chad, Namibia and Angola, deployed
troops to the DRC after the Tutsi rebels launched the attack
against President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Namibia, Angola, Zimbabwe, Rwanda, Uganda and the DRC
government recently have signed a ceasefire agreement in Lusaka,
Zambia, which the rebels are yet to sign.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Lawyer to Defend Rwanda Genocide Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A Belgian lawyer will come
to Tanzania to defend Bernard Ntuyahaga, a former army officer
wanted by both Rwanda and Belgium for his role in the 1994 Rwanda
genocide.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga's current lawyer Jwain Mwaikusa said this at the
Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court in the Tanzanian capital
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The accused, who speaks French, alleged that he has language
problems and needs Temmerman, who has been his lawyer since 1995,
to work together with Mwaikusa.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian lawyer had been applying for defending Ntuyahaga
for weeks before he got permission from Tanzania's Chief Justice
on July 15, Mwaikusa said.
</P>
<P>
Mwaikusa, a teacher at the Law Department of the University of
Dar es Salaam, told Principal Resident Magistrate Projestus
Rugazia, who presided over the case, that the Belgian lawyer is
expected to arrive in Dar es Salaam on August 17.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Tanzanian laws, a case must be mentioned
again within two weeks. Therefore, Mwaikusa requested the court
to mention the case on August 11.
</P>
<P>
State Attorney Zakayo Bajana, who stands for the prosecution
side, told the judge that he has no objection to the date.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga had appeared in the court two weeks ago. The case
has been adjourned several times since it was heard by the Kisutu
court on May 12 this year.
</P>
<P>
Major Ntuyahaga, the former Head of Logistics at Kigali
military camp in Rwanda, allegedly murdered former Rwandan Prime
Minister Agathe Uwiningiyimana and 10 Belgium U.N. peacekeepers
escorting her in the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old man fell into the hand of the Tanzanian
government in March this year after the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), based in Arusha in northern Tanzania,
dropped charges of genocide and crimes against humanity against
him and released him in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga was then re-arrested by the Tanzanian police and
wanted by both Rwanda and Belgium for extradition and trial.

JOHANNESBURG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The South African rand ended
weaker Wednesday against the U.S. dollar, ignoring the mixed bag
of economic data released at the same day.
</P>
<P>
The trade data showed a foreign trade surplus of 2.3 billion
rand (383 million U.S. dollars) in June compared with 2.2 billion

inflation rate in June was 6.4 percent, 0.4 percentage point

</P>
<P>
The local currency was last traded at 6.1440 rand per dollar,
compared with its previous close of 6.1250.
</P>

Dealers said although the rand looked to have ignored the

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Article Calls for Proper Handling of Falun Gong Practitioners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper "People
's Daily" will publish a commentator's article tomorrow calling
for properly dealing with the Falun Gong issue.
</P>
<P>
The majority of Falun Gong practitioners who have broken away
from the illegal organization should be united and educated, the
article says, emphasizing that policies must be strictly observed
as the nationwide fight against Falun Gong goes on.
</P>
<P>
Every Chinese shoulders the responsibility to help the
practitioners realize the political nature and the serious harm
of Li Hongzhi and the Falun Dafa he concocted, and aid them to
uphold materialism against idealism, and adhere to atheism as
opposed to theism.
</P>
<P>
We should also make an effort to pull the practitioners out of
the absurd world created by Li Hongzhi, help them shift their
attention to the domestic and international situation and issues,
to the future of their motherland and the Party, and to the
ongoing opening and reforms and the socialist modernization drive,
the article notes.
</P>
<P>
The government policies call for uniting and educating the
majority of Falun Gong practitioners, to ensure the ideological
and political struggle against Falun Gong roll ahead in a sound
way.
</P>
<P>
And a clear line of demarcation needs to be drawn between the
ordinary practitioners and the core organizers and propagandists
of Falun Gong; between ordinary core members and the small number
of behind-the-scenes plotters and organizers who harbor political
ambitions; between those people who have realized their mistakes
and wish to correct them, and those diehards; between those who
did wrong before the central authorities' ban, and those who did
so afterwards, the article points out.
</P>
<P>
Proper handling of the Falun Gong issue will help eliminate
hidden dangers, maintain stability, and push ahead the reforms,
opening up and socialist modernization drive, the article says.

<HEADLINE> Vote for East Timor's Future Delayed Till August 30 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has decided to postpone the vote to determine the status of
East Timor by a week until August 30, it was announced here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the decision after consulting with Indonesia and
Portugal, said a U.N. spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The ballot, or popular consultation by the eligible citizens
aged 17 and above among the 800,000 East Timorese, was originally
set for August 8, according to an agreement reached between
Indonesia, Portugal and the United Nations on May 5.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general changed the date later to August 20 or 21
because of security concerns and logistics preparations. He also
changed the voter registration date from July 12 to 16.
</P>
<P>
The ballot is to see whether the local people want wide-range
autonomy within Indonesia or independence. East Timor has been
seen by the United Nations as a non-self-governing territory
administered by Indonesia since 1976.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia annexed the former Portuguese colony of East Timor in
1976.
</P>
<P>
The May 5 accord mandated the U.N. with mission to organize and
conduct the vote.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said Annan's latest
decision was made because of the registration delay and technical
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the new date is "firm," he said it is a firm date, "but
everything is firm until you change if conditions so require."
</P>
<P>
He expected the U.N. Security Council to discuss East Timor
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Pan-African Festival to Open in Ghana Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 NAIROBI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- PANAFEST '99, the fourth
Pan-African Historical Theatre Festival, opens in Cape Coast,
Ghana Saturday with an expected attendance of more than 5,000
participants, making it the biggest yet in the series which
started in 1992, the Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
 Running from July 30 to August eight, the festival is under
the theme: "The re-emergence of African civilization: Uniting
the African family: Youth -- the agenda for the new millennium".
</P>
<P>
 PANAFEST is a biennial cultural event dedicated to the
enhancement of the ideals of Pan-Africanism and the development of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
 Being the last version before the next millennium, this
year's festival assumes a broader dimension and, like the previous
one, PANAFEST ' 97, it has been scheduled to coincide with another
international event, Emancipation Day.
</P>
<P>
 Participants at PANAFEST '97 experienced a rare cultural
treat when it clashed with the Oguaa Fetu Afahye, festival of the
people of Cape Coast Traditional area, which is one of the
PANAFEST venues together with Elmina and Accra.
</P>
<P>
 Emancipation Day, which marks the abolition of chattel
slavery in British colonies in 1834 and the Americas in 1865,
occupies a place in the PANAFEST program with a vigil at the Cape
Coast Castle and the slave dungeons.
</P>
<P>
Another PANAFEST event brought on by the Emancipation Day
celebrations is the international soccer match that pitches
Jamaica's Reggae Boyz in separate duels with the Black Stars and
Asante Kotoko.
</P>
<P>
 PANAFEST '99 has also seen the highest list of sponsors, and
the number keeps rising each day, as organizers never hesitate to
impress upon individuals and institutions, the need to make it the
greatest cultural event on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
 As the Chairman of the PANAFEST Foundation, Mr Kojo Yankah
put it, funds accruing from the festival would be used to put up
a PANAFEST Village to be used as venues and to house facilities to
give the festival a stronger sense of permanence.
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the eight-day festival include a grand durbar of
African chiefs and people, a three-day Pan-African colloquium, on
the festival's theme.
</P>
<P>
 There would be special days for countries participating, a
Women's Day,
</P>
<P>
Visual Arts Exhibition and International Musical Concert.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 artistic groups and individuals from about 30
countries, including Ghana, the U.S., United Kingdom, Jamaica,
Trinidad and Tobago, Brazil, Nigeria, Uganda, Gambia, Zimbabwe
and South Africa are expected to perform at the festival.

<HEADLINE> Blair Begins UK Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
began the long-awaited government reshuffle on Wednesday, but only
one cabinet minister, Secretary of State for Wales Alun Michael,
will be leaving the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"There are no senior level changes other than Alun Michael has
stood down," Reuters quoted Blair's spokesman as saying. "There
will be wide-ranging changes at junior minister level, which will
be completed tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Michael had been expected to step down from the cabinet to take
over as first minister of the devolved Welsh assembly, set up
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Speculation over the reshuffle had focused on the future of
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam and Health Secretary Frank
Dobson, both of whom retained their portfolios, at least for now,
Reuters said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, responsible for the
environment,transport and the regions, had also faced a volley of
criticism in the days leading up to the reshuffle, according to
local media reports.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Repeats Inflation Warnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan repeated his warnings Wednesday that the Fed will move
again to raise interest rates if inflation appeared set to rise.
</P>
<P>
In his testimony to the Senate Banking Committee, Greenspan
said once again, "If new data suggest it is likely that the pace
of cost and price increases will be picking up, the Federal
Reserve will have to act promptly and forcefully so as to preclude
imbalances from arising that would only require a more disruptive
adjustment later."
</P>
<P>
Greenspan appears before Congress twice a year, at separate
House and Senate hearings, to provide an update on the central
bank's views. The assessment he gave senators wednesday was nearly
identical to what he told members of the House Banking Committee
on July 22.
</P>
<P>
Stock prices have retreated from all-time highs since that
warning that the Fed is ready to nudge interest rates higher if
the economy shows signs of overheating, such as rising consumer
prices or labor costs.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan also raised concerns about overconfidence among stock
market investors who may think that the nation's eight-year
economic expansion can continue indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said that 1999 has been "an exceptional year for the
American economy," with almost 1.25 million jobs created and no
pickup yet in consumer prices so far.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed the need for "preemptive policy-making" by the
Fed should there be signs of trouble.
</P>
<P>
U.S. lawmakers, however, repeatedly asked the Fed chairman for
his views on the budget surplus and how to use it rather than for
his views on monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
He noted the uncertainty of projecting future government
surpluses, which some members of Congress want to use to finance a
tax cut and others want to earmark for various new programs.
</P>
<P>
"We probably would be better off holding off on a tax cut
immediately, largely because it is apparent that the surpluses are
doing a great deal of good to the economy," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the tone of Greenspan's report to Congress is a
strong indication that the Fed still may raise interest rates
again before the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Barak Inform Clinton on Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak have separately
briefed President Bill Clinton on their Tuesday talks on Peace
process, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Barak would like to merge the implementation of the Wye
agreement with "final status" talks, but would honor the Wye
accord if that was the Palestinians' wish, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
"He had some ideas with respect to how Wye and the final status
talks might be merged at some point that he wanted to lay out for
Chairman Arafat," Berger told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Barak... said to Chairman Arafat that he had every intention
of implementing the Wye agreement if that was their mutual
desire,"he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Barak met on Tuesday at the Erez border crossing
between Israel and the Gaza Strip. They reached no agreement on
the implementation of the Wye agreement. But they agreed that
lower-level officials would discuss the issue over the next few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
"There will be further meetings at a working level over the
next few weeks at which point I think we will have some decisions
about whether we're going down the Wye road or... down a road that
has some modifications," Berger said.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Promotes Industrial Peace for Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 28 (Xinhua) - Alhaji Muhammad Mumuni, Ghanaian
minister of Employment and Social Welfare, urged the private
sector Wednesday to support government's initiative to achieving
higher economic growth by ensuring a peaceful industrial
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
 He said this would demand collective decision-making systems
based on dialog and consensus at workplaces to suit the specific
needs of all partners, the Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
 "Greater involvement of our workers in decision-making
processes at the workplace and a more open process of information
sharing and dissemination will be important in keeping militants
out of business," the minister told the annual meeting of the
Ghana Employers Association (GEA) in Accra.
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, which assembled the largest participation of top
business executives mainly from the private sector, was under the
theme "the challenges of the next millennium: role of employers'
organizations".
</P>
<P>
 It also marked the 40th anniversary of the GEA, a partner of
the tripartite committee, which fixes minimum wages. Other
members are the government and the trades unions.
</P>
<P>
Mumuni said government had initiated a new relationship with
the tripartite based on complementarity, consensus building and
participation.
</P>
<P>
 "It is a strategy which has been found to be more productive
and more positively related to the progress and development of
our enterprises and the country at large," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
 He was particular about industrial peace because the
government remains the largest employer in the country,
accounting for about two- thirds of the active working population.
</P>
<P>
 However, the labor environment, especially in 1998, was
unstable with pockets of industrial unrest.
</P>
<P>
 At least 83 labor disputes were recorded in 1998 as against
37 in the previous year while 306 disagreements between workers
and employers occurred in the same year compared with 109 in
1997.
</P>
<P>
To the minister, the "extreme enlightenment and liberalism" that
have marked the new relationship between all tripartite partners
should serve as a basis for ensuring that industrial disputes are
not carried to heights that would endanger the production
processes of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
 He pledged the support of the government to the private
sector by reforming and strengthening the public service to make
it more efficient to serve the leading role of the private
sector.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Plans Computer Monitoring System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government is planning
to create a security network to monitor and protect the nation's
most important computer systems from intruders, the White House
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton directed federal agencies earlier this
year to draft a plan to deal with the increasing problem, White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to build an elaborate network of
electronic obstacles, monitors and analyzers to watch for
potentially suspicious activity on federal computer systems.
</P>
<P>
The first 500 intrusion monitors would be installed on
nonmilitary computers next year. The full system would be
completed by May 20, 2003.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton has warned that a "concerted attack on the
computers of any one of our key economic sectors or governmental
agencies could have catastrophic effects."
</P>
<P>
"Where once our opponents relied exclusively on bombs and
bullets, hostile powers and terrorists can now turn a laptop
computer into a potent weapon capable of doing enormous damage,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Civil liberties groups complain that the security tools also
would make possible unprecedented electronic monitoring, especially
because of the increasingly widespread use of computers by the
government in almost every aspect of its citizens' daily lives.
</P>
<P>
But the Clinton administration pledged that no proposal would
"infringe on civil liberties, privacy rights or proprietary
information."
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned about protecting privacy rights,"
Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said Wednesday
at the White House.

<HEADLINE> White House Denies Clark Forced Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The White House denied
Wednesday that an early outgoing of U.S. General Wesley Clark as
NATO commander is because of the way he handles the air campaign
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Gen. Clark is a superb commander. The president has the
highest degree of confidence in him," Sandy Berger, President Bill
Clinton's national security adviser, told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"He did a superb job in the prosecution of the campaign in
Kosovo. Witness the fact that we won," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reports had said that Clark would be forced to step down in
April next year, three months earlier before he completed his
term.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report quoted several U.S. administration
and military officials as saying that Clark had rifts with the
Clinton administration during the 78-day campaign.
</P>
<P>
Clark argued "strenuously" that the option of using ground
troops in Kosovo not be removed from the table and he chafed at
the graduated air campaign dictated by the 19-member NATO
alliance.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified officials also said that Clark was not
particularly close to Defense Secretary William Cohen and the two
often communicated through an intermediary.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported in its Wednesday edition that the
timing of Clark's departure had been dictated by a desire to move
Air Force General Joseph Ralston into the NATO job.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's New Treasury Officer Stresses Discipline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's new chief Treasury civil
servant pledged Wednesday to establish a culture of financial
discipline and efficiency in a bid to to rebuild confidence for
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Martin Oduor-Otieno was appointed permanent secretary in the
Finance Ministry by President Daniel arap Moi last week, in a
minor shake-up intended to clean up the public service.
</P>
<P>
"We will see greater financial discipline, and will seek
efficient collection of taxes. We will set targets and monitor
them closely. That will be a major theme of my tenure,"
Oduor-Otieno said.
</P>
<P>
Oduor-Otieno admitted that Kenya's economy was in deep trouble
but said the president was hoping to turn things around in three
months.
</P>
<P>
He said Moi had given Oduor-Otieno and his new colleagues a
free hand to take what action was needed.
</P>
<P>
Oduor-Otieno, formerly finance and planning director at
Barclays Bank of Kenya, was one of several private sector leaders
tapped by Moi to "change the culture of corruption and
inefficiency in our public service'' and restart the economy.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's economy is predicted to grow at just 1.6 percent this
year, well

below population growth, while the government admitted last week
that Kenya had fallen into an "economic morass".
</P>
<P>
Part of its economic plight lies in a loan suspension by the
International Monetary Fund in July 1997. Other international
donors followed, pushing Kenya into a tighter financial corner.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,000 people have fled
their homes after five-day clashes over cattle-grazing in Garissa
District, Kenya' s North Eastern Province, Xinhua learnt here
Wednesday.
</P>

of dismantling weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. When its
people departed Baghdad last December because of U.S. and British
air-strikes against Iraq, they left the samples unremoved.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. spokesman said here Wednesday that the samples were
destroyed as a result of U.N. Security Council consultations
Tuesday. Diplomatic observers of France, China and Russia observed
the destruction, he said.
</P>
<P>
The destruction of the samples of chemical agents and mustard
gas was not intended to last so long. It was the finding of the VX
nerve gas samples in the lab which delayed a U.N. team's work as
the UNSCOM had not reported the matter to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The experts from the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons plus an independent expert have departed Iraq and
are expected to arrive in the Netherlands Thursday, U.N. spokesman
Manoel de Almeida e Silva said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Satisfied With Stepashin's Visit to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin said Thursday that President Boris Yeltsin had in
principle approved the results of his trip to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Boris Yeltsin gave a positive evaluation to what was worked
out by our delegation during the visit to the U.S.," Stepashin
told reporters after a meeting at the Kremlin with Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
He said, when referring to his meetings with U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, that the American side
had received assurances that Russia is not interested in the
proliferation of nuclear weapons or in increasing the number of
countries possessing ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the Gore-Stepashin Commission is concerned, until
my talks with Gore I was not sure whether it would continue its
work at all. There was a long interval in its work due to the
elections in the U.S. and the preparations for elections in Russia,
" the Interfax news agency quoted Stepashin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Next time the commission will convene in Moscow in the autumn,
he said, adding that "by this time the U.S. will adopt a document
which recognizes Russia as a country with a market economy."
</P>
<P>
"We made serious advances after a certain pause and anxiety
caused by the situation in Yugoslavia," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed to the IMF decision Wednesday to resume its 4.
5 billion dollars loan for Russia as a success of his U.S. trip.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the U.S. side tried to link the release of
the IMF loans to Russia with Moscow's aid to Yugoslavia, but
Stepashin defended the Russian position, Interfax said, quoting
government sources.
</P>
<P>
NATO's 78-day air campaign against Yugoslavia destroyed
factories, bridges, power stations and other infrastructures,
besides military installations.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin was quoted as saying that "aid absolutely must be
given to Yugoslavia, as in the winter its ruined economy will fail
to supply the population with everything it needs, which may lead
to a humanitarian catastrophe."

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, U.S. Firm Sign Agreements on Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government Thursday
signed four agreements with U.S.-based AES Corporation for the
installation of the 450-megawatt Meghnaghat combined cycle power
plant, the national news agency BSS reported.
</P>
<P>
The four agreements are on the implementation of the project,
the biggest in the private sector, power purchase, land lease and
gas supply.
</P>
<P>
The AES Corporation was selected by the Bangladeshi government
and it would sell power to the Power Development Board (PDB).
</P>
<P>
The project will be completed within 37 months, according to
the agreements.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, the AES Corporation will invest 300
million U.S. dollars in implementing the project.
</P>
<P>
When completed, the Meghnaghat Power Plant Project will be
beneficial to 16 percent of the 128 million people in the country.
</P>
<P>
Only about 15 percent of the total population in the country
have now access to electricity, and the present capacity of the
PDB with 52 generation units under 18 power stations is between
2,000 and 2,100 megawatts, whereas the country's total need is
about 2,300 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has adopted a policy of privatizing
the power sector. Encouraged by the policy, a number of local and
foreign companies have come forward to invest in the power sector.
</P>
<P>
The government is also encouraging both local and foreign
private entrepreneurs to take part in the development of the power
sector in a bid to solve the country's severe power shortage.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Reiterates Commitment to Wye Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALEXANDRIA (Egypt), July 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak on Thursday committed himself to the Wye peace
agreement with the Palestinians, but said he wants to make changes
if Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat agrees.
</P>
<P>
"I am committed to the Wye accord. We are going to implement
the deal," Barak told a joint news conference with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak after their meeting in Alexandria, 220
kilometers northwest of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Barak said he would like to modify the Wye River accord, but
"only if we agree upon it with Chairman Arafat (of the Palestinian
National Authority)."
</P>
<P>
"I feel that we have to go forward, but I never pretended to
have magic solutions to a conflict of 100 years in three weeks or
three months," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister left for home after a day-long visit
to Egypt for discussions with Mubarak on ways of reviving the
Middle East peace process. This was the second meeting between the
two leaders in 20 days after Barak assumed power early this month.
</P>
<P>
After election in May, Barak has repeatedly expressed readiness
to carry out the Wye accord which calls on Israel to withdraw from
another 13.1 percent of the West Bank in three phases.
</P>
<P>
But he, meanwhile, proposed the third phase of troop pullback
be combined with the more complicated negotiations on a final
peace deal with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, on the other hand, insists that the accord be
implemented "fully and accurately" before the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Seeking to allay Arafat's fears, Mubarak stressed that Barak is
keen to implement the Wye peace deal, saying he expects a delay of
two to three weeks in its implementation.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he believes there is a chance for the
implementation to start and for the peace negotiations to advance
between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak called on the two sides to show flexibility in their
peace talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- India and Russia Thursday signed
a protocol here to prepare the agenda for the next session of the
Indo-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission (IRIGC) scheduled for
November-December this year.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was signed by Indian Finance Minister Yashwant
Sinha and Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko,
who arrived here Wednesday for a four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Following the signing ceremony, Sinha told the press that
Russia had proposed using the rupee debt with India for setting up
a joint venture to manufacture light- and medium-sized passenger
aircraft in India.
</P>
<P>
Sinha said that a working group would be set up for firming up
proposals for the joint venture and the capacity of the two types
of aircraft could be 100 and 200 seats.
</P>
<P>
Khristenko also called on Indian caretaker Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee Thursday and the two leaders discussed bilateral
issues during their 30-minute meeting, officials here said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Khristenko proposed setting up a rupee account
for investment in India and asked India to provide concession to
rupee trade with Russia on par with other hard currency exports to
increase bilateral trade between the two countries, which fell by
23.23 percent in 1998-99 due mainly to the fall of traditional
exports and imports.
</P>
<P>
The main task of Khristenko's visit is to review the progress
of the implementation of the decision taken at the fifth session
of the IRIGC, held in Moscow in December last year.
</P>
<P>
India and Russia had set a target of doubling their bilateral
trade by 2000. Two-way trade between the two countries stood at
525.9 billion rupees (approximately 1.25 billion U.S. dollars) in
1998-99.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi hopes that the scheduled visit later this year by
Russian President Boris Yeltsin would further strengthen bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
India also showed keen interest in sourcing rough diamonds from
Russia. An Indian delegation had recently visited Moscow to
explore the possibilities of making direct purchase of the
diamonds.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Urged to Understand Nature of Struggle Against Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- An article to be appeared tomorrow
in the "People's Daily", China's leading newspaper, urges the
Chinese people to further understand the nature of the struggle
against Falun Gong, though initial achievements have been realized.
</P>
<P>
"We should recognize that the current efforts of exposing Li
Hongzhi, founder of Falun Gong, is a struggle which has an
important bearing on the fundamental faith of communists, on the
ideological basis for uniting the Chinese people, and on the
destiny and future of the Communist Party and the government. It
is a political struggle in the ideological sphere about winning
over the broad masses of people" the article says.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong intends to erode the minds of practitioners and
manipulate them in a bid to have them contend with the government.
It has posed a serious threat to the state and people, the paper
says.
</P>
<P>
The article calls on Party committees at all levels to
undertake painstaking ideological work among ordinary Chinese and
Party members alike, and help them understand what kind of a man
Li Hongzhi is, and what kind of organization Falun Gong is.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced retaliation
Thursday against the European Union (EU) for refusing to lift the
10-year ban on Canadian Beef.
</P>
<P>
Canadian International Trade Minister Sergio Marchi and
Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief jointly announced that tariffs
of 100 percent will be imposed beginning from August 1, 1999, on
EU exports of beef, Pork, cucumbers and gherkins to Canada.
</P>
<P>
"Canada is taking this action in response to the EU's failure
to abide by its international trade obligations," Marchi said.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Agriculture Minister Vanclief explained the goal "is
to regain access to the EU market, not retaliate."
</P>
<P>
Canadian government officials have been in consultations this
week with the World Trade Organization (WTO) on the final list of
retaliation against EU exports.
</P>
<P>
The official announcement said that Canada received authority
from the WTO on Monday to retaliate after the EU failed to comply
with the WTO ruling to lift the ban on May 13, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The EU introduced the ban in 1989 on Canadian beef produced by
using growth Hormones.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Welcomes IMF Decision to Renew Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin on Thursday welcomed the IMF decision to renew financing
for Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Fund will provide 4.5 billion U.S. dollars of loans in
seven tranches, three this year and four in 2000, according to
Aleksei Mozhin, IMF director for Russia.
</P>
<P>
The first tranche of 640 million dollars will be released to
Russia's account on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The extension of IMF loans was discussed during Stepashin's
Washington visit earlier this week, when the American side tried
to link the release of the loans with Moscow's aid to Yugoslavia
while Stepashin held different position, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
NATO's 78-day air campaign against Yugoslavia destroyed
factories, bridges, power stations and other infrastructures,
besides military installations.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin was quoted by the Interfax as saying that "aid
absolutely must be given to Yugoslavia, as in the winter its
ruined economy will fail to supply the population with everything
it needs, which may lead to a humanitarian catastrophe."
</P>
<P>
The loans will not be released directly to Moscow but will be
transferred to Russia's account with the IMF in order to refinance
the country's debt. Russia is due to repay the IMF 4.4 billion
dollars this year, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
IMF funding for Russia was suspended last August in the
aftermath of the country's financial crisis. Moscow has been
trying to persuade the IMF to resume financing for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
The IMF decision Wednesday will restore confidence in Russia's
economic policy and open the doors to decisions on further World
Bank loans and the Paris Club talks, Mozhin said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's foreign debt now totals 200 billion dollars, with 150
billion dollars owed by the state, almost at the same level with
its annual gross domestic product of 170 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Beleagued Bailey Receives Sympathy From Pan Am Flag Bearer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Beleagued Canadian
sprinter Donovan Bailey, who has been urged to return the 20,000
dollars he got for promoting the 13th Pan Am Games, receive a much-
welcome support from cycling champion Tanya Dubnicoff.
</P>
<P>
Winnipegger Dubnicoff, the Games official flag bearer who won
gold in the 500m time trial yesterday, said people should forget
about the black cloud following Bailey these days.
</P>
<P>
"I think the media should just relax," she said. "The guy has
just recovered from a severe injury. He's lucky to walk again,
never mind run."
</P>
<P>
"He's here competing in the 4X100m. People should be happy and
behind him."
</P>
<P>
The former world record holder, who sold his image to the Pan
Am organizers for a total of 200,000 Canadian dollars, has been
widely criticized after deciding to run nothing other than a relay
race and snubbing the opening ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
Some high-profile athletes, including three-time rowing Olympic
gold medalist Marnie McBean, even demanded Bailey should give the
money to athletes who deserve it.
</P>
<P>
"He probably has earned more on interest...on that 200,000 than
most of the athletes are going to make all year, " McBean said
after winning her single sculls heat on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
She said if Bailey's promotional money was divided among Canada
's 400 competitors, each would receive about 500 dollars, which
would mean a lot to the many athletes who put themselves into debt
to train for the Games.
</P>
<P>
Bailey, who just came back from a car accident last year which
had damaged his Archilles tendon, refused to represent Canada at
the so-called Pan Am marquee event men's 100m after having not
been selected in the first place.
</P>
<P>
The defending Olympic champion only placed third at the Pan Am
trials this June, after Bruny Surin and Brad McCuaig.
</P>
<P>
But Surin, like most of the world top sprinters including new
record holder Maurice Greene of the United States, declined the
invitation to concentrate on the world championships next month in
Spain.
</P>
<P>
"Donovan should have been a little more patient and maybe a bit
more humble waiting for an invitation," Mcbean said.

125 rupees (2.9 U.S. dollars) per kilogram on the bullion market

ANKARA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- One soldier was killed and seven
others wounded in an armed attack late Wednesday night by the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in eastern Turkey, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agency said a group of PKK rebels opened fire at a military
vehicle on duty on the construction site of Alparslan-1 Dam near
Bulunik town of Mus province, leaving one soldier dead, one
officer and six soldiers wounded.
</P>
<P>
The injured were rushed to Mus State Hospital for treatment,
said the agency, adding they are in stable conditions.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 a war for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. The guerrilla fighting
continues although their captive PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was
sentenced to death last month by a Turkish court.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts between the Turkish security forces and the PKK
militants have claimed over 37,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Li Hongzhi's "Life Origin" Theory Refuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A commentary in Qiushi (Seeking
Truth), China's leading and influential theoretical bimonthly,
refutes the theory of life's origin preached by Li Hongzhi,
founder of Falun Gong, which was banned by China's central
authorities this month.
</P>
<P>
Li cooked up a theory that men on Earth were stripped off from
the universe, and that the Earth is the "trash bin" of the
universe on which inferior people live.
</P>
<P>
This raises problems difficult for Li Hongzhi to answer. How ,
for example, did Li, who claims to be a " Buddha" with
supernatural powers greater than Sakyamuni, come to be deposited
on Earth and become garbage? the article asks.
</P>
<P>
The aim of Li Hongzhi's concocting of the "divinity-turned man
" theory is to create a horrible future world. In this way, he can
show off his ability to release people's souls from purgatory and
hold up the throne as the "only savior of the world," the article
says.
</P>
<P>
If people believe Li's fallacies, they are bound to be
manipulated by Li, it adds.
</P>
<P>
Li, not satisfied with controlling Falun Gong members, harbors
an evil motive. Falun Dafa, or Falun Gong, has a tight
organization in many parts of China and instigated innocent people
to illegally gather outside Party and government departments,
putting pressure on the Party and the government.
</P>
<P>
Facts demonstrate that the current struggle against Falun Gong
is a serious political and ideological struggle, the article notes.
</P>
<P>
The day when the broad masses of people find themselves in the
right place in China's drive to build socialism with Chinese
characteristics and hold the sway over their own destiny, all
sorts of saviors will disappear from the scene.

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Exceptional Assistance to Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on
Thursday that it had approved an exceptional financial assistance
to Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The commission, executive body of the 15-nation European Union,
proposed for approval by the council of ministers to increase by
75 million euro (78.7 million U.S. dollars) the loans ceiling and
by 35 million euro (36.7 million dollars) the grants ceiling.
</P>
<P>
The increased financial assistance is expected to support
Tajikistan in its adjustment and reform programs, and, according
to Thibault de Silguy, European commissioner in charge of economic,
monetary and financial affairs, it would underpin not only
Tajikistan's transition toward market economy but also the
strengthening of the still fragile peace process in the country.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Tajikistan has benefited from considerable
international humanitarian assistance. Of the outside assistance,
the European Union has provided a significant share.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Scientists Discover Two More Uranus Moons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Two Canadian scientists have
discovered two more Uranus moons, pushing its moon count to the
top of the planetary list, the Gobe and Mail newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. JJ Kavelaars and his colleague Brett Gladman announced the
discovery Wednesday at the Astroids, Comets and Meteors 1999
meeting in New York.
</P>
<P>
The discovery, which was made on July 18 this year, brings the
total number of known satellites to 20, of which 16 are regular
and four irregular, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The scientists found in the images taken every 10 minutes for
32 hours that one moon is about 10 million kilometers from Uranus
and another, which is brighter, about 24 million kilometers out.
</P>
<P>
"We found two things that are tiny, but significant," Kavelaars
said, describing the four-day process of going over the
photographs taken from the world's largest electronic camera,
which is mounted on the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
The scientists said they would continue the tradition started
by British Astronomer William Herschel to name the newly
discovered Uranus moons after Shakespearean characters.

<HEADLINE> N. Irish Sinn Fein Invites Unionists to Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland republican leader
Gerry Adams on Thursday invited leaders of the province's main pro-
British party to talks in a bid to restart the stalled peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a statement, Adams said his Sinn Fein party, the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army, was offering to hold
a "substantive round of discussions" with the Protestant Ulster
Unionist Party in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeking a range of meetings with the UUP at various
levels, both formal and informal, in a concerted attempt to find
the way forward in order to facilitate these discussions," Adams
said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to conduct these meetings in private," Adams
said.
</P>
<P>
Talks held earlier this summer involving both sides in Northern
Ireland and the British and Irish governments failed to break a
deadlock between Sinn Fein republicans and the unionists over
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Adams said Sinn Fein had not decided whether to take part in a
review of the Northern Ireland peace process to be headed by U.S.
Senator George Mitchell in September, which represented another
attempt to end the stalemate.

<HEADLINE> China's Banks And Enterprises Cooperate in Industrial Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Eight banks, including the Fuzhou
branches of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the
Agricultural Bank of China, signed agreements or letters of
intents with 36 enterprises today to offer them loans for key
industrial restructuring projects.
</P>
<P>
The bank loans of 2.36 billion yuan (279.2 million U.S. dollars)
, together with the 830 million yuan accumulated by the
enterprises, amount to two-thirds of the 50 key projects' total
funds. When accomplished, these projects will be able to add
another 12.2 billion yuan to their output value, bringing profits
of 1.81 billion.
</P>
<P>
The city has long suffered from industrial structure problems
such as an imbalance of supply and demand and the slow development
of pillar and new industries.
</P>
<P>
The city government therefore entrusted the China International
Engineering Consulting Corp. last August with creating a three-
year readjustment plan to solve these problems. This plan was
completed and implemented last April.
</P>
<P>
The plan names electronic information, machinery, and light
industry as pillar industries, and textile, pharmaceuticals, and
chemicals as key industries. It also selects 112 key readjustment
projects in these fields with a total investment of 12 billion
yuan. Among these, 77 will be accomplished this year or next, and
when they become operational they will increase sales volume by
another 26.47 billion yuan, with profits of 5.4 billion.

<HEADLINE> AFC to Make Final Decision in October on World Cup Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Football
Confederation(AFC) will convene an Extraordinary Congress on
October 10, 1999 here for a final decision on the boycott of the
2002 Korea/Japan World Cup, AFC General Secretary Peter Vellapan
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
AFC will continue to fight for Asia to be allocated five berths
for the 2002 World Cup finals, he told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
"We are exploring everything possible with FIFA President
Josepp Blatter on our rights. We are not out to create chaos,"
said Vellapan, who will leave for Mexico tomorrow to meet the FIFA
president to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that the current impasse will be resovled
before the Extraordinary Congress to avoid any possibility of a
boycott," he said.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA executive committee in December last year gave four
places to Asia for the 2002 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
But the AFC asked for five seats for Asia in the finals as
Vellapan said Asia football has progressed and the World Cup would
be co-hosted by South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
In the FIFA executive committee meeting in Los Angeles two
weeks ago, Asia was offered a play-off for the fifth berth by
Europe but Asia declined and stuck to their stand for five.
</P>
<P>
Velappan said the AFC would decide in October if it would go
ahead to boycott the finals if its demand was not met.

<HEADLINE> HK's Economic Growth Positive in Second Half of 1999: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A local economic analyst
depicted a rosy picture for Hong Kong's economic prospect in the
second half of the year while estimating that the gross domestic
product (GDP) would enjoy a two percent positive growth in the
fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing on the economic forecast for the
second half of 1999, Gilbert K. Chu, executive director of the Sun
Hung Kai Securities Ltd., said Thursday that Hong Kong's GDP is
estimated to stop decline in the third quarter of the year and to
have a positive growth in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's economic recovery is on its way amidst a prudent
optimistic outlook for the world economic situation in the second
half of the year, Chu said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen would be strong while the expected interest
rate increase in the United States would be kept at a moderate
level of 0.50 percent, Chu estimated.
</P>
<P>
The commodity prices would be firm on consumption recovery and
investors' confidence would be maintained by stable global
interest rate, Chu continued.
</P>
<P>
According to Chu, the downturn trend of the year-on-year re-
export of Hong Kong would be reversed by the end of the year while
the consumer spending stabilizes.
</P>
<P>
Bank loans for use in Hong Kong would grow moderately on a year-
on-year basis supported by stable interest rates, said Chu. As for
the stock market, Chu said that the Hang Seng Index will be around
the level of 14,000 points.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councilor Wu Yi has
urged relevant sectors to increase export and introduce overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks at a national conference on foreign trade
held in Beijing from July 27 to 28.
</P>
<P>
She said that China's export and overseas investment in the
country in the first half of this year have both dropped from that
in the same period of last year due to the adverse effect of the
Asian financial crisis, irrational structure of export commodities,
the weakness of export competitiveness and some not-well-shaped
policies.
</P>
<P>
However, the extent of export reduction has been gradually
narrowed, and overseas investors have had greater confidence in
doing businesses in central and western parts of China, and the
global economic situation has moved toward stability, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
In general, opportunities outweigh challenges, the Chinese
state councilor said, adding that the government has attached
great importance to foreign trade, and hammered out a series of
policies to expand export and introduce overseas investment.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier On Anti-Flood, Economic Work (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji has urged local
officials to prepare for possible flooding and to redouble efforts
to secure the Yangtze River embankments.
</P>
<P>
During his July 26-28 visit to Anhui Province, he also called
for earnest efforts to implement the Party's economic policies and
do a better job in the latter half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Despite successes in the first phase of flood-control in east
China's Anhui Province, Zhu said vigilance must be kept about
possible flooding and no complacency will be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
On July 26, he visited reinforcement projects and talked with
people who were affected by the flooding and with medical workers
and gave his best regards to all who were participating in the
anti-flood effort.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the province's anti-flood endeavor and its
success in fighting the floods caused by torrential rainfalls. But,
he warned, local officials need to remain on alert because the
flood season is not over yet.
</P>
<P>
The province needs to get ready for a long-lasting anti-flood
campaign, he said, and needs to make sure that people in the flood-
hit areas, especially the 600,000 people now living on embankments
have sufficient food, clean water, and makeshift housing to live
in. And an effort also needs to be made to maintain social
stability in the flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Time is of the essence in reinforcing major embankments of the
Yangtze, he said, because floodwaters are getting worse and
causing great damage to state property and people's lives. And the
anti-flood efforts are costing the state dearly, he said.
</P>
<P>
The central government began last year to drastically increase
spending on Yangtze embankments and there have been some benefits.
However, more work needs to be done to bring the Yangtze waters
under control once and for all, he said.
</P>
<P>
The central government will boost spending on the Yangtze
embankment consolidation, focusing on projects in Hunan, Hubei,
Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces, he said, and reinforcement projects
along the Yangtze need to be completed in three to five years. (

<P>
Moreover, it is essential to promote the smooth development of
the processing sector, consolidate traditional markets and expand

It is also vital to abolish unreasonable levies with respect to
exports and imports, while stepping up anti-smuggling efforts in
order to create a favorable environment for import and export
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier On Anti-flood, Economic Work (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On economic work, the premier said the central authorities
recently made a thorough analysis of the nation's current economic
situation and had adopted a series of timely macro-control
measures
</P>
<P>
"The measures will play a leading role in effectively
overcoming the current difficulties and maintaining the
satisfactory trend of reform and development," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He urged all government departments and localities to take
concrete steps to further the pro-active financial policy and
effectively stimulate consumption, investment, and exports to
retain sustained and rapid growth of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
China's experience over the past 50 years has demonstrated that
the base of the national economy is agriculture, the importance of
which "shall never be neglected or underestimated under any
circumstances," Zhu stressed.
</P>
<P>
"At present, we must give priority to increasing farmers'
income," he said, adding that this will not only lead to
consumption growth in the rural areas, but will also strengthen
the important role of agriculture in the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Measures must be taken to guide farmers to adjust and optimize
the agricultural structure and turn out high-quality farm produce
according to market demands, he noted.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he urged that concrete measures be taken to
end all unreasonable fees on farmers and reduce their burdens,
noting that "under the current situation, reducing farmers'
burdens is equal to increasing their income."
</P>
<P>
During his tour, Zhu also attended a seminar on social security
in Hefei, Anhui's provincial capital where he said that improving
the nation's social security system is an important prerequisite
for the reform and development of state-owned enterprises (SOEs),
and also an important guarantee for social stability and progress.
</P>
<P>
He called for the establishment of a complete, standardized,
and legal social security system to guarantee the basic living
standards of those workers laid off as a result of SOE reform.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also pledged to gradually increase expenditures on social
security by appropriately adjusting the structure of the budget,
as well as through other channels.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Accepts Waiver of Adviser's Appointment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
accepted Thursday the decision by businessman Mark Jimenez to
decline his one peso (0.025 U.S. dollar) a year appointment as
presidential adviser on Latin American affairs.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said Jimenez told the
president in a letter dated July 28, 1999 that waiving his
appointment and letting him remain in the private sector will best
serve the interest of Estrada and the country.
</P>
<P>
Barican pointed out that Jimenez "had not completed the
formalities of his assumption of office by taking his oath."
</P>
<P>
"Jimenez had earlier been appointed to a one-peso-a-year salary
as a personal adviser on Latin American trade and investments
without an office or staff. Until he declined the appointment, he
had acted as adviser on these matters on informal basis," Barican
said.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the president, Jimenez informed Estrada that
he made the decision to waive his appointment after deeper
consultation with his family and friends.
</P>
<P>
"I now think it's best if I can serve the nation in my private
capacity," he told the president.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Estrada made it clear that he will not lift a finger
to block the request of the United States for Jimenez's
extradition.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government wants the businessman to stand trial on
American soil for a string of charges such as allegedly making
illegal campaign contributions.

<HEADLINE> Team Eco-Internet Snatches Lead in Mild Seven Outdoor Quest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALI, China, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Team Eco-Internet took the
lead after the first stage of the Mild Seven Outdoor Quest here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On a day that saw the reac's 24 teams contest 95 grueling
kilometers of running, kayaking and mountain biking, Eco-Internet
displayed dominance, never showing signs of worry when Finland's
Team Halti made a valiant run for the lead.
</P>
<P>
"We've competed together for a long time," Eco-Internet captain
Robert Nagle said, "We know what it's like to win and we know that
it doesn't make sense to get uptight about positioning this early
in the race. We just focus on ourselves and try to forget about
anyone else."
</P>
<P>
Team Halti finished the day four minutes behind Eco-Internet's
seven hours one minute and 44 seconds. Team Beaver Creek/Asian
Star of Colorado of the United States was third at 7:13:41.
</P>
<P>
Eco-Internet, competing for the third time since the Mild Seven
Outdoor Quest was inaugurated in 1997, added Keith Murray, a New
Zealand running and mountain biking champion, to their squad this
year to boost their leg speed.
</P>
<P>
Murray's inclusion seemed to have an immediate effect on Team
Eco-Internet. During the opening five kilometers run and 20km
kayak, Murray set the pace. Later, on the mountain bike segment,
Murray rode at the front of the group.
</P>
<P>
The team, which also includes American Danelle Ballangee and
Australian Ian Adamson, never appeared pressed or out of breath.
They spoke calmly with each other and reminded one another to eat
and drink as the hours went on and their bodies ran the risk of
running out of energy.
</P>
<P>
At the midpoint of the mountain bike segment, when Halti drew
close, Eco-Internet chose to ride with the Finns rather than fight
them off. "We're very strong paddlers," said Adamson, "We know we
had that in our favor."
</P>
<P>
When the teams returned to Lake Er-hai for a final kayaking
segment, Eco-Internet pulled away form Halti for the win.
</P>
<P>
But the team was soberly aware that it will be more tough in
the next three days dispite winning the yellow jersey signifying
overall race leaders.
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a tough four days of racing. Anything can
happen," Nagle said, "but we're going to go hard every day. This
is a course that favors us-- the longer the better.

<HEADLINE> Auto Output Down Slightly in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China's domestic auto
manufacturers produced 48,900 cars in June, a slight drop of 2.6
percent from the same period last year, today's Market Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
The total auto output in the first half of this year was 271,
300, up 5.7 percent on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
This was the second drop since March and, analysts say, the
result of a short-lived surge in car production earlier in the
year, which caused oversupply. They predict that the overall
increase rate of auto production will continue to decline on a
monthly basis.
</P>
<P>
Jilin, a major industrial city in north China, is experiencing
a steady growth of auto production this year and is considered to
have the brightest market prospects among all cities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
However, in Shanghai, a major auto production base, auto output
has declined monthly, and will continue to decline even more in
the second half this year, market analysts predict.
</P>
<P>
With the slackening demand for cars, the expansion of car
production in Shanghai is becoming increasingly difficult,
analysts say.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Warned on Cross-Straits Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A commentary released today by the
Xinhua News Agency warns the Taiwan authorities against regarding
relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits as a
trifling matter.
</P>
<P>
The article listed some deceptions enunciated by Lee Teng-hui
in recent days.
</P>
<P>
In one such deceptive statement, Lee claimed that he "opposes
Taiwan independence," and said the "one China policy is my
ultimate objective" and even corrected himself on his remarks on
the theory of "two states" in the wake of strong pressure from
people in both the mainland and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he has raised hundreds of billions of Taiwan dollars
to shore up its declining stock market, an outcome of his
proclamation of the "two states" theory, and sought support for
this theory from some U.S. scholars.
</P>
<P>
It is Lee Teng-hui who denied the one China principle with his
"two states" theory, sabotaging the basis of cross-Straits
development and negotiations between the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF).
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstance, Lee was deceitful by saying time and
again that he expects the visit of ARATS President Wang Daohan to
Taiwan this autumn. He even made unfounded counter-charges by
saying that if Wang calls off his visit to Taiwan, he should bear
responsibility for sabotaging relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
This is the distorted logic of a rascal, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities should understand that the one China
principle is the basis and premise for developing cross-Straits
relations and realizing the unification of China. One must not be
vague on this matter of principle, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
It is quite dangerous to the development of cross-Straits
relations to treat this issue of vital interest to Taiwan
compatriots as a trifling matter, the commentary concluded.

<HEADLINE> EU Offers Romania 100 Million Euro in Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on
Thursday that it had approved a 100-million-euro aid package (105
million U.S. dollars) for Romania through the European Union's
PHARE aid program.
</P>
<P>
The aid will be directed to the eastern European country's
economic reform by supporting its restructuring, privatization and
closure of loss-making enterprises with particular emphasis on
specifically targeted areas.
</P>
<P>
The reform is expected to help Romania meet the demands for
macro-financial assistance from the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Restructuring of loss-making state enterprises has been a
policy objective of the Romanian government since 1990 but has had
limited progress so far, according to commission officials.
</P>
<P>
An important factor limiting the restructuring process has been
the potential social and economic impact of enterprise closures
and job losses on regions whose economic base is insufficiently
diversified.
</P>
<P>
The European Union aid program, the officials added, will not
only assist the Romanian government in implementing the
restructuring policies but will also alleviate the consequences of
enterprise closure through a strengthened social safety net and
through the promotion of employment initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The aid is expected to encourage economic activity leading up
to sustainable employment creation through assistance to small-
and medium-sized enterprises and micro-businesses.

<P>
Carbon dating indicates that the skull, which was found in a
tomb in Minhe County in Qinghai, is the oldest to have had this
operation in China and was from the later New Stone Age, about 4,
000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
A large triangular cut can be found at the top of the skull
with traces of scraping around it. There are also two sunken
traces on the skull, which Han says might have been left by a
strike from a certain instrument, causing a fracture and
inflammation of the skull.
</P>
<P>
There were some bony growths around the hole and the scraped
traces are indistinct, he says, meaning that the patient survived
for a period of time after the operation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Archaeologists Find Evidence of Craniotomies 4,000 Years Ago (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Skulls from the Shang Dynasty (1600-1100 BC), Western Zhou
Dynasty (1100-771 BC), Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770-256 BC), and Han
Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD) with holes in them were also discovered at
Anyang in Henan, Datong in Qinghai, and Tailai in Heilongjiang.
</P>
<P>
The skull of a middle-aged man from more than 3,000 years ago
unearthed in a tomb in Datong County has caught the attention of
archaeologists. It has an arc-shaped hole 115 millimeters long and
30 mm. wide. This large-scale craniotomy is very rare, Han says,
and it is interesting to find that different areas around the hole
grew back differently.
</P>
<P>
So, they concluded that the patient had had a skull opening
operation more than once.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xingcan, another archaeologist at the institute, says that
ancient surgeons used flint pieces or metal knives for the
operation and points to how marvelous it is that these people had
mastered this technique when the instruments were so simple and
crude.
</P>
<P>
Evidence of early craniotomies has also been found in Europe,
Africa, America, and other parts of Asia.

JAKARTA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Thursday met with visiting Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko
Komura and Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer here
respectively.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, the two foreign ministers congratulated
president on the smooth conduct of Indonesia's June 7 general
election.
</P>
<P>
Komura told reporters after the meeting that he hoped the
presidential election at the general meeting of the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR), the country's highest decision-making
body, later this year would also proceed smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Downer told reporters that he discussed with Habibie the latest
developments in East Timor in connection with the scheduled
U.N.-administered people's consultation on the territory's
political future next month.
</P>
<P>
Downer said the security situation in East Timor in the runup
to the ballot was beginning to improve and expressed the hope this
would continue until the day of the ballot by the end of August.
</P>
<P>
He commended Habibie for having adopted the policy of
permitting the East Timorese people to determine their own
political future.
</P>
<P>
The August ballot will allow the territory's people to choose
whether their homeland should become an autonomous region within
Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the U.N., which
still considers Portugal as the administering power of the
territory.

JAKARTA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Megawati Soekarnoputri, chairwoman
of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), Thursday
met with visiting Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Koumura and
discussed political and economic affairs in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>

Meanwhile, Kwik Kian Gie said it is natural for the Japanese
minister to meet with senior officials of the PDI-P.
</P>
<P>
"It is natural if the Japanese foreign minister wants to meet
with the party's executives as in a democratic country, the
biggest party is expected to have a strong position in the
House... and if Mega (Megawati) is not president, the PDI-P is an
important faction of the House," he said.
</P>
<P>
The PDI-P won the June 7 general election with a relative
majority. A preliminary count by the National Election Committee

compete for 462 of the 500 seats in the House. The remaining 38

<HEADLINE> Economic Adjustment in HK to Continue: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's economic growth will
continue to be checked by the deepening deflation although the
buoyant U.S. economy and the rebound in Asian economies could
alleviate the decline in total exports and inbound tourism has
improved.
</P>
<P>
This was expressed by the latest report of the Hang Seng
Economic Monthly issued by Hang Seng Bank.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will record economic contraction for the second
consecutive year in 1999, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report revises slightly upward its full-year gross domestic
product forecast to -0.9 percent from -1.5 percent while inflation
is forecast to fall to -2.8 percent from the previous estimate of
-1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report says that the worst is behind Hong Kong. However,
all sectors of the economy remain sluggish and indications of a
swift recovery are few.
</P>
<P>
As a predominantly services-based metropolitan economy, Hong
Kong's sustained recovery is dependent on the restoration of its
competitiveness and improvement in external demand, the report
points out.
</P>
<P>
Downward adjustment in domestic prices could be expected to
improve Hong Kong's external demand. Since the second half of
1998, inbound tourism has been improving as Hong Kong has become
more affordable for overseas visitors, says the report.
</P>
<P>
The highest growth has been recorded in visitors from China's
mainland and southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Given the relative strength of the Hong Kong dollar and the
Chinese reminbi, the falling exports are unlikely to be reversed.
However, the buoyant U.S. economy as well as the rebound in the
Asian economies could alleviate the decline in total exports, the
report says.
</P>
<P>
To put Hong Kong back on the growth track and to remain the
preferred conduit between the mainland the world economies, it is
crucial for the community to work together to restore the SAR's
competitiveness on all fronts, the report says.
</P>
<P>
In the latest survey on the cost of living in major
international cities conducted by the Economic Intelligence Unit,
Hong Kong continues to be ranked the second-most expensive city.
</P>
<P>
Containment of property prices and the cost of living remains a
challenge to Hong Kong and will be essential to restoring its
external competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The government has a crucial role to play in ensuring a
conducive business environment, and in reinforcing and promoting
the entrepreneurial spirit which has helped Hong Kong surmount
many difficulties in the past, the report concludes.

LAGOS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian government remains
committed to resuscitating and modernizing its railway system,
Nigerian Transport Minister Kema Chikwe said in Lagos Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister gave the assurance on a familiarization visit to
the headquarters of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) in the
country's largest city, the New Nigerian newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chikwe regretted the deterioration of Nigerian railway which
had in the past transported about 80 percent of the goods and
people all over the country.
</P>
<P>
"The present administration was strongly committed to improving
the lives of all Nigerians by ensuring that goods and services are
available at affordable prices" the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve this goal, an efficient and affordable means of
transport is essential," she said, noting the lack of maintenance
of the railways in the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that the new railway network would be
expanded to link areas rich in minerals, agricultural and
commercial potentials.
</P>
<P>
All tracks that would be constructed in the future would be of
standard gauge, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
The transport minister lauded previous administrations' efforts
in resuscitating and modernizing the railway infrastructure with
the help of the Chinese Civil Engineering and Construction Company
(CCECC), which has nearly finished a project worth 500 million
U.S. dollars to rehabilitate over 80 percent of the country's
railways.

to deceive people, resulting in the deaths of many practitioners.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Professors and scholars of Chinese
universities today gave their support to the Falun Gong ban and
expressed a desire to join the fight against the malicious
fallacies of Li Hongzhi, who concocted the Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
At a Ministry of Education meeting, professors and scholars
from Beijing University, Qinghua University, and People's
University spoke about Falun Gong from a philosophical, legal,
education, psychological, and scientific perspective.
</P>
<P>
Professor Huang Nansen of Beijing University said that Li
Hongzhi's "work" is full of scientific terms but that he knows
nothing about modern science. What he has done is nothing more
than to provide a scientific coating to his superstitious ideas.
</P>
<P>
Vice-minister of Education Zhang Tianbao pointed out that
education departments need to remain vigilant about the danger of
Falun Gong and said that schools should help students to establish
a correct world outlook. Schools spread modern culture, he said,
and leave no room for malicious theories like Falun Dafa and that
teachers need to provide a modern scientific education for
students.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Reimposes Ban on Belgian Meat Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
reimposed a ban on Belgian meat products following the discovery
of a more widespread dioxin contamination in Belgium, the
Philippine News Agency (PNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The PNA quoted an administrative order issued Tuesday by the
Department of Agriculture as saying that the ban will be in effect
until an appropriate decision is reached by the European
Commission and officially transmitted to the Philippine
government.
</P>
<P>
The country's dioxin ad hoc committee recommended the
reimposition of the ban on Belgian meat products following reports
of a more widespread contamination in Belgium and a new ban
imposed by the Netherlands and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The committee said it was believed that 300 more farms in
Belgium were discovered to have been affected by dioxin.
</P>
<P>
The government has stressed that Belgian meat products will not
be allowed to enter the country and those already in are being
readied for re-export to Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Following reports of documented dioxin contamination of feeds
in European Union countries, some 216,000 kilos of meat and meat
by-products from Belgium have been put on hold by the Philippine
government.

<HEADLINE> Upswings of Oil Prices in Int'l Market Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A convergence of economic and
climatic factors may have paved the way for further upswings in
international oil prices, which might cross the mark of 20 U.S.
dollars per barrel before the year end, the Oil and Gas Group of
Arthur Andersen in Lagos has predicted.
</P>
<P>
The group said in its report that though oil prices remain
volatile in the coming months, the price of crude oil would hover
between 18 and 20 dollars in the next several months, The Guardian
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to an industry survey published last March, the
majority of respondents expected an average price at 11.43 dollars
per barrel in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The expectations of the survey was mainly based on the possible
 continuation of the Asian economic recession and relatively low
demand by the European and U.S. consumers in the year.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that in fact the prevailing price level and
future outlook were a far cry from the expectations, and the crude
oil price on the New York Mercantile Exchange for Brent Sweet
Crude reached a 20-month high of 20.44 dollars per barrel on July
19.
</P>
<P>
The Arthur Andersen Oil and Gas Group attributed the phenomenal
shift in price level mainly to rapid decline in domestic supply in
the U.S. output curbs and strict compliance by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
According to the American Petroleum Institute, domestic crude
oil production in the U.S. decreased by 6.8 percent in May 1999,
compared to the same month of last year.
</P>
<P>
The rapid decline in domestic supply coupled with the continued
growth in demand has resulted in increased import of crude oil so
as to augment the shortfall in supply in the U.S., the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The report also explained that the strong resolve of the OPEC
members in compliance with output restrictions and the decision of
non-OPEC oil producers to reduce production had been contributed
to the upswings in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The resolve of the OPEC members to cut off two million barrels
per day from the world market is reinforced by the decision of the
non-OPEC producers to reduce oil production by about 400,000
barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
By the estimation of the International Energy Agency, if the
present production level is sustained, "demand will exceed supply
by about 3.2 million barrels per day by the fourth quarter of 1999
and further increasing the price from current levels".

<HEADLINE> Chinese Petroleum Company Profits Up In First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua)-- China National Star Petroleum
Corporation (CNSPC) had 195 million yuan (23.5 million US dollars)
in pre-tax profits in the first half of this year, a 51 percent
increase over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The company was established two years ago and has had annual
growth of over 20 percent. By the end of June, the company's
revenues amounted to 2.489 billion yuan, a 36.77 percent increase
from the same 1998 period. Industrial-added output value was worth
1.103 billion yuan, 36.4 percent more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of 1999, CNSPC found oil at 14 wildcat
sites and discovered six oil and gas structures. Breakthroughs
were made in the Luenpola Basin in Tibet, in the Tarim in Xinjiang,
in the Songliao in northeastern China, and in the Sichuan Basin.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of July, the company had commercial crude oil
flow of 150 cu.m. in the Luenpola basin, which has reserves of 10
million tons.
</P>
<P>
The company has found proven crude oil reserves of 67.18
million tons in the Tarim Basin. It plans to build up another
medium-sized oilfield in the southern Songliao, which has an oil-
bearing area of 12 sq. km.

<HEADLINE> Australia Posts Record Trade Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Australia's balance of trade
finished the fiscal year with a record 14.96 billion Australian
dollars (9.87 billion U.S. dollars) in the red, the Australian
Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The goods and services trade deficit for the month of June,
seasonally adjusted, was 1.525 billion Australian dollars (1.007
billion U.S. dollars), compared with 1.523 billion Australian
dollars (1.005 billion U.S. dollars) in May, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said exports to Asia fell two percent during June,
reducing total exports for the month to 8.87 billion Australian
dollars (5.85 billion U.S. dollars), while imports amounted to
10.4 billion Australian dollars (6.86 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth successive month of hefty deficits and took
the cumulative total for 1998-99 to 14.96 billion Australian
dollars, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
Economists predicted the latest deterioration would push the
current account deficit from 5.9 percent of gross domestic product
in the March quarter to over the six percent mark in June.
</P>
<P>
But most economists took the latest figures in their stride as
it was within expectations.

<HEADLINE> Voter Registration in E. Timor Not to Be Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Although U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has decided to postpone the ballot on East Timor's
future from August 8 to August 30, the period for registration of
voters will not be extended, a U.N. spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The registration period has been set to last 20 days, namely,
from July 16 to August 4, 1999, and will not be prolonged," deputy
chief spokesman of the U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET)
Yasuhiro Ueki told reporters in Dili, capital of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the registration period from July 16 through August
4, the schedule also includes a six-day documentation period
(August 5-10), a 17-day campaign period (August 11-27) and a
two-day cooling-down period (August 28-29).
</P>
<P>
Asked about the security problem during the whole process, Ueki
said the UNAMET was continuously observing it and whatever was
observed would be taken into due account in the formulation of a
code of conduct for campaigning activities.
</P>
<P>
The code was currently still in the making, he was quoted by
the Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, State Secretary Muladi said following the
postponement of East Timor's direct ballot, the Indonesian
government demanded registration of eligible voters in the
territory also be postponed for one week.
</P>
<P>
The August ballot will allow the territory's people to choose
whether their homeland should become an autonomous region within
Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.
</P>
<P>
Early this year Indonesia announced it would grant East Timor
independence if the people in the territory reject Indonesia's
offer of a wide-ranging autonomy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Companies Plan to Expand Investment in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. electronic companies in
Malaysia are expected to invest 5 billion ringgit (1.315 billion
U.S. dollars) over the next three years for expansion and
upgrading of existing facilities for the introduction of new
products here.
</P>
<P>
For local research and development (R&AMP;D) alone, they expect to
invest 200 million ringgit (52.631 million dollars) annually over
the period, the Malaysian American Electronics Industry (MAEI)
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The growth in R&AMP;D forecast figures indicated the continuing
trend of MAEI's 17 members -- mainly major electronic companies --
undertaking R&AMP;D work in their respective companies here, MAIE
Chairman Teh Chin Bin said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
These companies invested 3 billion ringgit (789.473 million
dollars) in 1998, underscoring their confidence in Malaysia as a
manufacturing base, Teh said, adding that in terms of local R&AMP;D,
these companies invested 150 million ringgit (39.473 million
dollars) last year, a 61-percent increase over 1997.
</P>
<P>
They also purchased materials and services from local suppliers
amounting to 5 billion ringgit (1.315 billion dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, MAEI members recorded 28 billion ringgit (7.368
billion U.S. dollars) in exports or 12 percent of Malaysia's total
manufactured exports.
</P>
<P>
They expect exports to grow by 9.0 percent this year and export
sales to average an 11-percent increase annually over the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
Teh said more R&AMP;D work is being undertaken here as the
operation of MAEI companies has become more sophisticated,
following the move from labor-intensive to capital-intensive,
high-tech manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
He said MAIE companies had also pledged their commitment to
providing substantial investment in training and education. In
1998, the companies spent 27 million ringgit (7.105 million
dollars) on education and training and have projected 90 million
ringgit (23.684 million dollars) in this area for the next three
years.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Li Hongzhi, head of the illegal "
Falun Dafa Research Society", is suspected of having committed the
crime of disturbing public order, the spokesman for the Ministry
of Public Security said here today in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Ministry of Public Security has issued a
wanted circular today for the arrest of Li Hongzhi, and the China
Central Bureau of the Interpol has also sent an aviso to the
Interpol's member states for international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that the "Falun Dafa Research Society
" is an unregistered illegal organization which has conducted
illegal activities to spread superstitious and fallacious ideas to
deceive the public and create disturbance, sabotaging social
stability.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Ministry of Civil Affairs announced on July 22
that the society and the Falun Gong organization under his control
are illegal organizations and placed them under ban.
</P>
<P>
Police investigations have shown that Li Hongzhi set up and
made use of the "Falun Dafa Research Society" and his Falun Gong
organization to spread superstitious and fallacious ideas to
deceive the public, causing deaths of practitioners, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to incomplete statistics from 30 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities, up to July 28, 743 persons
have died as a result of practicing Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Without applying for permits according to law, the organization
has plotted and organized gatherings and demonstrations, and
instigated people to disturb public order, he said, adding that
these activities have gone against the 290th, 296th and 300th
provisions of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China,
constituting a crime of disturbing public order.
</P>
<P>
The people's procuratorate has approved the arrest of Li
Hongzhi, the spokesman said, adding that, according to the 123rd
provision of the Criminal Procedure Law of the People's Republic
of China, the Ministry of Public Security has issued a wanted
circular to public security departments nationwide for the arrest
of Li Hongzhi, and the China Central Bureau of the Interpol has

<P>
MAPUTO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican Commission for
Information Policy said Wednesday that Mozambique is short of
funds for addressing the Year 2000 computer compliance problem.
</P>
<P>
The Noticias newspaper Thursday quoted an unidentified source
from the commission as saying that there are some 10,000 computers
in the southern African country whereas the millennium bug will
not only affect the computers but also the whole information
system and other electronics.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique, one of the poorest countries in the world, cannot
afford the cost for modify all the programs, the source said at
the third regional seminar on the millennium bug in Maputo.
</P>
<P>
The technical unit for Y2k problem has given priority to such
sectors as banks, telecommunications and insurance.
</P>
<P>
Other public sectors should also make efforts to deal with the
problem so that the national economy will not be affected, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the public service is also targeted because the
100,000 public servants will not get paid if the computers break
down for the millennium bug.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has declared
war against any unhealthy imported used goods in a bid to prevent
diseases spread and rescue local industries from collapse, the
People Daily newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director Philip Okundi of the Kenya Bureau of
Standards said here Wednesday that with effect from October 1,
this year, imported used items which do not meet the requirements
of his organization would be banned.
</P>
<P>
Okundi was quoted as saying that the code of practice for the
importation of used shoes will require a health certificate from
the country of origin to certifying that they are free from any
skin disease or radioactive material.
</P>
<P>
The government also introduced a "fumigation certificate" on
used shoes, as the ban on the importation of used inner garments
became effective on June 30. Inner garments include under wears,
socks and vests.
</P>
<P>
It has established that the used items were causing diseases
ranging from leprosy, anthrax and other fungal diseases, Okundi
said.
</P>
<P>
He said following the order, already 60 trucks with unchecked
footwear had been netted and are being held at a depot.

<HEADLINE> Bridges Bringing Business To China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- In Wuhan, the capital of China's
Hubei Province, bridges are bringing good profits.
</P>
<P>
The Wuhan Bridge, China's first bridge across the Yangtze River,
is an important connection between the north and south on the
Beijing-Guangzhou Railway Line. It has generated nearly 10 billion
yuan in economic benefits since it opened in 1957.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan Bridge No.2, which drew 100,000 visitors at its
inauguration in 1995, has made a reality of the city's ring road.
Wuhan is separated by the Yangtze and the Hanjiang rivers into
Wuchang, where government institutions and colleges are located,
Hankou, where business is done, and Hanyang, which is the cultural
center.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the ring road, drivers can travel around the city a
lot faster, a far cry from the ferryboats that used to be the only
way to cross the Yangtze. Work is going on on two other new
bridges across the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
On the Hanjiang, 3 more new bridges are being built in addition
to the four operational ones. Wuhan is China's largest bridge
industry center for design, construction, special steel, and
bridge engineering equipment.
</P>
<P>
The Railways Ministry's Bridge Engineering Bureau has made its
headquarters in Wuhan. It has been involved in more than 300
bridges.
</P>
<P>
To show their devotion to the bridges, for which the word in
Chinese is "qiao", many local people have given their newborn
children names with "qiao" in them.
</P>
<P>
Since 1957, China has built 16 bridges across the Yangtze.

PHNOM PENH, July 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 4,000 illegal weapons
were destroyed Thursday by the Cambodian government with
bulldozers at a ceremony in Takmau, Kandal province, about 20
kilometers south of here.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Sar Kheng presided
over the ceremony attended by police and army officers as well as
U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
Sar Kheng said disarming Cambodia is a crucial step in
attracting foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
It is the third time for the Cambodian government to destroy
illegal weapons since the new coalition government was formed last
November.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the destruction is to show to the
international community the Cambodian government's determination
to control illegal weapons and maintain social security.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide gun ownership ban was imposed earlier this year
and police searched vehicles and motorists for illegal weapons at
checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that so far the government has collected more
than 30,000 weapons including the more than 10,000 confiscated and
destroyed firearms.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to attract more
investments, the Philippine government is considering the possible
rationalization of the various tax incentives given to the private
financial institutions, a top official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Edgardo Espiritu, secretary of Finance, told a meeting that the
government is considering further reducing the tax burdens of the
private financial institutions, like banks and investment
brokerage houses in the country.
</P>
<P>
His pronouncement came at a time when the financial market is
faced with the effects of the regional turmoil so that it is
necessary to introduce some kind of tax incentives.
</P>
<P>
This is a time-bound focused direction to get rid of double
taxation to give the institutions a uniform tax incentives on both
foreign and domestic investments, Espiritu said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the government is also considering removing
documentary stamp tax on recurring financial instruments like
transactions at the Philippine Stock Exchange and gross receipts
taxes imposed on banking transactions.
</P>
<P>
Actually, these proposed measures are bound to lessen the
government's revenue collection at this time when it needs more
revenues to finance its expenditures, he explained.
</P>
<P>
However, these will be done as a means to remove disincentives
to business transactions and instead attract more investments into
the country, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Report: Mubarak Hopes to Hear New Ideas from Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has
said he hopes to hear "new and serious" ideas from Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak during a meeting on Thursday for the revival
of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to hear from (Barak) something new and serious on the
way to achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace to
guarantee stability, security and tranquility in the region," the
Al-Gomhuria newspaper quoted Mubarak as saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He told the pro-government daily that he wants to hear Barak's
ideas on how to implement the agreements signed with the
Palestinians and views on resuming the peace talks with Syria and
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Barak are scheduled to hold talks Thursday in
Alexandria, the second between the two leaders in 20 days in this
Mediterranean port city after Barak took office early this month.
</P>
<P>
The meeting follows the inconclusive peace talks on Tuesday
between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Barak. Barak has said
he wants to combine part of last October's Wye River accord with
the more complicated negotiations on a final peace deal with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has rejected the proposal, insisting that Israel carry
out the last two of the three-phased troop withdrawals from the
West Bank under the Wye accord before going into the final status
talks.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, as president of the first Arab nation to make peace
with Israel, often serves as a mediator in the Middle East peace
negotiations.

<HEADLINE> China Promoting Chinese Language Courses For Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Education gave 85
teachers who were trained between 1961 and 1964 awards today for
their efforts in teaching Chinese to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Vice-minister of Education Wei Yu said at the ceremony that
these teachers visited some 50 countries and made a great
contribution to teaching Chinese to foreigners in the past three
decades. She said that China now has over 5,000 teachers who are
teaching Chinese to foreigners and about 350 universities that
have foreign students. They had more than 43,000 foreigners last
year, 85 percent of them studying Chinese language and culture.
</P>
<P>
There has been a 20 percent increase in the number of
foreigners taking the special HSK Chinese language test. Last year,
nearly 50,000 foreigners took the test, which is known as the
Chinese TOEFL.
</P>
<P>
The test has eleven levels and has been held annually since
1990. Zhao Guocheng, the director of the Ministry of Education's
division of Chinese language for foreign students, says that if a
foreigner passes level 3 he or she can pursue a major in science
and engineering at an average-level college without taking a
special Chinese language test.
</P>
<P>
But some key universities, like Beijing University and Qinghua
University, are insisting that foreigners pass level 6 before
being accepted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has established a special group for
teaching Chinese to foreigners, which is under the control of Chen
Zhili, the Minister of Education. The country now has over 36 HSK
test centers in 21 cities and has overseas test centers in 10
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Some universities like Beijing Foreign Language and Culture
University and East China Normal University have started training
teachers of Chinese for foreign students in special departments.
China has also set up over 3,000 schools overseas to teach Chinese.

<HEADLINE> Australia Sees Renewed Investment Interest in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 29 (Xinhua) -- There are signs that
Australia has shown renewed investment interest in Malaysia over
the last couple of months, Australia's High Commissioner to
Malaysia Robert Cotton said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Australian investment in Malaysia slowed down in the last one
and a half years mainly because of the regional financial economic
downturn, Cotton said at a press conference here to provide the
latest information on the Australia-Malaysia Business Council
(AMBC).
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis saw Australia's export to Malaysia decline
by 22 percent to 4.8 billion ringgit (1.263 billion U.S. dollars)
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
But "we are now starting to see some renewed interest from both
countries," he said, adding the investment is expected to grow
further in one to two years.
</P>
<P>
Cotton said the recovery of Malaysia's economy was very
important, not only for the region but also for Australia.
</P>
<P>
"We are very confident about Malaysia as our trade and
investment base," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cotton said that the visit scheduled for Malaysia's
International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz to
Australia early next month was considered timely as the minister
would be able to give a more clearer picture of Malaysia's current
economic situation.

<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China began a cybermarketing
project recently to help companies with marketing on websites, the
China Information Industry Association (CIIA) reports.
</P>
<P>
The project is sponsored by CIIA, China Telecom's Data
Communication Bureau, and the China Financial Net Information
Technology Co. Ltd, according to Gao Xinmin, vice-director of CIIA.
</P>
<P>
It helps companies with market research and analysis and
product development via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The project has 2 parts: training and Internet service. In the
first, managers will receive training on cybermarketing and basic
Internet use; in the second, Internet Service Providers and
Internet Platform Providers will provide services.
</P>
<P>
Gao says that it is still difficult to do e-commerce in China,
but that cybermarketing, which does not have website costs, will
help develop e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the China Entrepreneur System this year showed that
although 20 percent of Chinese companies have a homepage, the
addition of information on the homepage is very slow, and 85
percent didn't even add to the homepage in half a year.

<HEADLINE> Leaders of Egypt, Israel Meet on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Thursday in Alexandria,
discussing ways of reviving the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was the second between Mubarak and Barak in 20 days
in the Mediterranean port city, 220 kilometers northwest of Cairo,
after the Israeli prime minister assumed office early this month.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, as president of the first Arab country to make peace
with Israel, plays a key role in mediating in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Barak arrived in Alexandria earlier in the day. He was greeted
at the airport by Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri, Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa and other senior Egyptian officials.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Mubarak and Barak followed the Tuesday
inconclusive talks between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Barak on the implementation of the Wye River accord.
</P>
<P>
Barak wants to combine part of the accord with the more
complicated negotiations on a final peace deal with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat has said he would not accept any modifications of
the peace agreement, insisting that Israel carry out the accord
before going into the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
The interim peace deal signed last October by Arafat and former
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calls on Israel to hand
over another 13.1 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
Netanyahu, however, suspended the implementation in December after
carrying out the first of the three-phase troop withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the pro-government Al Gomhuria daily
published on Thursday, Mubarak urged Israel "to show flexibility
in the peace talks and honestly implement pacts signed with the
Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
"We hope to hear from (Barak) something new and serious on the
road to achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace to
guarantee stability, security and tranquility in the region,"
Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak told the daily he wanted to hear Barak's ideas on "how
to implement the agreements signed with the Palestinians and his
views on peace talks on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks."

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Forest Park on Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A large section of the Bwindi
Impenetrable National Park in southwestern Uganda has been
destroyed by a wild fire which has raged on for the past five
days.
</P>
<P>
The fire has destroyed about six hills of forest in Nyabaremura
and Bushaga in Kirundu sub-county, the New Vision daily reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Government officials were quoted as saying that the fire would
dent the country's tourism industry if it is not controlled,
because animals are fleeing.
</P>
<P>
Rita Byiringiro, information officer with the Kisoro district,
said that the fire was started by the Batwa (pygmies) as they
extracted honey.
</P>
<P>
Local people have been trying to put out the fire, but the dry
spell has made it more difficult, he said, adding that they need
advanced fire- fighting equipment.
</P>
<P>
Bwindi's size is estimated at 333 square kilometers, the third
largest forest park in the country. It has more than 300 mountain
gorillas, over half of its population in the whole world.
</P>
<P>
The area came into limelight in early March following eight
foreign tourists were allegedly killed in the park by Hutu
extremists coming in from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
This incident has largely tainted Uganda's international image
and plunged the country's young and booming tourist industry to a
rock bottom.

<HEADLINE> UAE Has Largest Number of Net Subscribers in Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emriates (UAE)
has the largest number of Internet subscribers in the Arab world,
according to a Gulf News report on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from Etisalat, the country's telecommunications
monopolizer, show that the number of net subscribers had reached
81,700 until April this year, which indicates more people in the
country are being drawn to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
However, with regard to the number of real users, which
includes families of subscribers, the UAE is in second place
after Egypt. Statistics show that real Internet users have
reached 204,300 in the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The growing interest in exploring cyberspace had raised fears
of net-related crimes, including illegal access to confidential
data which could endanger national security, the paper pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
"Although it has facilitated the exchange of information, as
well as commercial transactions, the Internet has also created a
channel for promoting illegal practices and immoral concepts," a
Sharjah-based police officer was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The officer stressed the need to install the Internet at
police departments and to familiarize police staff with its
applications. "They would play a major role in curbing Internet
crimes and international terrorism," he added.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Okays Pact with Southern Africa Customs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has finally approved the
signing of an agreement with the Southern Africa Customs Union
(SACU), which will allow duty-free imports from countries in the
grouping, the Times of Zambia newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Commerce, Trade and Industry Minister David Mpamba
confirmed the development in Lusaka Wednesday, assuring that
Zambia would soon sign the agreement with other SACU members.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy to say that the cabinet has now approved the
signing of the Zambia-SACU trade agreement which was negotiated
for last year," Mpamba was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia-SACU agreement was an interim arrangement which
would be replaced by the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) trade protocol when it was fully implemented, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Mpamba said the agreement aims to promote trade between Zambia
and SACU members namely South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho
and Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
"When the agreement comes into force, quotas of selected
Zambian goods will be allowed into SACU countries duty free," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry was
working on mechanisms of how the quotas would be allocated and
would be advising all stake-holders of selected goods on the
quotas and the mechanism of accessing the quotas.
</P>
<P>
Mpamba would soon be consulting with his SACU counterparts to
discuss the date of signing and also to resolve minor outstanding
issues that may still be there.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to exporters in Zambia to consult with the Bureau
of Standards to ensure that the quality of their goods meet the
standards in SACU.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Guerrilla Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A member of Lebanon's Muslim
guerrilla group Hezbollah has been killed in south Lebanon during
clash with Israeli forces and its allied South Lebanon Army (SLA),
the Voice of the People radio reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted the group's statement as saying that the
member, called Ali Abdallah Krayyem, 23, was killed Wednesday in
fighting Israeli forces and its proxy SLA.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not give details about how the guerrilla
died, but said Hezbollah launched rocket and machine-gun attacks
on Israeli and SLA's positions in the Israeli occupied border zone
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
This is the first fatality Hezbollah received in south Lebanon
since Israel launched the massive air blitz on Lebanon on June 24,
during which 10 Lebanese were killed and more than 60 wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been
spearheading a guerrilla war to oust Israeli occupation troops and
SLA out of the country.

ADDIS ABABA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has earned 275.2
million U.S. dollars by exporting 103,423 tons of coffee during
the 1998/99 fiscal year ending on July 7, 1999, according to the
Coffee and Tea Authority.
</P>
<P>
Of all the coffee export, 87,287 tons were from private coffee
exporters, and the remaining 16,136 tons had been supplied by the
state-owned Ethiopian Coffee Export Enterprise, the Ethiopia
Herald newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is one of major the coffee exporters in the world,
though it consumes annually two-thirds of the coffee produced in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Horn of Africa country exported about 120,000 tons of
coffee in 1997/ 98. The decrease of coffee export was attributed
to a slump in the world price.
</P>
<P>
The depression of coffee market was allegedly caused by excess
supply of the crop by Brazil and some other leading coffee-growing
countries.

<HEADLINE> Japan Fails to Narrow Gaps Over Steel Trade With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Japan and the United States on
Thursday failed to narrow their differences over bilateral steel
trade at a vice-ministerial meeting, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held here between Japanese Vice Minister for
International Affairs Hisamitsu Arai and his U.S. counterpart,
David Aaron, undersecretary for international trade at the
Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Arai accused Washington of "abusing" its
authority to hold antidumping investigations over Japanese steel
exports, damaging Japanese steelmakers' exports.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated that Japan's steel exports to the U.S. have
already fallen to the monthly average of 1997 pre-crisis levels, a
target agreed on by the two sides, since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
In response, Aaron said that U.S. steel imports from Japan and
other countries were at a destructive level, resulting in 11,000
jobs being slashed in the U.S. steel industry and the bankruptcies
of two steelmakers last year.
</P>
<P>
Japan's steel shipments to the U.S. had surged in 1998, partly
due to sluggish domestic demand and Asia's economic woes,
prompting the U.S. to declare a crisis.
</P>
<P>
Aaron defended his country's antidumping investigations, saying
they are an allowed measure under rules of the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Aaron also said prices of Japanese-made steel products kept on
falling last year, encouraging Russian steelmakers to follow suit.

more than 400 million yuan in equity can allocate 25 to 75 percent
of the total offering to corporate investors and the rest will be
offered on the stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The CSRC divides corporate investors into strategic investors
and general corporate investors. Strategic investors usually have
close business ties with the company issuing the stock and must
hold the shares for not less than six months. General corporate
investors can sell their shares three months after the stock is
listed on the stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The company issuing the stock and its underwriter can determine
the stock price and state-owned enterprises, listed companies, and
other corporate investors can take part in the allocation if they
are not using illegal funds. For example, they can not use bank
loans or funds raised through the issue of shares.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say that the new regulation will draw more
corporate investors and make the market more stable. It also
provides a new investment tool for state-owned enterprises, which,
the analysts adds, is particularly important at a time when the
government is trying every means to stimulate domestic demand and
investment.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Forms Committee to Tackle Eclipse Dangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government has decided
to form a three-man ministerial committee to oversee a nationwide
awareness campaign advising citizens of precautionary measures for
next month's eclipse of the sun.
</P>
<P>
The decision, which was made at the weekly cabinet session
Wednesday night, followed an announcement earlier in the day by
the National Council for Scientific Research that the Lebanese
will be able to partially view the eclipse in the afternoon of
August 11, the Daily Star reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The committee, comprising information, health and social
affairs ministers, will prepare detailed reports on the effects
of the eclipse on citizens who try to view it with the naked eye
and provide suggestions to protect them from harm.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Anwar Khalil warned that failure to abide
by the committee's imminent advice "may lead to irreversible
damage to the eyes."
</P>
<P>
He also warned people who might try to profit from the event by
selling inauthenic eyeglasses or filters.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, the eclipse will start at 1:12 p.m. local time, peak
at 2:39 p.m. and end at 3.58 p.m. on August 11, the research
council said.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Two Jordanian men were hanged
Wednesday for raping a child and murdering a women in separate
incidents, the fifth and sixth executions carried out this year
in the kingdom, Jordan Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Othman Abdu Lawi, 49, from the Karak district was put to death

parents informed the authorities when they found her seven
months in pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
The second man executed Wednesday was Mansour Subeih, 50, from
the Swaqa district for killing a woman whom he had attempted to
rape in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Men convicted of raping a minor or murder are normally hanged
in the desert kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Persuades Zimbabwe to Pullout From Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has begun talks to convince
Zimbabwe to withdraw its troops from the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) so that the cease-fire accord signed in Zambian
capital Lusaka on July 10 can be executed.
</P>
<P>
Uganda welcomed the agreement to end the war in the third
largest African country, Foreign Minister Eriya Kategaya told
Parliament Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision newspaper Thursday quoted the minister as saying
that Uganda is to talk to Zimbabwe and other interested parties to
first withdraw their troops so that the factions engaged in combat
can implement the Lusaka peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is willing to pull out its troops deployed in the DRC
following the cease-fire agreement, Kategaya added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Kampala is trying to reconcile the two rebel
groups within the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) and Jean
Pierre Bemba's Movement for the Liberation of Congo in order for
them to reach a common understanding.
</P>
<P>
He insisted on the legitimacy of the presence of Ugandan troops
in the DRC, saying that its security was threatened by rebels
based in the vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of six African countries directly involved in the
11-month armed conflict in the central African country signed the
cease-fire agreement in Lusaka following marathon preparations by
foreign and defense ministers from these countries.
</P>
<P>
The rebels fighting to topple DRC President Laurent Kabila did
not sign it because they could not reach agreement as to who
should represent all the rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has widely been regarded as one of key supporters of the
rebels there and began deploying troops deep into the DRC to
allegedly uproot the bases of the rebels of the Allied Democratic
Forces (ADF).
</P>
<P>
The ADF rebels infiltrated into western Uganda to abduct and
kill, posing a serious threat the region's security and
development.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Ban Polluting Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
decided to ban the polluting tree-wheelers within the Kathmandu
valley from August 17, said The Kathmandu Post Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The three wheelers, known as Vikram tempos, have been the major
factor behind the capital's deteriorated air quality.
</P>
<P>
There are roughly 5,800 diesel-operated tempos running in
Kathmandu, producing thick, blue gas and smoke wherever they go.
</P>
<P>
As the owners of Vikram tempos have filed protests against the
government's decision to ban the vehicles, there remains some
doubt  whether the decision can be put into effective
implementation remains a doubt.

<HEADLINE> Athletic Records Fall at Pan American Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States
Wednesday kept its firm contol of the Pan American medals race
with a total of 43 golds, but its athletes looked flat out on a
busy track and field day.
</P>
<P>
The Americans netted 12 gold, half of them from wrestling, 11
silver and 5 bronze today, with hosts Canada speeding up by
turning in a 7-8-10 record.
</P>
<P>
Cuba landed 5 gold, three of them coming as new Pan American
Games' records.
</P>
<P>
In the University of Manitoba Stadium which saw ten athletic
golds claimed, the traditional powerhouse United States only
managed two, relying on Marla Runyan (women's 1,500m) and Anthony
Washington (men's discus) to save the day for them.
</P>
<P>
Four Pan American track and field records fell today,
respectively to Figueroa Pernia (women's 400m hurdles) and Yamile
Aldama Pozo (women's triple jump) from Cuba, Brazilian Eronildes
Araujo (men's 400m hurdles) and Mexican Rocha De La Cruz (women's
10,000m).
</P>
<P>
Female high jumper Arrendel Rosario snatched the first gold for
the Dominica Republic at the Games, with a personal best jump of 1.
93 meters.
</P>
<P>
Hosts Canada had three of its seven golds coming from badminton,
but what thrilled them most was to see home-town heroine and Pan
American Games flag bearer Tanya Dubnicoff wheeling away with the
women's 500m time trial cycling gold.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 1km time trial, Cuba's Julio Herrera established a
new Games record of one minute 4.487 seconds to win gold.
</P>
<P>
In the Pan American Pool, home favourite Eryn Bulmer
accumulated 530.220 points to take the women's three-meter
springboard title while the men's platform gold went to Mexican
Fernando Platas.
</P>
<P>
The 13th Pan Am Games is the third largest sporting event ever
held in the North America besides the 1984 Los Angeles and 1996
Atlanta Olympics.

<P>
XIAMEN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Xiamen, the port city in eastern
Fujian Province, sold 11,800 tons of grain reserves at auction
July 26-27.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the grain was part of the 14,500
tons of reserves that have been held for a long time. They were
sold at the Xiamen Grains and Edible Oils Wholesale Market.
</P>
<P>
They consisted of early and late rice and imported wheat that
had been held in state-owned grain depots since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four businesspeople competed in the sale that brought in

stockpiles to make enough room for new grain and reduce
maintenance costs, say local officials.

Bangladesh has planned to organize a series of "Bangladesh Week"
programs in Europe, America and Asia in the current fiscal year
(July 1999-June 2000) to attract more foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The BOI will organize "Bangladesh Week" in Berlin, Brussels,
Milan, Osaka, Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong, New York, Los Angels,
Chicago, Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, according to the decision
taken at a recent BOI meeting, the Bangladesh Observer reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Bangladesh Week" programs include seminars and workshops on
investment, trade fairs, exhibition and cultural activities, which
will also help popularize the country's products and tourism.
</P>
<P>
"This special program has been planned with a view to building
image of the country in the outside world, which knows Bangladesh
as a country of natural calamity and poverty," a BOI official
said. he added, "We want to apprise the foreign investors of the
incentives and facilities now being offered by the Bangladeshi
government."
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh had received foreign direct investment offers of
288.8 billion taka (5.96 billion U.S. dollars) in the June
1996-May 1999 period, and a total of 425 projects had been
registered with the BOI during the period with opportunities for
the employment of more than 94,000 people, according the latest
BOI statistics.
</P>
<P>
The projects include five in the power sector, three in the
telecom sector, two in the oil and gas sector and 12 in the cement
manufacturing sector and the pace of their implementation is on
the whole satisfactory, BOI officials said.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Produce Armored Mine Mopper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Defense Industrial
Organization affiliated to the Iranian Defense Ministry will
produce a prototype armored vehicle to be used for mine mopping.
</P>
<P>
The mine mopper will be capable of sweeping all kinds of
landmines weighing up to 10 kilograms and planted 30 centimeters
below land surface, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle can work over an area of 3,000 to 6,000 square
meters to clear the landmines through detection and poundings that
bring about their destruction or detonation.
</P>
<P>
It works on the principle of hydrostatics and has the
capability of being transformed into a remote control system, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The mine mopper is currently being used by a search team that
is trying to find those missing in action in the Iran-Iraq war
from 1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
The production cost of the armored landmine mopper is about
400,000 U.S. dollars, less than the cost for a foreign made one at
700,000 dollars, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Iran will be able to clear up landmines of different kinds in
an area of 4 million hectares in the country swiftly once the mass
production of this armored vehicle is initiated, it added.

<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Tourists now have a new way to see
the Chinese capital -- by boat.
</P>
<P>
The first boat tour started on Wednesday on a major canal that
runs through the downtown area. Beijing has 336 km. of rivers and
canals. In ancient times, grain, foodstuff, and commodities from
the south were transported to the capital on them.
</P>
<P>
However, in this century, most of them have silted up or have
had their water polluted and navigation has come to a halt.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing government has spent a billion yuan and used 10,000
workers to dredge them since 1998 and sources say that all of them
will be open to navigation in two years and they will be used for
various forms of entertainment.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Some 70,000 people who were left
homeless recently when a dike in central China's Hunan Province
broke have been given temporary housing.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial Flood Control Headquarters says that 500 tents,
150 tons of rice, and 500,000 yuan in cash and nearly 300,000 yuan
worth of pharmaceuticals have been provided for them. Each
household was given 25 kg. of rice and 20 yuan in cash.
</P>
<P>
The dike burst around noon on July 23 in the Dongting Lake's
Minzhu Flood Diversion Zone near the city of Yiyang. The diversion
zone is one of the 24 in Hunan on the middle reaches of the
Yangtze River. The break left three people dead and more than 50
injured.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 soldiers and farmers were sent to repair the dyke.
There are now 12 medical teams with more than 100 personnel
working with the victims to prevent and control the spread of
disease.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Brazil lived up to its
reputation as the nation of soccer by beating the United States 1-
0 for a clean slate in the Confederations Cup Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldinho scored early in the 12th minute and Brazil held on
to give the first defeat to the United States who opened its
journey with a 2-1 victory over New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The Americans came out fighting and never gave up, dominating
possession for much of the game and taking many shots on goal but
failed to score even through the penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
In the 72nd minute, Joe-Max Moore kicked his penalty straight
into goalkeeper Dida's hands.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians speeded up the game whenever they could to tire
the Americans, while the Americans often slowed it down.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Brazil that beat Germany 4-0, almost secures the
top spot in the group as it will face winless New Zealand on
Friday in its last group match.
</P>
<P>
While the other semifinal spot will be fought out between the
United States and Germany with the former advances in goal
differential in case of a tie.

<HEADLINE> AFC Keeps Boycott Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Football
Confederation (AFC) may still boycott the 2002 World Cup should
FIFA fails to meet the needs of more places for Asia, AFC
secretary-general Peter Velappan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The five seats are our rights but we are open to all kinds of
options," Velappan said, noting that the FIFA executive committee
was meeting in Zurich on September 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
"If we can solve the problem then by whatever means, the
boycott does not arise. If there is an impasse the (AFC)
extraordinary congress must decide thereafter," he said, referring
to a congress in Kuala Lumpur on October 10.
</P>
<P>
Asian delegates walked out of a FIFA congress earlier this
month after being awarded four places at the tournament as both
Japan and South Korea will advance as co-hosts.
</P>
<P>
Velappan reiterated that "Asia is compelled to boycott the
World Cup 2002" as FIFA had not acceded to the AFC's request for
three seats plus two for hosts Japan and South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Australian Treasurer Indicates Increasing Aid to PNG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Australian Treasurer Peter
Costello Thursday indicated Australia's willingness to increase
its assistance to Papua New Guinea (PNG) if its new government
implements a program to restructure the ailing economy, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Costello, the first Australian minister to visit PNG since
Mekere Morauta was elected prime minister on July 14, also said in
PNG's capital Port Moresby that Australia was willing to bring
forward 30 million Australian dollars (19.8 million U.S. dollars)
in payments to support PNG's budget.
</P>
<P>
Australia already provides 300 million Australian dollars (198
million U.S. dollars) to PNG in aid on a yearly basis, making it
the largest recipient of Australian financial assistance, AAP
said.
</P>
<P>
Costello was quoted as saying that Australia would offer PNG
technical support, assistance and manpower to help in
restructuring the economy.
</P>
<P>
Australia could also assist PNG in talks on securing loans with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Sir Mekere has assured me that his government and he are
committed to economic restructure," Costello said.
</P>
<P>
"I have assured him that the Australian government stands ready
to assist in providing technical support and assistance and
manpower, that we will be looking to the mission of the World Bank
and the IMF, which will be here in two weeks, to discuss a program
for PNG," he added.
</P>
<P>
Costello said PNG needed money to restructure its debt and
foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
"Such support would involve international institutions, in
particular the IMF and the World Bank," he said.

<HEADLINE> Sarajevo Summit: Just Token of Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sarajevo, July 29 (Xinhua) -- About 30 leaders from Balkan
countries and other parts of the world are ready to hold a "
Stability Pact Summit" here on Friday, to reaffirm their
commitment to reconstruction in the region after NATO's 78-day
bombing on Yugoslavia, but officials believe it is nothing more
than a token for real stability across the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The summit, to be chaired by Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari,
forms part of Germany-proposed "stability pact" for southeast
Europe, which involves the 15 European Union (EU) member states,
nine non-EU European countries, plus the United States, Canada and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled three-hour summit in the capital of Bosnia-
Herzegovina, a seemingly symbol of Balkan destruction and rebirth,
is aimed at reinforcing the political importance of the "stability
pact" agreed by the major western powers in June "to promote
democracy and economic growth" in the region.
</P>
<P>
But a German government official said the time is very limited
for such a large gathering of government leaders and senior
officials.
</P>
<P>
A senior British official said on condition of anonymity that
it could have been better to put off the summit until more work
had been done on the three main chapters of the stability pact:
democracy, economic regeneration and security.
</P>
<P>
"Sarajevo is coming a bit early because we've just formed the
stability pact," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the western powers have been in a dilemma
from the very beginning after NATO's air war in the powder-keg
region, in regard to aid for Yugoslavia's neighboring countries,
international policing of Kosovo and rebuilding of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Some EU sources said the Sarajevo meeting would be an
opportunity to counter worries in Albania and Macedonia over the
aid issue.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government has been urging the western powers to
provide money for its refugee arrangements made during NATO's air
strike against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to Sarajevo, to stress especially the big
contribution of Albania during the crisis and, based on this, to
demand from the international community assistance for economic
development," Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal Milo said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is not enough to say just fine words about the
contribution. "We have heard a lot of them," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials and scholars agree that as long as Serbia
remains isolated there will be a giant black hole at the center of
the stability pact.
</P>
<P>
However, some U.S. officials disclosed that the Sarajevo summit
might announce programs to support dissident Serb groups and
cities, which analysts believe would undermine stability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Some observers in Europe suggest that Balkan leaders may have
already realized the uncertainty in a short term for their own
countries and the region's instability in a long run. They will
gather here on Thursday to discuss their fate before joining other
leaders including U.S. President Bill Clinton at Friday's summit.

SHANGHAI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China's leading gearbox
manufacturer, the Shanghai Automobile Gearworks, has become the
first Chinese factory to get the VDA 6.1 certification for
automobile quality of the German Automobile Industry Association (
VDA).
</P>
<P>
VDA 6.1 is considered to be one of the two top automobile
quality standards in the world, along with the QS 9000 of the
three big U.S. automobile manufacturers, Chrysler, Ford, and
General Motors.
</P>
<P>
The two standards both have more stringent requirements than
the standard ISO 9000.

Shanghai Automobile Gearworks has been a supplier of Germany's

9000 and QS 9000 certification a few years ago.

HANGZHOU, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China plans to establish its
first museum of finance in Hangzhou, the capital of east China's

</P>
<P>
The Chinese Museum of Finance will house major cultural relics
and data related to finances in China, where it has a history of
5,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for construction work are under way and a group
has been set up by the Ministry of Finance to oversee the work.
Finance departments in Zhejiang Province have collected more than
10,000 historical relics.
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou has chosen as the site of the museum because it is one
of the areas in China where the finance business originated. It is
also home to several other state-level museums like the Tea Museum
and the Silk Museum.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Study Transit Facility to India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh government has
approved in principle a proposal for examining and discussing the
transshipment of Indian goods through Bangladesh, press reports
here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The approval was given at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A Joint Expert Committee would discuss and examine the matter
of transporting Indian goods from one part to another of India
through Bangladesh by Bangladeshi transports, giving priority to
Bangladesh's interest and economic development, an official
announcement said.
</P>
<P>
India has long been pressing for transit to transport goods to
and from its seven northeastern states through Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The government decision came just over one month after Indian
caretaker Prime Minister Atal Behari Vjpayee's short visit to
Dhaka when he was believed to have raised the transit issue with
his Bangladeshi counterpart, Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
The Indian proposal sparked off widespread controversy and
protests in the political circles in the country. The opposition
parties said that giving transit facilities to India would
jeopardize Bangladesh's sovereignty and security.
</P>
<P>
Oli Ahmed, member of the Standing Committee of the major
opposition - the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), denounced the
government decision, saying, "The cabinet decision about conceding
transit facility to India would ultimately jeopardize security of
Bangladesh."
</P>
<P>
He refuted the suggestion that the transit would bring economic
benefits to Bangladesh. "It's a bluff to divert the people's
attention," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jatiya Party leader Kazi Zafar Ahmed termed the cabinet
decision as a ploy to give a corridor to India. "It is not a
transit, rather the government has granted corridor to India," he
said, adding that the permission would destroy Bangladesh's
economy and put the country's independence and sovereignty in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
Jamaat-e-Islami Secretary General Maulana Matiur Rahman Nizami
also said the government decision was a first step toward giving a
corridor to India. Before taking such an important decision, the
matter should have been discussed in the parliament, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The decision is against the interest of Bangladesh" as "India
will not only use the transit for expanding its trade, but also
use it for military purpose to curb rebellion or independence
movement in northeastern states of India," he said.
</P>
<P>
In reply to the criticism, Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed said
the cabinet decision was only an approval in principle under which
the expert committee would examine the infrastructure faculties
like road communication and its existing condition. "The
opposition has no right to criticize the government on this issue,
because it was the BNP which initiated the process of providing
such facilities to India when it was in power," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Awal Mintoo, president of the Federation of Bangladesh
Chambers of Commerce and Industries said, "It's very good
decision. The sooner the two countries will reach consensus on the
matter and implement the decision of providing transit facility,
the better it'll be for our economy."
</P>
<P>
Giving transit to India would also narrow down the huge trade
gap between the two neighboring nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the security of the country, Mintoo said better financial
condition was prime security for a nation. "What is the security
of poor person? What will happen to our security if we're not
economically strong?" he asked.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Demands Delay in Voter Registration in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Following a postponement of the
East Timor direct ballot announced by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, the Indonesian government demanded that registration of
eligible voters in the territory also be postponed.
</P>
<P>
"All of the ballot process is under U.N. coordination. ... But
what we demand is that registration at the ballot should be
delayed too, about a week," State Secretary and Justice Minister
Muladi told reporters here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia couldn't refuse the U.N. delay decision for
it is difficult to proceed ballot without the U.N. umbrella.
</P>
<P>
"So, we have to follow U.N. decision," Muladi said.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. spokesman told reporters in New York on Wednesday that
Annan made the decision after consulting with Indonesia and
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
It was the second delay in the implementation of the ballot,
which had originally been scheduled for August 8, but was later on
pushed back to August 21 or 22.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Information Minister Yunus Yosfiah said after a
cabinet meeting on Wednesday that President B.J. Habibie did not
mind at all if the ballot was implemented on August 30.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said one reason given by the Untied
Nations for the delay was the late start of the voter registration
process.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we will have difficulty with this one week
postponement, assuming the registration process is also extended
for another week until the week before the actual ballot," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The ballot will allow the territory's people to choose whether
their homeland should become an autonomous region within Indonesia
or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.
</P>
<P>
Early this year Indonesia announced it would grant East Timor
independence if the people in the territory reject Indonesia's
offer of wide-ranging autonomy.

<HEADLINE> Suicide Bombing Kills Sri Lanka's Tamil Parliamentarian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A moderate Tamil parliamentarian
and three others including the suicide bomber were killed in a
suicide bombing Thursday morning in the capital of Sri Lanka,
informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
N. Thiruchelvam of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) and
two others were inside a car when a suicide bomber riding a
motorcycle attacked them, the sources said.
</P>

Thiruchelvam is a leading Tamil leader who favors political
solution and cooperation to solve the long-standing ethnic
conflicts in the country.
</P>

anniversary.
</P>

<HEADLINE> India, Russia Hold Inter-Governmental Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- India and Russia began a
three-day inter-governmental meeting here Wednesday mainly to
discuss their trade and economic cooperation, with Russia
proposing to set up a rupee account for investment in India.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made by Russian First Deputy Prime Minister
Vikto khristenko at the sixth session of the Indo-Russian
Inter-governmental Commission (IRIGC) on Trade, Economic,
Scientific, Technological and Cultural Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Khristenko, who arrived here earlier Wednesday, asked India to
provide concession to rupee trade with Russia on par with other
hard currency exports to increase bilateral trade between the two
traditional allies. Trade between the two countries fell by 23.23
percent in 1998-99 due mainly to the fall of traditional exports
and imports.
</P>
<P>
Indian Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha, co-chairman of the
IRIGC, told his guests that New Delhi had already given a draft
proposal for using rupee debt fund for investment, saying the
Indian government was considering the clarifications sought by
Russian of the draft.
</P>
<P>
The rupee debt fund was a special arrangement between the two
countries against the background of India's purchases of Russian
weapons and military equipment during the years of Cold War, which
resulted in hundreds of billions of rupee debts to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Khristenko proposed to set up a rupee account with the Reserve
Bank of India, the country's central bank, to use rupee-rouble
debt for investments in the South Asian country.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reviewed the progress of implementation of
decisions taken at the fifth session of the IRIGC, held in Moscow
in December last year.
</P>
<P>
Sinha said at the meeting that the recent decision of the
Indian government to reduce value addition norms for rupee trade
on par with dollar exports would promote trade between India and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
The two countries had set a target of doubling bilateral trade
by 2000. The two-way trade between the two countries stood at
525.9 billion rupees (approximately 1.25 billion U.S. dollars) in
1998-99.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi hopes that the scheduled visit later this year by
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, during which the two countries
will sign a strategic partnership agreement, would further
strengthen bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
With the special rupee and rouble debt arrangements, Russia is
now helping India build several projects including a 2,000-mw
nuclear power plant at Koodankulam in the southwestern state of
Tamil Nadu and revival of Indian Steel Authority subsidiary,
Indian Iron and Steel Company, at Burnpur in West Bengal.
</P>
<P>
India also showed keen interest in sourcing rough diamonds from
Russia. An Indian delegation has recently visited Moscow to
explore the possibilities of making direct purchase of the
diamonds.

MEXICO CITY, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The last group of refugees
from the civil war in Guatemala crossed the Mexican border on
their way home on Wednesday, putting an end to the international
efforts in resettling them.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony was held in Mexico's southern city of Champoton on
Wednesday to mark the conclusion of the Guatemalan refugee plan in
the states of Campeche and Quintana Roo.
</P>
<P>
Present at the ceremony were Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo,
visiting Guatemalan President Alvaro Arzu and U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata.
</P>
<P>
From 1981 to 1983, tens of thousands of Guatemalan refugees
fled domestic armed conflicts and crossed the border into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
They started to return home only after a peace treaty was
signed between the Guatemalan government and the guerrillas in
December 1996. The conflict left at least 200,000 people dead or
missing.
</P>
<P>
A total of 42,400 people were repatriated, while around 22,000
Guatemalans decided to register themselves as Mexican citizens and
stay on.
</P>
<P>
Of those who chose to stay, half were actually born in Mexico
and were granted Mexican citizenship automatically.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Denounces High-handedness in Pan American Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban delegation for the Pan
American games in Winnipeg, Canada, said on Wednesday that their
sports people are victims of high-handedness.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban delegation attributed the unfairness limiting their
share of the medals despite their current occupation of the second
place in the medals table.
</P>
<P>
The organising committee of the 13th Pan American Games, has
taken a contemplative and partial position in the realization of
the drawing of lots and the presentation of the competitions, said
the Cuban delegation, quoted on Wednesday by the official
newspaper "Granma".
</P>
<P>
"This high-handedness interferes with the development of the
competitions, their results, as well as the most noble aspirations
of the Cuban sports people", stated the document.
</P>
<P>
Up to the seventh phase of the competitions of Wednesday, Cuba
ranked second in the overall medal table with a total of 49 (21
gold, 16 silver, and 12 bronze), behind the United States with 83
(32-32-19) and above Canada who reapt 46 (13-11-22).
</P>
<P>
The Cuban delegation said in the declaration that they had
manifested their complaint in an official manner because the acts
"committed with impunity" had affected the competition in the
following sports of table tennis, karate and canoeing.
</P>
<P>
The delegation also added that they had faced pressures of
every type, including some press in the sneaky work of the talent
scouts and other sports dealers.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban sports authorities criticised the organisers who
tried to eliminate rewards in which Cuba is the favourite to limit
their crop of the medals and thus benefit the host country.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban sports people attending the Winnipeg Games include
numerous Olympic, world and Pan American champions, who are
attempting to maintain their second place in the medal tables.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban authorities have also stated that various press
outlets are also trying to aid the desertion of the sports people
from the island.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Castro said on Monday that never before "have
we seen such cheating and dirty tricks in the Panamerican Games,
all of which are to harras Cuba, to take away our second place,
for the benefit of the host country".

today, claimed by Brazil, Cuba and Mexico respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 400m hurdles, Eronildes Araujo clocked 48.23
seconds to notch up the gold, trimming 0.26 seconds off the
previous best mark by Jamaican Graham Winthrop.
</P>
<P>
But his result looked remote from the world record of 46:78,
set by American Kevin Young seven years ago in the Barcelona
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Figueroa Pernia of Cuba landed the women's gold with a time of
53.44 seconds, wiping off the 12-year-old old mark of 54.23 set by
American Judi Brown in the 1987 Games. Yamile Aldama Pozo
contributed another gold, from women's triple jump, with a new
Games mark of 14.77 meters.
</P>
<P>
Mexico once again showed its prowess in the long distance event
as Rocha De La Cruz posted a Games record-breaking time of 32
minutes 56.51 seconds to win the women's 10,000m.
</P>
<P>
The world record of the discipline was held by the Chinese
legend Wang Junxia, who timed an awesome 29:31.78 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Araujo's teammate Claudinei Silva added a 200m gold to his 100m
bronze from Monday while in the women's 200m, Debbie Ferguson of
the Bahamas followed her teammate Chandra Sturrup's 100m triumph
to take the title.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 1,500m, Marla Runyan saved the blushes for the
United States by winning its only track gold from a busy athletic
day, with a time of four minutes 16.86 seconds. Her male teammate
Anthony Washington brought home a dicus gold with a 64.25 toss.

Female high jumper Arrendel Rosario snatched the first gold for
the Dominica Republic at the Games, with a personal best of 1.93
meters.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Panama is to promote
vacationing and recreational tourism in the areas returned to
Panamanian control by the United States, said Nicolas Ardito
Barletta, director of the Inter-oceanic Regional Authority (ARI).
</P>
<P>
Panama will turn these areas into one of the principal tourist
centers on the Latin American continent, according to Barletta,
who is in charge of U.S.-returned property and territory.
</P>
<P>
At a tourist forum held on Wednesday, Barletta specified that
the ARI has projects which will cost over 2.54 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
One of the most ambitious plans is to build a four-star hotel
in the former U.S. military base of Fort Davis, on the Atlantic
coast, with an investment of more than 2 billion dollars from the
Spanish company Rockmar.
</P>
<P>
A South Korean-U.S. consortium plans to invest 300 million

<HEADLINE> U.S. Anti-drug Personnel to Operate in Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The military personnel and boats
which operate from the port of Manta in Ecuador are subject to
Ecuadorian law, said U.S. top anti-drug official General Barry
McCaffrey here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in the Presidential House in Ecuador,
McCaffrey concluded that the selection of Manta as the base for
anti-drug operations was the result of a study performed a year
ago. The study was concluded after 2,000 flights over Ecuador to
help establish the best location for the anti-narcotic
installation.
</P>
<P>
Control missions from the Manta base in the province of Manabi
will be performed by the U.S. Customs Service, the Drug
Enforcement Agency, the U.S. Coast Guard and the air force.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey said the U.S. presence in Ecuador is essential
because the country is surrounded by strong anti-government forces.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, to deal with the guerrilla movement and the
drug cartels in Colombia is the responsibility of the Colombian
government. "But we must all help the peace process within the
country," he added.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey, the U.S. anti-narcotic czar, arrived here Tuesday
for a two-day visit. He will also evaluate the possibility of
installing an "Advanced Operations Office" for the long term at
the Manta base, a project which the Unite States is also
considering for Curacao.
</P>
<P>
These installations will aid the anti-narcotic operations that
the United States performed earlier from the Howard airbase in
Panama.

<HEADLINE> Oil, Gas Gushing Out of Myanmar's Letpando Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil and natural gas are
gushing again out of a well in Letpando oil and natural gas field
in Myanmar's central Magway division after the well had been
closed for nearly 23 years for low production in 1976.
</P>
<P>
The well No.1-A of the onshore Letpando oil and natural gas
field in the division's Pauk township is estimated to have been
producing between 200 and 300 barrels of crude oil and between
56,634 and 84,951 cubic meters of natural gas per day since July
21 this year, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The drilling of the well started in May 1974 and was then
producing 845 barrels of crude oil and 32,791 cubic meters of
natural gas per day.
</P>
<P>
Test production from the well began in February 1976 and was
closed later in the same year due to low production.
</P>
<P>
Of the test wells drilled up to March this year in the Letpando
oil and natural gas field, 12 are producing 651 barrels of crude
oil and 40,918 cubic meters of natural gas daily.
</P>
<P>
There are about 17 onshore and two outstanding offshore oil and
natural gas fields in Myanmar. The two offshore fields are the
Yadana in the country's gulf of Mottma and the Yedagun off the
Tanintharyi coast.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar produced 3.378
million barrels of crude oil in 1998-99 which ended in March, a
reduction of 252,000 barrels from 1997-98 while the output of
natural gas was 1.724 billion cubic meters, a drop of 74 million
cubic meters compared with 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
To develop the crude oil and natural gas industry, Myanmar has,
since late 1988, been absorbing foreign investments for
undertaking both offshore and onshore oil and gas exploration and
production projects.
</P>
<P>
By the end of April this year, foreign investment in the oil
and gas sector reached 2.3 billion U.S. dollars in 46 projects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar has to import 280,000-300,000 tons of crude
oil and 100,000-150,000 tons of diesel oil every year as local
production cannot meet domestic demand.

<HEADLINE> Four Bodies Recovered From U.S. Plane Crash Site in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTEFE DE BOGOTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Military personnel
recovered four bodies Wednesday from a U.S. plane that crashed
Friday in south Colombia.
</P>
<P>
According to Colombian Air-Force Commander Fabio Velazquez, the
plane was discovered close to the hills of Pastascoy.
</P>
<P>
Velasco said there were five Americans and two Colombians in
the four-engine "De Havilland RC-7" plane, which was fitted with
photographic equipment for detecting plants cultivated for
narcotics.
</P>
<P>
The identities of the five U.S. military personnel have not
been made public. It is only known that they were in the sixth
brigade of the U.S. Air-Defence Artillery (ADA). Two of the
victims were captains, one a technician and two soldiers.
</P>
<P>
According to the ADA source, the five Americans were part of
the 240-strong contingent of the U.S. military present in Colombia,
many of which were engaged in anti-drug operations.
</P>
<P>
There are signs that the U.S. military's role in Colombia has
become blurred. The respected El Espectador newspaper ran a banner
headline "U.S. Spies On FARC with RC-7" on Tuesday. But U.S.
officials have insisted that the plane, carrying sophisticated
infrared imaging, heat-seeking and eavesdropping equipment, was on
a routine" counter-narcotics mission.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves 4.5-Billion-Dollar Loan to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) approved Wednesday a new loan of 4.5 billion U.S. dollars to
help Russia pay old debts and avoid a confidence-cracking default.
</P>
<P>
A total of 640 million dollars would be made available
immediately, said an IMF spokeswoman. However, the money of the 17-
month loan will never actually reach Russia, but will be paid
directly to an account at the IMF to service Russia's debts to the
IMF, which amounts to 18 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy to the
International Monetary Fund, Mikhail Zadornov, worked out the
final details with the IMF's first deputy managing director,
Stanley Fischer, and the 24-member executive board during a day-
long meeting.
</P>
<P>
It is the first IMF loan to Russia since Moscow devalued the
ruble and defaulted on some debts last August, breaking the terms
of an emergency cash injection totaling 4.8 billion dollars from
July 1998 and sending shockwaves around the financial world.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has extended a series of loans to Russia over the last
seven years, but few of them have been paid in full amount due to
the IMF's persistent concern about Russia's poor tax collection,
mounting arrears and sluggish progress in economic reform.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government has adopted new laws and regulations in
an effort to win this latest IMF credit and IMF officials say they
are impressed by the government policies.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, speaking during a
visit to Washington this week, said his country had now realized
that there was no alternative to the policies agreed with the IMF.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Reiterates "One China" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Wednesday reiterated that the United Nations upholds the
"one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement at a meeting with Ambassador Qin Huasun,
representative of the Permanent Mission of China to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Annan said, "the U.N. position on the issue is clear-cut -- it
upholds the one-China policy. It has never changed the policy."
</P>
<P>
Qin briefed the secretary-general on the tensions created by
recent separatist remarks made by Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui and
the Chinese government's solemn and just position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The remarks are aimed at repudiating the "one China" principle
with an attempt to cut Taiwan away from China, Qin said, adding
this is a very dangerous step by the Taiwan authorities in their
separatist moves which has seriously affected the development of
the cross-straits relations and stability in the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Qin said as early as in 1971 the U.N. General Assembly adopted
Resolution 2758 affirming the "one China" principle and
recognizing the government of the People's Republic of China as
the sole legitimate government representing the entire Chinese
people. This has become common sense, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief agreed with the view and reaffirmed the U.N.
stand.

<P>
KIEV, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian National Aviation
Bureau is studying the possibility of a full-scale restoration of
air traffic between Kiev and Belgrade, the Ukrainian Interfax
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two-way air traffic between the two capital cities is
expected to reopen as soon as all necessary procedures are
completed, officials of the Ukrainian National Airline Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The air route between Kiev and Belgrade, opened in 1994 under
an agreement between the two governments, was cut off by the NATO
air strikes against Yugoslavia in March this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
People's Daily
</P>
<P>
-- A commentary published today criticizes Lee Teng-hui for his
"two states" remarks, saying that Lee has gone too far along the
road of splitting the motherland.
</P>
<P>
People of insight in Taiwan should have a clear mind on the
cross-Straits situation and join the mainland in stoutly
interdicting the risky move of Lee and his followers, the
commentary says.
</P>
<P>
Lee, fearing that cross-Straits relations will grow in a way
conducive to the reunification of the motherland, never fails to
put sand in the wheels whenever cross-Straits relations tend
toward relaxation and development, it says.
</P>
<P>
-- East China's province of Zhejiang continues its robust
economic growth this year after registering a 10.1 percent growth
last year.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua Daily Telegraph
</P>
<P>
-- The Xinhua News Agency released a special commentator's
article calling on the country's elderly to live a scientific life.
</P>
<P>
Some unhealthy and decadent ideas have made their way into the
minds of the elderly, harming them mentally and physically, the
article says.
</P>
<P>
A typical example is Falun Gong, concocted by Li Hongzhi, which,
by taking advantage of the elder's desire to live longer and
healthier, has spread superstition and stirred up an anti-
scientific mentality among them.
</P>
<P>
-- China has confiscated 1.55 million volumes of illegally
published books and materials on Falun Gong since the Chinese
government banned it on July 22.
</P>
<P>
China Daily
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. House of Representatives voted by an overwhelming
majority to support the extension of Normal Trade Relations (NTR)
with China.
</P>
<P>
The House, in a 260-170 vote, defeated a measure calling for
the overturn of President Bill Clinton's decision to continue
China's NTR status. The vote will continue to allow the entry of
Chinese goods into the U.S. market for another year at the same
low tariff rates offered to most other nations.
</P>
<P>
-- The Ministry of Construction made public parts of its long-
awaited housing reform program on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> China to Tighten Control Over Narcotics Material </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China's drug administration plans
to impose tight control over production and the use of a medicinal
material which can be processed into the drug "ice", according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The State Drug Administration (SDA) has drawn up a regulation
to restrict the supply and use of ephedrine, asking that ephedrine
and its products may only be produced by SDA-designated
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The report described the action as "part of the global drive to
control the abuse of narcotics", and anti-narcotics specialists
from many countries have predicted that the abuse of such
substances as deoxyephedrine will gradually replace heroin and be
used widely in the next century.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the world's biggest producers of ephedrine,
which is often clinically used in the country to treat illnesses
like the common cold.
</P>
<P>
However, several drug trafficking cases have been disclosed in
which ephedrine was abstracted to be processed into drugs.
</P>
<P>
The SDA regulations ordered designated enterprises not to
increase production, transfer their technology or establish
branches in other places without permission from the SDA.
</P>
<P>
Ephedrine products can only be marketed in state-designated
commercial units. Researchers, hospitals and pharmaceutical plants
must apply for permission before they are allowed to purchase such
products from designated suppliers, according to the regulations.

"I look forward to it," Pippen said Tuesday night. "Right here

</P>
<P>
"Until that time comes for me to make a decision to do

</P>
<P>
There was talk Pippen would be dealt to the Lakers for Glen
Rice and former Rocket Robert Horry.
</P>

"That's all speculation," Pippen said. "I haven't sat down and

WINNIPEG, Canada, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Home-town heroine and Pan
Am Games flag bearer Tanya Dubnicoff wheeled away with the gold
medal on the cycling track here today, becoming the second
Winnipegger gold medalist at the two-week Olympic-style Games.
</P>
<P>
The world top-ranked Canadian followed Emma Robinson's rowing
triumph on Monday with a champion showing in the women's 500m time
trial event at Birds Hill Park.
</P>
<P>
But her winning time came as 35.394 seconds, well outside of
the world record of 34.010 held by Frenchwoman Felicia Ballanger.
</P>
<P>
Dubnicoff, the 29-year-old veteran who is leading the cycling
World Cup overall standings, is the most successful female in the
history of Canadian track cycling.
</P>
<P>
As eight-time Canadian champion, Dubnicoff has won two Pan Am
gold medals (1991, 1995) and two Commonwealth Games gold (1994,
1998). She won the 1993 World Championship in sprint cycling after
just 5 months in the sport.
</P>
<P>
Dubnicoff led the entire contingent of athletes into Winnipeg
Stadium on July 23 for the Pan Am Games opening ceremony as the
official flag bearer for the 1999 Games in her home town.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 1km time trial, Cuba's Julio Herrera established a
new Games record of one minute 4.487 seconds to win gold. The old
best mark was 1:05.307 set up by Canadian Jocelyn Lovell.

WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Coming off her first Wimbledon
title, top seed Lindsay Davenport looks to duplicate her success
of last year's summer hardcourt season when she begins defense of
her title tonight at the $520,000 Bank of the West Classic tennis

<HEADLINE> China Issues Regulations on Secondary Housing Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Construction has
issued new regulations governing secondary housing market
clarifying housing property rights of owners of public and
government-subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
As a part of the ministry's housing reform program, the new
regulations will enable state officials and employees to go to the
secondary housing market if they want to sell their home or
exchange them for more spacious ones.
</P>
<P>
They have gained housing property rights "upon buying public
housing at cost price," the ministry officials were quoted by
today's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, home sellers must have housing property right
certificates before they can sell their homes on the secondary
market.
</P>
<P>
For decades, China operated a welfare housing system under
which the government allocated houses as welfare to State
officials and employees. Residents had no housing property rights
to such welfare houses, which were owned by their work units.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials said that the new policies will go a long
way towards creating an active housing market, stimulating
housing purchases and eventually boosting growth in gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
Xie Jiajin, director of the ministry's Department of Housing
and Real Estate Industry, was quoted by the English newspaper as
saying that China will continue to look to the housing sector as a
new economic growth engine by speeding up housing reform and
encouraging more people to purchase housing this year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the housing sector contributed about one percent out
of the 7.8 percent GDP growth.
</P>
<P>
"By clarifying the housing property issue, we are building up
confidence among more and more people that the government is
trying its best to shape a healthy and active secondary housing
market," Xie said.
</P>
<P>
An active market also generates tens of thousands of job
opportunities and gives a boost to the consumption of furniture,
decorations and construction, she added.

Edmundo Larroza, officer-in-charge of the Philippine National

<HEADLINE> Germany Posts Trade Deficit in Eastern Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Germany's trade with eastern
European countries posted a deficit for the first time since the
early 1990s, said the Berlin-based economic research institute in
its latest report.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that in the first three months of 1999,
Germany witnessed a deficit of 79 million marks (43.9 million U.S.
dollars) with its east European trade partners, compared with the
6.2-billion-mark (3.4 billion dollars) surplus in the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 and 1998, Germany maintained a 20-billion-mark (11
billion dollars) trade surplus with the eastern European countries.
But exports slumped since the second half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, German trade with Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary, its three largest partners in the region, showed no sign
of a decline, with a surplus still figured in for the first half
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the deficit this year has resulted primarily
from the decline in exports to Russia, which imported less because
of its economic crisis, while Germany imported more from Russia,
especially crude oil and petroleum.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Health Minister Nimal
Siripala de Silva has warned of the spreading of dengue fever
which has left five people dead and hundreds of others
hospitalized so far this year, press reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
People should make a joint effort by taking preventive measures
to control the spread of the disease, the Daily News quoted the
minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Health Ministry alone cannot combat the
disease without community participation as the only way to
eradicate dengue is to eliminate breeding places of mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry has identified industrial establishments in
urban areas as the most vulnerable places which provide breeding
grounds for mosquitoes transmitting the disease.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry had identified 95 positive cases so far
this year while around 600 suspected cases had been reported from
several parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
In Colombo alone there were 304 suspected cases. Colombo's Lady
Ridgeway Hospital Director Dr. Wimal Jayantha said an average of
about seven children were admitted every day with suspected
dengue.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Club Denies Release of Wang Zhizhi to NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China's basketball club August 1
Thursday denied recent local reports that it has agreed to release
its 2.12-meter center Wang Zhizhi, who was selected by the NBA
Dallas Mavericks with the 36th pick on June 30, to play for the
NBA club.
</P>
<P>
"No way," said Qian Limin, general manager of the Chinese Army
club. "It's an absolute rumour that we have agreed to release Wang
for NBA."
</P>
<P>
Qian explained that the August 1 has no right to release Wang
to anywhere as it's a privilege of the concerned authorities since
Wang is a member of the Chinese Army. "We reported the issue (
Wang's pick by Dallas) to our leaders ealier this month, now we
are just waiting for their decision."
</P>
<P>
Huashen Daily carried a report on Tuesday with a banner of "
Augurst 1 agreed to release, Wang is to play for Mavericks".
</P>
<P>
Besides, some other local newspapers in Guangzhou, Shenyang,
Shanghai and Jinan also printed the reports of the kind, which
were likely originated from the same source.
</P>
<P>
"They were too innocent without any sense of responsibility,"
Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Qian explained that he had received a fax from Dallas, which
informed the arrival of an official from the NBA club to Beijing
early next month who is expected to make formal talks with the
Chinese club on Wang's transfer.
</P>
<P>
Wang, 22, is undergoing intensive training in Changchun with
the Chinese national team, to tune up for the inpending Asian men'
s basketball championship, an Asian qualifier for the 2000
Olympics slated from August 28 to September 5 in Japan as only the
champions qualify for the Sydney Games.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Urges U.N. Peacekeepers to Observe U.N. Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 28 (Xinhua)-- The Yugoslav government on
Wednesday released a memorandum, accusing the U.N. Mission in
Kosovo (UNMIK) and the U.N. Peacekeeping Forces in Kosovo (KFOR)
of not completely implementing and even violating relevant U.N.
Resolutions.
</P>
<P>
After Yugoslavia had withdrawn its troops from Kosovo in
compliance with the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244, the
memo stressed, the UNMIK and the KFOR should have taken
responsibility for the security of all ethnic groups there. But
due to misconduct by some, the province is now facing a "law
vacuum," which has resulted in a sharp deterioration of public
security.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of an out-of-control border, many armed
factions rolled into Kosovo from neighboring Albania and Macedonia.
The illegal military organization of the ethnic Albanians, the
Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), has upgraded their terrorist attacks
against non-Albanian residents under the connivance of the UNMIK
and the KFOR, the memo said.
</P>
<P>
According to the memorandum, since the KFOR entered Kosovo in
June, 96 civilians have been killed, 223 kidnapped, and more than
600 houses and 20 churches were burned, and 5,000 cars were robbed
or stolen. In addition, more than 160,500 Serbs and Montenegrins
were forced to leave home in fear of KLA attacks, the memo quoted
U.N. envoy Sergio De Mello as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia urged in the memo that the UNMIK and the KFOR should
fulfill their obligations contained in relevant U.N. resolutions
without delay, adding that it would reject any decision made in
violation of the U.N. resolution.

<HEADLINE> Four Brazilian Airlines to Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's four main airlines,
Varig, TransBrazil, Vasp and Tam, are preparing to merge, media
reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Brazilian market could not support four international
companies," Varig President Fernando Pinto said.
</P>
<P>
However, he assured that after the merger, Varig, which has the
largest international presence, would "still exist."
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the merger of the four airlines began after two
top breweries in the country decided to merge.
</P>
<P>
"When the companies close the agreement, they will receive help
from the government," said an official source.
</P>
<P>
Vasp President Wagner Canhedo said his company was not for sale,
but was open to a merger or the purchase of another company.
</P>
<P>
According to an official statement, after the devaluation of
the Brazilian currency, the real, in January last year, the four
airline companies have had difficulties in their international
operations, as the competition in the market has become more
intense, especially from the U.S. airlines Continental and
American.
</P>
<P>
The total debt of the four Brazilian airlines adds up to 3.6
billion U.S. dollars, and their individual prospects do not look
good. Varig, for example, has had to suspend a series of
international flights. In its U.S.-bound flights, it has only used
50 percent of its authorized flight program.

<P>
JAKARTA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian swimmers performed
outstandingly in a two-day simulation session at the Senayan
swimming pool in their final preparation for the 20th Southeast
Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei Darussalam next month.
</P>
<P>
Lukman Niode, chief of the technical commission of the
Indonesian Swimming Federation, said the performances were
satisfying despite their limited time in preparation.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the swimmers can use the simulation to rehearse the
competition in Brunei. We also intentionally staged the
preliminary heats at 09:00 a.m. and the finals at 06:00 p.m. to
allow them to adjust to the competition time," he was quoted by
the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the athletes are still nervous, but that's usual. I
just love to see them smiling again after weeks of hard training,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Lukman, a former national swimmer, said both Thailand and
Singapore would become their toughest opponents at the Games.
</P>
<P>
"We must apply the right strategy to reach our goals at the
event," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, diving coach Harly Ramayani said her Indonesian
disciples have improved their skills during their overseas stint
in China.
</P>
<P>
"We competed in Wenzhou and Hong Kong and I think they have
improved a lot, especially Shenny Ratna," she said.
</P>
<P>
In the previous SEA Games, Shenny won a silver medal as an
Indonesian referee awarded her the lowest score.
</P>

Harly predicted that Thailand and Malaysia would be tough
rivals at the Games, adding she was unaware of the competitive
level of the Thai divers.

<HEADLINE> Mia Audina Denies to Join Husband in Netherlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's top woman shuttler Mia
Audina Wednesday denied that she was set to join husband Tylio
Lobman in the Netherlands, the reason given by the Badminton
Association of Indonesia (PBSI) in announcing her expulsion from
its program.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't make a final decision in yesterday's (Tuesday)
meeting. If I had made an official decision, I would have to
provide a letter of resignation to the National Badminton Center,"
Mia was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I regret PBSI's announcement to the public because I asked the
officials not to disclose the matter until we made a deal," she
said.
</P>
<P>
PBSI executive director Karsono announced on Tuesday that Mia,
19, would be expelled from the training center due to her request
to move to Rotterdam with Lobman, who is Surinamese born but holds
Dutch citizenship, but still play for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
PBSI said the options were for Mia to remain in Indonesia and
compete for the country, or for her to resign from the center and
no longer play internationally for her homeland.
</P>
<P>
Karsono said Mia insisted on moving and opted for the second
choice.
</P>
<P>
Mia denied she made a decision.
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible for me to make a decision in less than 24
hours. I must consider it clearly. PBSI's response was not as I
expected. But I have promised PBSI chairman Subagyo (Hadisiswoyo)
that I will fight for Indonesia until the Olympics," she said.
</P>
<P>
Mia's mother died on April 28 from a heart attack. Mia said she
spent the following two months in Rotterdam, recovering
emotionally from her grief. She also began to consider relocating
from Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"I spoke to Tylio about the possibility of moving to Rotterdam
because I always remembered mother and I found that living there
was nicer. Besides, Tylio received a job offer which was twice as
good as anything here. I think I can train with the Dutch national
team if I reside there. But I will still fight for Indonesia," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Mia said she did not discuss her plan with the Badminton
Association of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged receiving an offer from the Netherlands to
play on its team, but said it was not unusual.
</P>
<P>
"It's not only from the Netherlands. I've got so many offers,"
she added.

<HEADLINE> Wimbledon Semifinalist Stevenson Shuns Sticky Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Wimbledon semifinalist
Alexlandra Stevenson said she has no answer for those who are
probing into her alleged relations with the American basketball
legend Dr. J (Julius Erving).
</P>
<P>
When bombarded by tons of questions at a Pan Am press
conference on whether the 70s' NBA super star is parentally
related to her, the up-and-coming tennis prospect had only one
answer.
</P>
<P>
"No comment," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Some people are going to be nice and some are not. I'm sorry
but that's the world. And when you face that kind of people, your
answer is no comment."
</P>
<P>
The American teenager surprised the tennis world by cracking
the top four as a qualifier in Wimbledon earlier this month and
hit even more headlines when rumors spread that she was the
illegal daughter of American basketball hero Dr. J.
</P>
<P>
Even Dr.J. himself admitted he had had an affair with Steveson'
s mother, then a journalist specializing in the Philadelphia 76ers
which Dr. J once played for.
</P>
<P>
When reporters continued the sticky question by asking whether
the relationship between Stevenson and her mother changed since
the Wimbledon, she gave a rather diplomatic reply.
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not. Ours is still a mother-and-daughter
relationship," she said.
</P>
<P>
Stevenson, who is currently ranked No.37 in the WTA Tour, gave
up much more lucrative San Diego Open and opted to compete in the
Pan Am tennis tournament which starts tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a hard decision at all. I feel great honored to
represent my country at the Games," she said.

</P>
<P>
The American teenager, who is currently ranked No.37 in the WTA
Tour world rankings, is competing in her first event since she
reached the semifinals of Wimbledon as a qualifier earlier this

</P>
<P>
She will face Miriam D'Agostini, the world's No.2 player from

</P>
<P>
The men's top seed place also belonged to the United States,

<HEADLINE> Philippines BOP Surplus Rises in 1st Half of Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' balance of
payments (BOP) position yielded a surplus of nearly 3 billion U.S.
dollars for the first semester of 1999, 90 percent higher than
that of the same period of 1998, Manila Bulletin reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed the surplus mainly to the large inflows
from foreign loans and remittances from overseas workers as well
as an increase in foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Rafael Buenaventura, governor of the Philippine Central Bank,
said the healthy position was derived from the improvements in net
international reserves (NIR), which refer to the dollar reserves
of the central bank less its short-term liabilities.
</P>
<P>
As of the third week of June, the country's NIR stood at 10.989
billion dollars, up by 2.76 billion dollars from the June 1998
level of 8.229 billion dollars, the paper quoted Buenaventura as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"The continued favorable performance of the current account and
loans and investments account contributed to the improved BOP
position," Buenaventura said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to Buenaventura, the continued growth in
export receipts also contributed to the improvement of the
country's BOP standing.
</P>
<P>
For the first five months of the year, exports registered an
annual growth rate of 12.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, foreigners' temporary incursions in the country's
stock market soared to 4.437 billion dollars during the first half
of the year, up 74 percent from 2.548 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
"The existing favorable external environment is expected to
contribute to higher inflows and stable foreign exchange market in
the succeeding months," Buenaventura said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's net foreign exchange
reserves increased by 39 million U.S. dollars to 16.1 billion
dollars on July 23 from the previous week's level, according to
Bank Indonesia's weekly report.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mainly due to receipts from gas and oil and
the disbursement of foreign loans, the report was quoted by The
Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Net foreign reserves were now well above the International
Monetary Fund-adjusted target of 15.7 billion dollars, the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
Gross international reserves, which are net foreign exchange
reserves plus outstanding foreign exchange contracts, also
increase during the week by 43.9 million dollars to 26.62 billion

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard has expressed his sympathy to the families of those who
died in the Swiss canyoning tragedy, AAP said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Howard was quoted as calling the tragedy the worst one ever to
affect young Australians overseas outside war.
</P>
<P>
"Like all Australians, I'm deeply distressed by this terrible
tragedy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Australia said
Wednesday night that 13 Australians are feared dead in the Swiss
canyoning tragedy,
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Swiss authorities confirmed 18 people died when a
torrent of water washed away a group of tourists on a canyoning
expedition near Interlaken in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that up to 13 Australians have died," Howard
said. "If that is true, then this is probably the worst tragedy
ever to occur overseas and affect young Australians outside the
theater of war."
</P>
<P>
He said all Australians shared the grief of the families of
those who had died or were missing.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the government would provide assistance to help the
families travel to Switzerland if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Australian consular officials in Switzerland will
help local authorities investigate the accident.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Parties Urged to Stop Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council Wednesday called on the Afghan parties to enter into
negotiations promptly to find a peaceful settlement to the
Afghanistan problem.
</P>
<P>
Members of the council expressed their grave concern at reports
on the resumption of major hostilities by the Taliban faction,
said a statement issued after the council met on the matter.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed deep concern on the deteriorating
humanitarian situation, which could undermine the efforts of the
international community to bring about a speedy cessation of armed
conflict in that country, said the statement read by the council
president, Malaysia's Hasmy Agam.
</P>
<P>
Demanding an immediately cessation of outside military support
to all military factions, the council expressed support for the
peacemaking efforts of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his
special envoy for Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The 15 members of th council welcomed the meeting of the 6+2

seeking a political settlement to the Afghanistan problem.
</P>
<P>
Earlier U.N. humanitarian agencies issued a statement on the
disruption of their activities by the rocketing of Kabul airport
Tuesday.
</P>

Due to the fact that the fighting puts the security of U.N.
staff in jeopardy, the agencies have suspended flights to Kabul
pending the reconfirmation of the agreed security guarantees, the

<HEADLINE> Football TV Rights Shake-up Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Office of Fair Trading lost its
challenge to the Premier League's exclusive TV contract with BSkyB
or other broadcasters when a top British court on Wednesday upheld
the right of the league to sell TV rights to its matches
collectively.
</P>
<P>
The Restrictive Practices Court ruled that the 20 league clubs
that make up the Premiership were not acting as an illegal cartel
in selling live rights to Sky and highlights to the BBC.
</P>
<P>
Pay TV giant BSkyB has rights to televise 60 matches live each
season while the BBC shows a weekly highlights package as part of
a 743 million pounds (1.2 billion U.S. dollars) five-year deal.
</P>
<P>
The OFT had hoped to prove that the deals were anti-competitive.
</P>
<P>
Had they been successful, it would have opened the way for TV
companies to bid for coverage of individual teams, or matches,
rather than the Premier League as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that the Premiership should be allowed to carry
out collective bargaining on behalf of its member clubs over TV
rights.
</P>
<P>
It said that the OFT bid had some good points in law but,
weighing up both sides, the existing deal was in the best
interests of football generally.
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, Justice Ferris said the present deal did involve
"restrictions on the supply of services", but to rule it unlawful
on those grounds would not be in the public interest.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the Premier League lost the ability to sell TV
rights as a whole, member clubs would suffer substantial loss of
revenue.
</P>
<P>
This would mean improvements to the quality of stadia,
facilities, playing squads and other public benefits would not be
carried out to the same extent as at present.
</P>
<P>
There had been fears that if the collective deal was broken,
the top clubs which are more attractive to television would be
paid substantially more, whereas smaller clubs would suffer.
</P>
<P>
Ferris said the ability of the Premier League to achieve an "
equitable division" of televison revenue between its member clubs
would be "lost or seriously diminished."
</P>
<P>
He said football outside the Premier League would suffer with
the top flight's ability to confer benefits on smaller clubs
reduced.
</P>
<P>
"In these circumstances, we conclude that the restrictions are
not unreasonable," Ferris said.
</P>
<P>
"We shall therefore declare that they are not against the
public interest."
</P>
<P>
John Bridgeman, director general of the OFT, said he would be
considering an appeal, but needed to evaluate the detail of the
195-page full judgment.
</P>
<P>
He said: "This was a very good case to bring and that is what
the court agreed, they accepted many of our points.
</P>
<P>
"We put a lot of weight on the unfulfilled consumer demand and
that is what we asked the court to consider.
</P>
<P>
"I believe there are millions of fans who want to see more of
the game on television such as people who cannot afford to go to
football matches and those who can't afford to travel away," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Walker Cleared of Drugs Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- European 200m champion Dougie
Walker was cleared of drugs charges Wednesday by the disciplinary
panel investigating his failed test last December.
</P>
<P>
Walker's urine samples from a random out-of-competition test
last December registered positive for the banned steroid
nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
But the findings of the three-man disciplinary committee,
chaired by Ian Mill QC, have cleared the Scot of any wrongdoing.

<P>
It means the European 200m gold medallist no longer faces a two-
year ban and will be allowed to represent Britain in future
Olympic games.
</P>
<P>
Confirmation of his acquittal has come as a welcome present for
the Scot, who was celebrating his 26th birthday on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But the Scottish Athletics Federation has called for an urgent
review of doping control procedures to ensure swift consideration
of cases.
</P>
<P>
Walker, who has always maintained his innocence, has been
suspended from competition since 24 March.
</P>
<P>
That was when an independent Doping Advisory Committee
appointed by UK Athletics decided there was sufficient evidence to
indicate a doping offence had taken place.
</P>
<P>
After the disciplinary committee announced its findings on
Wednesday, UK Athletics said all charges against the Scottish
sprinter had been dropped.
</P>
<P>
The organisation's spokeswoman, Jayne Pearce, said: "UK
Athletics is delighted Doug Walker has been acquitted by the
disciplinary committee."
</P>
<P>
The Scottish Athletics Federation also welcomed the news that
the sprinter had "finally been found innocent of any doping
offence".
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive David Joy said: "The last nine months have been
a terrible ordeal for Walker, and this is the best possible news
for Doug, his family and friend and for Scottish Athletics."
</P>
<P>
Joy said UK Athletics had done everything possible to manage
this affair according to its rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
But he went on: "The Scottish Athletics Federation believes
that all agencies involved must take urgent steps to review the
procedures to ensure that cases can be dealt with as swiftly as
possible in the future."
</P>
<P>
Joy said news of Walker's acquittal had given "a massive boost"
to the whole of Scottish Athletics, adding: "We all look forward
to seeing Doug back in competition."
</P>
<P>
The sprinter is giving a press conference on Thursday alongside
UK Athletics chief executive David Moorcroft to explain the
background to the case.

<HEADLINE> Grobbelaar Wins Libel Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Bruce Grobbelaar, the former
Liverpool and Zimbabwe goalkeeper, won a high-profile libel case
on Wednesday against Britain's top-selling Sun newspaper over
match-fixing allegations.
</P>
<P>
Britain's High Court awarded Grobbelaar 85,000 pounds (134,900
U.S. dollars) damages. The paper will also have to pay the
Zimbabwean's costs, estimated at 500,000 pounds (793,800 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Judge Charles Gray said the damages did not have to be paid for
21 days, pending any Sun appeal. The paper's attorney George
Carman said the Sun would appeal both the verdict and the level of
damages.
</P>
<P>
Grobbelaar's lawyers have described the Sun's allegations as a
"classic scam", saying he had been wronged when he tried to expose
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Grobbelaar, 41, had asked for substantial damages over a series
of articles published by The Sun in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Sun said its secret recordings were "absolutely damning".
It was alleged he took 40,000 pounds to make sure Liverpool lost 3-
0 away to Newcastle in 1993.
</P>
<P>
It also said he had blown his chance of 125,000 pounds more in
a 1994 game against Manchester United, which ended in a 3-3 draw,
by accidentally making a sensational save in a match he was trying
to lose.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper denied libel, claiming justification and
qualified privilege. It said secretly-recorded video tapes and the
acceptance by Grobbelaar of a 2,000 pounds payment, shortly before
publication, were "absolutely damning".
</P>
<P>
The claims led to two trials at Winchester Crown Court in 1997
in which Grobbelaar was cleared of conspiring to help fix matches
for Asian betting syndicates, along with former Wimbledon stars
John Fashanu and Hans Segers, and businessman Richard Lim.
</P>
<P>
Grobbelaar said after the High Court case: "This is a day that
we can all relish because it ends the slur on football in this
country and the game that we love.
</P>
<P>
"It was not the money I was after, I was just trying to clear
my name in football."
</P>
<P>
Grobbelaar, who won 13 medals with Liverpool, has been coaching
in Cape Town, South Africa, but said he now hoped to return to
playing the game.
</P>
<P>
The Sun said it was "surprised" by the verdict and said it
would appeal.

<HEADLINE>   "Stressed" Anelka Snubs Arsenal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Striker Nicolas Anelka has failed
to report back to Highbury for training, because he says that he
is suffering from "stress".
</P>
<P>
Arsenal took the troubled player off the transfer list on
Tuesday, apparently bringing to an end his protracted attempt to
leave the club.
</P>
<P>
But Anelka, who sent a sicknote to the club from his home in
Paris, has branded the Gunners' attempt to recall him "comical"
</P>
<P>
"I think they'll be waiting for me a long time. I'm fine. I'm
calm," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, this break from soccer will be good for me. I've
recharged my batteries for this season which looks like being a
long one."
</P>
<P>
Lazio, the club that was preparing to sign him for 22 million
pounds, has also insisted that talks over the player's future are
not at an end.
</P>
<P>
The Rome club said: "We deny that at this point talks with
Arsenal over the possible sale of the player are concluded,
directly or indirectly."
</P>
<P>
Anelka had threatened legal action if his desire to join the
Rome club was not met. It is unclear if he still intends to
proceed with any action.
</P>
<P>
Anelka's latest move is unlikely to endear him to an already
hostile British sporting press and increasingly disgruntled
Gunners supporters.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, the London club has made clear its intention to
hold on to Anelka, after he failed to agree personal terms with
Lazio by the Tuesday deadline set the London club.
</P>
<P>
A statement on Arsenal's Internet site said: "It has always
been Arsenal Football Club's wish to retain the services of
Nicolas Anelka.
</P>
<P>
"He is an exceptional young talent and it remains our primary
concern that the player respects his contract with the Club. "
</P>
<P>
Arsenal confirmed conflicting rumours that separate
negotiations were held with two Italian clubs - Lazio and Juventus
- but "it would appear that personal terms were not concluded and
therefore a transfer to either club was unable to proceed".
</P>
<P>
The statement went on to say that manager Arsene Wenger's
priority is "to have the team fully settled and prepared for the
forthcoming campaign".
</P>
<P>
"In the absence of a firm agreement for the transfer of Nicolas
Anelka, the club has withdrawn the possibility of the player
departing, and expect him to resume full training with Arsenal
this week."

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Wednesday as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan reiterated
his concerns about an overheated U.S. economy and stock market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 6.97 at 10,972.07.
The blue chip index fell in the final hour of trading after
staying in positive territory in much of the session.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee that the Federal
Reserve is prepared to raise interest rates at any sign of a
rebound in inflation. He also raised concerns about overconfidence
among stock market investors who believe that the U.S. economic
expansion can continue indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Greenspan said in a testimony at the House
Banking Committee that the Federal Reserve must be "especially
alert" to inflation risks and be prepared to "act promptly and
forcefully" to avoid the need for more rate hikes later. The
remarks dragged the market lower until Tuesday, when the Dow
gained 115.88 points.
</P>
<P>
While Greenspan's remarks left the market unimpressed Wednesday
the Commerce Department sent a fresh sign that the U.S. economy
has not overheated. The department said in a report that order for
big-ticket manufactured goods rose just 0.3 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were, however, mostly higher. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 2.56 at 1,365.40 and the
technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 26.51 at 2,705.84.
</P>
<P>
Financial stocks turned mostly higher but Internet stocks were
mostly lower.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 0.29 at 640.40 and the American
Stock Exchange index fell 3.02 at 789.60. But the Russell 2000
index of smaller companies rose 0.13 at 446.61.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-6 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,600 down, 1,373 up and 575
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 688.93 million shares from 714.65
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Launches Suicide Prevention Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Surgeon General David
Satcher said Wednesday that suicide is a serious public health
threat, launching an effort to educate school counselors, parents
and even hairdressers on how to spot signs of trouble.
</P>
<P>
Suicide must be boldly confronted by the nation's parents and
children, doctors and schools, baseball coaches and hairdressers,
Satcher said.
</P>
<P>
"People should not be afraid or ashamed to seek help," he said.
</P>
<P>
Satcher issued 15 public recommendations for increasing
awareness about suicide, stepping up research and encouraging
intervention with people at risk.
</P>
<P>
Early next year, Satcher plans to present a "national strategy"
toward suicide prevention that will offer more specific ideas for
helping particular groups.
</P>
<P>
Older Americans, particularly men, are most likely to commit
suicide in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death in the country,
claiming about 30,000 lives each year, compared with fewer than
19,000 homicides. And more than a half million Americans attempt
suicide each year but survive.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Center for Health Statistics, the
leading causes of death in 1997 are: heart disease, cancer,
stroke, lung disease, accidents, pneumonia and influenza,
diabetes, suicide, kidney disease, liver disease, blood poisoning,
Alzheimer's disease, homicide, HIV and HIDS, hardening of the
arteries.
</P>
<P>
Satcher has also released a full report reviewing the science
and treatments for mental illness, which often leads to suicide.
