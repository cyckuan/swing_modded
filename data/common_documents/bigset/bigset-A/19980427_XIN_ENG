<HEADLINE> Spain's Ruano-Pascual Claims Budapest Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Virginia Ruano-Pascual of Spain
took the Budapest Wonmen's Open on Sunday, beating Italy's Silvia
Farina 6-4, 4-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Ruano-Pascual, the seventh seed, won the first set against the
temperamental and inconsistent Italian.
</P>
<P>
Farina lost her cool several times and made a lot of unforced
errors, but she regained her composure to take the second set.
</P>
<P>
But after losing the first game of the decider when she led
40-0, she went to pieces and Ruano-Pascual had an easy ride to 5-0.
</P>
<P>
Farina staged a belated recovery and saved three match points
as she fought back to 5-3, but had no answer when Ruano-Pascual
took a 40-0 lead in the next game and easily took her first match
point for the title.

<HEADLINE> Exercise Shows U.S. Unable to Cope with Germ War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A secret exercise held last
month showed that the United States is unprepared to cope with a
germ war, The New York Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The drill simulated a smallpox hybrid virus that was spread by
terrorists along the Mexican-American border, primarily in
California and the southwest. As the scenario unfolded, officials
playing the role of state and local officials were quickly
overwhelmed by a panicked population, thousands of whom were
falling ill and dying.
</P>
<P>
It discovered huge gaps in logistics, legal authority and
medical care.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the exercise surprised some participants but
illustrated what others had long suspected: the United States is
still unprepared to respond to biological terror weapons, despite
huge investments of time, money and effort in recent years, the
Times said.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the exercise would support U.S. President Bill
Clinton's effort to increase the U.S. readiness to deal with a
terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to sign two new directives this week that
provide a sweeping plan for dealing with chemical, biological or
computer-related weapons, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Clinton signed a Presidential Decision Directive to
underscore the need for stopping terrorists from acquiring weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the two new Presidential Decision Directives, known
as PDD-62 and PDD-63, is to enhence the country's ability to
prevent chemical, biological or cyber-weapon attacks, and if
deterrence fails, to respond more effectively to the mayhem, the
Times said.

<P>
ROME, April 26 (xinhua) -- David Coulthard in his McLaren
Sunday won the San Marin Grand Prix and revive his world champion
hopes in Imola, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Leading from start to finish, Coulthard looked to be in trouble
as Michael Schumacher in his Ferrari began to reel him in over the
closing laps.
</P>
<P>
From a 23-second gap between the two rivals, the 27-year-old
Scot saw the German close to within five seconds but even
Schumacher could not grab a dramatic last lap victory.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Eddie Irvine in the second Ferrari held off Jacques
Villeneuve to finish third having raced with a pain-killing
injection after suffering back muscle spasm "after five laps in
the car."
</P>
<P>
Former champion Damon Hill was forced to retire just three laps
from the finish when lying eighth for Jordan while Johnny Herbert
also finished early when his Sauber developed mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
Coulthard's teammate Mika Hakkinen, leader in this season's
title race, was forced to call it a day on lap 17 with gearbox
trouble. The Finn heads the championship standings with 26 points.
</P>
<P>
Coulthard has moved up into second place with 23 points with
Schumacher third with 20 points.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Urged to Lead Integration in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) has urged the private sector to take
an active role in developing economies, thereby expedite economic
integration in the region.
</P>
<P>
A report, which sets out COMESA plans for the new millenium,
was released Sunday at the ongoing Zimbabwe international trade
fair, announces the formation of the Eastern and Southern African
Business Organisation (ESABO) through which the private sector in
COMESA and SADC (Southern African Development Community)
countries will network.
</P>
<P>
The report said COMESA recognized the private sector's central
position in the production and distribution of goods and services
and general creation of wealth, reported the Zimbabwe News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
''The business community is increasingly becoming an intergral
part of the economic fabric of the region. In the new millenium
the strategy will require fuller involvement of the private
sector in all areas,'' said the report.
</P>
<P>
It said that last year COMESA carried out an assessment of the
chambers of industry and commerce to identify products and
activities that could assist the member states to effectively
participate in and benefit from integration.
</P>
<P>
This resulted in a number of activities which were introduced
to support the business community to improve and be more
competitive.
</P>
<P>
The activities include enterprise specific assistance, supply
and demand surveys, buyers/sellers contact promotion meetings,
trade fairs, information networks, marketing missions and
training.
</P>
<P>
The report calls for a continuous dialogue between the COMESA
policy organs and the private sector to create an environment
conducive to business participation in regional development.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the COMESA member states to deregulate their
economies by adopting appropriate macro-economic policies and to
create a conducive investment code for favourable private sector
investment climate.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Returns from Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides Sunday returned from a three-day visit to Greece, where
he held talks with Greek Premier Costas Simitis on the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
Clerides did not comment on his hour-long meeting with Simitis
upon returning at the airport. But it was was believed that the
two focused on the upcoming trip to Cyprus by United States
presidential emissary Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke is expected to arrive here on May 2 in a new effort
to bring the Greek Cypriot-dominated government and the Turkish
Cypriots back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash walked out of talks with
the Greek Cypriot side last summer when the European Union decided
to hold talks with Cyprus on its entry into the multi-nation body.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops on the island and took over the northern third subsequent
to a failed coup by supporters of union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke visited Cyprus early this month, but left
empty-handed due to Denktash's insistence that he will not
participate in talks unless his northern entity is internationally
recognized.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 the
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which is
recognized only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Clerides, however, appeared optimistic last Friday after
meeting with U.S. State Department Coordinator Thomas Miller in
Athens.
</P>
<P>
Clerides was quoted by Cyprus state radio as saying that Miller
would be bringing to Cyprus "a lot more than expected."
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Greece last Friday, Clerides said there was
no sign that Turkey or the Turkish Cypriot side would respond
positively to a resumption of the intercommunal talks.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Greece, Clerides also attended the funeral
of late Greek President Constantinos Karamanlis, who passed away
on April 23.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu, Ross Hold Second Meeting on Pullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 26 (Xinhua) -- United States peace envoy
Dennis Ross held a second meeting here Sunday with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as Israeli cabinet repeated its
refusal to accept the U.S. pullback plan.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who arrived here Saturday together with Assistant
Secretary of State Martin Indyk, was trying to win Israel's
acceptance of the U.S. proposal for a 13.1 percent pullback in the
West Bank in exchange for Palestinian security promises. No
progress has been reported over Ross' first meeting with Netanyahu
held late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But Israel's hardline right-wing cabinet, at a weekly session
Sunday, reiterated its firmness on rejecting the U.S. proposal. It
demanded cancellation of the third redeployment and fulfillment of
obligations by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu cut short the weekly cabinet session so as to hold
another meeting of his inner cabinet to discuss the further
redeployment and his second meeting with Ross. The inner cabinet
also includes Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, and Industry and Trade
Minister Natan Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the state-run TV Channel I, Netanyahu said Israel
will insist on two principles in dealing with the Palestinians:
the PNA must keep its obligations in the signed agreements and
Israel's security perimeter must be safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's media adviser, said Sunday that
the obligations that Israel urged the PNA to fulfill included
fighting terrorism, reducing police forces and stopping activities
in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He called on the PNA to ink agreements "that were on the verge
of signing," namely the opening of the Gaza airport and the Karni
industrial park. He said that in so doing, it would "give anybody
the sense of encouragement and progress" and would help push
forward the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting with Netanyahu in the afternoon, Ross and Indyk
held an hour-long meeting with Mordechai. They discussed both the
redeployment issue and Israel's initiative on a unilateral pullout
from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Late Sunday, Ross traveled to Gaza for a meeting with Arafat,
in a bid to break the year-old deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process. Arafat has endorsed the U.S. plan and hoped the
U.S. to pressure Israel to accept it.
</P>
<P>
Ross's visit was mainly aimed at setting the stage for the
London talks early May, in which U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will hold separate meetings with Netanyahu and
Arafat to bridge their gaps.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was trying to dissuade the U.S. from publicizing its
redeployment plan, reportedly to be made known during the London
talks. He is facing stiff opposition within his right-wing
coalition to any pullback over 9 percent of the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Taliban, Northern Alliance Call for End to Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Delegates of the Taliban and
the rival Northern Alliance attending the peace talks here Sunday
appealed to their respective leadership not to launch major
military offensives against each other.
</P>
<P>
"The Steering Committee agreed that each side will appeal (to)
its leadership to agree to continue the moratorium on launching
any major offensive against each other," said James Ngobi, acting
head of the U.N. Special Mission on Afghanistan, at a press
briefing after the conclusion of the second session of the
Steering Committee.
</P>
<P>
The appeal has been made after Saturday's fighting north of the
Afghan capital of Kabul, which was reported to have left about 50
people dead.
</P>
<P>
The second session of the Steering Committee Sunday afternoon
lasted for three hours. The talks was supervised by Assistant
Secretary General of the Organization of Islamic Conference Saleh
Bakar and Ngobi.
</P>
<P>
Ngobi said the Steering Committee held its second session
Sunday afternoon and continued its consideration of procedural
issues.
</P>
<P>
The Committee will continue to consider procedural issues at
its next session scheduled for Monday morning, he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Steering Committee decided any provisional agenda
of the talks, Ngobi said, "that will be discussed. It continues to
be discussed."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Northern Alliance has described as "highly
successful" the two rounds of talks of the Steering Committee and
expected positive results.
</P>
<P>
The two warring Afghan factions began their peace talks here
Sunday morning. It is the first face-to-face meeting between the
two sides in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks are expected to last three to five days as
agreed by the two sides in the session Sunday morning.

PARIS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Two amateur-piloted small planes
collided with each other Sunday in Bretagne in western France,
killing two pilots and two passengers on board, Agence

Two old "Fouga Magister" planes bumped into each other in the

the regional capital of Bretagne, from where they took off.

The two planes were bought by a team of amateur pilots a few

pilots and conducting patrol flights, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
Among the killed was Yves Duval, the head of the amateurs' team
engaged in a training program "Yankee Delta."

<HEADLINE> United Front Ready to Negotiate with Taliban: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the Afghan National
Islamic Movement Abdulrashid Dostum said here on Sunday that the
National Islamic United Front of Afghanistan is ready to negotiate
with the Taliban group.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Iran's Special Envoy for Afghan Affairs
Alaeddin Boroujerdi, Dostum said the United Front has the
responsibility to prevent massacre of innocent civilians and bring
peace to the country, Iran's official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The National Islamic United Front of Afghanistan is fighting
the Taliban Islamic group which took over the capital of Kabul in
1996 and ousted the Afghan government of President Burhanuddin
Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
"If our enemies are not serious about peace and opt to fight
us, we will defend our people with all might," Dostum said,
hailing the United Front as a group of unity and playing the
greatest role in Afghan developments.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said the Taliban and its northern-based
alliance ended their first day of negotiations, which are
co-sponsored by United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) on Sunday in Pakistan and expected to last for
three to five days.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are negotiating a cease-fire, prisoner exchange
and a committee of Islamic scholars whose decisions would be
binding on the warriors.
</P>
<P>
Dostum called on Iran, as current OIC chairman, to use all
means at its disposal to help resolve the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi said that peace would be made in Afghanistan only
with serious determination of all the Afghan factions.
</P>
<P>
Iran considers negotiations of the factions as the most
suitable way of resolving the crisis in the war-devastated
country, the Iranian official said.
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi termed the change of Taliban's stance as a "positive
step," which he said, if sincere, can help end the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
Dostum arrived here on Saturday for a four-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Peres: A Palestinian State Is Possible Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The possible solution to the
stalled Middle East peace process is the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state, former Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres said in Gaza on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat, Peres told a joint press conference that the peace
process has been stalled for a long time, and the possible solution to
it is the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate on the idea, but said that it is in the
interest of all that the Palestinian economy is strong.
</P>
<P>
Being a vehement advocate of the peace process, Peres supports
the idea of pushing the process forward through economic
cooperations between the parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
He set up a peace fund last year to help open up economic
projects in the PNA territories to help the Palestinians build
their economy.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Britain's Nuclear Accusation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday turned down an
accusation by British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook that it has a
program to attain nuclear technology, terming it as "unfounded."
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said Cook's claim aimed to divert the
British public opinion from the controversy surrounding the
shipment of Georgian nuclear wastes to Scotland for reprocessing.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern over the indifference of the international
community towards the growing arm activities of Israel, saying
that Tel Aviv, through support of the U.S. and some other western
countries, has transformed the occupied territories into a depot
of new arms and ammunition which threatens the stability and
security in the region and the world.
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.S., Israel and their like of engaging in a
misinformation campaign against Iran, which he said based on its
foreign policy and attention on international regulations.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been calling for a Middle East free of weapons of mass
destruction and increased pressure on Israel for it to destroy
nuclear warheads and weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The international community should also pressure Israel's
western supporters to end their support for non-stop growth of its
stockpile of nuclear armaments, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to relations between the European Union (EU) and
Iran, Mohammadi said that Tehran welcomed the desire expressed by
the EU ministers in their March 30 meeting to start dialog with
Iran.
</P>
<P>
There currently exists talks between Iran and the EU at
director general level, to define the framework of comprehensive
negotiations, he added.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Syria Call for Israeli Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- In a joint communique issued here
Sunday, Iran and Syria voiced their support for Lebanon in
demanding a speedy and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops
from its territory.
</P>
<P>
The communique was released by the Iranian official news
agency at the end of a visit by Syrian First Vice President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam, who arrived here Saturday afternoon to
coordinate with Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, Iran and Syria termed the recent Israeli
offer for conditional withdrawal from south Lebanon as a
conspiracy aimed at diverting world public opinion, stirring up
tension in Lebanon and hurting the destiny of Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet decided on April 1 to accept the United
Nations Resolution 425, saying it would pull out its troops from
south Lebanon after negotiating security arrangement with Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The offer was firmly rejected by Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Syria urged the U.N. Security Council and
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to end Israel's occupation of
Muslim and Arab lands, including Jerusalem, in an effort to
establish security and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
They reiterated their "all-out support" for the national and
Islamic resistance against Israeli occupation, terming the
resistance as "legitimate struggle consistent with the
international laws."
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern about the military cooperation between
Turkey and Israel, the two countries said their cooperation could
poise a threat to regional states, especially the neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
Expecting Turkey to reconsider its cooperation with Israel, the
two countries urged Ankara to expand cooperation with Muslim
states, especially with its neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, Syria condemned Israel's accusation that
Iran was developing nuclear weapons, saying the Israeli move was
aimed at diverting world public opinion from its own stockpile
of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Both Iran and Syria, stressing the need for cleansing the
Mideast region from any atomic arms and other weapons of mass
destruction, called on the international community to force Israel
to bring its atomic activities under supervision of the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of stability and security in the
region, Iran and Syria voiced hope for closer cooperation among
states in the region.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam wound up his visit and return home Sunday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> FM: Iran Ready to Help Solve Afghan Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi reiterated Sunday that Iran, as chairman of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), is ready to help
solve the Afghan crisis and bring peace and tranquillity to the
country.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Abdulrashid Dostum, vice president and leader
of the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan, Kharrazi stressed
that unity among all factions would guarantee peace and stability
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Dostum thanked Tehran for its peace efforts, stressing that the
National Islamic United Front (NIUF) headed by Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani was determined to work for peace in the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani and his government were driven out of capital Kabul in
the protracted civil war in September 1996 by Taliban militants,
who have since seized power and consolidated their rule over most
of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Dostum blamed the "oppressive policies" of Taliban for the
nation's many pains and sufferings, urging it to be sincere in the
forthcoming negotiations for peace.
</P>
<P>
Dostum, who arrived here Saturday for a four-day official
visit, met Iran's special envoy for Afghan affairs Alaeddin
Boroujerdi on Sunday and indicated the NIUF's readiness to
negotiate with Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Following the intervention by the U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations Bill Richardson, the NIUF and Taliban started first round
of peace talks in Islamabad, Pakistan on Sunday in an effort to
put an end to the country's civil war.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid arrived here on Sunday for a
three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, the AL chief told reporters that he would discuss
issues of concern to the Arab world, including combating
terrorism, with President Liamine Zeroual and Algerian officials.
</P>
<P>
He said the visit came after the Arab countries signed on
Tuesday an agreement on fighting terrorism, which he described as
historic.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, the first of its kind in the Arab world,
"defines the framework of Arab actions against terrorism", he said.
</P>
<P>
"Arab states are looking forward to further cooperation and
coordination in combating terrorism, and we assert and support
every action that leads to stability and peace for all Arab
people," he added.
</P>
<P>
Algeria, an Arab country in north Africa, has been heavily hit
by Islamic insurgence since 1992 when the military-backed
government canceled a parliament election in which the Islamic
Salvation Front was poised to win.
</P>
<P>
More than 60,000 people, mostly innocent civilians, have been
killed in the bloody fighting waged by Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question about the prospect of an Arab summit,
Abdel-Meguid said "there is no unanimity at present regarding the
convocation of a mini or full-fledged Arab summit, but
consultations are ongoing at top level."
</P>
<P>
Those consultations, either bilateral or multilateral, are
dealing with the Arab causes, the Middle East peace process in
particular, the Arab League chief said.
</P>
<P>
Some Arab countries have proposed to hold a summit to discuss
various issues in the Arab world and ways and means of advancing
the peace talks between Arab countries and Israel.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Sees Normal Ties with Nigeria: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- South African High Commissioner to
Nigeria Sipho Nene has described the state of relations between
the two countries as "normal and cordial", saying "they are just as
normal as they are with most countries."
</P>
<P>
Although there has been no official bilateral agreements and
exchanges, "the two countries are on a very normal and cordial
relations," the envoy said, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to Nene, the nature of Nigeria's transition to civil
rule program has had an impact on both countries in the area of
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It has been repeatedly reported that the two countries have
been vying for the leadership of Africa, with an aim to represent
the continent to seat among permanent members in a planned
expanded United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations became cold following Nigeria's
refusal of calls from the international community, including
South Africa, not to execute nine minority activists in 1995.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was one of the countries advocating sanctions
against Nigeria, including the two-year suspension of Nigeria
from the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
It also joined the majority of Commonwealth member states to
oppose the idea of expelling Nigeria from the 53-country
organization at a meeting last year, which decided final action
would be taken at the end of Nigeria's political transition.
</P>
<P>
Nene noted that there are a lot of possibilities for
cooperation in all spheres of the economy in both countries,
saying that "it is question of time for cooperation between both
countries to be fully exploited."

<HEADLINE> Kohl Suffers Major Setback in Eastern German State Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- With only five months away from
national elections in September, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl saw
one of his most severe setbacks to date on Sunday when his
conservative party lost heavily in a crucial local legislature
vote in the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt.
</P>
<P>
In Saxony-Anhalt's statehouse race, which is viewed as a key
test of Kohl's chances to win re-election in the September 27
national vote, the chancellor's Christian Democratic Union (CDU)
scored only about 23 percent of the vote, a loss of more than 10
percentage points from its 1994 result of 34.4 percent,
preliminary computer projections showed.
</P>
<P>
Riding a surge in support nationwide, the main opposition party
in Bonn, the Social Democratic Party (SPD), increased their score
to over 37 percent from 34 percent in 1994, replacing the CDU as
the largest party in the eastern German state.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the slumping popularity of the CDU mainly
to the fact that many former supporters of Kohl, who has won wide
public endorsement after leading the German reunification in 1990,
have turned against him because of his poor record to keep his
promises to revitalize the eastern German economy.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "Germany's poorhouse", Saxony-Anhalt, which once proudly
regarded itself as a stronghold of heavy industry, now has
Germany's highest jobless rate, about 24 percent, the lowest rate
of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
With their support ratings runing about 10 percentage points
ahead of Kohl's party in Germany recently, the Social Democrats
saw the Saxony-Anhalt vote as another sign for their eventual
victory in the national elections after 16 years in opposition.
</P>
<P>
As a major alarm for the mainstream parties, the
right-extremist party German People's Union DVU managed to
capitalize on the big losses of the CDU by scoring over 10 percent
on Sunday, becoming the first radical right party to enter a state
assembly in eastern Germany since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The DVU has been put under surveillance by German
constitutional authorities because of its anti-foreigner
sentiments and appeal to neo-Nazis.
</P>
<P>
The Saxony-Anhalt election also saw the support for the
ecologist Greens party dropping from 5.1 percent in 1994 to around
three percent, short of the five percent needed to win
parliamentary seats under the German election law.
</P>
<P>
The popularity of the Greens has taken a nosedive in recent
months after it floated the unpopular idea of tripling the
country's gasoline prices in order to cover social security
deficits.
</P>
<P>
If such a trend continued, it would be a major setback for the
SPD which might have to count on an alliance with the Greens in
order to come to power in Bonn in September.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Free Democratic Party (FDP), the junior partner
in Kohl's current ruling coalition in Bonn, also failed to make
the grade to enter the statehouse of Saxony-Anhalt, though it did
improve its performance a little bit to over four percent from 3.6
percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) managed to keep its
position as the third largest political power in Saxony-Anhalt by
maintaining its support at about 20 percent. Hoping to ride
widespread resentment among eastern German voters, the former
communists has set a target to clear the five-percent threshold
for the first time in the national elections.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Urges Congress to Approve Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen on Sunday urged Congress to approve an emergency spending
bill by early May or there would be widespread furloughs of
civilian military employees.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also warned of cutting back on high-technology weapons if
the government fails to close military bases it no longer needs.
</P>
<P>
Appearing on "Fox News Sunday," Cohen said "we may have to
furlough some of the civilian workers."
</P>
<P>
He said he will make the decision in the first week in May to
give the appropriate legal notice that certain people will be
without work for a week, two weeks, possibly even a month.
</P>
<P>
Last week, President Clinton's budget director urged Congress
"to avoid actions that would result in gridlock and be detrimental
to our nation."
</P>
<P>
The bill would replenish Pentagon funds strained by deployments
in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf and it would provide relief to
communities hard hit by last winter's El Nino-driven storms.
</P>
<P>
House and Senate have named negotiators to work out a final
version of the emergency spending legislation, which the
administration wants approved by Friday.
</P>
<P>
On base closings, Cohen said he expects 21 billion U.S. dollars
in savings, which could pay for 450 new Joint Strike Fighters, two
new aircraft carriers under design, 12 new surface ships or about
600 RAH-66 Comanche helicopters.
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about real savings here that will go to
producing the kinds of systems that we're going to need to keep
our forces the superior force in the world," Cohen said. "If we
don't get those kinds of savings, then those programs will have to
be cut back or canceled."
</P>
<P>
The secretary is proposing a round of base closings in 2001 and
another in 2005.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Japan's Mediating Iran-U.S. Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister for
Asian and Pacific affairs Mohsen Aminzadeh on Sunday denied as
rumors that Japan was mediating between Iran and the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, Aminzadeh said the
Japan's Deputy Foreign Minister Massahico Komura, who visited Iran
earlier this week, had simply voiced his government's pleasure
with the improving atmosphere between Tehran and Washington.
</P>
<P>
He said Iranian authorities had reminded the Japanese official
that the U.S. administration is sticking to its hostile policies
towards Iran in many aspects.
</P>
<P>
Komura arrived here Wednesday on a four-day official visit, and
delivered a written message from Japanese Prime Minister Riyutaro
Kashimoto to Iranian President Mohammadi Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Khatami met with Komura on Saturday. During the talks, Khatami
said the American people should persuade their politicians to
change their policies towards Iran; Komura, for his part, hoped
that obstacles would be removed for re-establishment of
Tehran-Washington ties.
</P>
<P>
Since Khatami called for cultural exchanges between the Iranian
and American nations in January, there have been many rumors about
direct and indirect contacts between the two sides. Iranian
officials repeatedly stated that Tehran would not resume relations
with Washington unless its hostile policies are changed.
</P>
<P>
Aminzadeh also said Komura's visit to Tehran was a big stride
for further developing relations between Iran and Japan, adding
that the Japanese had indicated their interest in more regular
exchange of official visits.
</P>
<P>
Komura was the highest-ranking Japanese official that visited
Iran since Khatami became president last August.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar President Stresses Need to Develop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar President Salmin
Amour has stressed the necessity to develop tourism in the efforts
of the isles' to diversify its economy.
</P>
<P>
Opening the five-star Breeze Beach Club on Saturday at Dongwe
in Unguja South District, Amour said the government strived to
make tourism the principal foreign exchange earner to replace
clove exports, which have shown ineptness in the isles' economic
recovery efforts in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here Sunday, the president
observed that the decline of clove prices in the world market has
affected the isles' economy and stalled development projects.
</P>
<P>
Planting of cloves has been a pillar in the economy of the
twin islands of Unguja and Pemba for over 100 years. But Amour
said that the changing economic scenes have made it necessary for
the isles to choose an alternative means of development.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that tourism played a pivotal role in
securing more employment opportunities for people and in
fostering international cooperation through increased foreign
investments.
</P>
<P>
He called on Zanzibar residents to give full support to
foreign investors in developing the tourism industry in Zanzibar
so as to ease the isles' economic hardships.
</P>
<P>
The president, however, cautioned that such interactions
should not be given room to pollute Zanzibar's norms and cultural
values, which should be maintained and defended.
</P>
<P>
More than 95 percent of the population of Zanzibar, off the
east coast of the mainland of Tanzania, are Moslems. Of late,
the public have called on tour operators to keep the clean image
of Zanzibar, as some foreign visitors have come to Zanzibar
seeking not only sand and sunshine but also sex.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the beach hotel was part of celebrations to
mark the 34th anniversary of the union between then Tanganyika
and Zanzibar which reached its climax Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Greece: Intervention on Kosovo Should Respect Int'l Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Greece said Monday that
intervention on the crisis in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo
should always be within the framework of international law and
aimed at reducing tension there.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting on the European defense and security
structure in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki Monday, Greek
Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos described the present
situation in Kosovo as "a hand grenade ready to explode," the
semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
There must be some kind of intervention to pressure both the
ethnic Albanians and Serbia into resuming the immediate and
unconditional dialogue, he said, adding that such intervention
should always be within the framework of international law and the
implementation of international conventions.
</P>
<P>
He added that any party which mediated or wished to mediate
would be offering its good services when they followed this policy
of reducing tension.
</P>
<P>
In Kosovo, the ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the
province's 2 million population, are demanding their independence
from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Serbians rejected in a referendum a Western role in
Kosovo by a resounding 95 percent.

<HEADLINE> Campaign for Easier Abortion Launched in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A campaign to make abortion easier
to obtain in Britain was launched Monday by an alliance of
pro-choice and family planning groups, according to media reports
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, named the Voice for Choice, was launched on the
30th anniversary of the introduction of the 1967 Abortion Act, the
first legislation on abortion all over the world.
</P>
<P>
It was supported by politicians and Peers from all parties and
came in response to evidence that abortion provision has fallen
behind public expectations.
</P>
<P>
The move called for changes to the 1967 law, under which
abortion can be carried out on request for women in the first
three months of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy is only allowed
if two doctors agree that the mother would suffer mentally or
physically if her pregnancy went ahead.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time for years that there has been so much
weight behind our campaign," said Jane Roe, co-ordinator of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
"We are very optimistic about the chances of success," and "we
have got a lot of support among members of parliament and we feel
that all of the current cabinet is personally behind women's right
to choose," she added.
</P>
<P>
Baroness Gould of Potternewton, who chairs the campaign to mend
the law, said that "many women still have problems finding prompt,
sympathetic help. Access to NHS (National Health Service) abortion
varies widely around the country."
</P>
<P>
"It (the law) subjects women to undue stress and confusion at
what is already a very difficult and distressing period of their
lives. It is time for a change," she said.
</P>
<P>
The campaign demands that medical approval for terminations up
to 14 weeks of pregnancy should not be required at all and only
one doctor should have to give consent for abortions between 15
and 24 weeks.

<HEADLINE> Kiriyenko to Trim Russian Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko will cut the administrative staff as the first step to
streamline the bloated government, a senior Russian official said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Kotenkov, the Russian president's representative in
the State Duma (Russia's lower house of parliament), said at a
press conference that the presidential administration will be cut
by 300 people.
</P>
<P>
He said the Russian Security Council has already laid off 100
employees.
</P>
<P>
Ministries and government agencies performing functions that
overlap will be merged, Kotenkov said, indicating that more people
could be fired when mergers start.
</P>
<P>
Kotenkov implied that Kiriyenko would not name many lawmakers
into ministerial posts, whereas Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov
hoped that a coalition government could be formed.
</P>
<P>
"Although there are many able people in the lower house of
parliament, just a dozen are fit for ministerial posts," Kotenkov
said.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old Kiriyenko, who became the Russian prime
minister last Friday, will attempt to revive the stagnant Russian
economy; but Kotenkov said that a political and economic crisis
could strike the country in the fall.
</P>
<P>
Kotenkov blamed the political difficulty on the Duma's statement
that it would bring a non-confidence vote against the government in
September if the economy goes bust.
</P>
<P>
"If the economy is driven into a blind alley and wage and
pension arrears grow, the government is doomed," said Seleznyov.
</P>
<P>
The new government believes it can control the political crisis
but might not be able to curb the economic turmoil, said the
presidential representative.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Banks Earmarking More Loans To Secure Growth Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Commercial banks in this,
China's biggest economic powerhouse, today decided to grant more
loans to local industries, in order to reach a 10 percent economic
growth target for the municipality.
</P>
<P>
A joint meeting of the presidents of local banks made the
decision, pledging to extend more credit to the infrastructure
sector and key projects such as the Shanghai GM Project, the
Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway and the Pudong International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Hi-tech industries and the real estate sector are two fields
that will get special attention from the banks; more mortgage
loans will be offered to individual house buyers.
</P>
<P>
The banks should also help local enterprises to compete in the
international market by exporting more name-brand products and
contracting more overseas engineering projects, the decision added.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the meeting, the president of the People's Bank
of China's Shanghai branch, Mao Yingliang, urged local bankers to
fully understand the importance of the government's efforts to
maintain an appropriate rate of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The national goal for economic growth is expected at eight
percent this year, he noted.

SINGAPORE, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore International

The contracts are expected to be listed on SIMEX in November

exclusive rights to use both the Dow Jones Malaysia and Thailand
Stock Indexes as the basis for futures and options trading during
the market hours of the two stock markets.

SIMEX President Ang Swee Tian said, "The agreement with Dow
Jones is a natural progression in our continuing effort to expand
our core group of contracts to cover more Asian markets."

"We are confident that our new contracts, to be based on the
well-established Dow Jones indexes, will prove popular with
international fund managers and investors as useful hedging and
trading instruments," he said.

(KSE)-100 Index went down by 20.68 points on Monday to close at
1,589.85 against last Friday's close at 1,610.53.
</P>
<P>
A total of 41 million shares were traded on Monday against the
44.8 million shares last Friday.
</P>
<P>
There were 43 gainers and 97 losers while share prices of 53
companies remained unchanged in Monday's trading.
</P>
<P>
The KSE-100 Index closed lower Monday on low trading volumes
caused by punters holding their positions on the news that
Independent Power Producers (IPP) and the government had not
sorted out their differences.
</P>
<P>
Monday morning saw trading mainly in Pakistan Telecom Company
Ltd. (PTCL) stocks as traders held their positions on IPP scrips
as news reached the bourse that no significant development had
taken place in the talks between IPP and the government over
tariff reduction.
</P>
<P>
The government has threatened to cancel IPP projects if tariff
reductions do not take place.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Monday's trading was dominated by speculative
activity in PTCL scrips. Brokers predicted that the stock market
may see further declines on Tuesday as the energy sector comes in
for another battering.

<HEADLINE> Market Value of KSE Stocks Drops 18.8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwait Stock Exchange
(KSE) shares lost 1.64 billion Kuwait Dinars (5.412 billion
U.S. dollars) in market value, or 18.8 percent from the start of
this year till the latest trading week ending last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting financial reports, the Kuwait News Agency said Monday
that the plunge left the market value of KSE shares of a total of
75 listed Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti companies at 7.4 billion dinars
(24.42 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Compared with the end of 1997, KSE index retreated 570.5
points, or 21.5 percent, to stand at 2,082.3 points.
</P>
<P>
Trading at KSE was mixed during the week ending last
Wednesday. The indices of volume, value and number of transactions
increased while the general index registered the second largest
decline since the reopening of KSE on September 18, 1992 after the
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Since last November, deals in KSE have been poor due to the
high value of shares registered in the first half of 1997. KSE
financial experts attributed this to the halt of credit operations
and margin, as well as the lack of investment tools and the
establishment of new investment funds, which forced dealers to
withdraw large sums of cash.

<HEADLINE> Private Firms Might Be Granted Export Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A government official disclosed
here today that China is considering empowering the country's
private companies with the right to export goods on their own.
</P>
<P>
Under the current rules, private firms have to process export
business through state-owned firms, he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xiangdong, Assistant Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, made the remarks here today. Liu is attending the
83rd Guangzhou Export Commodity Trade Fair.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the rights will be first given to private
businesses in manufacturing sectors, since "the issue in the
circulation sector is more complicated".
</P>
<P>
For decades, only state-owned exporters had been granted the
right to be engaged in exporting and importing.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, only some state-owned companies and scientific
research bodies have obtained the right to export their own
products.
</P>
<P>
However, all the firms, including private ones, in the
country's five special economic zones -- Shenzhen, Xiamen,
Shantou, Zhuhai and Hainan -- have automatically obtained the
power to export their goods regardless of their ownership status.
</P>
<P>
The official said private businesses are quite active, and it
will be beneficial to the country's foreign economic and trade
sector to allow them to do foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The reform asks for improving the work of the supervision and
control departments, including Customs offices, banks, commodity
inspection and taxation bureaus, Liu said.

<P>
The communique was issued by the central committee of the
Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV), the president of Vietnam, the
National Assembly of Vietnam, the Vietnamese government, the
Vietnam Fatherland Front and the military central committee of the
CPV.
</P>
<P>

A state funeral will be held on April 29. Vietnam's national
flag will fly at half mast on April 28 and 29, and entertainment

</P>
<P>
Nguyen Van Linh was born on July 1, 1915, in Hanoi. He fought
against French colonial rule in 1929, and became a member of the
Indochina Communist Party in 1936.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Van Linh led the Vietnam people in southern Vietnam
against the United States armed forces during the 1960s.

Committee of the CPV in 1986 at the sixth National Congress of the
CPV, and served as the senior party advisor at the Seventh
National Congress of the CPV.
</P>
<P>
During his term as general secretary of the central committee
of the CPV, the party was undertaking an across-the-board reform.

<HEADLINE> Chinese PLA Chief of General Staff Meets Indian Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, chief of general
staff of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA), Monday exchanged
views with Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes and chiefs of
the three services of Indian Armed Forces on closer ties between
the two countries and armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere at the meeting was frank and friendly, sources
close to the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
General Fu arrived here Sunday night on a five-day official
visit to India.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides pointed out that China and
India, two ancient nations in Asia, have a traditional friendship
which has lasted for more than two thousand years.
</P>
<P>
They noted that China and India initiated the world-famous five
principles of peaceful coexistence, namely mutual respect for
territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression,
non-interference in each other's affairs, equality and mutual
benefit and peaceful coexistence. And they both have the desire to
maintain and develop good-neighborly relations.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the differences left over by history between the two
countries, Fu said all difficulties could be overcome gradually
through peaceful and friendly talks and negotiations as long as
the two countries want to establish good-neighborly ties.
</P>
<P>
Fu also said exchange of visits between the two countries could
enhance mutual understanding and trust.
</P>
<P>
To maintain friendly ties between China and India is not only
in the interest of the two countries, but also conducive to
regional and world peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fernandes and India's three services chiefs said India attaches
great importance to General Fu's visit, the first to India by the
chief of the PLA General Staff. They expressed their desire to
promote the friendship and cooperation between the two countries
and armed forces through visits and dialogue.

<HEADLINE> Somali Clan Fighting Goes into 4th Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Fighting around the Southern
port of Kismayu seems to be escalating as the armed clashes enter
the fourth day Monday, spreading to territories controlled by the
faction led by Hussein Mohamed Aidid in Lower Jubba region.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest reports, the Majerten Militiamen led
by the son-in-law of Somalia's late dictator, General Mohamed
Said Hirsi Morgan, have been repulsed back for a few kilometers
for the first time since they launched what is seen as a decisive
campaign in eradicating the Marehan militiamen from the region.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Jilib District, 170 km North of Kismayu, indicate
that Colonel Abdullahi Garamgaram, the operation commander and a
well known military official among General Morgan's militia
leaders has been one of the deceased in Sunday's fighting around
the strategic village of Mugambo, 100 km North of Kismayu.
</P>
<P>
However, reports from Kismayu denied the death of Colonel
Garamgaram and there's no independent confirmation.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Garamgaram who led a strong militia battalion with six
battle wagons has made a considerable advance into the
territories controlled by the Marehan militiamen until Sunday
morning, a report said.
</P>
<P>
In this militia advance by the Majerten, a few militia bases
from Hussein Aidid's faction were also overrun.
</P>
<P>
There are conflicting casualties in the fighting between the
two sides. However, radio VHF reports controlled by the Marehan
sub-clan in the region indicate that six of their militiamen were
killed in the fighting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
They also claimed the killing of nine militiamen from the
other side during the fighting on late Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 people have so far been killed and nearly 70
others were wounded since the fighting has intensified four days
ago.
</P>
<P>
The Majerten militiamen have also captured more than 20
prisoners and the villages of Gobwein, Yontoy and Bulo Gudud all
in Lower Jubba region earlier controlled by Marehan militiamen
and Hussein Aidid's faction.
</P>
<P>
These prisoners include four Habar Gidir militiamen from
Hussein Aidid's militia bases in the region.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the new upsurge of fighting is not yet known,
however, clan political analysts said that General Morgan plans
to capture more territories from Hussein Aidid's side so as to
eliminate the Marehans from the region on the one hand and to
stop the current peace talks in Mogadishu on the other.
</P>
<P>
General Morgan has always opposed to the Cairo peace
declaration and he intends to grab some parts of the rich farming
area in Lower Jubba region.
</P>
<P>
Despite the growing concern over the Kismayu fighting in
Mogadishu, it seems that Hussein Aidid's side will be forced to
get involved.
</P>
<P>
There 's also a peace tentative by the clan elders of Biomal
and Galjel of Hawiye tribe, but it is still too soon to talk
about its affects or success.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Holds Talks with Kirghiz Counterpart  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- It is a priority item for China
in formulating its foreign policy to develop friendly ties with
its bordering countries, President Jiang Zemin said here today in
talks with President of the Kirghiz Republic Askar Akayevich
Akayev.
</P>
<P>
No matter how the world situation changes, this basic policy
will remain unchanged, said Jiang, adding that developing
Sino-Kirghiz friendly relations and cooperation of mutual benefit
accord with the fundamental interests of the peoples of both
countries, and will promote regional peace, stability and
development.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, historic documents like the five-nation
agreements on improving trust, disarmament and the Sino-Kirghiz
border, of which he and Akayev were two of the signatories in 1996
and 1997, have enhanced the bilateral relationship of mutual trust
in the field of politics and military affairs to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Akayev told Jiang that the agreements which will be signed
after the present talks will lay a solid foundation for the
friendly relations of cooperation between the two countries in the
coming century.
</P>
<P>
The visiting president said that mutual trust has been
bolstered and the range of cooperation broadened since the two
countries forged diplomatic ties six years ago. He expressed
gratitude to China for its support of the Kirghiz Republic's
reforms.
</P>
<P>
China will, as always, support the Kirghiz Republic in its
efforts to safeguard its independent sovereignty, maintain
domestic stability and revitalize its national economy, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his appreciation and gratitude to the Kirghiz
Republic and its people for their consistent and clear support of
China on the issues of Taiwan, Tibet and opposing national
separatism.

<P>
Akayev reiterated that the Kirghiz Republic stands wholly on
the side of China on the above-mentioned issues, and firmly
opposes national separatism and religious extremism.
</P>
<P>
The Kirghiz Republic has learned from China's successful
experiences in dealing with the relations between ethnic groups,
he added.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral economic and trade relations, Jiang said that,
along with the globalization of the economy, economic factors have
become more and more important in the relationship between
nations. "Further bolstering economic and trade cooperation is the
common task we are facing," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation between the two countries in recent years has
demonstrated that there are great advantages and potential for
China and the Kirghiz Republic to develop economic and trade
cooperation, according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
"Both of us are undertaking economic reforms and accelerating
our opening up to the outside, which provides a good opportunity,"
said Jiang, who added that he hoped that enterpreneurs of both
countries would be more pragmatic and increase mutual investment.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the volume of trade between China and
the Kirghiz Republic has rose 50 percent, which, the visiting
president said he hoped, would be doubled. He expressed confidence
that China would undoubtedly become the most important trade
partner of the Kirghiz Republic in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Central Asia, Jiang said, "We are happy to
see that the Central Asian nations have been focusing on
maintaining social stability, advancing economic reforms,
strengthening regional cooperation and expanding contacts with
other countries since their independence.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the two presidents signed a joint declaration
on further developing and deepening the relations of friendly
cooperation between the two countries. Agreements on economic and
trade cooperation, Chinese loans to the Kirghiz Republic, a
certificate of approval on the Sino-Kirghiz Republic border and an
agreement on extradition were also signed.
</P>
<P>
Before the talks, Jiang hosted a welcome ceremony for Akayev
and his party. The two presidents reviewed a guard of honor of the
three services of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Akayev arrived here Sunday at the invitation of Jiang for a
five-day state visit.

<HEADLINE> Canadians Support Ties with Cuba: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Nearly two thirds of Canadians
support the government strategy of engaging Cuba, according to a
new poll published Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-five percent of those surveyed said the Canadian
government should assist Canadian companies in their fight against
the U.S. interventionism called for in the anti-Cuba Helms-Burton
law.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted for the Ottawa Citizen newspaper and the
Canadian National Committee of the International Institute of
Strategic Studies on April 15-18, days before Prime Minister Jean
Chretien started his landmark visit to Cuba Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chretien's three-day visit is the first to the Caribbean island
nation by a Canadian prime minister since Pierre Trudeau made the
trip there 22 years ago at the height of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that 17 percent of those surveyed said
Canada should come up with its own version of Helms-Burton
legislation, 12 percent said the U.S. law should be ignored and 5
percent said it should be obeyed.
</P>
<P>
And far more Canadians (42 percent) believe it is Ottawa's
opposition to the U.S. dictating trade rules on Cuba than an
interest in advancing Canadian economic interests (15 percent)
that motivates the government's commitment to Cuba, according to
the poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 500 Canadians is considered accurate to within 4.5
percent percentage points 19 times out of 20.

<HEADLINE> Chinese NPC Vice-Chairman Meets US Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- More exchanges between youth
organizations in China and the United States will be of
significance for the development of future bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zhenghua, vice-chairman of China's National People's
Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, said this in a meeting today
with a delegation from the American Council of Young Political
Leaders. He expressed the hope that American political figures of
the younger generation will make positive efforts to foster
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that as both China and the U.S. are large countries,
the growth of their relationship will benefit both sides and
contribute to world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
A. Gifford Miller, a member of the delegation and a member of the
Council of the City of New York, told Jiang that US-China
ties are a very important bilateral relationship in the
world.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. hopes to develop a "more cooperative and
stronger relationship" with China.
</P>
<P>
The American Council of Young Political Leaders, established in
1966, is a semi-official organization composed of both Republican
and Democratic party members. It established links with the
All-China Youth Federation in 1979.
</P>
<P>
This is the 16th visit to China by a delegation from the
American Council of Young Political Leaders.
</P>
<P>
Miller told Xinhua after the meeting that exchanges between
youth organizations in the two countries are important for the
enhancement of mutual understanding and mutual trust between the
peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He added that those exchanges can be a part of efforts to move
forward bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Miller, who is 28 years old and has served as a member of the
Council of the City of New York for more than two years, said that
presidential visits between the two countries can provide good
opportunities for the growth of bilateral ties, because the
leaders can see for themselves the culture, history and values of
each other's country and thus promote mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that President Bill Clinton's forthcoming
visit to China would result in "concrete achievements" in promoting
world peace and expanding cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Southeast Asia Remains Vital for China's Trade (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The changing global market
provides fresh opportunities for economic and trade cooperation
between China and the Southeast Asian nations, even though
purchasing power in Southeast Asia has weakened in the wake of the
regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The assiduous endeavors of China and the Southeast Asian
nations to promote mutual trade is reflected in the activities at
the 83rd Guangzhou Export Commodities Trade Fair (GECTF), now
being held in this capital of south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ang, a general merchandise trader from the Philippines,
said that, despite a shortage of money, people in the Philippines
still have a strong demand for daily-use articles, and Chinese
products are welcomed for their high quality and low prices compared
with goods from other countries.
</P>
<P>
"Half of the products in my shop come from China," Ang said.
</P>
<P>
A majority of businessmen from Southeast Asia attending the GECTF
shared Ang's view. High-quality and inexpensive daily-use and industrial
products from China have become the primary choice of customers in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
As traditional markets for China, the country's exports to
Southeast Asian nations account for seven percent of its total
trade volume. However, the Asian financial crisis since the latter
half of last year has caused a devaluation of currencies in some
nations, resulting in a fund shortage and restrictions on imports.
</P>
<P>
But Zhou Shijian, a Chinese expert on foreign trade, predicted
good prospects for economic growth in Southeast Asia upon
industrial restructuring there.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis in Southeast Asia offers not only a
challenge but also opportunities for China's exports, said Zhou,
who is also vice-president of the China Chamber of Commerce of
Importers and Exporters of Hardwares.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Chinese enterprises should readjust their
export mix in accordance with the special requirements of this
region, cut production costs and increase competitiveness, in a
bid to preserve these traditional markets.

<HEADLINE> China's Lawmakers Urge Spread of Fire-Control Knowledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China's lawmakers recommended
that people be made more aware of the necessity for and ways to
accomplish fire control when they deliberated the draft of the
country's first Law on Fire Control here today.
</P>
<P>
Many legislators said that the law should put more stress on
fire prevention.
</P>
<P>
The law should contain fire-prevention rules for residential
buildings, said Liu Zhongyi, a member of the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Ye Shuhua and Wang Youhui, also members of the NPC Standing
Committee, suggested that radio and television stations broadcast
programs concerning fire control and fire safety tips.
</P>
<P>
A group of Japanese people survived a conflagration in a Xi'an
hotel a few years ago because they were aware of what to do in
case of fire, whereas many Chinese lives were lost in the same
fire, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
Many members of the NPC Standing Committee suggested that the
ongoing second session of the NPC Standing Committee pass the law
draft.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some members urged the removal of factories where
the potential danger of explosion is present, including
storehouses and oil depots, which are near downtown areas.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yongning and Yang Zhenhuai called for the upgrading of the
equipment used by Chinese fire brigades.
</P>
<P>
The country should forbid the opening of entertainment
facilities, which might easily cause fires, near historical and
cultural sites such as museums, archives and libraries, Fan
Jingyi suggested.
</P>
<P>
The 28th session of the NPC Standing Committee held a
preliminary deliberation of the law draft in October last year.

The number of businessmen from Southeast Asia visiting the
present GECTF has decreased by 20 percent over previous fairs. And
many of them demand low prices and their orders are small. So far,
the transaction volume with Southeast Asia is 300 million US
dollars-worth, much less than at previous fairs.
</P>
<P>
Li Yueling, general manager of the Export Department of the
China Petrochemicals International Co., has signed a contract
worth one million US dollars for the export of paraffin wax.
</P>
<P>
"Trade partners in China and Southeast Asia should join efforts
to tide over this difficult period," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Chind Satukijchai, a frequent Thailand visitor to the GECTF,
said that some Southeast Asian nations have a great demand for raw
materials, semi-finished products and spare parts to accelerate
their processing industries. Chinese products are quite
competitive in terms of assortment of goods and low prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Southeast Asia may benefit from the devaluation of
Southeast Asian currencies in importing rice and palm oil.
</P>
<P>
China's imports from Southeast Asia in the first quarter of
this year rose 7.3 percent compared with the same period of last
year, far exceeding the country's overall import growth rate of
2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is expected to encourage domestic
enterprises to adopt a more flexible approach to trade with
countries in the region, such as by conducting barter trade.

WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A standoff that began with an
apparent robbery at a McDonald's restaurant in Massachusetts ended
Monday morning when one of the two gunmen were killed and another
fled, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen people were freed when special police entered

Boston. One of the gunmen was found dead in the back of the
restaurant and the other gunman was being sought. He had fled in
a car with two female hostages.
</P>
<P>
The women, including a McDonald's employee, were left in a New

<HEADLINE> HK-US Post-Handover Economic Cooperation Is Good: Volcker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Paul A. Volcker, chairman of
the United States/Hong Kong Economic Cooperation Committee, said
here on Monday that the economic cooperation between Hong Kong and
the United States remains good after Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
Volcker, who is here to attend the 13th Plenary Session of the
HK/US &AMP; US/HK Economic Cooperation Committee, told a press
conference that he saw no differences, despite incidental
frictions in China-U.S. trade, in the basic orientations of
economic cooperation with Hong Kong before and after the handover.
</P>
<P>
He said he was happy that the handover was going smoothly and
he anticipated brighter prospects for Hong Kong-U.S. economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Volcker also said that the financial policy of China marked by
its stable exchange rate seems to be successful and there is
something that may be useful to Asian, particularly Southeast
Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
It seems that China has all kinds of strength in terms of trade
position, attractiveness to international capital and the ability
to export, he said.
</P>
<P>
Volcker was chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System of the United States from 1979 to August 1987.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- So far, 43 Chinese companies
have been listed on stock exchanges in Hong Kong, the United
States and Singapore, raising more than 10 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The oversea listing has helped Chinese enterprises to
reconstruct and transform according to the requirements of the
international market," said Liu Hongru, former chairman of China
Securities Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
In his speech delivered on a ceremony marking the publishing of
the book, "Review and Outlook of the Overseas Listing of Chinese
Enterprises," held recently in Shunde City in south China's
Guangdong Province, Liu said the overseas listing has forced the
Chinese state enterprises to stand the test of intense competition
in the world market as well as helping them publicize their fame
and reputation.
</P>
<P>
The overseas listing has also equipped a number of Chinese
managers with sound knowledge of the international market and thus
enable them to lead their enterprises to success, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Fifteen years and 50 billion U.S. dollars after President
Ronald Reagan put forward his vision of a "Star Wars" defense, the
United States still lacks the means for blocking an
intercontinental ballistic missile. Nearly 1 billion U.S. dollars
continue to be spent annually on developing a national system to
protect U.S. territory and another 3 billion U.S. dollars or so on
battlefield weapons to safeguard U.S. troops abroad.
</P>
<P>
-- As in other school shootings around the nation, the
14-year-old boy accused of fatally shooting a teacher had talked
about killing people. Experts say such warnings can no longer be
ignored.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Five months before national elections, voters in an eastern
German state handed Chancellor Helmut Kohl another major defeat,
while a little-known far-right party grabbed 12 percent of the
votes and took seats in the assembly.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian scientists have been helping India for the past
three years to build a sea-launched ballistic missile capable of
carrying a nuclear warhead. Clinton Administration officials say
the work seems to violate Russia's 1993 agreement with the United
States to stop helping any country develop missile technology.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Airline alliances are raising opposition among regulators
and labor unions. But Delta's pilots, who derailed plans for a
United partnership, agreed to modify their position, allowing the
airlines to continue their talks.
</P>
<P>
-- PC sales grew at respectable pace in the first quarter, with
big suppliers tightening their hold on the industry,
market-research firms said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Predicts Moderate Rebound of Crisis-Hit Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has predicted moderate rebound of the economies which were
hit by the financial crisis starting mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
The latest version of the World Economic Outlook (WEO) released
by the IMF earlier this month predicts that confidence should
recover gradually during 1998, paving the way for a "moderate
rebound in growth in 1999 and solid recovery by 2000" of the
crisis-hit economies.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the WEO here on Monday, Flemming Larsen, deputy
director of the IMF's Research Department, said because of the
seriousness of the crisis, "we may not see swift recovery" of the
crisis-hit economies, and "it may take a little longer -- at least
a year, maybe two years -- and may not get to the historical
growth rate (before the crisis)."
</P>
<P>
The WEO says countering the potential for new crises is a
considerable challenge that needs to be met through increased
vigilance of national policymakers and private investors.
</P>
<P>
"A key task for policymakers is to identify weaknesses and
imbalances early enough to be able to address them before crises
erupt, and the development and monitoring of early-warning
indicators of vulnerability may be helpful in this regard," the
WEO says.
</P>
<P>
In assessing the crisis, the WEO says the financial turmoil has
abated since January 1998, and markets have partially recovered
from their troughs. However, currency and asset values in the
countries involved have been left far below precrisis levels, and
considerable uncertainty remains about the resolution of the
crisis and its global repercussions.
</P>
<P>
The WEO warns there are "clearly downside risks" although the
threat to global growth from the Asian crisis still appears to be
limited.
</P>
<P>
Part of the answer seems to be that these countries became
victims of their own success, which had led domestic and foreign
investors to underestimate the countries' economic weaknesses, the
WEO says.
</P>
<P>
To contain the economic damage caused by the crisis, it says,
the countries directly affected have needed to implement
corrective measures, and the international community led by the
IMF has provided financial support for policy programs in the
countries worst hit.
</P>
<P>
The WEO noted that monetary policy must be kept sufficiently
firm to resist excessive currency depreciation, and that
weaknesses in the financial sector require particularly urgent
attention, including a clearly announced reform agenda in each
case.
</P>
<P>
The WEO says improvements in public and corporate governance
and a strengthening of transparency and accountability are also
essential.
</P>
<P>
The IMF report points out that financial markets in China have
remained relatively unaffected by the Asian crisis, reflecting the
country's relatively closed capital account -- capital flows
consist primarily of direct investment as well as its large
foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
According to the WEO, Latin America and other regions have
weathered the Asian storm by implementing immediate policy
tightening to help ease their own pressures.

ANKARA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkey expressed willingness on
Monday to establish warmer relations with Germany to serve mutual
interests.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly press conference, Turkish Foreign
Ministry deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli said that Turkey always
attaches special importance to cooperation with Germany.
</P>
<P>
"There are strong relations between Turkey and Germany, and it
is our sincere hope that such relations will be further improved,"
Atacanli said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reports that German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
is ready to visit Ankara, Atacanli said that Turkish leaders will
be pleased to see Kinkel here. But he did not elabrate.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, Kinkel has said that he would
like to visit Turkey with an aim to improve bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Turkish-German relationship has soured due to Germany's
negative attitude toward Turkey's bid for membership of the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly said that Germany's position in this
regard is a major obstacle to Turkey's drive to enter the EU,
which excluded Turkey from the enlargement process at a European
summit last December.
</P>
<P>
Germany has been accusing Turkey, among other things, of
violating human rights.

<HEADLINE> EU FMs Agree to Lift "Label" From China, Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of the
European Union (EU) agreed on Monday to remove the "non-market
economy" status label from China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
At their Luxembourg council meeting, the foreign ministers
reached the agreement which is expected to update anti-dumping
rules that protect the 15-nation union against unfair pricing of
imports.
</P>
<P>
Sir Leon Brittan said that China and Russia have made real
economic progress toward becoming market economies.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission vice-president described the agreement
as a sensible and practical reform. The adoption of the reform
brings the EU anti-dumping rules up to date, he said.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials added that the removal of China and Russia
from the non-market economy list reflects the substantial advances
made by both countries toward market economy conditions.
</P>
<P>
The EU non-market economy list came into existence in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
The officials also said the EU move recognizes China's and
Russia's efforts to transform their economies by allowing domestic
price information to be used in anti-dumping investigations if the
existence of market economy conditions can be demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
Under EU rules, dumping occurs when a manufacturer sells goods
on an export market at a price lower than its normal value.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia are both important trading partners with the
EU. EU-China trade has increased more than 20 times since 1978.
</P>
<P>
The Asian country has become EU's third largest non-European
trading partner, with the volume of bilateral trade increasing
from 25,000 million ECUs to 45,000 million ECUs between 1992 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
Trade between EU and Russia has also increased dramatically,
from 17,600 million ECUs in 1992 to 42,400 million ECUs in 1996.

<HEADLINE> HKMA to Continue Improving Sound Banking Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) Monday pledged to "continue to improve the
soundness of the banking sector; enhance the transparency of the
financial system; and promote the development of a deep and liquid
debt market."
</P>
<P>
Joseph Yam, chief executive of the HKMA, said in the 1997
Annual Report of the HKMA published here Monday that the year 1997
was one of the most eventful and significant chapters in the
financial history of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Annual
Meetings provided a most timely opportunity for the international
financial community to witness the successful political transition
of Hong Kong as a vital international financial center, he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the most serious currency turmoil in Asia dominated
the last quarter of the year, he said that however, "Hong Kong was
fortunate and with good reasons to be the least and the last to be
affected."
</P>
<P>
Yam attributed the fact that the Hong Kong dollar has weathered
the regional financial turmoil relatively unscathed compared to
other Asian currencies to the numerous reforms of the monetary
system introduced over the last 14 years to strengthen the
currency system.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the performance of the Exchange Fund
and the Land Fund was also satisfactory despite the extremely
volatile market in 1997.
</P>
<P>
On the banking front, Yam said, limited exposure to the Asian
region explained why banks in Hong Kong have been able to stand up
well against the currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
To prepare Hong Kong's banking sector for the next millennium,
the HKMA has started a strategic study to address the challenges
ahead, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Yam said lessons learned from 1997 are clear: The HKMA will
have to remain highly vigilant and should be proactive and
preemptive rather than reactive.

<HEADLINE> Mazen, Ross Discuss Israeli Position on Pullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Deputy head of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) met here
Monday with the United States peace envoy Dennis Ross to discuss
the dispute over Israeli redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Mazen and Ross held the one-hour meeting in the King David
Hotel behind closed doors. The meeting was a follow-up to that
held Sunday night in Gaza between Ross and PNA leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Ross, accompanied by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin
Indyk, arrived here Saturday and had already held two meetings
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before holding
talks with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
His mission here is to prepare for the May 4 meetings in
London, where U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will
hold separate talks with Netanyahu and Arafat in an attempt to
solve the dispute over redeployment.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Mazen, Ross left through a back door to
evade reporters waiting at the lobby of the hotel. This was seen
as a sign that he made little progress in bridging the huge gap
between the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Leading Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told reporters that
the two sides held "extensive discussions" on the Israeli
redeployment, the joint interim committees and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said that Mazen assured Ross and Indyk that the PNA
wanted to move forward with the peace process, but it demanded
the Americans "immediately move to the substance" on the
redeployment issue by stopping Israel's game-playing.
</P>
<P>
"Time is crucial. It's time to move, and we should not
continue following the game of Mr. Netanyahu's, because wasting
time is not in the benefit of anyone," Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said the Palestinian side hoped to see the publication
of the U.S. plan calling for a 13.1 percent Israeli withdrawal
during the London talks. The PNA has accepted the plan in a
compromise move and is urging the U.S. to pressure Israel to
soften its position of intransigency.
</P>
<P>
So far Netanyahu has rejected the U.S. plan and tried to
disuade Washington from making known the plan for fear of its
ensuing pressure on Israel. Israel's rightwing government has
declared that it could only accomondate a 9 percent pullback at
best.
</P>
<P>
Besides the size of the second redeployment, another sticking
point in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute is that Israel hopes to
gain the U.S. support to its call for abolishing the third
redeployment and integrate it into the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has rejected the Israeli idea, insisting that Israel
must continue to carry out the third troop redeployment before
proceeding to talks for a permanent Israeli-Palestinian
settlement, in accordance with the Hebron accord signed early last
year.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals to Macao Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals to Macao during
the first three months of 1998 dropped 10.9 percent from the same
period last year, latest official statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics Department
on Monday show that the arrivals added up to 1,784,117 between
January and March, down 10.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
In March alone, the number of visitors to Macao dropped 23.4
percent to 578,181 in March 1998 from 713,476 in the same month in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Although the number of Hong Kong visitors, which account for 70
percent, increased 2.5 percent, those from the Republic of Korea,
Japan, Europe and Southeast Asia plummeted as much as 86 percent
in the first three months.
</P>
<P>
The less arrivals were believed to be connected with the
devaluation of currencies in Southeast Asia nations in the wake of
the financial crisis there.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is a leading economic sector for the territory of
420,000 population. Last year Macao received some seven million
visitors, down 14 percent from the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Plenary Session of HK/US Economic Cooperation Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The first year of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has been a success and the
principle of "one country, two systems" is now an established
reality, the HK/U.S. and the U.S./HK Economic Cooperation
Committees said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint communique issued after the one-day joint
plenary session held here, members of the committees also said
that Hong Kong's economy had been affected by fallout from the
financial and economic crises suffered by other economies in the
Asian region.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the HKSAR government's unwavering commitment
to the Kong Kong/US dollar link had helped to stabilize the local
situation and retain international business confidence in Hong
Kong. They all recognized the importance of a strong and stable
Renminbi, China's currency.
</P>
<P>
The committee members agreed that the distinctive and
predictable characteristics of Hong Kong's economy, including its
stable currency, huge foreign reserves, unrestricted movement of
capital, free flows of information, transparent administrative and
legal systems, had enabled it to better withstand fluctuations
elsewhere in the region, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
These strong fundamentals were also the reason "why Hong Kong
continues to be regarded by U.S. companies as an attractive
business location and good commercial partner," it said.
</P>
<P>
The committee members were particularly encouraged by the
increase in contacts between the United States and China,
including the exchanges of presidential visits, the communique
noted.
</P>
<P>
In the light of these positive developments, the communique
said, the committees anticipated that China's MFN status would be
renewed this year, and that China's application for WTO entry
would also continue to make progress.
</P>
<P>
The plenary session of the committees has received messages of
support from Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of the HKSAR and U.S.
Secretary of Commerce William Daley.
</P>
<P>
The committee members are scheduled to proceed to Shanghai on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The HK/US &AMP; US/HK Economic Cooperation Committees meet once a
year. The next session will be held in the United States in 1999.

<HEADLINE> CICC Chairman Outlines Success in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Xiaochuan, chairman of
Board of Directors of the China International Capital Corporation
Limited (CICC), the first joint-venture investment banking firm in
China, said here Monday that the CICC has achieved an outstanding
success in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the end of a Board of
Directors session held here on Monday, Zhou said the success has
built up the foundation for CICC as an international standard
investment bank in China.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, CICC led or participated in 24 closed transactions,
which included equity financing, merger and acquisition advisory
projects, and debt financing, said Zhou, who is also governor of
China Construction Bank.
</P>
<P>
Important transactions led by CICC in 1997 included the
successful dual-listing of China Telecom (Hong Kong) on the Stock
Exchange of Hong Kong and the New York Stock Exchange which raised
4.22 billion U.S. dollars, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Established on November 8, 1995, the Beijing-based CICC is a
joint-venture between the China Construction Bank and the Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., and other Chinese and overseas
partners.
</P>
<P>
"CICC achieved second place in the bookrunner rankings for
equity-related deals in the non-Japan Asia-Pacific region as
measured by International Financing Review for 1997," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
CICC has established itself as an important participant of
Chinese Government Bond (CGB) markets, he added.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, CICC established its Hong Kong subsidiary to offer
investment banking, sales and trading and research services to
clients, Zhou said, adding that CICC-HK is currently seeking the
approval of its application for the SEHK membership.
</P>
<P>
CICC's total consolidated firm revenue was approximately 50
million U.S. dollars and total pretax earnings in 1997 stand at 30
million U.S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently CICC's Investment Banking Department is broadly
involved in business sectors such as telecom, power, oil and gas,
chemical, transportation, infrastructure and financial
institutions and is working on some major and important projects,
Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
CICC's Direct Investment Department is able to undertake
capital investment or large-scale equity investments with or
without CICC's shareholders, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Sales and Trading Department has successfully procured
seats with Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges and is actively
engaged in CGB proprietary and agency businesses.
</P>
<P>
At the same press conference, John Mack, president of Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter and Co., said: "We are extremely pleased by
the success of this joint venture, which has made great strides
since it was founded three years ago."
</P>
<P>
"We are proud to be able to play a role in the development of
China's capital markets and the restructuring of the Chinese
economy through our involvement in CICC, and look forward to
working with our partners as CICC continues to build on its
success," Mack said.

generations of Chinese emperors will be auctioned to buyers
from at home and abroad at the end of May, sources at the
Beijing Auction Company said here today.
</P>
<P>
Starting today, this precious artistic work will be on show

According to Wu Lianzhong, manager of the company's Artistic

sandalwood.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Sets Up Fund for Low-, Medium-Cost Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Monday announced
the establishment of a Special Fund for Low- and Medium-Cost
Houses, which will begin operation on May 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Bank Negara (state bank) Malaysia, the central bank, will
provide funding facility amounting to 1 billion ringgit (265.251
million U.S. dollars) under the scheme, the bank said in a press
release Monday.
The money is to be channeled directly to financial institutions as
loans for housing developers building houses costing 150,000
ringgit (about 40,000 dollars) and below.
</P>
<P>
The bank added that the establishment of the fund is part of
the ongoing process to ensure the availability of affordable
houses to meet the needs of low- and middle-income groups given
the current economic and financial environment and tight monetary
stance of the state bank.
</P>
<P>
The latest facility is in addition to the 1 billion ringgit
(265.251 million dollars) worth of funds announced in October last
year, which were provided by Petronas when it subscribed to bonds
in Syarikat Perumahan Negara (SPN) (National Housing Corporation).
</P>
<P>
The central bank said the extension of this facility should not
be deemed expansionary on the monetary aggregates, emphasizing
that the credit target of 15 percent as announced earlier will
remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The annual rate of loan growth of the banking system sands at
17 percent at present, according to the bank.

<HEADLINE> EU Endorses Social Protection Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission adopted
its 1997 social welfare report which monitors progress achieved
in social welfare objectives within the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The report, the third following the 1993 and 1995 editions,
examines demographic, social and economic developments and the
changing context in which social welfare systems in the union
operate.
</P>
<P>
It also analyzes expenditures on social welfare protection in
EU member states and reviews their contribution to reducing
disparities in income between households.
</P>
<P>
The report reviewed the major changes which have been made to
social welfare systems across the 15-nation union in recent years,
focusing on the period since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report emphasized the operation of unemployment
compensation systems, the policies toward retirement and toward
reversing the trend of people to retire before reaching the
official pension age, the action to contain the growing cost of
health care while safeguarding the quality of service, and
long-term care for those who are infirm or too ill to look after
themselves.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the European Union recommended in July
1992 to merge social protection objectives and policies, and the
union started to monitor the convergence via biennial reports the
following year.
</P>
<P>
European Commissioner Padraig Flynn, responsible for employment
and social affairs, stressed that benefit systems need to be
reviewed and adapted to ensure they actively support employability.
</P>
<P>
"Social protection can help achieve other aims such as
developing entrepreneurship, encouraging adaptability of
businesses and their employees, and strengthening policies for
equal opportunities," Flynn added.

<HEADLINE> Project Launched to Aid Poor Rural Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The China Charity Federation (CCF)
started its "Candlelight Project" today to raise donations to
help poor teachers in rural China improve their lives and
professional skills.
</P>
<P>
The project, with a fund under the same name, plans to collect
two million yuan (about 241,000 U.S. dollars) in donations this
year, said Zhang Wanxin, chairman of the board of the project and
vice-chairman of the CCF.
</P>
<P>
The donations will be used to provide training materials for
3,000 schools in 300 poor counties, subsidize 1,000 poor
teachers in rural areas, and reward a group of outstanding rural
teachers who are not paid by the government but by local people,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has a total of three million rural
teachers, who are usually paid tiny salaries by the local
people and who make up about 60 percent of the total number of
rural teachers.
</P>
<P>
They provide education to one third of China's primary and
middle school students, who amount to 20 percent of the world's
total but only receive 0.78 percent of the world's total
funds for education.
</P>
<P>
Some rural teachers are living in extremely poor conditions,
and many ambitious ones have left their positions for better-paid
jobs. This, along with the factor that the professional skills of
rural teachers need improvement, has hindered the development of
rural education in China, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the "Candlelight Project" will be as
beneficial to rural education as "Project Hope", which helps
poor children in rural areas to go to school.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A large-scale, export-oriented
enterprise in the suburbs of Shanghai, which is engaged in
producing and selling vegetables in Southeast Asia and western
European nations, has gained a good harvest.
</P>
<P>
The enterprise, involving an investment of 9.8 million
U.S. dollars, was jointly set up by the United States, Australia
and Shanghai, and equipped with modern installations imported from
Israel and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the joint venture is projected to cultivate
1,600 hectares of vegetable-growing areas and produce 15,000 tons
of high-grade vegetables annually. And the output value is
estimated at 700 million yuan and profit at 100-to-150 million
yuan each year.

<HEADLINE> Intra-Afghan Talks Make "Good Progress" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The on-going intra-Afghan talks
have made "good progress" as Afghanistan's Islamic Taliban and the
rival Northern Alliance Monday agreed on a four-point agenda
including the formation of the Ulema (religious scholar)
Commission and ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Ibrahim Saleh Bakar, assistant secretary
general of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, Monday
afternoon after the Joint Steering Committee, which consists of
five Taliban and nine alliance delegates, concluded its morning
session on the second day of the talks.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks, the first face-to-face encounter between the
two Afghan rivals in more than a year, made "good progress" and
the two sides have agreed on the four-point agenda.
</P>
<P>
Bakar said that the two sides will continue to talk at 4 p.m.
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The agenda, he said, includes the consideration of matters
relating to the Ulema Commission, ceasefire between the two sides
and the release of prisoners of war of both sides, the modalities
for lifting the blockade to central Afghanistan and allowing
humanitarian aid to move freely in the country, and the date and
venue of the next meeting of the Steering Committee.
</P>
<P>
James Ngobi, acting head of the United Nations Special Mission
on Afghanistan, described the atmosphere of Monday's talks between
the two sides as "good" and said "they have made some progress."
</P>
<P>
The talks, which are being jointly sponsored by the U.N. and
the OIC, started on Sunday morning but failed to make any progress
on the first day as the Taliban and the Northern Alliance could
not reach an agreement on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who now control two-thirds of Afghanistan,
insisted that the formation of the Ulema Commission be the only
topic of the agenda while the Northern Alliance, which holds the
rest one third, wanted to include ceasefire and exchange of
prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides agreed on Sunday that the talks should
be concluded within three days if possible and not later than five
days. They also decided that the decision of the meeting will be
taken by consensus and not by voting, and if there is lack of
consensus on any matter under discussion, it would be referred to
their respective leadership or be postponed till the next meeting
of the Steering Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Ulema Commission proposed by the Taliban would decide the
future political set-up in Kabul if and when formed. The Joint
Steering Committee is yet another attempt to iron out differences
between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance after the former
rejected the latter's first Ulema list in February.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi Monday called upon the Caspian Sea littoral states to
cooperate for proper exploitation of resources in the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the sixth seminar on Central
Asia and the Caucasus, Kharrazi said the proper exploitation of
the sea's resources requires a legal framework as well as
consultation and trust among the littoral states.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister stressed Iran opposes unilateral use and
exploitation of the sea's resources, warning any such action would
violate the rights of other littoral states.
</P>
<P>
The Caspian Sea was reported to have proven reserves of 16
billion barrels of crude oil and 8.3 billion cubic meters of
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
So far, the five littoral countries, namely Iran, Turkmenistan,
Kazakhstan, Russia and Azerbaijan, have not reached any agreement
on how to exploit the natural resources and to protect the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said at the semimar that Tehran was ready to cooperate
with other Caspian Sea littoral states in construction of
refineries, terminals and laying oil and gas pipelines to develop
the sea.
</P>
<P>
Experts and researchers from 19 countries including Britain,
China, France, Italy, Russia, the U.S., Pakistan and republics of
the Central Asia and the Caucasus attended the two-day
seminar.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Rejects Greek Sovereignty Claim to Aegean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkey Monday rejected Greece's
claim of sovereignty over the uninhabited islets in the Aegean Sea
and reiterated that the status of those islets will have to be
decided through negotiations between Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli told
a weekly news briefing that the Greek government should not take
it for granted that these islets belong to Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greece attempted recently to include these islets under the
name of Greek territory in an environment program of the European
Union (EU), said Atacanli.
</P>
<P>
"As we said before, this is not something new. Greece's
territorial claims to these undecided islands are unacceptable to
Turkey," Atacanli said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Turkish government has been in contact with
the EU regarding this matter and hopes that the European bloc
could prevent Athens from doing this.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece have been at odds for long over the
sovereignty of these islets. In early 1996, their dispute over an
islet, called Kardak in Turkish and Imia in Greek, brought the two
countries to the brink of war.

<HEADLINE> Higher Electricity Prices in China to Cover Environmental Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- An official from the China Power
Corp. said here today that China is drafting regulations and
methods to further raise the price of electricity.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that price of electricity for agriculture use
will not increase by a large margin, while the price of
electricity for rural areas and industries will fully depend on
the market.
</P>
<P>
China will turn all power enterprises into companies that will
operate as commercial entities, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that free-market competition is needed
for sustainable growth in the power industry and that producers
will raise prices to cover expenses of environmental protection if
the electricity market is fully deregulated.
</P>
<P>
China is giving top priority to hydro-electric power, proper
development of coal-fired electricity and the use of clean-coal
technology, he said. Market competition will favor large-scale
power companies that run at a relatively lower cost and force
seriously polluting small coal-fired power plants out of business,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that stopping price controls will also promote
large-scale enterprises to use clean-coal technology, and that his
own company will cover the cost of adding environmental-protection
technology by raising the price of electricity.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Chinese government is prudent in
raising electricity prices. The present rise is of a compensatory
nature for power companies. He said that the administrative
authorities of the power industry and prices and auditing
authorities are carefully drafting the procedures of raising
prices.
</P>
<P>
China's potential water power is equal to 1.5 times the total
power-generating capacity of the country at present. In the 10
years after 2000, China will increase its hydropower capacity by
80 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Province plans to build the largest clean-coal plant in
the world with technology that will greatly reduce the amount of
sulphur and nitrogen gas emissions.

<HEADLINE> SIMEX Plans to Expand Equity Index Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore International
Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) announced here on Monday that it will
start trading a Singapore stock index contract in August this
year, and will list equity index contracts related to the stock
markets in Malaysia and Thailand from November 1998.
</P>
<P>
In addition, SIMEX said that futures contracts relating to
other Asian stock markets are being studied and will be added
subsequently.
</P>
<P>
The decision to list a Singapore stock index contract and
expand the range of regional products on SIMEX is in line with the
recent recommendations of the Sub-Committee on Finance and Banking
of the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness, which comprises
representatives from the financial industry, it said.
</P>
<P>
Victor Liew, Chairman of SIMEX, said, "the listing of a
Singapore stock index contract and other contracts relating to the
stock markets in the region will help strengthen SIMEX's position
as a leading center for trading Asian equity index products."
</P>
<P>
The globalization of the capital markets in Asia has increased
demand for effective risk management instruments among global
traders and investors. The provision of risk management
instruments such as the planned equity index futures contracts
will help develop greater breadth and resilience in regional
capital markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
"By providing hedging opportunities, they can also increase
global investment interest in the underlying stock markets," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore stock index futures contract to be launched in
August will be based on the MSCI (Morgan Stanley Capital
International) Singapore Free Index, which is compiled by MSCI.
</P>
<P>
The MSCI Singapore Free Index is a market
capitalization-weighted index of 37 stocks, which covers 55
percent of the total market capitalization of the Stock Exchange
of Singapore (SES), the SIMEX said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Index has 96 percent correlation with the SES
All-Singapore Index compiled by the SES, and is widely used by
many international investors as a performance benchmark for their
investment portfolio in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The SIMEX also said that the SIMEX MSCI Singapore Index
contract will be traded via the SIMEX Automated Trading System
(ATS), developed and maintained by the SES.
</P>
<P>
"This will facilitate the participation of the stock broking
community in Singapore which is used to electronic trading," Liew
said.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Strengthening of Non-Proliferation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Better solutions consistent with
the trend of the rapid development of technologies should be
explored in order to strengthen nuclear non-proliferation
mechanisms, said Sha Zukang, head of the Chinese delegation, here
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The rapid development of technologies and ever-expanding flow
of information have made it impossible to rely on containment and
high-handed measures to prevent nuclear proliferation, although
the existing non-proliferation regimes have played some useful
role," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sha was speaking at the second session of the Preparatory
Committee for the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).
</P>
<P>
At the same time, from the perspective of broad international
security environment, he said, efforts should be made to establish
a fair and rational new international political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
"Only in such a way can each and every country, large or small,
rich or poor, strong or weak, with or without nuclear weapons,
enjoy the sense of security," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sha stressed that the fundamental way to prevent the
proliferation of nuclear weapons lies in complete prohibition and
total destruction of nuclear weapons under effective international
verification and control.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of nuclear non-proliferation is to maintain world
peace, security and stability for the benefit of mankind, Sha said.
</P>
<P>
But some countries, he said, have deviated from this principle,
advertizing themselves as the sole crusader of non-proliferation,
taking its enforcement as their prerogative and using it to
further their own foreign policy objectives.
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, they are indifferent to or even encourage and
induce nuclear proliferation in some cases," he said.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, if they think that their own interests
might be compromised, they will intervene and impose sanctions on
those activities, even though they are for peaceful purposes," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"No country should impose its own law and interests on any
other country or the international community at large," Sha said.
</P>
<P>
"China holds that any concern related to nuclear proliferation
should be resolved according to the procedures spelled out in
relevant international legal instruments, including through
dialogue and cooperation, so as to achieve the non-proliferation
objectives shared by all," he told the session.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM: Practical Measures Needed to Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said here Monday that practical measures are needed to
improve the relations between Iran and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions at a press conference, Kharrazi denied the
report that the issue of Tehran-Cairo ties was discussed during
the recent visit by Syrian First Vice President Abdul-Halim
Khaddam.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the visit, Khaddam only conveyed Egypt's
interest in improving relations with Iran, but the talks between
Syrian and Iranian officials did not go on details about Iran's
ties with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam arrived here on Saturday for a two-day visit to
coordinate stances with Iranian officials on the recent Israeli
proposal on conditional withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Both Iran and Syria rejected the Israeli plan and reiterated
their support for Lebanon who has called for a speedy and
unconditional withdrawal of the Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister termed Egypt as a "country with
rich culture," saying that Iran believes the cooperation between
Tehran and Cairo would have positive impacts on the regional
developments since Iran and Egypt are two important countries in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Both Tehran and Cairo have expressed their readiness to
improve their bilateral ties, particularly after the election of
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, who favors friendly relations
among regional countries
</P>
<P>
However, no specific steps have been taken to realize the
resumption of ties between the two countries, which severed their
diplomatic relations in 1979 after Egypt signed the David Camp
peace accord with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for Dismantling Regional Customs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has called for dismantling
the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) to ensure free regional
trade and increase Zambia's foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has urged
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to work toward
the immediate dismantling of SACU, Times of Zambia paper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted LCCI Vice Chairman for Trade Henry
Chipewo as saying that here at the weekend that the delayed
dissolution of SACU contributes significantly to his country's
unstable exchange rate because manufacturers have limited export
market in the southern African region.
</P>
<P>
"Our members cannot export to the SACU member countries which
include South Africa, Namibia, Mozambique and Botswana when
manufacturers in these countries freely exported their goods and
services to Zambia," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said dismantling SACU will lead to free trade in the region
thus increasing Zambia's export and foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
SACU is a trade barrier in the region whose removal requires
concerted efforts from SADC member countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chipewo urged the Export Board of Zambia to support all
efforts made by LCCI to increase exports because the board
derives its strength from exporters.

<HEADLINE> Beida Plays Unique Role in Modern China's History (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The prestigious Beijing
University, also known as Beida, has played a unique role in
China's modern and contemporary history. That is the main reason
why the university's centennial celebration has drawn so much
attention nationwide, experts say.
</P>
<P>
The celebration activities, on an unprecedented scale, include
a meeting of 10,000 people at the Great Hall of the People, and an
evening of entertainment which will be attended by a large number
of Chinese artists as well as teachers and students of the
university.
</P>
<P>
China has also decided to issue a set of commemorative stamps
for the university's 100th anniversary on May 4 when most of the
activities will take place.
</P>
<P>
"All these are because Beijing University's role in China's
history cannot be replaced," said Chen Pingyuan, professor with
the Chinese Department of Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, Beijing University is not ranked among the
world's first-class universities, but no other university in the
world has played a role as important to their national
rejuvenation and national progress as Beijing University," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Beijing University was the birthplace of the May
4th Movement of 1919, an anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, political
and cultural movement in China. Influenced by the October
Revolution in Russia, the movement was led by intellectuals with
rudiments of Communist ideology.
</P>
<P>
Marxism was first disseminated in the university, and the
university was one of the most important revolutionary bases for
the Chinese Communist Party in its early days, said Chen, who has
studied the university's history for years.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the Vernacular Movement (1917-1919)
originated in the university, which was the cradle of China's new
culture, and the vernacular later developed into the commonly used
written language in China.

<HEADLINE> German Delegation to Visit Iran for Better Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi announced here on Monday that a German high-ranking
delegation would visit Iran in the near future to defrost the
relations between Tehran and Bonn.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at a press conference that the forthcoming
visit of German officials would be at the director general level.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister gave no further details of the visit.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the visit would have positive impact on
Tehran-Bonn ties, which have become "better" following the return of
European ambassadors to Tehran in November last year.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and Germany were strained in April last
year after a Berlin court ruled that Iranian leaders were behind
a terrorist assassination against four Iranian Kurdish rebel
leaders in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The court verdict provoked members of the European Union (EU)
to withdraw their ambassadors from Tehran. They returned to Tehran
after the EU reached a deal with Iran over the political row in
November.
</P>
<P>
Despite the detente between the EU and Iran, the Bonn-Tehran
reapproachment was delayed by the case of the German citizen
Helmut Hoffer, who was sentenced to death in Iran on charges of
having illegal sexual relationship with an Iranian Muslim woman.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel warned that Bonn-Tehran
ties would be damaged if Iran carried out the death sentence on
Hoffer. Iran claimed that the case was reviewed in Iran according
to normal judicial procedures.
</P>
<P>
The German Parliamentarian Gunger Verhugen paid a two-day
visit to Tehran last week to convince the Iranian authorities to
release Hoffer in order to repair the bilateral relations. But no
concrete achievement was reached during the visit.

<P>
Numerous new thoughts -- including democracy, science, equality
between men and women, and marriage freedom -- were also first
spread from Beijing University, the professor said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ren Yanshen, Party Secretary of Beijing
University, Beida was China's first state comprehensive
university. Its foundation was regarded as the start of China's
modern higher education.
</P>
<P>
Since the introduction of reform and opening-up drive, China
has attached great importance to science and technology. Late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping once said that science and technology
are the primary productive forces and, in a recent speech, Chinese
premier Zhu Rongji said that "revitalizing the nation through
science and technology" should be regarded as a basic state policy.
</P>
<P>
"This is another reason to highlight Beida's centennial," Ren
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the past 100 years the university has been
one of China's key educational and scientific research centers,
and the centenary celebration is an important event not only for
Beijing University but also for the entire scientific and
educational communities in China.
</P>
<P>
Ren said the university will carry out its fine tradition of
patriotism, democracy and science in the next century, and speed
up its reform and development to build a vigorous and high-level
university.

<HEADLINE> Ivory Trade Rampant in Dar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Illegal trading of ivory
still runs rampant in the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam
despite the ban of the government and international community on
poaching of elephants, Daily Mail has revealed.
</P>
<P>
According to investigations by the Dar es Salaam-based
newspaper, ivory is transported into the city through various
channels and then sold, or carved by craftsmen and exported
abroad, especially to the Far East.
</P>
<P>
There are people in Kariakoo, Mwenge and other areas of the
city who buy the ivory, with each kilogram priced at 12,000
shillings (about 18 U.S. Dollars) at present, an unnamed illegal
ivory dealer disclosed to the paper.
</P>
<P>
In the Mwenge Carvers Village, the ivory is bought, carved
immediately and sold as a finished product, the dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the ivory products were purchased by women and
foreigners, the source said, adding that women buy earrings,
bangles and other ornaments for trading elsewhere in the city,
while candle holders, chess pieces and carvings of Madonna are
favored by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Buyers were numerous, and delay in selling occurred only when
a price was not agreed upon, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said there was plenty of ivory in rural areas, especially
in the Kilombero District some 200 kilometers southwest of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Dealers get ivory from farmers who live near the Selous Game
Reserve, the world's largest. The farmers use homemade guns to
kill elephants and bury the tusks in the fields, waiting for
buyers to come.
</P>
<P>
"When we want to buy ivory," he said, "all we do is to go to
this area and ask around. You will be surprised with the amount
of offers you will get within a short time."
</P>
<P>
"I know what I am doing is not right but some big shots are
doing things which are even worse," he said, and added that it is
very easy to bring ivory into Dar es Salaam as long as one has
"the nerves."
</P>
<P>
He said a small consignment of ivory can be packed carefully
in a brief case, a sack or anything else with few chances of
being caught by the police.
</P>
<P>
If the amount is big, he said, one may use vehicles which will
not be subject to police check, such as army vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Big dealers even use containers to export raw ivory, he said,
noting that they pack ivory in containers along with other cargo
for export.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the ivory is sent in dhows to the Zanzibar isles,
where shipping ivory abroad is even safer than in Dar es Salaam.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Strengthen Tax Laws for Foreign Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Australia announced on Monday
its plans to strengthen tax laws for foreign companies
transferring ownership of property or mining rights in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Australian Federal Treasurer Peter Costello said the government
would tighten a loophole allowing non-residents to escape tax on
profits from the sale of real (commercial) property and mining
rights through a chain of holding companies or trusts.
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement that the government would amend the
International Tax Agreements Act 1953 to clarify the
interpretation of the alienation of property articles in
Australia's Double Tax Agreements (DTAs).
</P>
<P>
The move followed a full federal court finding that real
property held by a non-resident through a chain of companies did
not fall within the terms of provisions of the
Australia-Netherlands DTA.
</P>
<P>
Costello said the decision had implications for all of
Australia's DTAs and highlighted chances for non-residents to
escape Australian taxes on profits from the sale of real property
and mining rights in Australia by the use of a chain of holding
companies or trusts.
</P>
<P>
"The government has therefore decided to amend the law to
ensure it applies to profits arising from the indirect alienation
of real property by a non-resident after midday ... today," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Costello said countries with which Australia had concluded DTAs
were being advised of the proposed action.

<HEADLINE> Over 20m Nigerians Infected with Liver Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- At least 20 million Nigerians may
be suffering from the liver disease commonly known as hepatitis
B, according to the West African Society of Gastroenterology
(WASG).
</P>
<P>
The society, which gave the warning in a communique issued
after the 12th national conference of its Nigeria chapter, also
identified viral hepatitis as the major cause of chronic liver
disease in the country and other west African countries.
</P>
<P>
According to WASG, it has been established that hepatitis B
virus is the cause of hepatocellular carcinoma, a malignant and
terminal disease of the liver, while statistics show that the
disease is the commonest cancer among Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
The communique expressed displeasure that there was a dearth
of trained professionals in the diagnosis of liver diseases.
</P>
<P>
"Diagnostic facilities are inadequate and there is poor
reporting of chronic liver diseases, making it difficult to
determine accurately the burden of this disease," it said, quoted
by the Daily Times Monday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the drugs needed for the treatment of chronic liver
disease were either not locally available or unaffordable, it
noted.
</P>
<P>
The WASG communique warned against the use of traditional
means such as scarification marks and tattoos in treating the
disease.
</P>
<P>
It called for an improved reporting system of the notifiable
disease especially viral hepatitis by an improvement of the
existing health management information system.
</P>
<P>
It also appealed to the health ministries to incorporate the
education of the masses on the need to avoid harmful
socio-cultural practices to stem the tide of increasing
incidences of the diseases.

<HEADLINE> Iran: No Need to Resume Ties with Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi reiterated on Monday that Iran still sees no need to
re-establish brokened Iran-U.S. relations unless Washington
changes its hostile policies toward Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Responding to former U.S. assistant secretary of state Richard
Murphy's recent call for "meaningful and clear official exchanges"
between the two sides, Kharrazi said that "we has not seen any
need to do so."
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at a press conference that Iran rejected the
resumption of relations because of Washington's failure to bring
any change into its animosity-dominated policies toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
Citing a U.S. decision to expand Persian language broadcasting
service to Iran as a case of the policies, the foreign minister
further stressed that Iran can not enter into talks with the
U.S. under such a situation.
</P>
<P>
Despite strong criticism from the Iranian government, the
U.S. congress recently approved a bill allocating 2.5 million
U.S. dollars for Radio Free Iran which is scheduled to begin
broadcasting in September this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been pursuing containment policies toward the Gulf
state since the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran. It broke up
diplomatic relations with Tehran after radical Iranian students
occupied the U.S. Embassy and took staffers hostages in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister also denied the existence of
Japan's mediation between Iran and the U.S., saying that the
recent visit of Japanese state secretary for foreign affairs
Masahiko Komura to Iran had nothing to do with the
Tehran-Washington ties.
</P>
<P>
However, Japanese sources said that Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami asked Komura on Saturday to convey a message to the U.S.,
urging Washington to change its policies to break down the "wall
of mistrust" between the two sides.

PARIS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad
will pay a state visit to France in the second half of July,
Agence France-Presse (AFP) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad's visit will be a return to that by President Jacques
Chirac to Damascus in October 1996, the AFP quoted reliable
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
It would be Al-Assad's second visit to France in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
Relations between France and Syria remained cold during the
time of President Francois Mitterrand, mainly due to differences
over Lebanon. But they began to improve after Chirac became
president in May 1995.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Moves to Comply With OPEC Quota Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government and oil
production companies operating in the country have begun to take
concrete steps to reduce oil output in a bid to keep the fall of
oil price in the world market.
</P>
<P>
As party to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), Nigeria agreed last month to work together with other
members to restore stability of the oil market by cutting its
crude out by 125,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
The government and oil companies, at a meeting in Abuja
recently, agreed on a monitoring procedure to ensure compliance
with the cut.
</P>
<P>
Under the procedure, a report on export from each crude oil
terminal as well as domestic supply to refineries will be made on
a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Petroleum Resources is expected to supply
daily reports on provisional production to assist the monitoring
efforts of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).
</P>
<P>
No crude oil tanker or vessel will be given clearance for
proposed liftings in excess of the production allowable for each
company, according to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
While reiterating the government directive on production
restraint, NNPC group Managing Director Dalhatu Bayero assured
the chief executives of oil companies that the new guidelines are
being introduced in the interest of both the country, OPEC and
the oil firms themselves.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also confirmed the production allowable for each
company based on the cut agreed upon at the OPEC extraordinary
meeting last month.
</P>
<P>
The production cut which became effective on April 1 will see
Nigeria's production fall from the February level of 2.58 million
barrels per day to 2.455 million.
</P>
<P>
The figure is still in excess of the country's OPEC production
ceiling of 2.042 million barrel per day.

GENEVA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China has appealed once again that
a convention on a total ban of nuclear weapons be concluded at an
early date like the conventions banning chemical and biological
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here on Monday at the second session of the
Preparatory Committee for the 2000 Review Conference of the
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
(NPT), head of the Chinese delegation Sha Zukang made the
following proposals:
</P>
<P>
-- Nuclear-weapon states should conclude a treaty on mutual
no-first-use of nuclear weapons;
</P>
<P>
-- Nuclear-weapon states should abandon the policy of nuclear
deterrence and conclude a legally binding international instrument
on no use or threat to use of nuclear weapons against
non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones;
</P>
<P>
-- The quantity and quality of the nuclear weapons possessed by
the U.S. and Russia have brought them special responsibilities on
nuclear disarmament;
</P>
<P>
-- Countries concerned should stop immediately research on and
development of advanced strategic missile defense systems and
outer space weapons;
</P>
<P>
-- And, negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty
should be initiated and a pact be concluded as soon as possible.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Majlis (Parliament)
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri arrived here Monday for a three-day
visit aimed at enhancing political, cultural, parliamentary and
economic ties between the two Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
"Iran believes that exchanging visits might strengthen
brotherly and distinguished ties between our two countries,"
Nateq-Nouri told reporters upon his arrival at the Kuwaiti
airport.
</P>
<P>
This is Nateq-Nouri's second visit to Kuwait in response to an
invitation from his Kuwaiti counterpart Ahmad Al-Saadoun. He paid
his first visit in April 1995 when he signed a memorandum of
understanding with Kuwait on parliamentary affairs.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day stay in Kuwait, Nateq-Nouri will meet
with Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jabel Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah and members of
Kuwaiti National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The visit comes in an atmosphere of enhanced friendship
between the two countries as a result of the trip by the Kuwait's
amir to Iran last December to attend the eighth summit of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, Kuwaiti ambassador in
Tehran Abdullah Abdulaziz Al-Duwaikh was quoted as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations between Kuwait and Iran have been on good
terms. In May 1997, Kuwait and Iran signed a bilateral memorandum
of understanding on all aspects of economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Iran have also been striving to increase their
trade exchanges. Latest statistics show that the trade exchanges
between Iran and Kuwait stood at nearly 100 million U.S. dollars
in 1997.

</P>
<P>
It finished at 64.69 U.S. cents from 65.12 U.S. cents at

the market was increasing the odds of rate cut by the central

<HEADLINE> China Moves to Check Cheating in Pricing Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China plans to strictly check
fraudulent pricing activities, a conduct arousing many consumer
complaints, with the state's price law scheduled to go into effect
May 1.
</P>
<P>
According to Wei Dale, an official with the State Development
Planning Commission, the Price Law contains four chapters and 48
articles, which give explicit wording on price cheating.
</P>
<P>
The common fraudulent pricing activities include fictitious
lowering of prices, misunderstanding or vague price indications,
double prices and price discrimination, said the official.
</P>
<P>
He noted that such fraudulent pricing activities have seriously
harmed the interests of consumers and of other traders, causing
chaos in the country's economic life.
</P>
<P>
The price law stipulates a series of penalties for fraudulent
pricing conduct including compensation for the loss suffered by
consumers, fines on illegal traders as much as five times their
illegal gains, stopping business for rectification, or even
revoking their licenses, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the drafting of the price law is designed to
standardize pricing order in markets and to protect the legitimate
interests of consumers, in a bid to promote fair competition.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Seeks to Curb Loss of Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislative body is
deliberating on amendments to the draft of the Land-Use Law, which
aims to protect the country's farmland resources. China's per
capita acreage of farmland only accounts for 40 percent of the
world's average.
</P>
<P>
The amendments to the draft of the Land-Use Law, which has been
submitted to the second session of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC) for deliberation, clearly points
out that "the state will adopt special policies to protect the
farmland resources, and strictly prevent farmland from
being transferred into non-farmland."
</P>
<P>
The draft says that China also plans to establish a farmland
compensation system in the form of law. "The units that use
farmland for other purposes are entitled to exploit the same
amounts of new farmland," it says.
</P>
<P>
Besides, China is poised to implement a basic farmland
protection system, which means that more than 80 percent of the
country's farmland -- high-yield and arable land for specialties,
new products, and vegetables and scientific research -- is under
strict protection of the government.
</P>
<P>
The draft also stipulates that "no unit or individual is
allowed to leave farmland unused," and those who violate the rules
will be penalized economically or lose their land-use rights.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has 130 million hectares of
farmland, with per capita acreage at 0.1 hectare, while the Food
and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations set the global
alarm line at 0.05 hectares per person.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that during the last 10 years agricultural
structural adjustment and natural disasters have impaired 4.7
million hectares of farmland, in addition to 1.97 million hectares
of farmland used for non-agricultural purposes.
</P>
<P>
High- and stable-yield farmland, mainly situated in east and
south China, accounts for less than 40 percent of the country's
total farming area, and is also endangered as a result of being
used for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
Senior Chinese officials here have emphasized that China must
formulate and implement the most strict Land-Use Law in the world
to effectively protect the country's limited farmland
resources.

<HEADLINE> China Faces Obstacles in Developing Information Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Five major obstacles are
standing in the way of China's progress in information technology,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
One obstacle is the excessive emphasis of human relationships
in the traditional management culture. The tendency leads to a
booming restaurant business since a lot of deals are struck
through heated talks over dinner, while neglecting the use of
"cold computers," this is a view shared by experts attending a
national meeting here.
</P>
<P>
Another problem is caused by ample cheap labor in China, and
this makes the use of a worker much cheaper than the use of a
computer.
</P>
<P>
The traditional way of work is also a hindrance to the
acceptance of modern information technology. While many foreign
companies are abandoning offices following the use of computers,
most Chinese executives like to personally oversee their staff
work.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the fear of losing face also affects the enthusiasm
of Chinese executives, many of whom lack computer knowledge.
</P>
<P>
The last obstacle is the language barrier. Since many Chinese
people do not know English, software should be translated into
English, thus delaying the time for using them.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The International Exhibition
Center of the traditional exhibition city of Leipzig, Germany,
officially opened its Beijing representative office here today.
</P>
<P>
The center began doing business in China last September, with
the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce Beijing office as its
agent.
</P>
<P>
Ulrich Kromer, the center's managing director, announced the
official opening of the Beijing representative office in today's
news conference, and said that 15 Chinese delegations attended
trade fairs in Leipzig last year.
</P>
<P>
China's economy, which remained stable during last year's
financial crisis in Asia, has consolidated the decision of the
Leipzig Exhibition Center to enhance its presence in the Chinese
market, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kromer, the cooperation between Chinese businesses
and the center is mainly in the fields of contracts,
transportation, environmental technology and energy.
</P>
<P>
Leipzig, located in central Germany, played host to its first
trade fair in 1895, and has so far established 35 offices
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The German Chamber of Industry and Commerce also held its
official opening ceremony here this evening.

LHASA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Five state-owned enterprises in
China's Tibet Autonomous Region have completed reform by adopting
the stock system, with related stock issues raising a total of one
billion yuan (120 million US dollars).

<HEADLINE> OECD Ministerial Meeting Begins in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The 29-member Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Monday began its
annual ministerial meeting in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will focus on the financial crisis in Asia, the
economic crisis in Japan, the launch of the European single
currency and the stalked talks on an agreement on multilateral
investment among OECD members, said OECD officials.
</P>
<P>
Although the financial crisis in Asia is said to have only a
limited impact on other parts of the world, the OECD is
particularly worried about the slide and even a recession of
the Japanese economy, the world's second largest.
</P>
<P>
But OECD officials are optimistic that the Japanese economy,
expected to drop by 0.3 percent in its gross domestic product this
year, will recover from the crisis after Tokyo has launched a
massive, 128 billion-dollar economic renewal plan.
</P>
<P>
While the European Union (EU) recently released a report
supporting liberalization of global investment, the recently
resumed negotiations on the Agreement on Multilateral Investment
(AMI) among OECD members is not expected to go far in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Differences over cultural exceptions, American extra-
territorial laws on trade sanctions, and issues on social and
environmental protection persist between the United States and
European countries.
</P>
<P>
France is stoutly opposed to the AMI and the EU project to
establish a trans-Atlantic free trade zone.

<HEADLINE> Fruit Fosters Uygur Centenarians in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Fresh grapes, Hami melons,
watermelons and other kinds of fruit have fostered more than 500
centenarians in Hotan and Kashi prefectures in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
A special study conducted by two army hospitals in the region
shows that the amount of hormones in the blood of centenarians
is the same as in those who are 25 to 40 years younger.
</P>
<P>
The study, funded by the World Health Organization (WHO), also
indicates that the male centenarians still have the sex hormone
which makes them fertile.
</P>
<P>
Doctors attributed the centenarians' longevity to their diet of
fresh fruit all year round from which they absorb enough elements
necessary for keeping health and prolonging life.
</P>
<P>
The centenarians inhabit Gobi desert areas neighboring
Taklamakan Desert in the west and southwest parts of Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The scarce-population area claims to have the largest number
of centenarians in China. Bama County in south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, an area that has a population of
260,000, has 79 centenarians.
</P>
<P>
Similar to centenarians in Bama, they often consume maize,
potatoes and beans and had been farming, grazing animals and
hunting to a very old age.
</P>
<P>
Different from Bama centenarians, about one-fifth of the Uygur
centenarians never drink wine or liquor.
</P>
<P>
Bama is located in a mountainous area and most centenarians
often drink low-grade maize or snake wine to relieve rheumatic
pains, cold and encourage blood circulation.
</P>
<P>
About one-fifth of the Uygur centenarians never smoke and most
of them seldom add pungent flavor to their dishes.
</P>
<P>
Like centenarians in other parts of China, 99 percent of the
centenarians are moderate size or thin, and very few have
contracted high-blood presure or cardiovascular disease.
</P>
<P>
Another character of the Uygur centenarians is that they all
have brushed their teeth since childhood and some of them brush
their teeth five times a day; and only half of them lose all of
their teeth.
</P>
<P>
Like centenarians in other places, the clear and fresh air and
harmonious families are also major factors in their longevity.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Call for Forestry Compensation Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese legislators have
called for the establishment of a compensation fund for forestry
ecological benefits to better protect the environment in
state-owned forests.
</P>
<P>
Deliberating the draft amendments to the Forestry Law at the
ongoing second session of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, lawmakers said that it is a good idea to make
such amendment to the law.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Wu Shuqing said China is a country in need of forests,
so establishing the fund will be of great significance to protect
shelter forest and special-purpose forests as well as to improve
environmental quality.
</P>
<P>
According to the amendment, the fund will be specifically used
to cultivate, protect and manage shelter forest and special forest
resources which bring about considerable ecological benefits. And
the funds would not be used for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, lawmaker Pu Chaozhu said the amendments
should also take into consideration the economic interests of
local residents in addition to the emphasis on overall ecological
and social benefits.
</P>
<P>
Most of the those inhabiting forest areas are ethnic groups who
have to rely on the forests to make a living, Pu said.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, lawmakers said that the Forestry Law, which was
put into effect in 1984, has played a leading role in protecting
and utilizing forest resources. But along with social and economic
development, some of its articles are out of date and need
revision.
</P>
<P>
In panel discussions Sunday, lawmakers also deliberated draft
amendments concerning the transfer of the right of using woods and
forest lands, the requisitioning of forest lands, the issuance of
forest-related certificates in major state-owned forest areas, and
the responsibilities of forestry public security departments.
</P>
<P>
In the discussions, legislators expressed the belief that the
amendments would be passed at the NPC Standing Committee session.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Nepal and India have agreed to
expand air routes between them, The Kathmandu Post said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached last week, both countries will allow
airlines to operate on new routes from towns in the Terai plain in
southern Nepal to major Indian cities, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed to redraw the present operational
air routes between them to make air operation more efficient, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Many aviation experts see the opening of new air routes as a
big boost for Nepal's tourism industry, the daily said, adding
that Indian tourists have long been the biggest contributor to
Nepal's tourism, and the new routes are sure to see a jump in the
number of arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and India renewed a bilateral air services agreement last
June when then Indian Prime Minister I.K. Gujral visited Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The agreement allows private airlines to operate between the
two countries.

<HEADLINE> China's GDP Growth Rate To Hit 8.2 Percent, Economists Say (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- In spite of a first-quarter
slowdown, the Chinese economy is expected to gain momentum and
generate an 8.2 percent increase for the whole year, according to
an analytical report issued today by veteran economists with the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and State Statistics
Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
Based on results of analog model research and data analysis,
the report outlines a sound future for the Chinese economy with
the primary industries -- agriculture, fisheries, forestry, animal
husbandry and water conservation -- increasing 3.4 percent in
added value and the secondary and tertiary industries growing by
9.7 percent and 8.3 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The country's GDP growth rate was 8.8 percent last year. The
Chinese government announced that the growth target will be 8
percent this year to maintain a suitable economic momentum and
curb the bubble economic activities while readjusting its
enterprise structure.
</P>
<P>
The biannual analytical survey on the national economy, which
was initiated in 1990 by CASS and SSB, China's top two research
bodies in economics, has been one of the most reliable and
authoritative channels to foretell China's short-term economic
future.
</P>
<P>
Though still among the world's fastest growing economies,
China's is sloping down at "an unexpected speed" as the gross
domestic product (GDP) growth rate dropped to 7.2 percent in the
January-March period.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Asian financial crisis and inefficient
production structure in Chinese companies, the economic slowdown
was caused by the "remaining influence" of the government's
macro-control policies, which aimed at cooling down the overheated
macroeconomic operation and led to a soft landing in 1996.

<HEADLINE> China's GDP Growth Rate To Hit 8.2 Percent, Economists Say (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, a GDP increase of 8 percent or more could be
guaranteed in terms of both the country's present economic
conditions and growth potential, said economists with CASS and SSB.
</P>
<P>
They said the reshuffling of the central committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) at the 15th National CPC Congress
and the new State Council, or China's cabinet, at the last plenum
of the National People's Congress, provides a "stable political
guarantee" for economic development. Both the central and local
governments have made a firm resolution to pick up the economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
As long as the central government's policy on stimulating
economic growth is put into practice in time, China will be able
to solve all the problems hindering high economic growth, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
In order to facilitate a rebound in GDP growth, China has
resorted to a new economic model featuring higher domestic
demand. The new model is expected to take effect in the latter
half of this year, when the central government's investment
programs in fixed assets switch into high gear.
</P>
<P>
For its untapped market potential, the rural area could develop
into a major contributor to the targeted economic growth rate this
year, according to the economists.
</P>
<P>
A fast increase in exports is also possible, as long as China
readjusts the mix of trade partners through exploring more
business opportunities in non-Asian markets little affected by the
financial crisis, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to results of their analytic research, China's
investment in fixed assets will amount to about 2.89 trillion yuan
this year, up 14 percent over the previous year. Retail sales will
reach 2.97 trillion yuan, up 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The exports will be 195.5 billion U.S. dollars, up 7 percent,
achieving a foreign trade surplus of 35.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China expects slightly higher prices this year,
though the inflation rate will be far from reaching an alarm stage.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that the retail price index will climb by
1.9 percent this year, and the consumer price index by 3.8
percent.

<HEADLINE> Iranian House Speaker Visits Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran's parliament Speaker
Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri arrived here Monday on a three-day visit
aimed at enhancing political, cultural, parliamentary and
economic ties between the two Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
"Iran believes that exchanging visits might strengthen
brotherly and distinguished ties between our two countries,"
Nouri told reporters upon arrival at the Kuwaiti airport.
</P>
<P>
This is Nouri's second visit to Kuwait in response to an
invitation of his Kuwaiti counterpart Ahmed Al-Sadoun. He paid
his first visit in April 1995 when he signed a memorandum of
understanding with Kuwait including coordination of positions in
conferences of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day stay in Kuwait, Nouri will meet Kuwaiti
Amir Sheikh Jabel Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah and members of Kuwaiti
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Kuwait and Iran have been on good terms. Iran
also started last year to make goodwill initiatives towards the
Gulf Cooperation Council states on improving bilateral ties which
had been strained following Tehran's 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Arab states praised the enhancement of relations with
neighboring Iran since moderate President Khatami assumed office
in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
The six-member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council and Iran
have taken several steps towards the upgrading the level of
relations with the two sides believing that building strong ties
is vital for security and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
In May 1997, Kuwait and Iran signed a bilateral memorandum of
understanding on all aspects of economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Iran also have been striving to increase their
trade exchanges. Latest statistics showed that the trade
exchanges between Iran and Kuwait stood at nearly 100 million
U.S. dollars in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Army Chief to Visit Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Chief of General Staff
Ismail Hakki Karadayi is to visit Moscow from May 18 to 22 to
discuss some tough issues with Russian officials, the Daily News
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted senior military sources as saying that a
high-level delegation composed of experts on regional problems
and security issues will accompany Karadayi on his visit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russia's tolerance of outlawed Kurdish rebels on its territory
will be discussed during the visit. The Kurdish rebels have been
fighting a 14-year-old war in southeastern Turkey against the
Turkish government for an independent Kurdish state.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Russia of training the Kurdish rebels on its
territory, but Russia has denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also discuss Russia's determination to sell
S-300 missiles to Cyprus, which has been divided into the
Greek Cypriot-dominated south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled
north since 1974 when Turkish troops landed and took over the
northern third of the island in the wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-made S-300 missiles, which Cyprus signed an
agreement with Russia to purchase early last year, are expected to
be deployed on the island later this year. Turkey has threatened
preemptive strikes if the missiles are deployed.
</P>
<P>
"We want to have better, more sincere ties with Russia, but
Moscow should also prove its good intentions toward Ankara," a
senior official said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Russia's disagreement to the planned Baku-Ceyhan
oil pipeline project is also to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Turkey supports the oil project that will transport the Caspian
oil through a pipeline from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku and to
the southern Turkish city of Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
As an energy-starving country, Turkey has been playing an
active role in exploiting the abundant Caspian oil in order to
meet its rapidly increasing energy demands and also earn foreign
exchange through the pipelines that pass through its territory.
</P>
<P>
Russia has expressed its dissatisfaction toward a meeting among
Turkey, Azerbaijan and a number of other related countries for
discussion on the oil project. Russia was not invited to the
meeting held early last month in Istanbul, Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sets up Body to Boost Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has set up
a national committee to help formulate and implement new policies
toward a take-off of the country's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the National Tourism Facilitation Committee in
the capital Abuja over the weekend, Minister of Commerce and
Tourism Emmanuel Udogu said the new organization would advise the
government on the simplification of entry formalities into the
country.
</P>
<P>
The committee is also charged with the responsibility of
ensuring conformity with the provision of healthy and sanitary
regulations of the tourism industry, the Post Express reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The committee will equally be responsible for the collection
and dissemination of tourism information and ensure security and
safety of life and property of tourists visiting the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, tourism facilitation committees
will also be established at state and local government levels.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has given priority to the development
of tourism, the industry has remained in dismay without
an appreciable import of tourist arrivals and receipts.
</P>
<P>
The situation resulted from lack of adequate and functional
infrastructural facilities especially good roads, telephone and
electricity, the minister explained.
</P>
<P>
Lack of revenue establishment and the negative behaviors of
some government agencies whose functions are to develop and
promote tourism in the country have contributed to this trend, he
went on.
</P>
<P>
According to Udogu, his ministry has received complaints from
foreign tourists of their frustrating and harrowing experiences
at the nation's entry and exit points.
</P>
<P>
With Nigeria hosting the under 20 World Cup tournament next
year, the way the nation's tourism industry is presented during
the time remain indelible in the minds of those who would come in
as participants or tourists, he added.

PARIS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers Monday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Five months from the legislative elections in Germany, the
ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) was routed in the regional
election in Saxony-Anhalt in the former East Germany. The votes
obtained by CDU dropped by 12 percentage points to 22 percent, as
compared with the last election in 1994. Meanwhile, the
extreme-right Deutsche Volksunion entered for the first time into
the regional parliament of Saxony-Anhalt by winning 13 percent of
the votes.
</P>
<P>
-- The split between President Jacques Chirac and the chairman
of the Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) Philippe Seguin has
become more than apparent, after Seguin announced last Saturday
that he might not run for election of RPR chairman next
January. Seguin ordered RPR not to vote for the government project
to adopt the euro last week, despite Chirac's call for support to
the project.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The chairman of the Gaullist Rally for the Republic Philippe
Seguin said last Saturday that he will step down if he cannot have a
free hand to reorganize the Gaullist movement without intervention
from President Jacques Chirac. He described the internal situation
of the RPR as "a mess."
</P>
<P>
-- Air France and Air Afrique have decided to refuse to carry any
more illegal immigrants expelled by France to Mali, causing a major
embarrassment for the Socialist government and the Socialist Party of
France, which are resorting to other air companies, including the
Belgian Sabena, to carry out the operations which are always
tumultuous.

<HEADLINE> CIA Spoils Netanyahu's Attempt to Sidestep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) has foiled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's attempt to send a message on Mideast peace to
President Bill Clinton while sidestepping the Secretary of State.
</P>
<P>
CIA Director George Tenet has recently received the message
from Netanyahu concerning the U.S. role in mediating the Middle
East peace process. But he deemed this as a trick by the Israeli
leader to bypass Madeleine Albright and the State Department.
</P>
<P>
Then, he returned the message to the Israeli prime minister,
Israel's Hebrew daily Haaretz reported in a front-page story on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
By choosing to send messages to the CIA, Netanyahu aimed at
getting them through to Clinton directly without bringing Albright
into the picture, the report said.
</P>
<P>
This was the second message the CIA received from
Netanyahu. The CIA had been puzzled to have received the first
message which was found not sensitive enough for direct delivery
to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Netanyahu indicated his willingness to
increase slightly the size of the second redeployment, although in
public he has said Israel will only accept a pullback of 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
The CIA sensed from the wording of the message that Netanyahu
in fact expected Tenet to convey it through his own channels to
Clinton. Instead, the CIA sent a copy of the message to Albright's
office.
</P>
<P>
But soon afterward, Tenet received the second message. This
time Tenet decided to return it to Netanyahu as he concluded that
the Israeli leader was trying to bypass Albright. So the message
was sent back to Netanyahu with a note of explanation, drawn up
jointly by the CIA and the State Department.

<HEADLINE> FW de Klerk, Pik Botha to Marry Their New Loves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President F.W. de Klerk and former foreign minister Pik Botha,
will remarry with new women, the Star daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, 62, announced last week his intention to marry his
Greek love, Elita Georgiadis, saying, "I have already instructed
my attorney to proceed with a divorce action. Mrs. Georgiadis is
likewise busy with a divorce action and we plan to marry each
other when that has been finalized."
</P>
<P>
De Klerk has ruled out any possibly of making up with his
estranged wife of 39 years. Georgiadis was reportedly to leave
her husband Tony, to whom she had been married for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk's wife Marike, 60, had made no comment when told of
her husband's statement Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Botha was due to marry a long-time professional friend, South
African Broadcasting Corporation executive producer Ina Jourbet,
on his 66th birthday Monday.
</P>
<P>
The marriage was planned for later, but the couple decided to
bring it forward since Botha is due any day to undergo an
operation for prostate cancer, according to sources closed to
Botha.
</P>
<P>
Botha's first wife, Helena, died two years ago.

<HEADLINE> China's Beverage Industry Growing fast (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese beverage manufacturers are
currently challenging the dominance of U.S.-based Coca-Cola and
Pepsi in the country.
</P>
<P>
The greatest challenges come from two major Chinese beverage
producers -- the China Coconut Palm Group in the island Province
of Hainan and the Guangdong Jianlibao Group in south China's
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The two U.S. beverage producers entered the Chinese market with
ease in the early 1980s, gaining the lion's share of the domestic
market and forcing a number of their Chinese counterparts into
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Coconut Palm and Jianlibao have since entered the top 20 list
of best-selling beverages in China, along with Coca-Cola and Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
Numerous international consortia have expressed interest in
cooperating with Coconut Palm under favorable conditions. However,
Board Chairman Wang Guangxing declined all offer. "Coconut Palm is
growing without the need for overseas investments or brand name
association, and will continue to do so in the future," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Coconut Palm's 1997 sales volume was up by 180-fold on the
level for 1986 when the company was founded, and its annual output
has grown from less than 3,000 tons to well over 200,000 tons. The
company has also established more than 2,000 marketing agencies
across the country.
</P>
<P>
The group entered the world market in 1989 and currently
exports products to more than 30 countries and regions, with
annual export sales approaching 50 million yuan. The U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) granted approval for sales of the
group's natural coconut juice in the United States.

Coconut Palm has developed 51 high-grade products, including 21
items which have won both international and national gold
prizes. The company's natural coconut juice, mango juice and
mineral water have been designated for use at state banquets. The
company has hosted visits by more than 70 ambassadors to China and
over a dozen foreign chiefs of state.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute Coconut Palm's success mainly to the fact
that the "naturalness" of its products caters to worldwide return
to nature trend for beverages.
</P>
<P>
The company's natural coconut juice contains 17 kinds of amino
acids conducive to health, according to the Ministry of
Health. "Coconut juice is nutritious and coconut fat is beneficial
for the treatment of viruses and cancer," according to Dr. Mary
Enig, a well-known U.S. nutritionist.
</P>
<P>
The group's specialists conducted 383 in-depth experiments
before finally developing the company's coconut juice freshness
preservation technique which the Chinese Association for Science
and Technology cites as unique in the world. The technique is
currently registered in China's inland and Hong Kong, the
Philippines, Britain and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The company, the first domestic beverage producer to export
both products and equipment, currently exports the equipment of
its automatic processing lines.
</P>
<P>
China's immature national beverage industry has witnessed rapid
development, but nonetheless will require consistent efforts for
future progress, according to the Board Chairman Wang.

<HEADLINE> China Is One of Birthplaces For Tulip, Florist Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition of tulips is now
under way in Lanzhou, capital of northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
For most Chinese people, the tulip is a foreign flower from
Europe. The flower has been so beloved by Europeans that at least
three countries from that continent -- the Netherlands, Hungary
and Turkey -- have made it their national flower.
</P>
<P>
"But China is one of the birthplaces for the tulip," said Liang
Shuhai, a florist in northwestern Qinghai Province. Liang is
deputy secretary general of the provincial flower association and
manager of a local park in Xining, the provincial capital of
Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts have discovered 20 wild types of tulip in the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Mount Tianshan in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, and the Qinling Mountain area. It is a proof
that the country is one of the original places for the flower, the
florist said.
</P>
<P>
In the Middle Ages, European crusaders once reached the
northwestern part of China and brought the tulip back to Middle
Asia. Later, in the 17th century, the flower was brought into the
Netherlands and other European areas, according to Liang.
</P>
<P>
"Europeans, especially the Dutch, have been mad at tulip and
they have developed thousands of new types of the flower," the
florist said.
</P>
<P>
China is a late-comer in the cultivation and research of
tulips, but many parts of the country are suitable geographically
and climatically for growing the flower, he said.
</P>
<P>
So far, a number of tulip research and cultivation centers have
been set up in Gansu, Qinghai, Zhejiang and Sichuan provinces.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Province Trying Harder to Attract Overseas Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
will simplify its procedures for approving investment projects and
will introduce efficient "one window" service so that investors
may complete all necessary procedures in just one place.
</P>
<P>
The province will also establish a province-wide investment
promotion network and will give guidance in directing overseas
investment into such sectors as machine-building, electronics,
chemicals and pharmaceuticals, as well as into upgrading
traditional silk, cotton textile and cement industries.
</P>
<P>
It also intends to attract more overseas funds to speed up
development of agriculture featuring "high quality, high yield and
high efficiency", infrastructure, basic industries and the
high-tech industrial sector, according to information from a
recent provincial meeting on use of overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the province had signed contracts with
overseas investors involving a promised use of 25.23 billion
U.S. dollars in overseas funds, but the actual paid-in sum of
overseas funds stood at 10.82 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The province also had approved the establishment of 14,600
overseas-financed businesses, of which, 6,500 had started
operations. The operational overseas-backed businesses contributed
one-fourth of the province's total sales revenue and one-fourth of
exports in 1997, becoming an important part of the province's
economy.
</P>
<P>
The province, situated on the eastern China coast and
economically developed, now has two open coastal cities, 34 open
counties and county-level cities, eight state-level development
zones and a group of provincial-level development zones.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Joins Intensive Peace Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) peace
envoy Miguel Moratinos arrived here late Sunday to join the
United States' efforts to break the Israeli-Palestinian deadlock
in Israeli redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos held talks with Uzi Arad, diplomatic adviser to
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the Ben-Gurion
Airport upon his arrival before Arad's departure for Washington to
prepare for a scheduled visit by U.S. Vice-President Al Gore to
Israel later this week.
</P>
<P>
They discussed the ongoing diplomatic efforts launched by
U.S. Middle East special envoy Dennis Ross with the aim of
breaking the deadlock over the next stage of Israeli troop
withdrawal in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who arrived here Saturday with U.S. Assistant Secretary
of State Martin Indyk, has already held two rounds of talks with
Netanyahu and he met in Gaza Sunday night with Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
To add momentum to the current diplomatic offensive to break
the peace deadlock, Moratinos is to hold talks with Ross, Arafat
and Israeli officials in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Ross was trying to persuade Israel to accept the U.S.
proposal for a 13.1 percent pullback in the second redeployment,
but there is no sign so far indicating that Netanyahu has
softened his position on rejecting anything more than 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said that the aim of
Ross' mission was mainly "to bring Netanyahu closer to the
U.S. ideas." The PNA has declared its willingness to accept the
U.S. plan, and is waiting for the Israeli response.
</P>
<P>
The main sticking point now seemed to be that while Israel
could agree to increase somewhat the size of the second
redeployment, it intends to abolish the planned third
redeployment. Israel hopes to combine the third redeployment into
the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Ross' another mission is to set the stage for the May 4 talks
in London, in which U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
will hold separate talks with Netanyahu and Arafat in an attempt
to bridge their gap.
</P>
<P>
The London talks were brokered by British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, whose country is holding the rotating EU presidency,
during his visit to the region last week.
</P>
<P>
The prestigious Hebrew daily Haaretz quoted officials
accompanying Ross as saying that the U.S. will decide whether to
table its peace initiative in the London talks at the end of
Ross' mission here.
</P>
<P>
These officials said U.S. President Bill Clinton and Albright
are waiting for the recommendations from Ross, Indyk and Gore
before formulating next steps on advancing the Israeli-Palestinian
talks.

<HEADLINE> Soil Erosion Worsening along Upper Reaches of Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The area of soil erosion on the
upper reaches of the 5,464-kilometer Yellow River, China's second
longest after the Yangtze River, has spread to 75,400 square
kilometers, or 51.08 percent of the upper reaches' watershed in
Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
A remote sensing survey by the Ministry of Water Resources
shows that soil erosion produces 88 million tons of silt
annually. If this continues, people's life and production will be
seriously affected along the middle and lower reaches, experts
warn.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River has its source in the Qinghai and runs 1,983
kilometers in the province, involving 2.87 million people and
accounting for nearly 90 percent of the province's rural
population. The watershed is also Qinghai's major grain production
area.
</P>
<P>
However, the area is vulnerable to soil erosion as it lies at
the juncture of the mountainous Loess Plateau and Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, where torrents and mud-rock flows rush downriver when
rainstorms exceed 10 millimeters.
</P>
<P>
Man-made destruction is also a factor. The area of vegetation
has been decreasing with random reclamation. As a result, the
province's desertification area is thousands of square kilometers
more than two decades ago. And Qinghai suffers 170 million yuan in
direct economic losses from soil erosion alone every year, as well
as 59.9 million kilograms of grain losses.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao said here Monday that China will push forward its economic
and trade cooperation with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at a banquet hosted by South Korean
business leaders, Hu said that there are many favorable conditions
for China and South Korea to expand their cooperation since they
are close and friendly neighbors sharing similar culture and
tradition with good political relations and complementary
economies.
</P>
<P>
The industrial and commercial circles of the two nations, in
line with the spirit of mutual benefit, should enlarge exchange
and cooperation in economy and trade by exploring various avenues
and giving free rein to their advantages.
</P>
<P>
The economic and trade ties could be further developed so long
as the two countries make joint efforts, said Hu, who arrived here
Sunday for a five-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between China and South Korea rose to 24
billion U.S. dollars in 1997 from the 4.44 billion dollars in 1991.
</P>
<P>
China and South Korea established diplomatic relations in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Kim Sang Ha, president of the Korea Chamber of Commerce and
Industry, said at the banquet that China is now the third largest
trade partner of South Korea while South Korea has become China's
fourth largest trade partner.
</P>
<P>
China's 8 percent economic growth and its low inflation rate
have served as a strong support to its neighbors who are striving
for economic recovery, he said, adding that China's economic
potentials will help promote South Korean-Chinese economic
cooperation and contribute greatly to the stability and growth of
the economies in Asia.

LONDON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Blood supplies in Britain are

Operations are to be canceled as the nation's blood supplies

</P>
<P>
Hospitals are trying to reduce their waiting lists as they have
money available to carry out operations in the new financial year,
the spokesman said.
</P>

However, the NBA admits that owing to the blood shortage, it
has canceled and reduced blood supplies to some hospitals, mainly

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Xiaolangdi water control
project on the Yellow River will be able to stop the kind of
flooding that occurs every 100 years, this year, Chinese experts
say.
</P>
<P>
The project will allow the area to withstand flood waters below
182 meters this year. The flood season usually comes in July.
</P>
<P>
The two cofferdams have risen to the height of 185 meters, with
the remaining seven meters to be completed by the end of this
month.
</P>
<P>
The damming began last October. Since then, more than 19
million cubic meters of earth and stone have been put into the
dam, or 37 percent of the total amount needed.
</P>
<P>
Work on the underground power room, which measures 251 m. high
by 61 m., has been completed and workers are pouring the concrete
for the generator area.
</P>
<P>
This is the second largest water control project in China,
after the Three Gorges. It now can stop the kind of flooding that
occurs every 60 years but will be able to stop the kind that
occurs every 1,000 years when it is completed in 2001.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Support for the New Zealand
National Party continued to grow since the party changed its
leadership late last year, the latest opinion poll shows.
</P>
<P>
The party now enjoys 46 percent of the support rating, up 3
percent since the last poll, Television New Zealand reported
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The popularity of the major opposition party, the Labor Party,
sank to 38 percent, the lowest point in 11 months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 33 percent of those polled rated the present Prime
Minister Jenny Shipley as the most preferred prime minister, while
only 21 percent gave the credit to Labor leader Helen Clark, who
once enjoyed the highest rating as the preferred prime minister.
</P>
<P>
If translated into seats in the parliament, the National Party
would have 58 MPs. And the ACT party, which shares many policies
with the National Party, would win 6 seats.
</P>
<P>
The two parties would then have 64 MPs combined, enough to form
a majority government and is even more than the majority the
present coalition government has.

<HEADLINE> Trade Official Predicts Moderate Export Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The 1998 growth rate for China's
export will remain at or above 10 percent this year, according to
a senior Chinese trade official.
</P>
<P>
The official with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation noted that the country's exports to Japan declined by
1.7 percent in the first quarter when compared to the same 1997
period, its exports to the Republic of Korea fell by 22
percent and to Indonesia by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, sharp increases were recorded in exports to North
America, Europe, Latin America and various other Asian countries,
according to Li Jian, deputy director of the the ministry's China
Trade Research Department.
</P>
<P>
The latter export increases offset the negative influences of
the financial crisis in Southeast Asia, said Li.
</P>
<P>
China has introduced a technology-intensive processing system
with funds imported from abroad in recent years. The country
enjoys ample domestic supplies and a stable market, and many
Chinese enterprises have enhanced their awareness of international
competition. Li cited the aforementioned areas as favorable
factors for increasing exports.
</P>
<P>
Li addressed China's import situation for this year by noting
that many economists have adopted a positive approach to the
growth of imports. However, the slowdown in investments during the
first quarter resulted in only a slight increase in imports.
</P>
<P>
The promulgation of a series of government policies on
investment will spark a rebound in the growth rate for imports
during the latter half of the year, said Li.
</P>
<P>
Li predicted that China's import growth rate will reach 10
percent, with a favorable balance of some 40 billion U.S. dollars
for the year.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Seeks Non-Oil Sources of Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti government is
considering a number of economic measures searching for new
sources of income in response to the fall of oil prices, local
newspapers reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government wants to "diversify revenue (sources), reduce
public expenditures and improve the management of public funds in
response to fall in oil prices," Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs Nasser Abdallah Al-Roudhan
was quoted as saying after a weekly cabinet meeting Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the cabinet discussed a memorandum by the
Ministry of Finance that deals with the impact of declining oil
prices on the treasury.
</P>
<P>
The memo "includes 27 measures that should be implemented to
cut public spending and reduce challenges facing the budget
including its deficit," he added.
</P>
<P>
The economic committee of the cabinet is scheduled to meet
Wednesday and will study the memo and report back to the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The nine-year low oil prices in the world market since the
start of this year has a very negative impact on the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah warned Sunday
that Kuwait could face an "economic catastrophe" if Kuwaiti
crudes remained at 10.5 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The budget of 1998-99 fiscal year (July 1 to June 30), which is
based on an oil price of 12 U.S. dollars a barrel, was approved in
mid-April. It forecasts a deficit of 5.6 billion dollars, the
highest deficit since the 1991 Gulf War and 41 percent higher than
the 1997-98 budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet meeting was devoted to an assessment of the
country's financial and economic situation, Al-Roudhan said,
adding that the proposed measures seek to improve revenues and
rationalize spending.
</P>
<P>
The measures also aim to improve the efficiency of managing of
public funds especially by stopping unnecessary spending, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the cabinet "blessed the proposals in the memo and
asked the economic committee to suggest methods for
implementation."

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao On China's Economic Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao said Monday that an economically developed and prosperous
world needs China while China could not grow and flourish without
the world.
</P>
<P>
Hu made this remark when addressing South Korean business
leaders here on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
In face of the tremendous economic pressure and challenges
produced by the financial crisis in some Asian nations, China has
announced in a responsible manner that it will not devalue its
currency and has provided funds to those countries within its
ability.
</P>
<P>
It is not easy for China, which is still a developing country,
to do so, but China's commitment is serious and based on facts, Hu
said.
</P>
<P>
Although affected by the financial turmoil late last year,
China still reached an economic growth rate of 8.8 percent and an
inflation rate of 0.8 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The good momentum of "high growth and low inflation" in economy
has laid a solid foundation for the stability of China's currency
exchange rate, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The steady growth of China's foreign currency reserves, the
rational structure of its foreign debt, most of which are
long-term ones, and the low cost of labor force, which makes
China's export still competitive, have all made it possible to
maintain the value of the Renminbi (China's currency), Hu noted.
</P>
<P>
China is pleased to see that the sign of economic recovery has
emerged in some crisis-affected Asian nations and China believes
that the crisis will be overcome soon with the efforts of those
countries as well as the international community, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Hu voiced the belief that Asia will return to the world
economic stage with its high speed of economic development in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
China has made a breakthrough in the past five years in
establishing a system of socialist market-oriented economy, Hu
said, adding that a structure for opening wider to the outside
world has taken shape.
</P>
<P>
Hu described China's main targets of economic development in
1998 as achieving an 8 percent economic growth rate, keeping
inflation rate below 3 percent and safeguarding the value of its
currency.
</P>
<P>
To reach the targets will not only serve China's stability and
development, but also is conducive to the stability and prosperity
in Asia, said Hu.
</P>
<P>
To this end, China has taken a series of steps, including the
unshakable implementation of reforms, especially the further
reform of state-run enterprises, financial system and government
structure, said the Chinese vice-president.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is the second leg of Hu's East Asia tour, which has
taken him to Japan.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Firms in Move to Fight Music Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- An initiative by a group of
Kenyan music companies may lead to the introduction of a more
effective system of protecting music dealers from piracy and
illegal imports.
</P>
<P>
The proposed measure, known as the Banderole system, is being
formulated by major record companies and the Value Added Tax
department and is expected to take effect before the end of this
year, the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
It requires music companies to submit information to all their
labels and franchises to the VAT department and carry a security
band around cassettes or CDs for identification.
</P>
<P>
The bands will be purchased from the VAT department at an
equivalent of 17 percent of the retail price of the CDs and
cassettes. This will effectively be an advance payment of VAT and
is also intended to ensure a more efficient collection of the
tax.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Federation of Producers of
Phonograms and Videograms, piracy controls at least 80 percent of
the Kenyan music market.
</P>
<P>
In February, supported by major international record
companies, Kenyan licenses of overseas producers took measures to
stop parallel importation of music products.
</P>
<P>
The information submitted to the VAT department under the
Banderole system will also be useful in resolving industry
disputes over rights ownership.
</P>
<P>
However, some producers feel that this added cost is an extra
financial burden on the record companies, which are suffering
from the effects of declining sales. But others see it as a
necessary cost in containing piracy.
</P>
<P>
AI Record's director John Andrews and Managing Director of
Music World Kenya Ltd John Njagi said the Banderole system may
not directly relate to copyright infringement but it would
deprive pirates of the price advantage which has fanned the
counterfeit trade in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, every music cassette, video or compact
disc will be required to have a VAT band.
</P>
<P>
The price of pirate audio cassettes and CDs is 100 Kenyan
Shillings (1.66 U.S. Dollars) and 700 Shillings (11.66 Dollars)
respectively, while legitimate cassettes retail at 200 Shillings
(3.33 Dollars) for cassettes and 1,300 (21.66 Dollars) for CDs.
</P>
<P>
The price of pirate music videos is 300 Shillings (five
Dollars), compared to 800 Shillings (13.33 Dollars) a piece for
legitimate ones.
</P>
<P>
The 17 percent value added tax will be charged uniformly on
all music carriers based on the price of legitimate cassettes and
compact discs. This is expected to force pirates to increase
their retail prices, but will not affect the price of legitimate
products, which are already VAT inclusive.
</P>
<P>
Njagi, however, said the new system needs governmental
commitment to succeed.

JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the United States
will reach an agreement soon on phasing out the U.S. civilian aid
and increasing military aid to Israel over the next decade, local

</P>
<P>
Neeman said that Israel is aiming to gradually end its
dependence on civilian aid over the next decade. While Israeli
defense sources said the country is looking for an annual 600

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen Special Economic
Zone will auction two lots, one residential and the other
commercial, covering a total of 50,818 sq.m. on May 20.
</P>
<P>
The auction will be city's first land auction in over five
years.
</P>
<P>
The two pieces of property are part of eight lots covering
229,900 square meters the city plans to auction by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, a special economic zone, and neighboring Hong Kong
pioneered the sale of land-use rights on December 1, 1987. Five
lots covering a total of 55,319 sq.m. were sold by May 1993.
</P>
<P>
Land sale came to an abrupt halt in the latter part of 1993
when China's property market entered a period of
readjustment. Shenzhen responded by accelerating legislation and
improving the management of real estate deals.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen adopted the Rules Governing Bids and Auctions of
Land-Use Rights on February 6 this year. The rules stipulate that
bidding and auction methods should be adopted for land sales.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that most of Shenzhen's total land supply of
10.4 million sq.m. is supplied through signing of agreement
between the government and user.

<HEADLINE> Huge Fund Planned for Human Genome Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China will spend 7 million yuan
(843,000 U.S. dollars) launching a human genome project in the
next four years to ensure that the country will be competitive in
the field of genetics in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The funding for the project, "Studies on Structure and Function
of the Chinese Human Genome," is the biggest among 16 major
research projects during the 1996-2000 period sponsored by the
National Natural Science Fund Committee (NNSFC).
</P>
<P>
Part of the funding will be used to support the collection
of genes of various Chinese ethnic groups and build a bank of
cells.
</P>
<P>
The genetic relations between different ethnic groups,
such as the genetic difference between people in south and north
China, and the origination and immigration of modern Chinese will
be studied under the project.
</P>
<P>
Money will also be spent on studies of genes related to the
major traits of Chinese people and some major genetic diseases.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the project is expected to help create and develop
new theories and techniques of the functional genome science in
China, which has 22 percent of the world's population and 56
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The Human Genome Project (HGP), the largest biological and
medical research project in the world, aims to interpret the
genetic codes of humans and help prevent and treat more than 6,000
genetic diseases. The United States began HGP research in 1990,
and planned to invest 3 billion U.S. dollars within 15 years.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, NNSFC started the first human genome project in China,
"Studies on Several Gene Loci Structure of the Chinese Human
Genome," with a total funding of 3.6 million yuan (450,000 US
dollars). It has involved 16 research institutes across the
country and produced significant results.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the State Science and Technology Commission launched
another project, "Studies on Genes Related to Major Diseases," and
planned to spend 13 million yuan building an HGP center in Beijing
and 20 million yuan for a center in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Most Lebanese Aids Women Infected from Their </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Ninety-nine percent of Lebanese
women suffering from Aids were infected through their husbands
who used to live abroad, Lebanese newspaper The Daily Star Monday
quoted a senior official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Addressing students at the Batroun high school on Sunday,
Reine Helou, head of the education department of the International
Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC), gave figures on human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Lebanon and stressed the
importance of individual efforts in preventing the spread of the
virus.
</P>
<P>
HIV, which can lead to Aids, was detected in Lebanon three
years ago after it was first identified in the United States in
1981.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of all registered cases in this country were
attributed to immigrants who had been living in west Africa,
Europe and the U.S., Helou said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 465 reported cases of people with HIV in Lebanon, whose
ages are between 25 and 45, 93 are now being treated in hospital
suffering from full-blown Aids.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen children were infected with the HIV virus while in
the womb, he added.
</P>
<P>
World-wide, almost 40 million people will be infected with the
virus by the year 2000, 90 percent of them from developing
countries, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Helou said that nine out of 10 infected people in Lebanon are
not aware of their condition.

<HEADLINE> Private Businesses Make Big Profits From Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Liu Deqing has a very small shop
in the Yabaolu Garment Market, downtown Beijing, too small to
accommodate five-to-six people in addition to rows of garments
hung on the walls.
</P>
<P>
However, this handicap doesn't prevent him from doing big
businesses. With just a telephone call, he can send thousands of
kilograms of garments by air to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The 400-meter-long Yabaolu Road, located near Beijing's embassy
compound, has more than 2,000 stalls along its two sides,
involving more than 4,000 peddlers like Liu.
</P>
<P>
These peddlers sell Chinese-made garments and toys. The road
has become the biggest outdoor market in the Chinese capital
involved in garment exports.
</P>
<P>
At present, the market's export volume stands at 1 billion
U.S. dollars, or 40 percent of Beijing's annual total.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, seven aircrafts carried more than 300 tons of garments
daily released from the Yabaolu Road to eastern European countries.
</P>
<P>
However, businesses here seem to keep expanding.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who has made a profit of 1 million yuan in the last 10
years, has asked his younger sister to work with him, providing
her with a mobile phone on the first day she worked.

<HEADLINE> Urban Population Outnumbers Rural in China's Agro-Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province has claimed to be the country's first big agro-province
where urban residents have outnumbered rural population.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that, at the end of 1997, the province had an
urban population of 20.22 million and rural of 17.29 million.
</P>
<P>
The rural population doubled that of the urban one in 1977. In
the last 20 years, the number of towns increased from 102 to 466
and small cities from two to 20.
</P>
<P>
Wu Hengju, associate researcher of the China Society for Study
of Urban Economy, believes the reform and opening-up drive has
given rise to the establishment of small cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural province has not encouraged farmers to seek
jobs in big cities, instead focusing on the development of small
cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
One example of this trend is Ma Dequan, 32, who was granted
residence in Zhoujia Town by a local public security agency last
month after he managed a store and built a house in the town near
his village in the eastern part of Heilongjiang.
</P>
<P>
He is among millions of farmers in the province who have given
up their "responsibility plots" and resettled in towns or small
cities. Most of them are engaged in commerce and the service
sector.
</P>
<P>
With the practice of a household contract responsibility system
since the 1980s, Heilongjiang's annual grain output has risen from
15 billion kilograms to 30 billion, and it ranks first in selling
commodity crops among China's provinces and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang also has the biggest number of large- and
medium-size tractors among other provinces.
</P>
<P>
Agronomists believe that the large amount of surplus farm
produce and surplus laborers brought out by agro-mechanization are
the basic conditions for the rapid growth of urbanization.
</P>
<P>
The urbanization drive also encouraged economic growth in new
cities. The average agricultural and industrial growth rate in
Zhaodong and Anda, two cities growing out of counties, are 8
percent higher than that of other cities in the region.

<HEADLINE> Purified Water Selling Well in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Purified water will become the
most popular drink in the Shanghai market this year, according to
a recent market survey.
</P>
<P>
Sales of purified water in Shanghai have increased at an annual
rate of 20 percent in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
Many institutions and enterprises have installed drinking water
dispensers in offices and factories. An increasing number of urban
residents said they prefer purified water to boiled water.
</P>
<P>
Purified water is expected to make up 40 percent of total sales
in the soft drink market this summer. Sales of colorless carbonic
drinks will account for a quarter of the local market, the survey
said.
</P>
<P>
Mineral water is expected to take a market share of 20 percent;
fruit or vegetable juice, 10 percent; and milk products, 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
This reflects a trend that more residents favor natural
products and indicates increased competition in the soft drink
market, said a municipal official.

<HEADLINE> U.N. NGOs Call for Establishment of Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Non-governmental Organizations
(NGOs) have called for the full implementation of the United
Nations resolution on setting up an independent Palestinian state
in May 1999, the Middle East News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The call was made in a final statement issued at the end of a
two-day U.N. International NGOs Conference on the Question of
Palestine concluded in Cairo Sunday. The gathering was the first
NGOs meeting convened in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
"We affirm that the question of Palestine is, fundamentally,
about the struggle for land, and the fulfillment of the
inalienable Palestinian right to a state with Jerusalem as its
capital," said the final statement.
</P>
<P>
The declaration of principles, signed by the Palestinians and
Israelis in September 1993, and most recently reaffirmed in
U.N. General Assembly, raised hope for stability and peace in the
region, the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said it is clear that the policies of the present
Israeli government have undermined any confidence and trust in the
current peace process.
</P>
<P>
The NGOs noted that the U.N. and the international community
have a "continuing and unfulfilled responsibility" for a just
resolution of the question of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
The two-day gathering included workshops on the way of
assuaging the economic and social suffering of the Palestinian
people under the Israeli policy.
</P>
<P>
The NGOs reiterated their commitment to a just and lasting
peace based on self-determination for the Palestinian people,
calling for international protection of the Palestinians' rights
prior to the full implementation of the U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
In support of this goal, the NGOs redeclared their recognition
of the state of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
"We look to 1999 as the year of the state of Palestine and will
work with our constituencies and the public to prepare them for
the declaration of the independent state by the Palestinian
Authority," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The participants urged additional NGO events to be held in the
region next year, particularly in Palestine.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks were stalled a year ago when
Israel began construction of the Jewish housing project on Har
Homa in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the capital
of their would-be state.
</P>
<P>
Frustrated over the lack of progress in the peace process,
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat and
Palestinian officials have recently repeated their determination
to declare an independent Palestinian state in 1999, regardless of
achieving a peace treaty with Israel or not.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Public support rate for Japanese
cabinet, led by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, has dropped to
28 percent, the lowest since it was set up in January 1996, a leading
Japanese newspaper poll showed.
</P>
<P>
The rate was eight percentage points lower than a previous poll
in March and the second lowest following the 26 percent approval
rating posted by former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's cabinet
in April 1993, according to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper poll.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-one percent of respondents disapproved of the Hashimoto's
cabinet, up four percentage points from the March survey and
exceeding 50 percent for the first time since its establishment.
</P>
<P>
Those who supported Hashimoto's resignation and the set-up of a new
cabinet totaled 57 percent, while only 22 percent favored the
cabinet's continuing, the poll showed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 43 percent said they disapproved of the government's
latest 16 trillion yen (about 123.1 billion U.S. dollars) economic
stimulus package to boost the stagnant economy, while 36 percent
said they supported the measures, the poll said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's economic situation has been worsening despite a series
of pump-priming measures were announced by the government.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,558 randomly selected voters, 1,068 responded to the
telephone survey conducted by the paper on Saturday and Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Naval Ships Start Visit to New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese naval
ships arrived here Monday morning to begin a four-day visit to New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The two vessels, the guided-missile destroyer "Qiangdao" and
the training ship "Shichang", were on a three-nation South
Pacific visit which also includes Australia and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
While sailing into the Queens Wharf here, "Qiangdao" fired a
21-gun salute to pay tribute to the New Zealand national flag.
The New Zealand Royal Navy did the same to pay tribute to the
Chinese National flag.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a welcome ceremony at the wharf, New Zealand
Maritime Commander Commodore Peter McCharfei said this is the
first time that a Chinese naval fleet has arrived in New Zealand
for a visit.
</P>
<P>
The visit itself underlines the growing friendship between New
Zealand and China, he stated, adding that he was very much
impressed by "Qiangdao" when he saw her entering the harbor.
</P>
<P>
Commissioned in 1996 and equipped with guided missiles and
helicopters, the 4,800-ton "Qiangdao" is one of the most advanced
vessels of the Chinese navy.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, leader of the visiting fleet Rear Admiral Han
Fangrun said the visit is aimed to increase the understanding,
exchanges and friendship between the militaries of China and New
Zealand, and to enable the militaries of the two countries to
learn from each other.
</P>
<P>
Waving the flags of China and New Zealand, hundreds of New
Zealand Chinese were also among those at the wharf to greet the
Chinese fleet. They toured the ships shortly after the vessels
docked at the wharf.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Slack demand for automobiles has
caused considerable losses to 14 foreign-invested manufactures in
Vietnam, auto investors said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months of this year, only 600 automobiles
from companies like Toyota, Daihatsu and Mazda have hit the
streets, the investors were quoted by the Vietnam News as saying.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that current prices for domestically-assembled
cars remain rather high compared with the average Vietnamese
income. Car makers failed to reduce prices to expand market demand.
</P>
<P>
At present, a Kia Pride sells for 13,000 U.S. dollars, a Daewoo
Cielo for 19,000 dollars, a Mazda 323 for 26,000 dollars and a
Toyota Corolla for 24,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said that Vietnam's auto sector is still in
its infancy. As a result, industrial development over the past few
years has not met the expectations of auto makers.
</P>
<P>
Only 6,000 vehicles were sold on Vietnam's auto market last
year, much lower than the 1996's figure.

DHAKA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has reduced the import
tariff to a minimum level, Commerce and Industries Minister Tofael
Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
Although it is one of the least developed countries, Bangladesh
has withdrawn not-tariff barriers and quantitative restrictions on
import, the minister told Secretary General Naeem U Hasan of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Sunday,

India informed Bangladesh that it had reduced import tariff on
more than 200 items and withdrawn restrictions on many items, but
Bangladesh has a very little scope to export those items, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Hasan, who was here to attend the first SAARC information
ministers' meeting ended Sunday, requested the minister to discuss
the issues in the coming SAARC commerce ministers' meeting to be
held in Islamabad, Pakistan, on Wednesday and Thursday.

<P>
SAARC countries have bright prospect to prosper through
joint-venture investment projects, he added.

<HEADLINE> University Students May Choose Their Own Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Students in a university in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province now are allowed to select their
own teachers instead of having classes totally arranged by the
school, according to today's Guangming Daily.
</P>
<P>
This change is one of the educational reforms in the Northwest
China Institute of Political Science and Law, which announces a
list of teachers and their resumes at the beginning of each term
to help students make their selections.
</P>
<P>
"I have decided on some lecturers in accordance with my
preferences and study habits," said Ning Guodong, a freshman in
the Department of Law. In China, class schedules used to be
arranged by schools and teachers designated by departments.
</P>
<P>
Professor Ge Hongyi, who taught jurisprudence, attracted more
than 250 students to his class last term, compared sharply with
another professor who only had 19 applicants.
</P>
<P>
According to the institute, if a teacher has less than 30
applicants, his classes will be canceled.
</P>
<P>
"I felt worried," said Professor Xu Junlun, who attracted 33
applicants last year. He later made efforts to improve his
teaching methods, enrich study contents and organize class
discussions.
</P>
<P>
Guo Jie, a director of the institute, said the reform has been
widely accelerated by students and the quality of teaching
improved when competitiveness was introduced among teachers.

<HEADLINE> 4 Israeli Soldiers Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Four Israeli soldiers were
wounded Monday morning in a roadside bomb blast by Lebanese
guerrillas in south Lebanon, Lebanese Voice of the People radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred at the Shahein Valley in the western
sector of the Israeli occupied south Lebanon when an armored
Israeli patrol was passing by, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Guerrilla sources claimed the responsibility for the bomb attack
at 3:05 a.m. (0005 GMT), saying it killed and wounded several
Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
They said some of its fighters also attacked Israeli posts at
the hilltop of Radar and Burat inside the so-called Israeli
security zone.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources in the country's southern coastal
city of Tyre, near the occupied zone, confirmed that after the
bomb explosion, fierce clashes between guerrillas and Israeli
occupying forces broke out in the area.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying an artillery bombardment, Israeli warplanes
swooped down upon the suspected guerrilla bases on the mountainous
areas between the village of Majda Zoun and Yaetir, just north of
the occupied zone, in retaliation for the guerrillas' attack, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the 1,200-square-kilometer self-styled security
zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting
its northern areas from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attack.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanese resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been engaged in a
guerrillas war trying to dislodge some 2,000 Israeli occupying
forces from the country.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Arrests Leading Ugandan Rebel in Bomb Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenya police last week arrested
a leading Ugandan dissident in connection with a series of bomb
explosions which rocked Kampala early this month.
</P>
<P>
Although top police officials were non-committal on the number
of Ugandan dissidents rounded up in the mid-week operation,
sources said the former National Resistance Movement captain was
being held at the Kilimani police station in Nairobi, the East
African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Peter Kimanthi told the East African that he
required more time to establish the facts of the matter.
</P>
<P>
Three other Ugandans locked up at central police station were
being held in connection with immigration inquiries.
</P>
<P>
Kampala was said to have sought Nairobi's assistance in
arresting dissidents following bombing incidents in the Ugandan
capital on April 4, in which five people died. Some of the
suspects were said to have fled to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
One of the dissidents sought by Kenyan police was identified
as a former chemistry lecturer at Makerere University who has
been a political refugee in Kenya since Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni took over power.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blasts came 10 days after U.S. President Bill Clinton
left Kampala during his landmark six-nation African tour. Ugandan
police said at the time that home-made bombs were assembled from
locally available materials such as water pipes, crop chemicals
and dry cells.
</P>
<P>
The total number of suspects so far arrested by Ugandan police
stands at eight.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Tombs Discovered in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Some 20 ancient tombs dating back
over 900 years and a large cache of cultural relics were recently
discovered in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists believed the tombs date to the Western Xia
(1038-1227) period when the region was inhabited by Dangxiang, an
ancient Chinese ethnic group in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The tombs, located in southern Inner Mongolia, consist of paved
pathways, gates and coffin chambers. The discovery included brick
gates, and murals depicting people, flowers and curtains
decorating the interior walls of tombs.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 relics, including pottery, porcelain and
stone implements, were also unearthed.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists noted that the Western Xia period in northwest
China lasted more than 200 years, with indigenous people
developing their own language and culture. However, the rarity of
historical documents has led to continuing mystery concerning the
period, and the new finds are expected to greatly benefit research
related to the ancient kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Indian Scientist Forecasts Major Quake in Assam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake greater than
eight degree on the Richter Scale is possible in India's eastern
state of Assam at any time before the year 2010, said a renowned
Indian environmental scientist.
</P>
<P>
Studies on the earthquake of the region indicated that strain
is accumulating in some parts of the region, the Hindu daily on
Monday quoted S. K. Sarmah as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sarmah, a professor at the Department of Environment Science in
Gauhati University, Assam State, said three earthquake clusters
had appeared in the region and in one of these, an earthquake
occurred in 1988.
</P>
<P>
There was also "anomalous variation of compressional wave
velocity ratio with time in the region" and the number of small
magnitude earthquakes was increasing while that of larger
magnitude ones decreasing, he added.
</P>
<P>
"These facts can be explained on the basis of dilatancy model
of earthquake occurrence," he asserted, adding that they tended to
indicate the probability of occurrence of a high magnitude
earthquake in the Western part of the North-East at any time in
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
"Any delay in the occurrence of the earthquake will only
increase its magnitude," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake of magnitude greater than eight could destroy
houses, buildings and other structures which were not built with
proper design and in standard areas.
</P>
<P>
The region west of 90 degrees longitude in the North-East of
India is regarded as a high-seismic potential region.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's construction industry
is collapsing because of the suspension of housing schemes and
the failure by building societies to release mortgage funds for
home-seekers, The Herald Daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Over 72,000 jobs have been lost in the construction industry
over the past two years as the industry begins to feel the harsh
economic conditions in the country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview at the weekend, Chairman of the Zimbabwe
Building Contractors' Association Obert Sibanda said most
contractors depended on building houses and would fold up unless
the situation changed.
</P>
<P>
He said there were over 100,000 workers in the industry in
1996 but by late 1997, the figure had been reduced to less than
28,000 due to retrenchments.
</P>
<P>
"The future of the industry is very bleak. Many contractors
have folded while others are struggling to survive. If the
situation does not change soon more contractors will be forced to
fold," Sibanda said.

<HEADLINE> Base for Fluorine Replacement Under Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Construction of China's largest
production base for R-134a, a replacement for fluorine refrigerant,
commenced recently at the Jinghe Industrial Park in Xi'an, capital
of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The project will be carried out at an estimated cost of 210
million yuan, with first phase scheduled for completion in
December this year. The 200 ton designed annual production
capacity for the first phase will rise to 10,000 tons upon
completion of the second phase project in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The base will end China's total dependence on imported R-134a
and will strike a balance between total supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, China committed itself to reducing the production and
consumption of fluorine refrigerant, in a bid to reduce emissions
of fluorine products which contribute to the greenhouse
effect. Efforts have since centered on replacing fluorine
refrigerant with R-134a, a harmless and non-poisonous refrigerant
imported from abroad. The development of China's own R-134a passed
technological assessments in January 1996.

<P>
COLOMBO, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka government planned
to set up a number of lodging houses in Colombo for visitors from
the northern and eastern parts of the country, sources from the
Ministry of Social Services said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will be in charge of the project, said the
sources, adding that there are 5,000 to 7,500 persons who come to
Colombo from the northern and eastern parts of the country each
month for treatment, visiting relatives, foreign travel,
employment and education.

<HEADLINE> Dalian Tackles Salt Water Intrusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- This coastal city in northeast
China's Liaoning Province is drawing up a plan to solve the
problem of salt water leeching into underground water tables.
</P>
<P>
Resulting from overuse of underground water, ten places,
covering 220 sq km, in the city suffer from salt water
intrusion.
</P>
<P>
In some places wells have had to be closed because of
increasing salinization of underground water.
</P>
<P>
Experts have noted that the density of wells in the city is too
high, at six to seven per sq km.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, the local government invested three
billion yuan in pumping water to the city from the Biliu River 150
km away.
</P>
<P>
Completed last year, the project has raised the city's water
supply to 1.2 million tons per day from 1994's 800,000 tons and is
expected to provide enough water for the city in the next century.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the city has adopted a series of water-saving
measures such as limiting the scale of urban construction, and
issuing permits for the use of water.

<HEADLINE> Manila, World Bank Set Talks for Banking Reform Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is pushing for more
stringent banking reform as part of the conditions for the
granting of a 300-million-U.S.-dollar bank sector adjustment loan
to the Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
A World Bank mission will arrive here on Wednesday for fresh
negotiations with the Central Bank of the Philippines to thresh
out issues blocking the release of the loan, local newspaper
Manila Standard reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted sources privy to the talks said among the
new measures being pushed by the World Bank were amendments to the
Bank Secrecy Law and a reserve requirement on foreign currency
deposits (FCDs).
</P>
<P>
The international financial institution wants to amend the law,
which prevents authorities from prying open bank accounts unless
it's in connection with a court case, to limit the ability of
erring banks to hide questionable transactions.
</P>
<P>
Fearing the amendment to the secrecy law will open the door to
possible abuse by regulators and other government authorities,
Central Bank Governor Singson Gabriel Singson has objected to the
revision of the law, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The planned World Bank loan is expected to further boost the
central bank's international reserves which are vital for a stable
Philippine peso.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Eyes Stricter Anti-dumping Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Tariff Commission
has proposed to introduce various changes in trade measures in
view of the expected heavy dumping by other currency
crisis-affected economies, local newspaper the Business Daily said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tariff Commissioner Emmanuel Velasco was quoted as saying there
was a need to put in place stricter trade measures that will
protect local firms from being put at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
Because of the economic crisis in Asia, Velasco said the
possible heavy influx of cheap imported commodities from countries
with excess capacities like South Korea and Thailand could pose a
big threat to local manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The proposals raised by the Tariff Commission include the
passage of Export Valuation System, which facilitates the change
in the basis of dutiable value of imported articles from home
consumption value to transaction value.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, the Bureau of Customs can adjust the export
price of an imported commodity to a higher level and use this as
basis in computing for the import duties.
</P>
<P>
Velasco said that there was also a need for industry groups to
prepare domestic price and export price profiles of selected
commodities prior to the regional crisis so that government can
compare it with the current prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
unearthered the ruins of a plank road, salt warehouse and ferry
crossing over 1,100 years ago along the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the discoveries will offer a full view of water
transportation in ancient China.
</P>
<P>
The ancient plank road found Xin'an County, central China's
Henan Province, provided east-west for a 4,000 meter stretch on
both sides of a 36-km section of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
"Traces of ancient boat trackers and towropes are readily
discernible." according to the archeologists, who have also
concluded that the water level of the Yellow River some 10
meters lower than that some 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen-odd inscriptions penned by ancient scholars were found
on rocks alongside the plank road. The inscriptions mainly
recorded the status of water transportation during the Tang
Dynasty (618-907).
</P>
<P>
The discovery of salt warehouses some 12 km west of the
Xiaolongdi Reservoir reveals that the Yellow River was an
important channel for salt transportation in ancient China.
</P>
<P>
Four ferry crossings were discovered in nearby valleys,
including some which are still in use today.

<HEADLINE> China's Property Price Index Recovers in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China's real estate price index
recovered in the first quarter of this year, with the price index
in 16 major cities picking up by varying degrees except in Hong
Kong and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
According to a report compiled by the China Real Estate Index
System, the price index in Hong Kong and Shanghai in the first
quarter were 6,059 points and 809 points respectively, down 1,338
points and 16 points from the fourth quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's real estate price index dropped since October last
year as a result of the impact of the Asian financial crisis. It
is expected to be stable in the coming months because the local
government has taken a series of measures to stabilize the real
estate price.
</P>
<P>
The country's real estate situation took a favorable turn in
the first quarter, along with the clarification of associated
policies and measures, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Real estate investment in the first quarter increased by 9.2
percent compared with the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
The total floor space of commercial housing sold in the first
quarter increased by 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's housing market was extremely favorable as a result of
the high purchasing power of work units. The high purchasing power
resulted in a short supply of housing in the city center and a
rise in prices, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Beginning To Celebrate Birthdays (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- On his birthday earlier this year,
Dandzim was being given white hadas, the ceremonial silk scarfs
used to show respect among Tibetans, by his son and daughter, and
just sat there with his mouth wide open while someone gave him a
piece of cake and the grandchildren began to sing "Happy birthday".
</P>
<P>
The 80-year-old Tibetan, who worked for a serf-owner in
childhood, explained that people like him never celebrated their
birthdays and said, "I'm happy when my children celebrate my
birthday for me."
</P>
<P>
The Tibetans did not traditionally bear their date of birth in
mind and have only started to celebrate their birthdays recently
like people elsewhere. "My father only knows that he was born in
the Year of the Ram," says Dainba Gyalcan, the old man's son, "and
he really doesn't know the exact date of his birth."
</P>
<P>
"He has been a hardworking man all his life, and it is our duty
to show filial piety to him," the son, who is a middle school
teacher, continues and then explains, "We have all agreed that we
celebrate his birthday on the first day of the Tibetan lunar new
year."
</P>
<P>
As more Tibetan women give birth in hospitals and the permanent
residence registration system expands, birthday celebrations have
become increasingly popular among Tibetans and the younger
generation pay more attention to their birthdays, and parents buy
cakes and gifts.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Begin to Celebrate Birthdays (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"March 25 is the busiest day for us because we have to
prepare a cake and gifts and have to invite relatives to the
birthday party," said Wangdui, a 35-year-old medical worker, "we
just want my child to know that he is one year older, and all
friends and relatives have hopes for him."
</P>
<P>
As a result of this growth in birthday celebrations, there are
more cake shops in Lhasa, Tibet's capital.
</P>
<P>
Xu Geping, a baker who began his business in 1985, says that
since the 1990s, there has been an increasing number of people,
mostly Tibetans, buying cakes in his shop, and each day, at least
a dozen cakes are ordered.
</P>
<P>
And, he says, "The people of Lhasa are particular about the
taste of the cake," so he recently got more modern equipment from
Shanghai and other materials from overseas to make better cakes.
</P>
<P>
Banjue, of the Tibetan Academy of Social Sciences, says that
the popularity of birthday celebrations among Tibetans shows that
Tibetans are good at absorbing cultural traits from other people,
and, "It also means that the Tibetan people have a more positive
attitude towards life."

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Canadian PM to Promote Cuban Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien left here Sunday for a landmark visit to Cuba, the first
by a Canadian prime minister in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day trip, Chretien is expected to discuss with
his Cuban host President Fidel Castro issues such as trade,
investment and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Some bilateral agreements will also be signed to encourage
exchanges of medical personnel, audio-visual products and sports
teams.
</P>
<P>
But the most important thing about the trip is not what
Chretien is doing there, but the fact that he's there at all,
analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Chretien's visit will demonstrate to the world that Canada
pursues a foreign policy independent of the United States,
according to the analysts.
</P>
<P>
Canada has long maintained a policy of "constructive
engagement" with Cuba, which is in sharp contrast to the U.S.
policy of isolation in the past 36 years.
</P>
<P>
It took the lead in fighting against the 1996 U.S. Helms-Burton
law, which seeks to tighten its embargo on Cuba by penalizing
foreign companies that invest or do business there.
</P>
<P>
"Isolation leads nowhere," Chretien said, days before the visit
that has been rescheduled to last from April 26 to 28 due to
domestic issues.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the best way to promote our values is through
dialogue, not isolation," noted Chretien, who is the first
Canadian prime minister to visit Cuba since his predecessor Pierre
Trudeau made a trip in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Though Chretien's visit caused sharp words from Washington, it
has met welcome from most of the rest of the Western Hemisphere
since it was leaked at last week's summit of Americas in Santiago,
Chile.
</P>
<P>
"There is quited a strong push on in the entire hemisphere for
a different approach to Cuba, including them in the inter-American
system," said a senior Canadian official.
</P>
<P>
The analysts believed that Chretien's visit will also be a plus
in promoting Canadian-Cuban economic and political relations.
</P>
<P>
Despite the U.S. embargo, trade and investment cooperation
between Canada and Cuba has grown quickly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Canada stands now as Cuba's third largest trading partner, with
two-way trade reaching 712 million dollars (500 million USD) last
year.
</P>
<P>
Canada also has the largest foreign investment projects in Cuba.
The new terminal at Havana's international airport that Chretien
will inaugurate has been built with Canadian financing.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral political dialogues have been active and on the rise.
Last year, the two countries signed a joint declaration, which
identified 14 areas in which the two countries agreed to work
together.
</P>
<P>
Chretien and Castro are expected to review progress in these
areas during their meetings, the Canadian official said.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Police Chief for Nuclear Safety Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain's police chief for nuclear
safety resigned after a disagreement over policing levels at
Dounreay plant, a government spokeswoman said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman for the Department of Trade and Industry said
Anthony Pointer, chief constable for the United Kingdom Atomic
Energy Authority (UKAEA), stepped down after the government
decided to accept four kg of nuclear waste from Georgia and stored
the material at the Dounreay plant in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Pointer had privately warned that British nuclear plants,
including Dounreay, were open to attacks by terrorists and
environmental activists because of staff shortages.
</P>
<P>
The police chief complained that the UKAEA police force should
have 470 officers policing the installations but now had fewer
than 400.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said the UKAEA had agreed to meet the cost of
six extra security staff after Pointer was still determined to
leave the office.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear shipment from Georgia arrived on Friday and will be
reprocessed at Dounreay under a deal between the United States,
Britain and Georgia aimed at preventing it from falling into the
hands of rebels opposed to the Georgian government.

<HEADLINE> Kiriyenko: New Russian Government to be Shaped by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian new prime minister Sergei
Kiriyenko Sunday promised that a new Russian government is to be
shaped by April 29.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Russian television show Zerkalo the
newly-appointed premier said he will submit proposal on the
Cabinet structure and a number of ministerial appointments to the
President on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the submission Kiriyenko would exchange views with the
leaders of State Duma factions on the Cabinet selections on
Monday, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, he intends to ask the president for more time
to choose worthy candidates for the new Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The new premier plans to invite parliament deputies to work for
the government and there will be several candidates to each post.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko predicted that many politicians and economists might
be dissatisfied with government staff selection. But, he said, "I
am ready for that" after announcing government appointments he
might come under "attack" and fall victim to "provocations".
</P>
<P>
He also noted that all power branches can work on the economic
situation in Russia calmly and without emotions, since the
political instability ended.
</P>
<P>
"The main fundamental principle is to learn living within
means. Our spending should correspond to our revenues. We are
working to increase the revenues and make the spending more
efficient," Kiriyenko said.

<HEADLINE> Justice Department Releases Study of Jail Inmates' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half the female inmates
and 13 percent of jailed men in the United States have been abused
sexually or physically at least once in their lives, according to
a study of the local jail inmates released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
More than a quarter of the women -- 27 percent -- and three
percent of men said the abuse included rape. Large numbers of the
inmates grew up in single-parent homes, were children of dissolute
parents or spent at least part of their childhood in homes on
welfare or in public housing. More than a third of them said they
were unemployed before their most recent arrest.
</P>
<P>
The study by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice
Statistics tells stories of broken lives and is expected to give
clues to why more than half a million people ran afoul of local
authorities last year.
</P>
<P>
"The tragedy is that people who have been victimized often
become victimizers themselves," said Eric E. Sterling, president
of the Washington-based Criminal Justice Policy Foundation. "It's
a cycle we could break, but it involves some expense. As a
society, we haven't put our resources there."
</P>
<P>
Another expert, Raymond Bell of Pennsylvania's Lehigh
University, who has directed two other national studies for the
Justice Department, said, "One of the things coming out in the
juvenile courts is more and more boys are reporting sexual abuse
and incest in ways that 10 years ago they weren't."
</P>
<P>
In the latest study, the bureau said 20 percent of inmates were
seeking work, 16 percent were not looking, and "almost half
reported income of less than 600 dollars a month during the month
before their arrest."
</P>
<P>
Sterling said misbehaving children simply have fewer
opportunities for help in poor families.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty often means that kids in trouble are not able to get
therapy or counseling," he said. "Not to blame their parents, but
there is a lack of resources and a social indifference to the
problems of poor kids."
</P>
<P>
By mid-year 1997, 567,079 inmates were lodged in the nation's
3,328 local jails, up 43 percent from 395,554 in mid-1989. Unlike
prisons, jails are run by local governments. They hold convicts
awaiting sentencing and people serving sentences of a year or
less.
</P>
<P>
The report's findings were extrapolated from a survey of more
than 6,000 randomly selected inmates from 431 jails.
</P>
<P>
The study shows minorities comprise a disproportionate share of
inmates.
</P>
<P>
About half the nation's inmates grew up in single-family homes,
and 12 percent had lived in households without either parent, the
bureau said. Nearly one-third said their parents or guardians
abused alcohol and drugs.
</P>
<P>
Almost half said a relative had spent time in jail or prison,
and close to 39 percent spent some part of their childhood in
households that had received welfare or public housing assistance,
bureau said.
</P>
<P>
More than half of convicted jail inmates reported having used
illegal drugs in the month before their crimes, up from the 44
percent estimated when the last such survey was conducted in 1989,
justice officials said. Sixty percent were using drugs, alcohol or
both at the time of their offenses.
