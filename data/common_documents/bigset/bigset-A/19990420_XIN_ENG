<HEADLINE> FAO Says Millennium Bug Threatens World Farm Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Year 2000 (Y2K)
problem threatens agricultural production and food supply systems
worldwide, a release from the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The Millennium Bug could prove one of the most dangerous pests
threatening farmers, along with the locusts and brown planthoppers
they have battled with throughout the centuries," FAO said.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem is caused by using double-digit years, assuming
the first two digits to be always 19. When January 1, 2000
arrives, that assumption will no longer be correct and many
computers and embedded chips will read 00 as 1900 instead of the
year 2000. The problem could throw computers around the world into
chaos at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
According to the FAO, the computer-dependency of agriculture
and food supply systems has received very little attention. "In
one way or another, Year 2000 computer problems threaten all of
the supplies and services essential for agricultural production."
</P>
<P>
"Even small farmers who till their fields with ox-drawn ploughs
probably rely on supplies produced in high-tech factories and
transported thousands of kilometers over computer-controlled
transportation networks," said the FAO.
</P>
<P>
On the production side, basic inputs like seeds and fertilizers
may be vulnerable, including irrigation water and electricity, and
harvested crops could also be hit by severe problems in
processing, marketing and distribution systems that are crucial to
food security, the FAO warned.
</P>
<P>
Countries that depend heavily on exports of agricultural
commodities as a major source of income and countries that rely on
food imports and food aid to feed their people are especially
threatened by year 2000 problems, according to the FAO.
</P>
<P>
Farmers, traders and government ministries rely on
telecommunications systems to deliver a steady flow of information
on weather, prices and shipping, and in many countries,
computerized telephone switching systems are considered among the
most likely to fail, the FAO said.
</P>
<P>
"Farmers and governments in developing countries may not be
able to remedy or avoid some Year 2000 problems, particularly
those that may erupt in international financial, production and
transportation systems. In many cases, their most realistic
approach may be to concentrate limited time and resources
available on developing and implementing contingency plans to cope
with failures that countries do not have the means to prevent,"
the FAO added.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Develop Small Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government is
making efforts geared toward the development of small private
enterprises, an official from the Ministry of Trade and Industry
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government has formulated and adopted a national
strategy for promoting the development of small enterprises, which
lays out a systematic approach to the development of the sector,
said Jemil Mohammed, the official with the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The government has also mobilized the assistance of its
development partners to enhance the development of small
enterprises, the Ethiopian News Agency quoted Mohammed as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the governments of Ethiopia and Germany
have launched the Ethio-German small enterprises development
program to improve the performance of the existing enterprises and
create new ones.
</P>
<P>
Some regional administrations are also in the process of
providing the necessary legal framework for the establishment of
regional small enterprises development agencies, he added.
</P>
<P>
There are currently about 600,000 handicraftsmen and small
private enterprises which provide over 700,000 jobs in the Horn of
Africa country.

<HEADLINE> NATO Says It May Have Killed Convoy Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) formally acknowledged Monday that it may have
killed civilians in attacks last Wednesday on two convoys
traveling between Prizren and Djakovica in Kosovo, but declined
to give the number.
</P>
<P>
A NATO air force commander, Brig. Gen. Dan Leaf, told reporters
at NATO headquarters that there is the possibility that
civilian-type vehicles were struck and "there may have been
civilian personnel harmed." But he said NATO "can't determine that
clearly."
</P>
<P>
However, a NATO civilian spokesman, Jamie Shea, confirmed here
at a daily news briefing last Thursday that a NATO aircraft caused
civilian damage after bombing a convoy in Kosovo. "The NATO bomb
destroyed the lead vehicle which we now believe to have been a
civilian vehicle," he said while acknowledging an incident at a
site near Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
But journalists here challenged NATO spokesmen about the
bombing sites and casualty figures during mid-afternoon daily news
briefings these days.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav authorities reported about 80 people died from the
April 14 attacks in Kosovo, while Western journalists were also
trying to identify the exact details about the civilian tragedy.
</P>
<P>
One of the attacks was the subject of graphic Serb television
film showing blown-up tractors and the bodies of ethnic Albanians
on a road in Kosovo. Gen. Leaf said that reporters taken by
Yugoslav officials to the scene saw about 20 casualties. "I cannot
explain the bodies shown on Serb TV," the U.S. commander from
NATO's Aviano base in Italy said.
</P>
<P>
During about the one-hour briefing, Leaf gave reporters a
detailed account of NATO attacks on two convoys near Djakovica
over a two-hour period on April 14.

<HEADLINE> China Favors Political Solution to Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China Monday said that it
favors a political solution to the question of Kosovo, a Serbian
province, and opposes imposing any solution on the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY).
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, as he was speaking to
reporters here after a closed-door Security Council session on the
current situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply concerned over the deterioration of the
situation in the Balkan region caused by the continued NATO
military strikes against the FRY," Qin said. "We are in favor of a
political solution of the question of Kosovo, the FRY."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador also called for an immediate end to the
ongoing NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Qin's statement came as several countries had put forward
several proposals on how to solve the question of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that any political solution should be based on two
principles, namely faithful respect for and maintenance of the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the FRY, and protection
of the legitimate rights of all ethnic groups in Kosovo, the FRY,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, it is very important to seek the consent of
the government of the FRY when any plan is to be discussed," he
said. "We are against imposing any solution on the FRY. As for
now, it is a matter of priority for NATO to cease immediately its
military action against the FRY."
</P>
<P>
NATO entered its fourth week in bombing Yugoslavia, a sovereign
and independent member of the U.N. family and creating a large
exodus of refugees and a serious humanitarian crisis in the
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
NATO, without the authorization of the U.N. Security Council,
began the air strikes on March 24, violating the U.N. Charter and
international law. Many peace-loving countries have called for an
immediate end to NATO's illegal military action.

<HEADLINE> General Motors, Toyota To Jointly Develop Fuel-Cell Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 19 (Xinhua) -- General Motors Corp. and
Toyota Motor Corp. said Monday they have reached a five-year
agreement to jointly develop cars powered by fuel cells and other
non-traditional fuel technologies.
</P>
<P>
A report from General Motors Corp. said the new venture will
involve research and development of electric, hybrid electric and
fuel-cell technology.
</P>
<P>
Experts say fuel cells produce electricity using a chemical
reaction between hydrogen and oxygen and produce little or no
emissions, and the technology was developed for use in spacecraft,
but problems in supplying and storing hydrogen have hampered plans
to use it for cars.
</P>
<P>
The hybrid electric vehicles, they said, typically combine an
electric motor with other power systems. So far, fuel cells remain
prohibitively expensive, they added.
</P>
<P>
"Pooling our efforts should result in commercially viable and
advanced technologies faster and at a lower cost to our customers,
and as breakthroughs are reached, suppliers will be able to count
on the volume of production from two of the world's largest
automakers," GM Vice Chairman Harry Pearce said in a Detroit news
conference.
</P>
<P>
GM, the world's largest automaker, was the first to mass-market
an electric car, the EV1, which has failed to catch on in the
markets where it is being leased. Toyota, the world's third
largest, brought the first hybrid electric car to market, the
Prius, in Japan two years ago.
</P>
<P>
GM and Toyota have worked together on projects before, the most
recent of which was an agreement in June 1998 to develop and
improve the electric vehicle inductive charging system.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Reiterates Bigger Role of Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior Kuwaiti official
reiterated Monday the need to expand the role of the private
sector in the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Promoting privatization is necessary to increase non-oil
revenues, create jobs for nationals, enhance efficiency of
national manpower and widen participation in obtaining new
technology, Oil Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah said during
the foundation laying ceremony of the Kuwait Catalyst Company.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kuwaiti government has exerted much of its efforts
over the past few years in planning for a most effective future
economic path and taking into consideration the importance of
activating the role of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
"The new century we are approaching is bringing along with it
numerous opportunities, the opening of countries and the
integration of their economies into one market, in which the
private sector is playing a very important role while the
government is increasingly shifting its role to supervisory and
regulatory function," Saud added.
</P>
<P>
In face of the sagging oil prices which heavily reduced its
state revenues, Kuwait has been attaching great importance to
boosting the role of the private sector, which at present
involves mainly in the service industry.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti government is also considering to privatize some
of its properties, including affiliates of the state-owned
petroleum corporation.
</P>
<P>
Related government ministries have implemented a number of
measures designed to encourage more investment in private
sector.
</P>
<P>
Since the private sector, in which cheap foreign labor
accounts for more than 98 percent of the 600,000 employees, has
been reluctant to accept local workers, the government is urged to
introduce an effective mechanism for imposing decisions and
legislation of limiting the employment of skilled expatriates.

<HEADLINE> Agreement to Resolve DRC Crisis Signed in Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A regional summit held in Libya
on the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has
ended with a communique calling for an immediate cease-fire to
pave way for peaceful resolution to the eight-month conflict
there.
</P>
<P>
The summit , which started in Libya's northern town of Sirte
Saturday, was chaired by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and was
attended by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, DRC President
Laurent Kabila, Eritrean President Issaias Afewerki and Chadian
President Idriss Debie, a press release from the Ugandan
President's Office said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique signed by the regional leaders, they
stressed the need for security and integrity of the borders of all
the states concerned and agreed on the deployment of a neutral
African peace-keeping force in areas now under control of foreign
troops in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The summit condemned all acts of violence and mass murder and
affirmed the need to pursue the murderers and punish them.
</P>
<P>
On a peaceful settlement of the issue, the leaders agreed that
DRC government should encourage and pursue a policy of national
dialog involving all parties concerned in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
They held that as soon as a peaceful agreement is reached, all
foreign forces in the DRC should be withdrawn. They called for a
commitment to respecting the principle of non-interference in the
internal affairs of countries.
</P>
<P>
The war in the DRC erupted in early August last year. Kabila's
 government has military support from Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola
and Chad while the Tutsi rebels fighting to oust Kabila are
allegedly backed by Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The war has never ceased in spite of regional and international
efforts to bring the armed conflict to an end.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged war has exerted a heavy economic burden on all
the key players involved in the war.

<HEADLINE> N. Ireland Peace Talks to Resume Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
said here Monday the talks on Northern Ireland's peace process
were to resume early next week.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after leading politicians from the province met in
Downing Street, Ahern said there had been no breakthrough in
attempts to end the deadlock over arms.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Ahern met representatives
from the three main parties separately for five hours in total.
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely difficult, there is no hiding that fact. I
don't expect either side to lose all. Neither do I expect them to
ask each other to win all. I think they have to lose to get a
solution," Ahern told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Ahern said that despite the apparent lack of progress, the
dialogue would continue and not be "parked."
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that was agreed is that no one wants to park
the agreement. That means we have to keep up an intensive round of
(talks) trying to find a way through or around the obvious
impasse," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged both Sinn Fein and Unionists to give ground on
the decommissioning which has blocked the peace process for
several months.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Blair said that all the parties agreed there
was no question of sidelining the process. "There is a shared
determination to crack this," he said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Unionists insist the IRA hand over its arms before its
political wing Sinn Fein to join the local government.
</P>
<P>
But the IRA has made clear it will not hand over -- or
decommission -- its weapons as the precondition was not stipulated
in the peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Welcomes Annan's Efforts on Kosovo Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The president of the U.N.
Security Council, Alain Dejammet of France, Monday said that the
15-member Council welcomes the efforts by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on the solution of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Council also agreed that the world body should "play a
significant role" on Kosovo, a Serbian province, Dejammet said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, Dejammet said, "Members
of the Security Council confirmed that they welcomed the efforts
of the Secretary-General to the solution of the crisis."
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General expressed his conviction that the U.N.
should play a significant role. He called upon the members of the
Security Council to rebuild their unity on this issue. He declared
himself determined to continue his efforts and he confirmed his
intentions to appoint diplomatic envoys to the region," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Council members "agree with the conviction expressed by the
Secretary-General of the necessity for the U.N. to play a
significant role," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Security Council approved the intention of the
Secretary-General to appoint diplomatic envoys and they approved
his intentions to go himself soon to Germany and to Moscow," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after a closed-door Security Council meeting
on Kosovo, at which Annan briefed the Council members on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
During the briefing, Annan told the Security Council, "I
believe that there is broad consensus that the United Nations
should play a significant role in the search for a diplomatic
solution aimed at ensuring lasting peace and stability in the
region."
</P>
<P>
Martin Griffiths, deputy to the Under-Secretary-General for
Humanitarian Affairs, also briefed the Security Council on the
humanitarian situation in and around Kosovo, a southern province
in the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the U.N. spokesman issued a statement, announcing that
Annan will pay a visit to Germany on April 26-28 and Russia on
April 29 to seek a diplomatic solution on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said last Friday that the
U.N. chief believes that "we are involved in a difficult,
dangerous and intractable situation," and "we are only at the
beginning stage of our search for a diplomatic solution."
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, Annan, who just returned from his
Europe tour, made wide contacts either by face-to-face meetings
with representatives of the five permanent members of the Security
Council or telephone talks with leaders of several countries,
diplomatic sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council Monday urged the Afghan warring party the Taleban
to return to the negotiating table shortly.
</P>
<P>
The move came as the Security Council was briefed by Lakhsar
Brahimi, U.N. Special Envoy on Afghanistan, on the latest
developments in the country.
</P>
<P>
Expressing its concern at the military preparations carried out
by warring parties of the country, the Council reiterated that
there was no alternative to a peace settlement, on the basis of
the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The Council called on the parties to cooperate with the U.N. to
establish mechanisms to prevent the escalation of the fighting and
to undertake confidence-building measures.
</P>
<P>
The Council reiterated their demand that the Taleban fully
comply with their obligations to ensure the security of
international personnel returning to the country, which remained
an immutable prerequisite for resumption of U.N. full-fledged
activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Council expressed firm support for the efforts of the "Six
Plus Two" Group to facilitate the peace process in Afghanistan and
called upon them to continue preparation for the meeting of the
members of the Group in Tashkent, and to exert their influence
over the parties in the most effective manner.
</P>
<P>
The Taleban decided last week to cancel the talks to be held in
mid-April in Afghanistan, which is the continuation of the resumed
talks between the Taleban and the the northern-based alliance in
Ashgabat, Turkmenistan in March.

<P>
NEW YORK, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks tumbled
Monday with the Dow Jones industrial average soaring as high as
270 points in the morning but retreating in the afternoon. The
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index dived severely.
</P>
<P>
At 2:50 p.m. EST, the Dow was up 19.38 at 10,474.51 while the
Nasdaq was down 103.38 at 2,380.66.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Dow posted its fifth consecutive closing at
10,493.89 Friday due to investors' swing from technology stocks
into industrial stocks.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index closed the week at 2,484.04 from
Monday's record 2,598.81. The index jumped 39.6 percent in 1998
and saw continued upswing in January. After a setback in February
and March, it took a rapid recovery in the first week of April.
</P>
<P>
Investors' confidence in technology stocks was partly erased by
computer giant Compaq's recent announcement on its dismal earnings
projections as a result of low personal computer prices.
</P>
<P>
Among the Dow gainers were financial stocks Monday. The biggest
U.S. financial services company, Citigroup, reported a 12 percent
rise in its profits to 2.42 billion U.S. dollars in the first
quarter of 1999 from a year earlier.

<P>
KAMPALA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Monday urged scientists not to exclude anybody who may have any
intelligence about the HIV/AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to them to work together to overcome the problem in
a speech read for him by Minister of Presidency Ruhakana Rugunda
at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in Entebbe, 40
kilometers south of capital Kampala.
</P>
<P>
At the occasion marking 10 years of HIV/AIDS research
cooperation between the British Medical Research Council and the
Ugandan institute, Museveni hailed the joint venture output which
made Uganda one of the four privileged countries from the
developing world to have access to the anti- AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
The president in his written speech also called upon the
researchers at the institute to maintain a high profile research
so that AIDS may be further tamed and eventually eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Museveni attributed Uganda's success story in its fight against
the epidemic to the ruling National Resistance Movement's openness
which dramatically increased people's awareness of the dangers of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
With collective efforts by various groups and organizations,
incidence of HIV/AIDS in Uganda has dropped from over 30 percent
10 years ago to the present level of less than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has been regarded as one of the success stories in
checking the spread of the pandemic in the whole world.

Monday.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Aziz Salama told the Middle East News Agency that
Ismailia governorate is to offer facilities to the industrial
projects concluded during President Hosni Mubarak's recent visit
to the three Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak traveled to China, South Korea and Japan on April
5-13. During the visit, Egypt reached scores of agreements on
economic cooperation and establishment of joint ventures with the
three countries.
</P>
<P>
Salama said the planned technology valley will be developed on
an area of 6,720 hectares near the east bank of the Suez Canal.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises set up in the valley are required to produce
electronics, semi-conductors, wireless equipment and computer
software, he said, adding that 85 percent of the products are
export-oriented.
</P>
<P>
He expected high returns from the projects due to the valley's
advantageous geographical position, which is close to the
international waterway and the European and African markets.
</P>
<P>
Products of the valley will also enjoy facilities and
preferential advantages in the Arab and African markets under
agreements Egypt signed with Arab and African countries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has sealed with other Arab countries agreements on
economic and trade cooperation, including those on free trade
zones. The country became a member of the Common Market of Eastern
and Southern Africa in June 1998.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Urges U.N. to Force Israel to Withdraw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon Monday urged the
United Nations Security Council to force Israel to quit a village
it included last week in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Security Council, Lebanese U.N.
representative Samir Moubarak said Israel sent 50 men into the
village of Arnoun on April 15 in company with a tank, an armored
personnel carrier and a jeep.
</P>
<P>
"In a new attempt to include it into the occupied zone in the
south, they separated Arnoun from the liberated area and proceeded
to arrest residents and to prevent inhabitants from entering," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"In bringing this dangerous development to the attention of the
Secretary-General, the members of the Security Council and the
international community, the Lebanese government urged swift
action to put an end to a situation that constitutes a flagrant
violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the principles
of international law," Moubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Moubarak also urged implementation of a 1978 Security Council
resolution that called on Israel to withdraw from southern
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief to Visit Germany, Russia on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is scheduled to pay a visit to Germany and Russia on
Kosovo, a Serbian province, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Eckhard said, "the
Secretary-General will be making a long-planned official visit to
Germany from 26 to 28 April."
</P>
<P>
"After consulting with the Russian Government, he has extended
this trip by one day to visit Moscow on 29 April," the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after Annan Monday morning briefed a
closed-door Security Council session on Kosovo. He is expected to
appoint a special envoy on Kosovo, diplomatic sources here said,
but the name of the would-be envoy remains unknown at the moment.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General was not invited to attend the NATO
anniversary celebration in Washington," Eckhard said, referring to
the Washington summit marking the 50th anniversary of NATO on
April 23-25 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council convened the closed-door session on Kosovo
after several countries recently proposed solutions on how to
solve the question of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who said earlier "not directly involved in the Kosovo
crisis," is began a new round of diplomacy on Kosovo. The U.N.
chief, describing the current situation in Kosovo following the
ongoing NATO bombing as "difficult and dangerous," said last week
that one cannot expect "quick result," and "we are in the
beginning of the diplomatic meditation."
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to
the United Nations, told reporters after the Council meeting that
"we are in favor of a political solution of the question of
Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that any political solution should be based on two
principles, namely faithful respect for and maintenance of the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the FRY (Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia), and protection of the legitimate rights of all
ethnic groups in Kosovo, the FRY," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, it is very important to seek the consent of
the Government of the FRY when any plan is to be discussed," Qin
said. "We are against imposing any solution on the FRY. As for
now, it is a matter of priority for NATO to cease immediately its
military action against the FRY."
</P>
<P>
NATO, without the authorization of the Security Council,
unilaterally launched air strikes on Yugoslavia, a sovereign and
independent member of the U.N. family, violating the U.N. Charter
and international law.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing air attacks also created a large exodus of refugees
and a serious humanitarian crisis.

JOHANNESBURG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Botswana Monday
estimated a trade deficit of 30 million Pula (about 6.94 million
U.S. dollars) for the country in 1998, the first since 1982.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted the bank as saying that
the current account deficit in Botswana was about 375 million Pula
(about 86.8 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
In its February statistical bulletin, the bank attributes the
deficits largely to a sharp decline in diamond exports.
</P>
<P>
Its diamond share of major exports dropped to 88.6 percent from
91.1 percent. No figures were given for imports.

<HEADLINE> German Parliament Returns to Historic Reichstag Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 19 (xinhua) -- Nearly nine years after the
reunification of West and East Germany, the German parliament, the
Bundestag, Monday officially returned from Bonn to the historic
Reichstag building in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
On the flower-decorated steps of the building, German President
Roman Herzog, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder with his entire
cabinet, and ex-Chancellor Helmut Kohl attended the handover
ceremony, at which parliamentary spokesman Wolfgang Thierse
received keys to the Reichstag from the British architect Sir
Norman Foster.
</P>
<P>
Foster directed the reconstruction of the building 66 years
after it had been burnt by the Nazis and 54 years after it had
been destroyed in World War II.
</P>
<P>
The Reichstag, as the structure will continue to be called, was
designed by architect Paul Wallot, and was in 1894 inaugurated by
the then German Emperor Wilhelm II.
</P>
<P>
It had been the seat of the German parliament until 1933, when
the Nazis under Adolf Hitler seized the power. The parliament
played no role in the Nazi era.
</P>
<P>
Sixty years after Germany launched the second world war,
Monday's ceremony was featured with a statement by Schroeder, who
said Germany, by participating in the NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia, had begun taking responsibility for other nations with
alteration in generations of its leadership.
</P>
<P>
"To me, here is the right site and right time to draw the
interim balance of the united Germany," Schroeder said. "(It's)
the right site because that Berlin symbolizes the united
Germany,... the right time because the united Germany has
fulfilled its political alteration in generations."
</P>
<P>
There is no other country in the world than Germany, which has
not changed its policy significantly after the the generation who
experienced World War II withdrawing from the political stage,
Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
"The right time is also because, as the events has dramatically
run in the past weeks and months, Germany has changed its role in
the world. After years of being separated and standing behind the
affairs, we are now deferently and more intensively taking
responsibility for the fate of people in other countries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In its first direct campaign operation after World War II,
Germany has been taking part in the NATO air raids against
Yugoslavia from the very beginning in March.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Telekom, Telecom Italia Reached Merger Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- One of the world's largest
telecommunications groups valued at some 200 billion U.S. dollars
will be created after the German giant Deutsche Telekom merges
with Telecom Italia as they have agreed.
</P>
<P>
The two companies will announce details of the agreement at a
press conference in London Tuesday, the DPA news agency reported
Monday. Deutsche Telekom neither confirmed nor denied the
information.
</P>
<P>
The development follows days of intense speculation and reports
about their imminent merger to create a concern with a yearly
turnover of around 64 billion dollars and a work force of about
350,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Telekom just a week ago dismissed a Financial Times
report about the merger as "speculation," saying it would not
participate in such speculation.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, the German company while reporting
its first-quarter results also announced plans for a second
emission of shares which could generate as much as 12 billion
dollars in revenues.
</P>
<P>
The company said the share issue, to be effected by the summer,
would be used to bolster its finances and to help in making
acquisitions, a point which only further fueled the speculation
about its aims towards Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, German Finance Minister Hans Eichel and his
Italian counterpart, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, respectively gave their
blessing to the merger at an informal European Union finance
ministers meeting, and said they would not stand against it.
</P>
<P>
The two companies Sunday formally confirmed their talks, which
had been believed to involve the two sides' top executives, Ron
Sommer of Deutsche Telekom and Franco Bernabe of Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
The German business daily Handelsblatt reported earlier Monday
that the two companies were intending a merger after the model of
the mega-fusion last year between Daimler and Chrysler, whereby
the shares of both would be exchanged in lieu of a single new
share.
</P>
<P>
Amid the developments, France Telecom, one of Deutsche
Telekom's most important international partners, warned Monday
against the merger with Telecom Italia, saying it viewed such a
merger as incompatible with Deutsche Telekom's efforts towards a
"strategic turnaround."
</P>
<P>
The French and German companies are involved together with the
U.S. telephone company Sprint in a joint venture called Global
One, which has reportedly run into problems with
larger-than-anticipated losses.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Seek Emergency Funding for Kosovo Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Monday he would ask the U.S. Congress for emergency funds to
pay for NATO's Kosovo air campaign and for resolving the refugee
crisis resulting from the war.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a White House event, Clinton did not say how much
was being requested, but said he hoped Congress would approve it
"right away."
</P>
<P>
However, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said it would be
roughly 6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Congressional sources said they expected the request to include
5.45 billion U.S. dollars for the war and about 491 million U.S.
dollars for the refugee crisis.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the emergency spending would "ensure that we have
the resources to sustain the air campaign to ensure that we
achieve our goals while maintaining our high level of general
military readiness."
</P>
<P>
"The need for this funding is urgent, immediate, clearly in
the national interest," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"There are... lives hanging in the balance. And so I hope in a
spirit of genuine bipartisanship the Congress will move the
package right away."
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Clinton spoke with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin for 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Clinton and Yeltsin had spoken since
the start of the airstrikes, and the conversation came after
Yeltsin named a special envoy for the crisis last week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States is seeking NATO support for
cutting off seaborne shipments of oil into Yugoslavia to limit
President Slobodan Milosevic's ability to fight ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said only that NATO
was considering "a variety of things" that could loosen
Milosevic's grip on power.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that these are ideas that are worth pursuing, and
that's what's being discussed," he said.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Chief Commends Report on Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Executive Director of the United
Nations Environment Program (UNEP), Klaus Toepfer, Monday praised
a report of the World Commission on Forests and Sustainable
Development for mapping out a blueprint to solve the global forest
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The report entitled "Our Forests... Our Future" was released
Monday in Washington, the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The report offers a way out of the forest crisis because it
specifies reforms needed from abandoning subsidies and tax
incentives that provoke forest destruction to more openness in
timber allocation procedures and landscape planning," Toepfer said
in Nairobi, Kenya's capital.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer, who is also a member of the commission on forests,
noted the loss of millions of hectares of forest annually is
serious because of the ecological services forests provide in
terms of the hydrological cycle, soil conservation, biological
diversity and weather patterns.
</P>
<P>
After holding hearings on five continents, the commission on
forests released the report, saying that by changing the way
people manage forests, both development and forests can be
sustained.
</P>
<P>
Through the public hearings the commission has organized, the
report gives a warning to people who live in the forests, who make
a living from the forests, and to other people who have a stake in
the future of the forests.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, from Siberia to Haiti, the world's
forests are exploited far beyond their ability to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 75 percent of the tropical forests in west Africa have
been lost since 1950. Thailand lost a third of its forests in the
1980's.
</P>
<P>
Forests face an even shakier future with the global population
expected to grow by 50 percent in the first half of next century,
the report added.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Netherlands Hold Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Trade ministers of Egypt and the
Netherlands on Monday discussed here ways of promoting bilateral
ties in trade, economic cooperation and investment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Egyptian Minister of
Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili said the two sides dealt with means
of boosting Dutch participation in Egypt's national projects.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is carrying out a number of giant projects in Sinai and
the southern valley to channel Nile water to reclaim land from
desert. The country is seeking foreign cooperation in developing
an industrial park in the northwest of the Gulf of Suez.
</P>
<P>
Gowaili said that he explored with Anneck Van Dok, who arrived
in Cairo on Sunday, Netherlands' technological assistance to
Egypt's small and medium industries in a bid to raise their
production and export capability.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's small and medium enterprises, which account for 99.7
percent of the non-agricultural private businesses, provide 80
percent of the value produced annually by the private sector and
employ 75 percent of the country's non-agricultural labor force.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian minister said the two sides also tackled means of
shoring up Dutch investments in Egypt, which he said stand at 1.3
billion Egyptian pounds (over 380 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Several agreements will be signed between the two countries on
enhancing trade and preventing dual taxation, said Afifi Selim,
official of Egypt's Ministry of Trade and Supply.
</P>
<P>
A memo of understanding is to be sealed between the two sides,
under which the Netherlands will grant Egypt 5 million dollars for
conducting feasibility studies on infrastructure projects, Selim
said.

<HEADLINE> Vojvodina PM: NATO Attacks European Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NOVI SAD, Yugoslavia, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A ranking official
of the northern Yugoslav province of Vojvodina said Monday that
the NATO attack on a government building here represents an attack
on European culture.
</P>
<P>
The building, of the provincial executive council, was hit by a
NATO missile at 01:34 a.m. local time. The interior of the
building was badly damaged but nobody was injured.
</P>
<P>
Council President Bosko Perosevic said the building was daily
frequented by members of all the 26 ethnic groups living in the
province and its only function was to provide administrative
services.
</P>
<P>
Fragments of the missile could be seen lying on the corridor of
the fifth floor. One fragment bears the letters and Arabic
numerals of EB02138.
</P>
<P>
Below the window where the missile hit, a radiator made of cast
iron was broken into bits and pieces, shattering windows and
locked doors nearby.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said they heard five detonations and planes roaring
overhead.
</P>
<P>
"The building is one of the most prominent symbols of Novi Sad,
and a shot taken at this building is a shot into the very heart of
European culture, because of the place it has in European
architecture," Perosevic said.
</P>
<P>
"This should be a signal to Europeans to oppose the insane
bombardments of our country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Perosevic inaugurated a new waterworks
network which normalized the supply of about 40,000 inhabitants of
Novi Sad districts on the western bank of the Danube -- Sremska
Kamenica, Petrovaradin, Sremski Karlovci, and other places which
have been without drinking water since NATO destroyed the Varadin
Bridge and the Freedom Bridge which also served to connect water
pipelines.
</P>
<P>
"The entire job which requires three months under normal
circumstances has been completed in just 10 days, and this is a
good example how one should tackle any difficulty caused by the
brutal NATO aggression," Perosevic said.
</P>
<P>
On the northern side of destroyed the Varadin Bridge, a barge
operated by the army was providing free transport for the
residents to cross the Danube river.
</P>
<P>
Gordan, 16, said he had to spend about one hour more to travel
between the two parts of the city following the destruction of the
bridge.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he was worrying about his father, who is in the army
guarding another bridge in Beska, a city some 30 kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
According to Perosevic, seven of the province's bridges were
bombed by NATO and four were totally destroyed, blocking
navigation along the Danube river.
</P>
<P>
And Novi Sad, the provincial capital some 80 kilometers north
of Belgrade, has been under NATO attacks almost daily since March
24 except three nights, Perosevic said.

<HEADLINE> Angolan War Hinders Anti-Trypanosomiasis Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- War has seriously hindered the
Angolan government's efforts to wipe out trypanosomiasis, Deputy
Minister of Health Jose van Dunen said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Van Dunen said this at the re-opening ceremony of the
Trypanosomiasis Treatment Center in Viana City, 16 kilometers east
of capital Luanda.
</P>
<P>
The center, which can accommodate 42 patients, was reopened
with the help of the French government.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister noted that Angola is one of the countries
seriously affected by the disease, saying that nearly 30,000
people had reportedly infected with trypanosomiasis between 1975
and 1998.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the actual number must be much bigger than
this.
</P>
<P>
According to surveys conducted by some international health
organizations, half of the 10 million Angolans are threatened by
the disease.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan official pointed out that because of the civil war,
two research and treatment institutions in northern Uige Province,
one of the most seriously affected areas, had been forced to shut
down.
</P>
<P>
However, van Dunen pledged that his government will continue to
invest in the anti-trypanosomiasis drive, despite the renewed
civil war.
</P>
<P>
He also called upon donor countries and private institutions to
provide Angola with assistance so as to strengthen the efforts
made by the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
At the same function, French Ambassador to Angola Andre Cida
said that his government will provide 1.12 million U.S. dollars in
addition to the funds for re-opening the Viana center.
</P>
<P>
Trypanosomiasis is a special kind of tropical disease in
Africa. It can kill people. The disease is infected through
bites by tsetse flies. The symptom of the disease is that the
patients always feel sleepy.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic is prevalent in northern provinces of Zaire, Uige
and Kwanza-Norte and central Benguela Province in the southern
African country.

<P>
KATHMANDU, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Police are still investigating
into the bomb explosion which happened early Monday morning at the
office building of the government-owned Gorkhapatra daily but hurt
no body.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, which happened at two o'clock, damaged three
rooms of the paper's editorial section and left a hole at the end
of the bath room where the bomb was planted, Gyan Bahadur Rai
said. He is the acting editor-in-chief of The Rising Nepal, the
sister paper of the vernacular Gorkhapatra.
</P>
<P>
He said his English-language paper, which is also in the
building, was not affected.
</P>
<P>
The blast shattered window glasses of a nearby bank, he said,
adding that the property damaged was initially valued at 200,000
rupees (2,941 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Police suspect that the 10-kilogram bomb, possibly a time bomb,
could be planted by anti-social elements, Rai said.
</P>
<P>
Following the explosion, the worst in 20 years, the newspaper
is tightening security, he said.
</P>
<P>
Election to the House of Representatives is scheduled for May 3
and May 17.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Seek Urgent Action on Oceans, Overfishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- At least 60 percent of
world fisheries are either fully exploited or overfished, 58
percent of the world's coral reefs are threatened by human
activity, and more than half of the world's coastal areas are at
high or moderate risk of environmental degradation, a new U.N.
report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Commission on Sustainable Development, expected to
meet here on April 19-30, will focus this year on urgent action
needed to combat these problems. Environment ministers and other
top government officials will add their input at a high-level
segment on April 21-23.
</P>
<P>
The Commission, which follows up on the work of the 1992 Rio
Earth Summit, will build on debate generated by the 1998
International Year of the Ocean.
</P>
<P>
"This session is a real opportunity to take stock of the state
of the oceans," said Simon Upton, environment minister of New
Zealand and current chairman of the U.N. commission. "I am

<HEADLINE> Greek Equity Prices Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Greece's equity prices fell
sharply Monday due to the fears of a prolonged war in Kosovo and
its impact on the Greek economy.
</P>
<P>
The Athens Stock Exchange's general index fell 4.87 percent to
3,386.09 points while the FTSE/ASE 20 index dropped 5.29 percent
to 2,115.85 points.
</P>
<P>
Broadly, decliners led advancers by 241 to 45 with another 7
issues unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Banks led the market decline with a 5.56 percent, with
industrials and miscellaneous losing 3.39 percent and 5.52 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the decline to the failure in diplomatic
initiatives to end the Kosovo war and fears of an escalation of
the war with NATO's possible deployment of ground troops in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Economists warned that the Kosovo crisis could reduce Greece's
gross domestic growth from a budget target of 3.5 percent this
year to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
They also estimated that the Kosovo crisis could cost the Greek
economy about 300 billion drachmas (about 1 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian MPs to Vote on Granting NATO Access to Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The National Assembly of Bulgaria,
or parliament, will convene parliamentary members to vote on
whether to provide NATO access to Bulgarian airspace, President
Peter Stoyanov announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov made the announcement after consultations with
National Assembly Chairman Yordan Sokolov and Prime Minister Ivan
Kostov, following NATO's request on Saturday for access to
Bulgarian airspace to conduct operations in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The vote decision was approved by Stoyanov, Sokolov and Kostov.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after the consultations, Stoyanov said
Bulgaria's support for NATO actions is not intended to gain NATO
membership but is a way to choose peace.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria has already received security guarantees from NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana and will receive more security
guarantees during Kostov's visit to Brussels on Wednesday, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
The new guarantees will probably be in the form of a Bulgaria-
NATO agreement on complementing the Partnership for Peace
Agreement and safeguarding the country's territorial integrity "in
the best possible manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
Integration into the EU and NATO remains a key foreign policy
priority for Bulgaria, said National Assembly Chairman Sokolov.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria is not hostile to Yugoslavia and is not getting
involved in the Kosovo conflict, Kostov stressed.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the Rambouillet agreement would keep the
present borders of Yugoslavia, which would be good for Bulgaria,
he said.
</P>
<P>
A different solution would reshape the borders in the Balkans
which, he said, would destabilize the region.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Minister Relieved Over Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Oil Minister Saud
Nasser Al-Sabah said Monday he was relieved over the present oil
price hikes following the recent output cuts by the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
The prices are improving in the right and desirable direction,
Saud told Kuwait News Agency during the foundation laying ceremony
for a catalyst plant.
</P>
<P>
The average price of OPEC's basket of seven crudes reached
14.83 U.S. dollars per barrel last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that oil prices in the world market
would further climb up after the usual summer slump.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti official noted that the ascending oil prices is
proof that oil producing countries are committed to their pledged
cuts.
</P>
<P>
"We are closely watching the markets and waiting for reports by
month end that will show the degree of commitment to cuts in
exports by other countries," Saud said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, OPEC members agreed to slash production by 1.7
million barrels per day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, a Gulf emirate with a crude reserve of near 100
billion barrels, began on April 1 an output reduction of 140,000
bpd from its former level of 1.98 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
A number of non-OPEC oil producers also agreed to cut
productions by 400,000 bpd.

<HEADLINE> Study: Cigars, Pipes as Lethal as Cigarettes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Cigars and pipes are just as
lethal as cigarettes, the World Health Organization (WHO) said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cigars and pipes, long promoted by the tobacco industry as
status symbols or glamorous cousins of the humble cigarette, cause
cancer and kill just as cigarettes do, the WHO cited a new
European study by the International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC) as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The writing on the wall is clear: the time has come to apply
the same controls used for cigarettes to cigars and pipes," said
Dr Derek Yach, head of the WHO Tobacco Free Initiative.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the Lyon-based IARC study, Yach said that the study
is a message for "politicians, fashion models, movie stars and
sports people who glamorize and popularize cigars and pipes by
endorsing these products or smoking them in public."
</P>
<P>
The IARC conducted the study in seven centers in Germany, Italy
and Sweden. The three-country study included 5,621 men with lung
cancer who were compared to 7,255 men without lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
Cigar smokers were nine times more likely to develop lung
cancer than non-smokers, according to the study. Pipe-smokers ran
an almost eight-fold risk of getting lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
Lower rates of lung cancer among cigar and pipe smokers are
attributable to the fact that pipe and cigar smokers consume less
tobacco on average than cigarette smokers, and not because cigars
and pipe tobacco are less harmful, the study said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Prime Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit announced here Monday evening that he had submitted his
resignation to President Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit resigned after he learned the results of Sunday's local
and parliamentary elections in which his central-left Democratic
Left Party (DSP) took the lead.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that Demirel asked him to continue his minority
coalition government until the new, 57th government is formed.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit became the prime minister of the 56th government in
January after the government led by Mesut Yilmaz lost a
confidence vote in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Yilmaz government collapsed last November because of
corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit's DSP led the elections by winning 21.76 percent of over
37 million votes cast in the local and the 21st parliamentary
elections on Sunday. The DSP will gain 134 deputies in the
550-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit is expected to hold talks with other political party
leaders on the formation of a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister won more support from the people than
expected, partly as the result of the capture of Abdullah Ocalan,
leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in Kenya in
mid-February.
</P>
<P>
The DSP secured support from voters in big cities such as
Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. But it lost support in southeastern
Turkey where most Kurdish people are populated.
</P>
<P>
About 85 percent of the voters turned out in the elections
across Turkey and this was the first time in Turkey that the local
and parliamentary elections were held at the same date.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing National Movement Party (MHP) ranked second in
the elections by gaining 18.40 percent of the votes and will
occupy 129 seats in the parliament. This marked a surprising rise
of support among the voters.
</P>
<P>
The MHP won support from young people and from many who had
supported the pro-Islamic Virtue Party (FP), which has won only
15.14 percent of the votes and will have 109 deputies in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The FP had reportedly fought a battle for the number one spot
in Sunday's elections but apparently failed to sustain its glamour
during the last elections.
</P>
<P>
Due to the long discord between the central-right Motherland
Party (ANAP) led by former Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and the
central-right True Path Party (DYP) led by former Prime Minister
Tansu Ciller, the two parties got less support from the people by
winning only 13.57 percent and 12.82 percent of the votes
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The ANAP will have 86 deputies and the DYP 90 deputies in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Republican Peoples' Party (CHP) won 8.48 percent of the
votes and it can not enter into the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Under the Turkish election law, a political party should enter
into the parliament by winning at lest 10 percent of the votes in
general elections.
</P>
<P>
In the last general election in December 1995, the now-defunct
pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP), predecessor of the FP, took the
lead by winning 21.23 percent of the votes, followed by the ANAP
with 19.66 percent of the votes, the DYP with 19.20 percent, the
DSP with 14.65 percent and the CHP with 10.75 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A man claiming to be from the
extreme right-wing group Combat 18 told police Monday they were
responsible for the bomb attack in south London Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The call was made from a telephone box on Well Hall Road, south
London -- near where Stephen Lawrence was murdered in April 1993.
</P>
<P>
But Scotland Yard detectives say they were keeping an open mind
about the motive behind Saturday afternoon's attack which injured
48 people and have not ruled out the phone call being a hoax.
</P>
<P>
Police are still sifting through recordings from nearby
security cameras to see if the bomber was caught on video.
</P>
<P>
Of the 48 people injured in the blast, 14 are still in
hospital, with four giving doctors cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
Two men, being treated in King's College Hospital, may lose
their sight.
</P>
<P>
Detectives are still examining possible motives for the bomb
attack as they step up their hunt for the culprit.
</P>
<P>
The Brixton street where the bomb blasted remains cordoned off,
but police say it will be reopened as soon as the shops which line
both sides had been made secure. Many still have broken windows.

<P>
JAKARTA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
here Monday said the bomb blast in a mosque in Jakarta is an
attempt to stir up political instability to sabotage the June 7
polls.
</P>
<P>
"This is an attempt to create an inter-religious and ethnic
conflict," the president was quoted by Investment Minister Hamzah
Haz at the state palace as saying.
</P>
<P>
An explosion, believed to be a bomb blast, took place on the
ground floor of Istiqlal Mosque at 3:00 p.m. Monday, wounding
several persons and destroying rooms in front of the Indonesian
Ulemas Council office.
</P>
<P>
The president urged Muslims not to be swept up in religious
unrest following the bomb blast, Hamzah said.
</P>
<P>
"They want to create unrest. Tha action is no longer
provocation but brutal one," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that they want to create unrest and
instability, which will in turn lead to a war between Muslims and
non-Muslims," he added.
</P>
<P>
This is the second blast that hit the Indonesian capital within
five days.
</P>

A powerful bomb exploded and badly damaged a shop at Jakarta's
Hayam Wuruk Plaza shopping center last Thursday, injuring several

<HEADLINE> COMESA Members Urged to Export Finished Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has urged member states of
the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) to
increase the export volume of their finished products to enhance
economic growth and development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry, David Mpamba,
said in Lusaka Monday when opening the Fourth Meeting of COMESA
Trade and Customs Committee that the region had the capacity to
convert raw materials into finished goods for export as a major
source of income.
</P>
<P>
"It is about time we thought of pursuing exportation of goods
to countries outside COMESA," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian minister said that member states would find it
easier to remove customs duty as they would concentrate on
importing raw materials for the manufacturing of finished products
for export.
</P>
<P>
He urged COMESA members to urgently eliminate all types of
barriers to regional trade and development.
</P>
<P>
The fear by some governments that they would loose revenue by
reducing tariffs was unfounded, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mpamba noted that countries and global groupings were moving
away from dependence on customs duties as the major source of
their income to more neutral taxes such as value added tax (VAT)
and sales tax.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed gratitude that 16 member states out of
the 21 had reduced import duties on COMESA products by between 60
to 90 percent while almost all members had removed the classical
non-tariff barriers.
</P>
<P>
Mpamba also urged COMESA members to support the development of
cross- border trade because it was a source of income to the
region's unemployed people.

<P>
HONG KONG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A league champion from Asia
gained the first entrance into the prestigious 1999 McDonald's
Championship to be held in Milan in October, Carl Ching Men-ky,
president of Asian Basketball Confederation (ABC) announced on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Basketball in Asia is on its way, and a new era is beginning,
" Carl Ching Men-ky told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The McDonald's Championship is also called the World Basketball
Club Championship, created by world basketball governing body FIBA
and the NBA in 1987.
</P>
<P>
"We are thrilled that finally an Asian team will be represented
in Milan, along with the top club teams from around the world. Now
we can say that the McDonald's Championship is a world
championship of professional leagues, " said Ms. Mary Reiling
Spencer, vice president and managing director of NBA Asia Pacific.
</P>
<P>
"This is a historic day for Asian basketball. We are honored
to have an Asian team participate for the first time ever in this
prestigious tournament. It speaks volume of the strength and
maturity of our basketball development in Asia, " said ABC
Secretary General Yeoh Choo Hock, who has been lobbying FIBA for
the instatement of the Asian side for several years.
</P>
<P>
The event was expanded from the original three-team format to
four teams from 1988 to 1991, and in 1993 it grew to its current
six-team format. Since 1991, the championship has been scheduled
to compliment the Olympics and the World Championship on the four-
year international basketball calendar.
</P>
<P>
The event features the best clubs in the world. Competitions in
the Euroleague, ABC Champions cup, the national basketball league
in Australia and the South American Basketball league are in the
process of crowning club champions that will go on to compete for
this year's McDonald's championship title.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Launches Youth-Oriented Anti-Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Monday launched a campaign to steer the youth from
crime.
</P>
<P>
The campaign would use former prisoners to teach the youth that
crime did not pay. Young people would also be trained to become
leaders in the program.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the initiative deserves the support of all South
Africans.
</P>
<P>
"By combining education and crime prevention, by working in our
schools and among our young people who are unemployed or in
prison, the campaign will indeed bring the light of hope," he said
at a ceremony in Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the time to blame all the country's difficulties
on the past has long gone. But he said apartheid had corroded the
moral fabric of society and left a legacy of poverty that would
take years to eradicate.
</P>
<P>
While the underlying causes of crime such as poverty and
inequality should be addressed, tough action against criminals
should continue by enforcing stricter laws and bail conditions, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Those who commit crime must know they will be caught and
punished," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the government's repeated commitments to curb crime,
the crime wave seems to be spiralling.
</P>
<P>
Last week, quite a few incidents sparked outrage. A Soweto
principal and a photographer were murdered and a U.N. official was
raped. The Burundian ambassador to South Africa, Gedeon Magete,
was robbed for a second time within seven days.

<HEADLINE> Most of Zambia's State Enterprises Privatized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- About 86 percent of state-owned
enterprises in Zambia had been privatized by the end of March, the
Zambian Privatization Agency (ZPA) said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the agency, out of the
280 state- run enterprises in its working portfolio, 242 have been
privatized since the agency was established in 1992.
</P>
<P>
As the winding up of the country's privatization program,
donors have resumed financial aid by releasing a total of 36
million U.S. dollars so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The donors withheld their promised balance-of-payment support
to Zambia last year because of the delayed privatization of the
country's copper mines.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Anglo-American Corporation and Zambia signed a
memorandum of understanding over the sale of Nchanga, Nkana and
Konkola mines of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, paving the
way for the resumption of the aid.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian Privatization Agency is expected to end its mission
before the end of next year, according to the press release.

<HEADLINE> Over 120,000 Child Soldiers Fighting in Africa, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A new report on child
soldiers in Africa has found that more than 120,000 children under
18 years of age are being used as soldiers across the continent,
some of these children being no more than seven years of age.
</P>
<P>
The report, released here Monday by the Coalition to Stop the
Use of Child Soldiers, said the countries most affected were
Algeria, Angola, Burundi, Congo-Brazzaville, the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Sudan and
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"African children are being targeted across the continent as
tools fo war," said Reed Brody, director of Human Rights Watch,
which chairs the international coalition. He called on governments
to stop recruiting children into their own armed forces and to end
all support to rebel groups that used children as soldiers.
</P>
<P>
When not actively engaged in combat, children are often used to
man checkpoints. Adult soldiers tend to stand several meters
further back so that if bullets start flying, the children will be
the first victims, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report, which is being published to coincide with the
opening in Maputo, Mozambique, of a Regional Conference on the Use
of Children as Soldiers, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming majority of African countries have set 18
years as the minimum age for recruitment, whether voluntary or
through conscription. Notable exceptions are Angola, which
recently reduced its conscription age to 17, and Uganda, which
appears to allow children over 13 years of age to enlist in
certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which currently accepts volunteers at 17 years,
plans to raise its minimum recruitment age to 18 years in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which is being jointly organized by the
Coalition and Save the Children, a non-governmental organization,
is the first of four regional conferences to be held this year.
The others will be held in Latin America, Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Maputo Conference will bring together the largest-ever
gathering of African governments, non-governmental organizations,
and representatives of the United Nations and the Red Cross to
seek to end the use of children as soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The coalition, headed by seven international non-governmental
organizations, was founded in May 1998.

<HEADLINE> GCC Meets on Employment of National Manpower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) Consultative Committee began a meeting here Monday on the
employment of national manpower and facilitating their movement
among member states.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came in implementing recommendations of the
previous GCC summit on expanding the employment of GCC nationals
and giving them equal employment rights in member countries, said
Mohammed Eid Al Muraikhi, chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
The initiative to give GCC nationals equal employment rights
in member states was a major part of the agenda for the 19th GCC
summit which took place here last November.
</P>
<P>
The GCC comprises Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman
and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Jamil Hujailan, secretary general of the GCC, said at the
meeting that as a regional organization, the GCC was established
on the basis of social, economic and cultural agreement among its
member countries.
</P>
<P>
The GCC economic agreement has created a free market for the
movement of services, capitals and commodities of the Gulf region,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"It has also created joint economic establishments such as the
Gulf Investment Organization, the Gulf organization for
Industrial Consultations, the Commercial Arbitration Center and
the Gulf Patent Office," he added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President to Visit Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- President Ezer Weizman will pay
a short visit to Egypt Thursday at the invitation of his Egyptian
counterpart Hosni Mubarak, Israel Radio said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The radio did not elaborate on the upcoming visit. But the
stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process and the Palestinian
statehood are expected to be on the agenda of the talks between
the two presidents.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the Palestinian statehood has drawn worldwide
attention as May 4, the date when the five-year interim period for
Palestinian self-government expires, is around the corner.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat has
traveled around the world in the last two months to garner support
for the Palestinian right to statehood and to collect suggestions
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He has been urged by most of the countries he visited,
including the United States, to delay a unilateral declaration
planned on May 4 so as not to further derail the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Peace-making between Israel and the Palestinians has been in
stalemate since Israel froze the implementation of the Wye
agreement signed last October.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Central Council, a 125-member Palestinian
leadership body, will meet next week to make a final decision on
this issue.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has reportedly favored a delay in the declaration.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, a strong pursuer of peace with Arab neighbors, has
said that a unilateral declaration of statehood by Arafat is
"unwise."
</P>
<P>
Although also famed for his record as a warrior, Weizman helped
forge the Jewish state's ground-breaking peace treaty with Egypt
in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Arrests Seven Suspected Militants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian prosecutors Monday ordered
the arrest of seven Islamic militant suspects who were extradited
from three Arab countries last week.
</P>
<P>
The arrest finished a legal procedure required before the
suspects can be charged and tried in a state security court.
</P>
<P>
The specific indictments against them are not clear for now but
they were wanted for terrorist acts in the country over the past
15 years, security officials said.
</P>
<P>
They were suspected members of the outlawed group, Jihad, or
Holy War, which assassinated former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Since their extradition by Kuwait, Yemen and Sudan, the seven
had been detained for interrogation.
</P>
<P>
About 20 suspected Islamic militants have been extradited to
Egypt over the last three months from Arab, European and South
American countries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Islamic militants launched an insurgency in 1992 in an
attempt to topple the secular government and install a strict
Islamic rule. More than 1,200 people have been killed in the
insurgency, mostly militants and policemen.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Park Attracts More Tourists After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Bwindi Impenetrable Forest
National Park in southwestern Uganda, a place known to the world
after eight foreign tourists were killed there in March this year,
has attracted more tourists after it reopened to tourism
activities in early April.
</P>
<P>
So far, the park has received some 80 foreign tourists from
Germany, Sweden, England, Australia, Switzerland and Canada, Radio
Uganda reported Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Lillian Adarova, a visitor service coordinator with Uganda
Wildlife Authority, was quoted as saying that the Ugandan
government has put in place enough security measures to ensure the
safety of the tourists.
</P>
<P>
The Second Division Commander Benon Biraro assured the tourists
and the public at large that the government army will maintain its
presence in the area at all times.
</P>
<P>
The national park became internationally well-known after eight
foreign tourists were killed on March 1 by the Interahamwe rebels
allegedly coming from eastern part of the Democratic Republic of
Congo.
</P>
<P>
This massacre has plunged the young tourism industry in Uganda
to a record low.
</P>
<P>
With deployment of troops around the park and improvement of
telecommunications facilities in the area, more visitors came to
visit the park which is home to some 300 mountain gorillas, more
than half of its total population in the world, the report said..
</P>
<P>
Mountain gorilla tracking is the most lucrative activity the
park offers. It accounts for some 70 percent of the Uganda
Wildlife Authority's annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
Since the number of tourists entering the park to track
gorillas is limited, many foreign tourists have to book their
tickets one year in advance.

comment of the United States on Algeria's presidential election as
"irresponsible" and a "flagrant interference in Algeria's internal
affairs."

people and their leaders, adding Iraq "opposes any form of foreign
interference in Algeria's internal affairs."

UNITED NATIONS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The year 2000 millennium
bug may have a negative impact on world food supply system
especially in developing countries, a U.N. agency warned on

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said
those countries relying on food aid while lacking funds to solve

</P>
<P>
The Rome-based FAO said the bug, regarded as a factor to cause
chaos in the global computer system by not distinguishing between
1900 and 2000 if it not properly fixed, may threaten to affect all
of supplies and services essential to agricultural production.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief to Visit Germany, Russia on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is scheduled to pay a visit to Germany and Russia on
Kosovo, a Serbian province, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Eckhard said, "the
Secretary-General will be making a long-planned official visit to
Germany from 26 to 28 April."
</P>
<P>
"After consulting with the Russian Government, he has extended
this trip by one day to visit Moscow on 29 April," the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Germany, Annan will meet with the German
president, foreign minister and the minister of defense on the
current situation in Kosovo, where conflicts broke out in February
last year after ethnic Albanians have been fighting with Serbs for
independence.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after Anna on Monday morning briefed a
closed-door Security Council session on Kosovo. He is expected to
appoint a special envoy on Kosovo, diplomatic sources here said,
but the name of the would-be envoy remains unknown at the moment.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General was not invited to attend the NATO
anniversary celebration in Washington," Eckhard said, referring to
the Washington summit marking the 50th anniversary of NATO on
April 23-25 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council convened the closed-door session on Kosovo
after several countries recently proposed solutions on how to
solve the question of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who said earlier "not directly involved in the Kosovo
crisis," is began a new round of diplomacy on Kosovo. The U.N.
Chief, describing the current situation in Kosovo following the
ongoing NATO bombing as "difficult and dangerous," said last week
that one can not expect "quick result," and "we are in the
beginning of the diplomatic meditation."
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to
the United Nations, told reporters after the Council meeting that
"we are in favor of a political solution of the question of
Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that any political solution should be based on two
principles, namely faithful respect for and maintenance of the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of FRY (the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia), and protection of the legitimate rights of all
ethnic groups in Kosovo, FRY," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, it is very important to seek the consent of
the Government of FRY when any plan is to be discussed," Qin said.
"We are against imposing any solution on FRY. As for now, it is a
matter of priority for NATO to cease immediately its military
action against FRY."
</P>
<P>
NATO, without the authorization of the Security Council,
unilaterally launched air strikes on Yugoslavia, a sovereign and
independent member of the U.N. family, violating the U.N. Charter
and international law.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing air attacks also created a large exodus of refugees
and serious humanitarian crisis.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Sugar Authority (KSA)
announced here Monday it would impose a three-month ban on
imported sugar in the east African country until local
manufacturers sell out all their stocks.
</P>
<P>
The only exception will be sugar imported by legally registered
 companies for industrial use, the government agency said.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the KSA Mark Too said any sugar imported would be
held in warehouses until the local sugar companies run out of
stocks.
</P>
<P>
Too said the curb on sugar imports was part of KSA's efforts to
 streamline sugar importation and warehousing in the country.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Kenya Sugar-cane Growers Association complained
that massive imports of white sugar were threatening local
companies, citing that 88,600 tons of domestic sugar worth 3.6
billion shillings (about 57 million U.S. dollars) would go to
waste due to the imports.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Supreme Court Rejects Mayor's Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative supreme court
on Tuesday turned down the appeal by the former Tehran mayor
Gholamhussein Karbaschi for a re-examination of his case.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, a well-known reformist and staunch ally of moderate
President Mohammad Khatami, was tried and convicted on charges of
graft last July. His attorney, Bahman Keshavarz, called for a
re-investigation of the charges against the mayor.
</P>
<P>
The supreme court said that it sees no need to examine or hear
the case once again since Karbaschi's appeal had earlier been
investigated by public prosecutor's office of the supreme court
and was already rejected by the public prosecutor general, the
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was sentenced by a Tehran court to five years in
prison, a 20-year ban from holding government office, 60 lashes
and a fine of 1 billion rials (about 1.6 million U.S. dollars)
from the Tehran district court.
</P>
<P>
But an appeal court last December reduced his prison sentence
to two years and the period he was banned from taking public
office to 10 years. The court also changed his lashing sentence to
a cash fine of 10 million rials (about 1,600 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Keshavarz decided to resort to retrial regulations to get the
case re-investigated at the supreme court.
</P>
<P>
The former mayor had been a target of hard-line political
rivals who control the country's judiciary. Many believe the case
against him was a political avenge for his support to Khatami in
the presidential campaign 1997.
</P>
<P>
Khatami won a landslide victory in the presidential election in
May 1997 over his hardline competitor, Majlis (parliament) Speaker
Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was temporally jailed last April, but was released
under an order from the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
after political disturbances took place in reaction to the former
mayor's arrest.

<HEADLINE> Russia Opposes U.N. Mandate to Use Force in Yugoslavia: Vedrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said on Tuesday that Russia always opposes the approval by
the United Nations for a use of force in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Russia has expressed its opposition at the U.N. Security
Council to a French proposal to use Chapter Seven of the U.N.
Charter to justify a deployment of foreign troops in Kosovo, said
Vedrine at the French National Assembly, or lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
"For the moment, the Russians don't want to vote a resolution
in the name of Chapter Seven. They don't want to overstep the
line toward a resort to force," he said.
</P>
<P>
France wishes to use Chapter Seven of the U.N. Charter, which
justifies international action to stop violence endangering a
whole people, to give a legal basis to NATO intervention against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
But the French foreign minister said that France will continue
to seek cooperation from Russia for a political and diplomatic
solution to Kosovo in future.
</P>
<P>
While ruling out any possibility for Kosovo to win independence,
Vedrine said that the idea on international protection in the
Yugoslav province is gaining ground and it will make a U.N.
involvement indispensable.

NEW DELHI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- India Tuesday rejected as
unacceptable the United States demands that any new regime in
India should accept international demands on nuclear and missiles

</P>

Rubin also said that the United States strongly supported the
Lahore process and hoped India would move fast on the Lahore
Declaration signed between prime ministers of India and Pakistan
last February.

"There is no question of so-called non-proliferation demands,"
the Indian official spokesman said, adding that New Delhi would

As for India-Pakistan issues, the spokesman said that there was

<HEADLINE> Most Bulgarians Against Opening Territorial Air to NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A late poll shows that 63 percent
of Bulgarians oppose granting the use of Bulgarian airspace for
NATO's military operation against Yugoslavia, Now newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, which surveyed 623 people, followed a request by NATO
made Saturday for unlimited access to Bulgaria's airspace.
</P>
<P>
Only 24 percent of the people approved of NATO's request.
Thirteen percent did not comment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that 72 percent of those polled were worried
that Bulgaria would risk involvement in a war if it opened its air
corridor to the Western alliance. Half of the people thought the
risk was high.
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of the people disapproved of Bulgarian President
Petar Stoyanov's position to provide all possible help to NATO and
only 22 percent agreed with him. This is the lowest support rate
for the president since he took office two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Under Bulgaria's constitution, foreign armed forces cannot pass
through the country unless the Bulgarian parliament gives its
approval. The Constitutional Court ruled in 1994 that each case
would require separate parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian parliament is due to vote on NATO's request on
Monday or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's opposing Socialist Party has clearly expressed
objection to NATO's request.
</P>
<P>
The majority of Bulgarian people are predominantly Slav
Orthodox population. Serbians have held rallies throughout the
country against the request.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister Ivan Kostov, Parliamentary Speaker
Yordan Sokolov as well as Stoyanov have all agreed to give grant
to NATO's request, according to the local media.
</P>
<P>
The parliament, in which Kostov's center-right Union of
Democratic Forces has a clear majority, is very likely to approve
the request.

<P>
PARIS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Abdelaziz Bouteflika was formally
proclaimed president of the Republic of Algeria on Tuesday by the
Constitutional Council of Algeria, after his victory in the
presidential election on April 15.
</P>
<P>
Constitutional Council President Said Bouchair made the
announcement on television, according to reports from Algiers.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika won 7,445,045 votes, or nearly 74 percent of the
votes cast, Bouchair reportedly quoted verified figures released
by the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The new president will take over the position from his
predecessor, Liamine Zeroual, after being sworn in on Saturday,
said Algerian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The six other presidential candidates withdrew from the vote in
the last minute to protest what they called "fraud in primary
voting operations" among Saharan nomadic people and in military
barracks.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition candidates still won 26 percent of the votes,
with moderate Islamist Ahmed-Taleb Ibrahimi winning 1,265,594
votes, Abdallah Djaballah 400,080 votes, Hocine Ait-Ahmed 321,179
votes, Mouloud Hamrouche 314,160 votes, Mokdad Sifi 226,139 votes
and Youssef Khatib 121,414 votes.
</P>
<P>
The participation rate stood at 60,25 percent of a total of 17,
488,759 registered voters in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
This was disputed by the opposition parties, who estimate it at
between 20 and 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika will be the fifth president of Algeria since the
country's independence in 1962 from France, after Ahmed Benbella,
Houari Boumediene, Chadli Bendjedid and Liamine Zeroual.
</P>
<P>
Zeroual became the first democratically elected president in
1995 by beating three rivals from the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Algeria was governed by a five-man presidency council from
January 1992 -- after the military canceled a legislative election
result which let Islamists come to power -- till January 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) expressed its "firm stand" again here Tuesday
for carrying on the military campaign against Yugoslavia to the
end as there are two days before the alliance's 50th anniversary
celebration in Washington this week.
</P>
<P>
Both British Prime Minister Tony Blair and NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana told reporters here after their
meeting that the 19-nation alliance's determination was firm.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that his meeting with Blair gave them "a further
opportunity to consider the Kosovo crisis. "I can speak for both
of us when I stress once again our, and the alliance's, firm
determination to succeed. We will stand firm to the end."
</P>
<P>
Blair also said when answering questions that the solution of
the NATO strikes is "very simple:" "we carry on until he (Mr.
Milosevic) does step down."
</P>
<P>
Asked if NATO has any further plan about deployment of ground

foreign minister on that last week, Blair said NATO was very
grateful for the help that Hungary had given and the support in
circumstances where they were aware, but he refused to reveal
anything about ground troops.
</P>
<P>
"What we must now demonstrate, over the next coming period of
time, is constantly to restate the basic reasons why we are, where
we are, constantly to emphasize that our demands and objectives
are reasonably met in full," Blair told reporters at NATO
headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
A NATO civilian spokesman, Jamie Shea, told a daily news
briefing Tuesday afternoon that Solana also, by telephone, talked
with the prime ministers of Norway, the Netherlands and Luxembourg
as part of his ongoing consultations to prepare for the Washington
summit. "They also reviewed the latest development in Kosovo," he
said.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Rebels Advancing to Angolan Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Armed rebel forces of the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) are flooding
into northern Angola's Kwanza-sul Province, which is a gate to
capital city Luanda, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Higino Carneiro, governor of the province, said the situation
is " critical".
</P>
<P>
He said UNITA's regular troops and guerrillas who have won some
battles in central Angola, are launching offenses to the province,
inflicting big losses on the part of the government forces.
</P>
<P>
Carneiro did not say how many of his cities and towns are now
under UNITA's control, but he said that all the people in his
province have been mobilized to resist UNITA's attacks.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend a foreign non-governmental organization group,
heading for a humanitarian aid conference, were ambushed by UNITA,
killing all six people on a car, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
Carneiro, also a hard-line general determined to wipe out
UNITA, was assigned to Kwanza-sul at the end of January after a
governmental reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, situation in the neighboring Benge Province, which
has been haunted by UNITA guerrillas, is also intensifying, with
refugee flooding into the Caxito, capital of the province about 40
kms from Luanda.
</P>
<P>
People in the capital can smell a strong sense of war, while
the government is enrolling youths for its troops from every
corner of the city, armed police checking vehicles and pedestrians
on the streets.
</P>
<P>
Situation in central Angola went panic after governmental
troops failed in their fight against UNITA in Andulo City,
headquarters of UNITA. It is reported that UNITA forces captured
a strategically important city of Alto Catumbela in Benguela
Province.
</P>
<P>
But the report has not been confirmed by the government.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Inflation Drops in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's year-on-year
consumer inflation rate was 7.9 percent in March, a sharp decrease
from February's 8. 6 percent, Statistics South Africa announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fall was attributed mainly to a further drop in home loan
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The annual core inflation rate, which excludes mortgage
payments and other volatile items, rose to eight percent in march
from 7.8 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fall in the headline consumer inflation rate,
economists Tuesday warned against over-optimism.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted Standard Bank's economic
division as saying that proposed fuel price hikes would have an
adverse effect on the rate.
</P>
<P>
The fuel price is expected to rise by 17 cents (0.028 U.S.
dollars) per liter at the beginning of May owing to oil price
hikes on international markets.
</P>
<P>
"Consumer inflation will be affected once the higher import
cost of oil results in changes in petroleum prices at retail
level," the bank said.

LANZHOU, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have climbed
to the highest point of the South Pole, 3,910 meters above sea
level and carried out the first ever scientific investigations in
the region during their 15th expedition to Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
Scientists drilled ice cores to a total depth of more than 200
meters and obtained a large number of snow and air samples in this
highest region of the Antarctic ice cap during the 50-day
expedition from December 15 to February 3, according to a press
conference here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
There was no human contamination of the ice cores and snow
samples which will provide precious data for research into global
climate changes, said scientists from the Lanzhou Institute of
Glaciology and Cryopedology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS).
</P>
<P>
The Antarctic ice cap, covering a total area of over 13 million
square kilometers, is the largest glacier on earth and contains 70
percent of the earth's fresh water.

BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- New regulations aimed at
encouraging scientific organizations, higher-learning institutes
and their staff to research and develop high technology and speed
up the industrialization of research results have been issued by
the General Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Jointly compiled by the Ministry of Science and Technology, the
Ministry of Education and other government organizations the rules
are promulgated under the title Regulations on Promoting the
Industrialization of Scientific And Technological Results.
</P>
<P>
They are divided into three parts and incorporate detailed
principles boosting scientific results, guaranteeing the right of
self-management of high-tech enterprises, and providing a better
environment for the industrialization of high technology.
</P>
<P>
"The older laws, regulations and policies concerning the same
issues are too general to give enough incentive and guidance to
relevant people," Xu Guanhua, vice-minister of Science and
Technology said during an interview with reporters from the Xinhua
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that the new regulations are more detailed and more
feasible than old ones and provide new policies which will guide

</P>
<P>
To further speed up the process, people can choose to
industrialize their research results in accordance with relevant
agreements with their institutes or organizations one year after
the development of the results, according to one of the
regulations.
</P>
<P>
"They also provide a number of detailed principles for

<P>
He said that scientific employees are allowed to do part-time
jobs or engage in moon-lighting, but only where this concerns the

allowed to leave their institute for less than two years to do
other research and development work, and will be given equal
opportunity to compete for positions in their original workplaces

<HEADLINE> Model of Design for Reunification Monument Displayed in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A model of the design for
Reunification Monument was displayed to the public here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Selected from a total of 260 submissions through open
invitation and approved by Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the outstanding
design is adopted as the basis of design concept for the monument.
</P>
<P>
According to the design, the monument is composed of three
parts: the pedestal, the pillar and the head, with a total height
of about 20 meters and a width of 1.6 meters.
</P>
<P>
The name of the monument as written by President Jiang Zemin
will be engraved on the facade of the pillar and the Chinese and
English versions of the inscription separately on the east- and
west-facing sides of the pedestal.
</P>
<P>
The bottom part of the pillar is square in shape and is
gradually rounded off towards the top. It is made up of 206
overlapping stone slabs, each of which representing a year between
1842 and 2047. A glass ring with built-in lighting marks the
return of Hong Kong to China in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Leung Chun-ying, chairman of the Working Group on Reunification
Monument, said at a press conference here Tuesday the estimated
construction cost, including costs on advanced and ancillary works,
amounts to 9.68 million HK dollars (1.24 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The monument will be temporarily erected to the north-west of
the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center Extension where the
handover ceremony was held.
</P>
<P>
Upon the completion of the proposed new HKSAR government
headquarters at the former Tamar site, the HKSAR government might
consider relocating the monument permanently to the open space off
the new headquarters for better coordination in the celebration
for the anniversary of the HKSAR establishment and other relevant
functions.
</P>
<P>
According to suggestions raised by the working group, the
Government House will be renamed as "Zilu" in Chinese. Zi refers
to Bauhinia, the city flower of Hong Kong while Lu means a
unpretentious cottage.
</P>
<P>
The new Chinese name will be formally adopted with effect from
July 1, 1999 while the English name "Government House" will remain
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Set up on July 1, 1998, the working group openly invited
submissions of monument design, monument inscription and new names
for the government House between September 28 and November 14 last
year.

TIRANA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Britain is sending another batch

British troops in the Balkan country to 6,300.
</P>
<P>
A Macedonian news agency MIA report, monitored here Tuesday,

<HEADLINE> Scientists Mark 80th Anniversary of May 4 Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of well-known Chinese
scientists stressed at today's forum to commemorate the 80th
anniversary of the May 4 Movement that the future of the nation
depends on the fostering of a scientific spirit.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the China Association for Science and Technology (
CAST), the forum was one of the many events planned to mark the
anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, political and cultural movement
which flourished earlier this century.
</P>
<P>
"It aroused Chinese intellectuals, as well as the common people
and imbued in them a fervor for patriotism, science and democracy,
" said Zhou Guangzhao, vice-chairman of the National People's
Congress (NPC) Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
He added that the spirit advocated during the movement has
practical and immediate significance in scientific circles to this
day.
</P>
<P>
The movement also blew away the feudal system and outmoded
concepts which had ruled China for more than two millennia.
Theorists in the enlightenment movement believed that only
democracy and science could save and invigorate China.
</P>
<P>
Patriotism and good academic discipline should be emphasized in
the scientific circle today, said Zhou, who is also the president
of the CAST, and the scientific knowledge, spirit and thoughts
should be spread to the public.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending the forum said that science and technology
has taken deep root in all the fields of economic and social
developments in China 80 years after the May 4 Movement. Meanwhile,
the scientific spirit should enter the social life and become a
standard for the whole society.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the scientific spirit has an important role in
maintaining social stability, promoting economic development,
improving the people's life and in making decisions by the
government.
</P>
<P>
China has initiated the strategy of invigorating the nation
through science and technology, which is a development of late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's theory that science and technology
is the first productive force.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has emphasized for several times
that the implementation of the strategy will be a major task of
the current government.

<P>
PARIS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- German tennis star Boris Becker
quit the Monte Carlo Open on Tuesday after his father death,
according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Karl-Heinz Becker, 63, died in a clinic in Heidelberg on Monday
night after a long fight against cancer.
</P>
<P>
"I am very sad, I admired my father and I owe him a lot,"
Becker was quoted as saying. "In this difficult situation, I have
to and want to be close to my family. Especially my mother needs
me."
</P>
<P>
Reports said Becker, who entered the tournament on invitation,
had reached the second round by beating Frenchman Cedric Pioline
on Monday and was due to take on another French player Jerome
Golmard.
</P>
<P>
Becker last week came back from Asia, withdrawing before the
Japan Open after reaching the final in Hong Kong when his father's
condition worsened.
</P>
<P>
Becker, 31, is determined to retire after a final fling at
Wimbledon this summer, followed by a farewell to Stuttgart in July
at the Mercedes Cup, reports said.

<HEADLINE> British MPs Urge NATO to Stop Bombing in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Two British Parliament Members (
MPs) on Tuesday condemned NATO's bombing on Yugoslavia and told
the military alliance that the only way to solve the Kosovo crisis
is political negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Alice Mahon, who just came back from a two-day trip to
Yugoslavia, told a press conference held in the House of Commons
on Tuesday morning that NATO's bombing can not solve the problems
in Yugoslavia and would provide more refugees that can never be
back home unless the airstrikes was stopped.
</P>
<P>
"I think what we supposed to be the first humanitarian war
actually created a humanitarian disaster," Mahon said.
</P>
<P>
She said she had the feeling that NATO's bombing forced more
people to stand on the side of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, and that unless NATO stops its bombing, the fight would
keep on and there would be no way to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav people had the strong feeling that the United States
wanted to take over their country and they would surely fight the
war against NATO, Mahon said.
</P>
<P>
"This is war. It's going to be worse because the Serbs will
fight. They know the Americans want to take over their country,"
Mahon said.
</P>
<P>
"We will fight for our country in every town, every village and
every house and behind every tree. We are not going to give up,"
Mahon said she was repeatedly told by Yugoslavs.
</P>
<P>
"The only hope is to keep pressing all sides to get the United
Nations involved, involve the Russians, try to come out with a
political solution that form the bases of negotiation at the very
least, and not just keep repeating what we tried for months at
Rambouillet. It didn't work," Mahon said.
</P>
<P>
Tam Dalyell, another MP attending the conference, said NATO's
policy in Yugoslavia now is causing more problems in that region
rather than solving it.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of bombing does not make the situation better. It
makes it far, far worse," Dalyell said.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif met his Russian counterpart Yevgeny Primakov Sunday
to discuss the Balkan crisis, the situation in South Asia and
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, the first Pakistani leader to visit Russia in 25 years,

agreement with Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said the outcome of the talks indicated that both
sides hoped to improve bilateral relations.

The changed situation in Asia and the world has made it
necessary for the two countries to develop good bilateral
relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Pakistan hold similar positions regarding many
international and regional issues, and, both sides believe the
idea of building a unipolar world should not be permitted to gain

To develop relations between Russia, Pakistan, China and India
is of great importance to stability and security in South Asia,
Primakov noted.

weapons, including Pakistan and India, to join relevant
nonproliferation treaties and stop nuclear tests in any form.

<HEADLINE> Romania, Bulgaria Discuss NATO's Request for Access to Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu Tuesday consulted his Bulgarian counterpart Petar
Stoyanov by telephone regarding NATO's recent request for
unrestricted access for its aircraft in the two countries'
airspace.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu said he had talked by telephone with Stoyanov
shortly before a meeting of Romania's Supreme Defense Council,
which was convened to evaluate NATO's request.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian president said Stoyanov proposed coordinating the
positions of the two countries regarding the request.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Bulgarian president, the government, and the
parliamentary majority have agreed to allow NATO's aircraft to use
the country's airspace, according to Bulagria's news agency BTA.
</P>
<P>
NATO last Saturday called on Bucharest authorities to grant "
unlimited" access of Romania's air space for its aircraft. The
request did not include the use of Romanian airports and other
ground facilities by NATO aircraft for their flights to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
NATO aircraft currently have access to Romania's air space only
in "emergency and unforeseen situations," under a ruling the
Romanian parliament made in October last year.
</P>
<P>
After consulting with Prime Minister Radu Vasile on Monday,
Constantinescu held separate consultations Tuesday with leaders of
the ruling coalition and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Romania's Supreme Defense Council, the country's institution in
charge of national security, is currently holding a session which
will be followed by an extraordinary sitting of Romania's
government. If they agree, it will be filed with Romania's
parliament, the only institution mandated to make such a decision.

<HEADLINE> Resumed Land Auction in HK Achieves Good Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government's
first land sale in nearly a year has achieved encouraging results
by raising 1.49 billion HK dollars (19 million U.S. dollars) with
a total of over 26,000 square meters of government lots.
</P>
<P>
Both government officials and property developers said the
prices were higher than expected.
</P>
<P>
Three lots were put up for auction Tuesday at the Concert Hall
of Hong Kong Cultural Center, Tsim Sha Tsui.
</P>
<P>
Property developers reacted positively to the auction, which
was held for the first time since the government decided to
suspend land sales in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
After the auction, Herbert Leung, assistant director of the
Lands Department, who conducted the auction, said the lots have
been successfully sold out in an open and just manner and the
prices were decided by the market.
</P>
<P>
Leung said the aim of the sale is to provide steady supplies of
land to meet the market demand and achieve stable property market.
</P>
<P>
The government suspended its land sales program at the end of
June last year in an effort to stabilize the sharply falling
property prices which had been hit by the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Property prices plunged by about 50 percent after the regional
economic crisis forced interest rates to soar.
</P>
<P>
While the sharp fall in property prices might be good for home
buyers, it has hurt the citizens and has an impact on other
economic sectors in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Small and Medium-sized enterprises, accounting for more than 90
percent of firms in Hong Kong, usually use their properties as
mortgages to get loans from banks.
</P>
<P>
The plunging property prices made it difficult for them to get
the loans.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, land sales are a major source of the
government's incomes. Taking 1996 and 1997 for example, the income
from land sales accounted for about 13 percent of the government
incomes.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of land sales in the 1998-99 fiscal year ending
March would have reduced the government's income by 30 billion HK
dollars (3.85 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The decision to resume the land sales was announced on February
12. Government officials said the policy objective is to ensure
stability in the property market and provide sufficient land to
meet the long-term needs.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six months prices have edged up by about 10-15
percent, analysts say.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Defending its selective
capital control measures, Malaysia said Tuesday the measures
introduced from September 1 last year have increased the country's
external reserves by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Between September 1, 1998, and April 15, 1999, Malaysia's
external reserves totaled 28.2 billion U.S. dollars, equivalent to
financing 6.1 months of retained imports compared with just 20
billion U.S. dollars, equivalent to financing 3.8 months of
retained imports last August, according to Second Finance Minister
Mustapa Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
"The 50 percent increase is a proud achievement. No one can
cast any doubt on that achievement," he was quoted by the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama as saying in Parliament
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the relaxation of the selective capital controls
by imposing an exit tax on repatriated foreign capital since
February 15 had succeeded in attracting net inflows of capital
totaling 440 million ringgit (115.789 million U.S. dollars) to
date. Of the total capital inflows of 1,570 million ringgit
(413.157 million U.S. dollars), outflows amounted to 1,130 million
ringgit (297.368 million U.S. dollars), he added.
</P>
<P>
"Introduction of the exit tax had improved investor sentiment.
Net capital inflows are being monitored daily and Bank Negara
(State Bank) Malaysia keeps a record daily," he said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the saying that the capital controls had not worked
and that investor confidence had yet to return as "inaccurate", he
said indicators had shown that the Malaysian economy was sound and
recovering.
</P>
<P>
He said fund managers, international financial institutions and
rating agencies had changed the ratings on Malaysia to stable from
negative previously and had even forecast economic growth higher
than the 1.0 percent predicted by the Malaysian government.
</P>
<P>
He cited Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley's forecast of 2.0
percent growth for Malaysia this year and an even higher growth
forecast by the Institute of International Finance and Credit
Suisse of between 3.0 and 3.1 percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Workshop On AIDS/HIV,TB Control Strategies In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A four-day workshop aimed to map
out a framework for a common AIDS/HIV and TB control strategies in
Africa Tuesday started in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Botswana, Gambia, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, South
Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe are attending the
meeting organized by the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional
Office for Africa.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will discuss about the performance of the on-going
community based AIDS/TB care projects, review the adapted training
tools, guidelines and current practices in the management of
AIDS/HIV/TB and develop a draft regional framework for
strengthening the prevention and care of TB and people living with
HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, acting Director of the Communicable
Disease Prevention and Control Division of WHO Regional Office for
Africa, Antoine Kabore said since the advent of the HIV/AIDS
epidemic, Africa has witnessed a massive increase in
zero-prevalence and death rates in all the sub- regions. This has
been paralleled by an equally steep rise in incidence rates for
tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, the two diseases have become one of the most devastating
public health crises in the African region at the close of this
century," Kabore said.
</P>
<P>
Africa registered two million of the 2.5 million AIDS-related
deaths that occurred globally in 1998, Kabore said.
</P>
<P>
For TB, 1.6 million new infectious cases are estimated to occur
each year in the region, with over 600,000 deaths. Over the last
two decades, case notification rates have increased from under 100
per 100,000 inhabitants to over 400 per 100,000 inhabitants in
some countries in Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The rapid increase is largely due to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in
these countries, Kabore said.
</P>
<P>
Kabore noted, "despite the efforts made by several African
governments to intervene on these two diseases, there seems to be
hardly any decline in the incidence and transmission."
</P>
<P>
He called this meeting to try and put together from various
experiences, a framework that will assist the countries to begin
to make some progress in their efforts to contain this rapidly
growing dual epidemic.

<HEADLINE> Indian Central Bank Adjusts Monetary, Credit Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Reserve Bank of India (RBI),
the central bank of the country, adjusted its monetary and credit
policy Tuesday with a cut in the cash reserve ratio by 0.5 percent
to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The cut, which will be effective from May 8, would augment
banks' lendable resources by 32.5 billion rupees (approximately
773 million U.S. dollars), the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported
from Mumbai, India's financial capital, 1400 km southwest of here.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the monetary and credit policy for 1999-2000 at a
meeting with chairmen of commercial banks, RBI Governor Bimal
Jalan said the stance of monetary policy would continue to
facilitate adequate availability of liquidity along with stable
medium and long-term interest rate.
</P>
<P>
RBI would allowed banks to fix different prime lending rates
for different maturities and in keeping with the wishes of
industry, the central bank has permitted banks to offer fixed rate
loans.
</P>
<P>
RBI has also prescribed a ceiling of 10 percent of total
capital for banks and financial institutions for investment in
subordinated debt instruments.
</P>
<P>
As part of efforts at developing the money markets, RBI has
decided to permit money market mutual funds to offer "cheque
writing" facility to their investors through an arrangement with a
bank.
</P>
<P>
Jalan said that RBI and the central government would work out a
package to promote retail market for government securities.
</P>
<P>
In order to encourage flow of finance for venture capital, the
overall ceiling of five percent of incremental deposits on
investments by banks in shares, convertible debentures and units
of mutual funds would stand automatically enhanced to the extent
of banks' investment in venture capital.
</P>
<P>
RBI has with immediate effect withdrawn general refinance
facility to banks and replaced it with a collateralised lending
facility of up to 0.25 percent of the fortnightly average
outstanding aggregate deposits in 1997-98 for two weeks at the
bank rate.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Financial Reform Relevant to Asia Economic Recovery: Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Tuesday the
reform of the international financial architecture (IFA) was
required as there was no guarantee that a financial turmoil like
the one which began in July 1997 would not recur.
</P>
<P>
Despite the signs of recovery shown by some crisis-hit Asian
economies, a revamp in the IFA remains a relevant issue, Second
Finance Minister Mustapa Mohamed told a press briefing here on
the forthcoming sixth APEC Finance Ministers' meeting to be held
in Malaysia next month.
</P>
<P>
The APEC finance ministers' meeting in Langkawi, a resort
island in northern Malaysia from May 15 to 16, will conduct a
follow-up on the reform issue and provide a momentum required to
get it resolved, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the APEC consultative efforts on the matter continue to
be important so as to avert the repeat of similar catastrophe in
the future.
</P>
<P>
As an informal consultative mechanism that brings together
leaders and ministers, the grouping is not in a position to play a
leading role on international financial issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
This role falls under the purview of the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund (MF), the Group of Seven and the Group
of 22 countries, Mustapa said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said APEC had contributed to resolving the crisis
and had been successful as one of the avenues for Malaysia and
other developing economies to express and push forward various
agenda including the reform of the IFA.
</P>
<P>
He said as the message on the need for the reform filtered
through, there is now a convergence of views from other countries,
including industrialized ones in support for such reform. But
progress is lacking as there has been no concrete action so far,
he added.
</P>
<P>
At the Langkawi meeting, the ministers are expected to exchange
views on the economic and financial situation in the region
including prospects for recovery as well as the future work
programs aimed at strengthening APEC's economies and financial
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The ministers would also consider the finalization of various
initiatives now underway with focus on efforts to strengthen
financial systems and promote the return of stable and sustainable
private capital flows into the region.

<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)

<HEADLINE> Pak Attracts More Investments in Oil, Gas Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Investments of 161 million U.S.
dollars were attracted in oil and gas exploration last year in
Pakistan, a top petroleum official Tuesday said at an
international conference here.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Federal Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources
Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan told the third Pakistan Oil and Gas Summit
that 36 new exploration agreements were signed in the year 1997-98
(July-June) covering an area of 135,000 square kilometers which
was a record in one year.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan received investment commitments worth 1.2 billion
dollars in the upstream and downstream petroleum sectors last
year, he added.
</P>
<P>
Accelerated exploration activity resulted in 16 oil and gas
discoveries during the year, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"Five of these gas discoveries are expected to add substantial
reserves of up to 5 to 6 trillion cubic feet resulting in an
increase of around 35 percent in our remaining reserves of natural
gas," Khan said.
</P>
<P>
He said a special focus was placed on offshore exploration and
an incentive package was introduced leading to the grant of first
ever exploration licence in deep waters last year.
</P>
<P>
The petroleum summit began on Tuesday and was attended by
representatives from Pakistani and international oil and gas
sector.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Tourism to Create 3.71 million Jobs by 2007 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' tourism industry
could be developed into a "great and reliable employment source"
and could absorb up to 3.71 million workers by 2007, a report of
the country's House of Representatives said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Department of Tourism sources as saying that
the country expects a movement of 16.204 million among domestic
tourists, who would spend about 53.47 billion pesos (about 1.3
billion U.S. dollars) by 2007.
</P>
<P>
"With the Philippines targeting visitor receipts of about 3.82
billion U.S. dollars from foreign arrivals of about 2.74 million,
this is definitely good news for the country," the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the prospects are based on several
global factors, including increasing long-haul travel, global
liberalization in tourism services, emergence of multilateral
aviation regime, growing middle-class and well-educated travel
groups, and advancements in information technology.
</P>
<P>
Also, recognition of travel and tourism as a basic human need,
increasing decision-making among women, and greater demand for
family-oriented travel will contribute to increased tourism
activity, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Mark 80th Anniversary of May 4 Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of well-known Chinese
scientists stressed at today's forum to commemorate the 80th
anniversary of the May 4 Movement that the future of the nation
depends on the fostering of a scientific spirit.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the China Association for Science and Technology (
CAST), the forum was one of the many events planned to mark the
anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, political and cultural movement
which flourished earlier this century.
</P>
<P>
"It aroused Chinese intellectuals, as well as the common people
and imbued in them a fervor for patriotism, science and democracy,
" said Zhou Guangzhao, vice-chairman of the National People's
Congress (NPC) Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
He added that the spirit advocated during the movement has
practical and immediate significance in scientific circles to this
day.
</P>
<P>
The movement also blew away the feudal system and outmoded
concepts which had ruled China for more than two millennia.
Theorists in the enlightenment movement believed that only
democracy and science could save and invigorate China.
</P>
<P>
Patriotism and good academic discipline should be emphasized in
the scientific circle today, said Zhou, who is also the president
of the CAST, and the scientific knowledge, spirit and thoughts
should be spread to the public.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending the forum said that science and technology
has taken deep root in all the fields of economic and social
developments in China 80 years after the May 4 Movement. Meanwhile,
the scientific spirit should enter the social life and become a
standard for the whole society.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the scientific spirit has an important role in
maintaining social stability, promoting economic development,
improving the people's life and in making decisions by the
government.
</P>
<P>
China has initiated the strategy of invigorating the nation
through science and technology, which is a development of late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's theory that science and technology

PHNOM PENH, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen will postpone a four-day official visit to India scheduled for
April 25-28, a government official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>

India.
</P>
<P>
India's 13-month-old Vajpayee coalition government collapsed
after it lost a vote of confidence in the Lower House of
Parliament Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Lose $1.7 Billion over Mines Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will lose about 1.7 billion
U.S. dollars because of the selling of its remaining copper mines
to Anglo American Corporation (ACC) instead of the Kafue
consortium.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Mail weekly Tuesday quoted Theo Bull, chairman of
the Committee on Small Business Development of Zambia Association
of Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI), as saying that the
country will lose the money as the ACC offer for the remaining
mines of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) is only 40
percent of the price that had been offered by the Kafue
consortium.
</P>
<P>
"A sale of the major mines at 40 percent of the value of the
promised investment we could have got two years ago from new
investors has many sad implications," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kafue's final bid submitted in May 1998 comprises cash of 130
million dollars, debt assumption of 35 million dollars, working
capital investment of 76 million, a five year capital investment
program of 708 million, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
ACC's bid of January 1999 comprises cash of 90 million dollars
without debt assumption and investment over three years of 300
million dollars representing a total commitment of 390 million
dollars for an 80 percent ownership, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"In simple arithmetical terms, the consortium's best bid at
1,060 million dollars for 88 percent share is roughly two and a
half times that of Anglo at 390 million dollars, 80 percent
share," he said.
</P>
<P>
He described the decision to refuse Kafue's offer as ill
advised and monumentally poor judgement.
</P>
<P>
Nchanga, Nkana and Konkola mines, which account for more than
two-thirds of Zambia's total copper mine assets, were sold to ACC
at the end of last year at 90 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
ACC has pledged to pump in 300 million dollars in three years
into the three mines of ZCCM.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government will retain a 20 percent share-holding
and establish a team to monitor ACC.
</P>
<P>
Due to disagreement over the cost of Nkana and Nchanga mines,
Zambia discontinued the negotiations with Kafue Consortium in
April last year over the sale of the two biggest mines in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In May last year, donors pledged to give the country an aid of
530 million dollars. However, they withheld the money to pressure
it to speed up the privatization of ZCCM.

<HEADLINE> N. Ireland Secretary Confident Over Peace Deal Despite Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Secretary
Marjorie Mowlam said on Tuesday she was confident that a way
forward could be found in the peace process, despite the latest
setback in breaking the deadlock over decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
Talks on Monday between the British and Irish prime ministers
and leading party leaders of the province ended without progress
on the crucial issue of paramilitary disarmament and the formation
of the province's power-sharing executive.
</P>
<P>
But Mowlam said she was confident that all parties would be
working for a solution when talks resume next week.
</P>
<P>
"What I believe is that all sides want the Good Friday
Agreement to work," she was quoted by BBC as saying.
</P>
<P>
"They all accept, I think, that there is no clear alternative
and that this is the best chance we have for so many years."
</P>
<P>
"What's important is that no one walks, we keep talking and try
to find some way forward that both traditions are happy with," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon, of the
Irish Social Democratic and Labour Party, accused both the Ulster
Unionists and Sinn Fein of trying to hold the peace process to
ransom.
</P>
<P>
They were maintaining positions that could "destroy something
which can create a totally new way of life for all of us," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionist Party refuses to sit in a coalition
structure with Sinn Fein until the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
hands in arms but Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, says the
decommissioning was not a precondition of the peace agreement for
the party to join the local executive.

<HEADLINE> 48 Insurance Co.s Liquidated in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The National Insurance Commission
(NAICOM) of Nigeria is to revoke the licenses of 48 insurance
companies for non- compliance with statutory deposit payment to
the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
</P>
<P>
Out of the 48 companies, 19 are being shut down with immediate
effect while the other 29 will be effective from May 15, The
Guardian newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a sensitization of the insurance sector, only 29 companies
were cleared to engage in insurance business while 80 others were
placed on the waiting list for having paid the mandatory 50
percent of their paid-up share capital to the bank.
</P>
<P>
The Commissioner for Insurance, Chief Dipo Bailey, was quoted
as saying Monday that the process of clearance would continue
until May 15, adding certificates for final approval have been
given to those 29 companies while an additional list will be
published when more companies are cleared.
</P>
<P>
According to him, a consortium of 25 accounting companies has
been contracted to assess the solvency of approved insurers and to
prepare others for liquidation as part of the "on-going
sensitization of the insurance industry in line with international
standard".
</P>
<P>
The insurance chief ruled out a reprieve for affected
companies, saying the door was "officially closed" on the matter
at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Under the Insurance Decree taking into effect in 1997, any
insurance company wishing to do business in Nigeria must deposit
with the bank 50 percent of its capital base.
</P>
<P>
The decree raised the capital base for insurance companies from
a minimum of 5 million naira (90 naira equal to one U.S. dollar)
to 20 million naira while at the same time pegging the maximum at
10 million naira to 90 million naira.
</P>
<P>
Since the promulgation of the decree, the deadline for
implementation of the decree has been extended twice as the hands
of NAICOM had all along been tied by the lingering court action
instituted against it by the underwriters under the aegis of the
Nigerian Insurance Association.
</P>
<P>
In its ruling last Wednesday, the Lagos High Court directed
insurance companies in the west African country to comply with the
decree by depositing 50 percent of their statutory capital base
with the bank.
</P>
<P>
There are 140 insurance companies, five reinsurance houses and
more than 50 brokerage companies operating in the most populous
African country.

BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank (CCB)
announced today that it will grant loans totaling 40 billion yuan
to the nation's housing sector this year.
</P>
<P>
A CCB spokesman said a major portion of the loans will be
earmarked for the housing consumption sector, with individuals
receiving some 30 billion yuan for housing purchases.
</P>

The spokesman noted that the CCB's outstanding real estate
loans hit 261.7 billion yuan by the end of 1998, with the figure
for individual housing loans totaling 69.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
New individual housing loans accounted for 10.4 percent of the
increase in the bank's total loans.
</P>
<P>
The CCB's real estate loan target for this year focuses on
satisfying market demand while minimizing risks. Priority will be
placed on individual housing mortgage loans, the development of
profitable real estate projects and low-cost residential housing.
</P>
<P>
The CCB will make further efforts to improve service for
housing loans, according to the spokesman.

<P>
LUSAKA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambia police arrested Basil
Kabwe, administrative secretary of the opposition United National
Independence Party (UNIP) led by former President Kenneth Kaunda,
Zambia Daily Mail reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The national newspaper quoted Kabwe's lawyer Mwangala Zaloumis
as confirming that Kabwe was arrested here Monday and was charged
with alarming the nation.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Kabwe as saying that "I have been charged formally
and I would not like to comment on the matter because I would be
doing it out of emotion."
</P>
<P>
Zaloumis said her client is expected to appear in court soon.
</P>
<P>
Kabwe was quoted by the South African Mail &AMP; Guardian of April
9-15 as saying he had seen eight trucks in a procession allegedly
heading for the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Last Friday the police questioned Kabwe over his alleged supply
of information to some sections of the South African press on the
supply of arms to UNITA.
</P>
<P>
One day before, Kabwe was picked up and questioned by the
country's security personnel and was freed later.
</P>
<P>
Recently the Angolan government has repeatedly accused Zambia
of supplying arms to UNITA rebels but Zambia has categorically
denied the accusations.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Development Zones Enjoys Preferential Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Economic and
Technological Development Zone (BETDZ) enjoys the same
preferential policies as state-level new and high technology
development zones.
</P>
<P>
Domestic enterprises engaged in high and new technology
development also benefit from preferential policies which include
15 percent income tax reduction, tax exemptions for the first two
years of operation following the acquisition of business licenses,
and a 50 percent tax reduction for the following three years.
Related preferential policies were previously restricted to
overseas-funded and export-oriented enterprises located in the
zone.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that the new preferential policies
attracted 44 new enterprises to the zone in the first quarter of
this year, a 4.5-fold rise on the previous year's period. Total
added investments during the period grew by 1.7-fold to 68 million
yuan (about 8.2 million U.S. dollars). Eleven of the new overseas-
funded enterprises involved cumulative investments of 56.81
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
A further analysis shows that world-famous overseas
corporations accounted for the bulk of new arrivals. Total
combined investments from the German-based Hoechst Group, which
focuses on pharmaceuticals and chemicals, and the Tontrush Group
approached 29 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some 30-odd multinational corporations, including SMC,
Panasonic and Shiseido from Japan, Swiss-based ABB, Bayer and
Henkel from Germany, Britain's Unilever, U.S.-based Lucent, Coca
Cola and McDonald's, accounted for over 60 percent of total
investments in place by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Zone officials disclosed that plans for this year call for the
zone's sales volume to hit five billion yuan, with the fiscal
income expected to rise to 500 million yuan and export value to 80
million U.S. dollars. Growth rates for the respective areas are
expected to hover between 20-40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The development zone, founded in 1992, has played an important
role in the city's economic development. The BETDZ is currently
home to 338 enterprises with total investment of 1.72 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Growth rates for the zone's sales volume, fiscal income and
industrial output value during the first quarter of the year
surpassed 50 percent.

<P>
YANGON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is making preparations to
join an upcoming meeting with Thailand and a trilateral
ministerial meeting among Myanmar, Thailand and Laos on
cooperation in eradication of narcotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
The meetings will be be held later this month in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary meeting held here Monday was attended by Colonel
Tin Hlaing, Myanmar Minister of Home Affairs and chairman of the
Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control, and Colonel Thein Nyunt,
minister of Progress of Border Areas and National Races and
Development Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed implementation of the resolutions passed
by the 42nd meeting of U.N. Drug Control Program, the New Light of
Myanmar newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Thailand have been cooperating in drug control. The
anti-narcotics authorities of the two countries agreed at a
cross-border meeting in Tachilek in January this year to step up
drug suppression cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Also during a visit by Myanmar leader Senior-General Than Shwe
to Thailand last month, the two governments pledged to further
enhance their cooperation in the drug fight aimed at turning the
common border of the two countries into a border of friendship,
harmony and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Laos also cooperate in drug control. During Myanmar
Foreign Minister U Win Aung's visit to Laos last month, the two
sides signed an agreement on prevention of trafficking of drug and
psychotropic substances, and on control of banned chemical
substances.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar, Thailand and Laos, at their third
ministerial conference on cooperation in drug control held in
Vientiane in July 1997, agreed to cooperate in eradicating opium
poppy cultivation in the border areas and combating trafficking of
chemicals and materials for the production of narcotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
The three countries then also called for coordination among
their law enforcement agencies with exchange of information on
drug control measures and enacting laws and rules on drug abuse
control in the sub-region.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The '99 International
Reproductive Health and Family Planning Expo, sponsored by the
State Family Planning Commission (SFPC), will be held in Beijing,
the Chinese capital, in August.
</P>
<P>
Government organizations and enterprises from both at home and
abroad will introduce information and products related to
reproductive healthcare.
</P>
<P>
"China should focus on improving healthcare in conjunction with
controlling population growth," said SFPC Vice Director Yang Kuifu,
adding that the lack of knowledge related to reproductive health
is one of the major factors causing birth defects among new-born
babies in China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has 130 million illiterate and semi-
illiterate citizens. The country thus has a large group of people
with inadequate healthcare knowledge to care themselves and their
children. More than 200,000 disabled infants are born in China
each year.
</P>
<P>
Incidence rates for sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) and
HIV/AIDS are also on the rise, with 12,000 reported HIV cases and
417 AIDS patients nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Beijing hosted a national forum on population and resources in
March, with the central government using the event to stress the
urgent need to disseminate information in order to eradicate
ignorance concerning reproductive healthcare and reduce the
incidence rate for STDs.
</P>
<P>
The expo, scheduled for August 16-30, will also be held in
Shanghai, Dalian, Chongqing and Shenzhen if proven successful in
Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Nosedown on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Share prices gyrated from
positive to negative territory on Singapore Stock Market Tuesday,
dragged down by some profit-taking encouraged by the weak
performance on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index plunged 32.83 points to
finish at 1,809.48 points.
</P>
<P>
The total volume decreased to 651.75 million units worth 979.22
million Singapore dollars (572.81 million U.S. dollars). Decliners
outnumbered advancers by 189 to 126 with 119 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The larger block was the 36.47 million stock parcel by Tuan S
which was transacted at 0.31 Singapore dollars per share. UIC was
the second most active mover with 18.26 million stocks done.
KimEng was the next with 18.05 million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Transmarco headed the ascent of the day with a rise of 32 cents
to 2.86 Singapore dollars. Cerebos and OCBC picked up 20 cents to
finish at 3.88 and 10.20 Singapore dollars respectively. ST Comp
moved up 15 cents to finish at 1.42 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Creative 50 was the biggest loser of the day
with a loss of 2.60 Singapore dollars to end at 22.70 Singapore
dollars. It was followed by Venture which shed 80 cents to close
at 9.20 Singapore dollars. CityDev retreated 70 cents to finish at
11.60 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers noted that the market finally relented to correction
after soaring up nearly 20 percent in March supported by fund
flows into the region from institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
The past two weeks saw a powerful liquidity run not seen since
the heady days of the last bull market in 1993.
</P>
<P>
As previous bull run rallies since the start of the Asian
crisis in July 1997 have proved short-lived, many market watchers
expected a correction although the market bullish behavior had
belied their expectation.
</P>
<P>
Dealers also said the disappointing figures released by
Singapore's Trade Development Board on the country's external
trade in March 1999 had somewhat affected the market sentiment and
accelerated profit-taking.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Businessmen in HK Support China's Entry into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of senior members
of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (AmCham) will
travel to Washington DC this weekend to pledge the support of the
American business community in Hong Kong for China's accession to
the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The AmCham said Tuesday it hopes to build on the momentum of
recent weeks as significant progress has been made on the WTO
talks.
</P>
<P>
"AmCham applauds the U.S. and Chinese negotiators for reaching
a breakthrough in their 13-year stalemate and is fully committed
to working with U.S. policy makers to overcome the remaining trade
obstacles preventing China's membership," said AmCham Chairman
Jason Felton.
</P>
<P>
AmCham's three-pronged strategy this year will be to expedite
China's WTO accession on commercially meaningful term; voice its
support for the renewal of the normal trade relations status for
China; and, once a successful WTO accord has been reached, will
lobby the U.S. Congress extensively to pass legislation that would
grant permanent normal trade relations status for China.
</P>
<P>
The AmCham delegation will be in Washington DC from April 26-30,
when meetings will be held with more than 150 senior
administration officials as well as members of the Congress.

<HEADLINE> Economists: Kosovo War Hurts Euro Zone Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Though it's too early to count the
cost of NATO's attack on Yugoslavia, one early casualty is the
euro and a second could be consumer confidence in the 11-country
currency union, according to a Reuters survey of leading
economists.
</P>
<P>
The infant currency has been hitting record lows, beset by
worries over the Kosovo crisis. If the war is prolonged and
ground troops are sent in, consumer confidence could be the next
victim, dampening the euro zone's already weak growth prospects,
the Reuters quoted economists saying.
</P>
<P>
"The main negative could be through weaker consumer sentiment
which is the main linchpin holding up the economy," said Julian
Callow of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in London. "The Gulf War led
to a mild U.S. recession; a nasty flare-up in the Balkans could
easily do the same for Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If consumer confidence goes, we're in trouble," said Daniel
Gros of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one out of 37 economists surveyed April 14-16 predicted
a protracted conflict would have a moderate impact on economic
growth while five thought it would be significant.
</P>
<P>
It could mean "greater deficits, higher interest rates, lower
growth rates and more instability", said ING Bank's Fred Pallada
in Amsterdam. Tourism revenues would also be hit, said Alison
Cottrell of PaineWebber in London.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Water Leaks Out At Indian Atomic Power Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- About six tons of heavy water
leaked out last month during inspection of a coolant channel tube
at an atomic power station in Madras, 2,090 km south of here, the
Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some of the repair workers were exposed to excess tritium which
was said mildly radioactive, PTI said, quoting officials of
Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL).
</P>
<P>
A committee was set up to investigate the cause of the leak,
review the design of the special sealing plug used for inspection
from where the leak occurred and suggest remedial measures to
avoid recurrence of such incidents, NPCIL officials said.
</P>
<P>
The leak at Unit Two of the Madras Atomic Power Station on
March 26 was initially categorized as a "below scale" or "zero"
event in the international nuclear event scale which ranges from
zero to seven.
</P>
<P>
NPCIL officials said the incident was under review and the
rating of the incident was expected to be one.
</P>
<P>
They said the workers engaged in rectification of the leak wore
protective plastic suits to avoid tritium uptake and there was no
adverse effect on reactor safety during the incident, or abnormal
release of radioactivity.

<HEADLINE> France Does Not Rule out NATO Ground Intervention in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- France said on Tuesday that a NATO
ground intervention against Yugoslavia is not excluded, but the
political objective of NATO, which is to stop violence against
Kosovars, remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Alain Richard said in an interview with
LCI television channel that "it is normal that we exclude nothing.
"
</P>
<P>
But he refused to give such kind of information which could "
help the adversary."
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO is prepared for "an entry on the ground by
the force of security, which is the necessary support to a
political solution."
</P>
<P>
About 12,000 NATO soldiers are deployed in Macedonia, waiting
for a peace agreement on Kosovo, he said.
</P>
<P>
The objective is to control the violence, he said, while
accusing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of "taking two
million people hostage."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said on
Tuesday that NATO will increase the number of targets to be struck
in the air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the U.S. newspaper International Herald
Tribune, Vedrine said that the objective of NATO airstrikes is to
"bring about a change to the regime of Serbia."
</P>
<P>
He said this objective is shared by not only Western countries,
but also Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The immediate objective of the bombings is to break the
military forces which the regime uses for the repression. Public
opinion understands these limits and supports our action," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Build Closer Ties With Russia: Sharif </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 20 -- Pakistani Prime Minister Mian Nawaz Sharif
said his country is ready to build closer relations with Russia,
Russian newspaper Izvestia reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the newspaper, Sharif, who arrived in
Moscow Monday for a three-day official visit, said the two
countries should work for a lasting all-round cooperative
relationship in accordance with the interests of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, the first Pakistani prime minister to visit Russia in
25 years, laid special emphasis on economic cooperation between
Pakistan and Russia, which he said has great potentials and should
precede cooperation in other areas.
</P>
<P>
He also called for close coordination between the two sides on
regional and global matters.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in South Asia, Sharif said the unresolved
Kashmir issue remains the cause of discord and tension between
Pakistan and India. The Pakistani government is exerting all
efforts to avoid a nuclear arms race with India and hoping for the
establishment of a strategic containing system in South Asia to
head off armed conflicts and maintain regional stability.
</P>
<P>
On Afghanistan, Sharif said Pakistan supports all efforts aimed
at realizing lasting peace in that country, noting that Pakistan
and Russia have had a series of consultations in the past few
months in a bid to carry on the peace process in Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
received a loan of over three billion shillings (around 47
million U.S. dollars) from the World Bank for developing tourism
and guaranteeing its security.
</P>
<P>
World Bank country director Harold Walkman said here Monday
that a total of 550 million shillings had been set for the
purchase of vehicles and equipment, of which 465 million
shillings had been disbursed for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Walkman made the remarks when he handed over 41 vehicles to
Richard Leakey, director of the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) at
the KWS headquarters in capital Nairobi, the Kenya Times paper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the World Bank would maintain dialog with the Kenyan
government while seeking ways in which they could contribute
toward Kenya' s growth of wildlife and other related sectors.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has been a partner with Kenya in developing
appropriate policies and institutional arrangements as well as
legal backing to ensure sustainable growth of the tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that earings from tourism in Kenya accounted
for eight percent of its gross national product last year and the
sector is the second foreign exchange earner after agriculture.

WELLINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government has
said it will not push for United Nations peacekeepers to intervene
in East Timor before July despite rising violence there, the
Evening Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Don
McKinnon as saying that U.N. peacekeepers would not land in East
Timor until after the expected referendum on the territory's
future in July.
</P>
<P>
He added that they will enter East Timor only if they have
Indonesia's permission.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper said McKinnon has refused to
push for an early deployment of U.N. peacekeepers even though New
Zealand troops are on standby to join such a force.
</P>
<P>
McKinnon said New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and
Defense Minister Max Bradford are monitoring the growing crisis in
East Timor. He himself expects to visit Jakarta early next month
to express New Zealand's concerns about events in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Since violence began recently in East Timor, the New Zealand
Government has urged Indonesia to disarm the paramilitary groups
and hoped that the U.N.-sponsored talks between Portugal,
Indonesia and East Timorese leaders on Thursday will make
progress.

<HEADLINE> Uganda: A Success Story in Anti-Drug Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has intensified its
efforts against drug smuggling and has proved a success story in
this aspect since 1996.
</P>
<P>
The country's Police Anti-Narcotics Unit has impounded one
million kilos of marijuana, 10,320 kilos of heroin and 1.8 kilos
of cocaine over this period, Tuesday's Monitor paper quoted the
latest report by the Interpol as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report said a total 266 people, including 22 foreigners
from Nigeria, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania and Kenya, have been
arrested while trying to smuggle marijuana out of the country.
Some 27 heroin smugglers and three cocaine traffickers have been
netted.
</P>
<P>
So far 150 have been charged and convicted while 81 cases are
pending, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The most common route used by drug traffickers from the Indian
sub- continent and Far East to Uganda has been Bombay-New Delhi
via Lahore-Tehran to the east Africa airports, a senior police
officer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report, however, indicated a marked increase in trafficking
through Kigali, Rwanda, to Uganda by road to avoid detection at
Entebbe International Airport.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Loses $1 Million Per Week After Fish Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Uganda loses one million U.S.
dollars in foreign exchange earnings per week after the European
Union (EU) has tightened a knot on the temporary ban on fish
exports from east Africa.
</P>
<P>
Nsimbe Bulega, principal fisheries officer, made the revelation
Monday, according ot the Monitor daily.
</P>
<P>
He said the fisheries department had embarked on monitoring of
landing sites and submitted fish samples to government chemists as
one of the measures to evaluate methods to stem fish poisoning.
</P>
<P>
The EU has issued guidelines to east African countries before
lifting the ban. It demanded providing comprehensive information
on the control of sources of contamination.
</P>
<P>
They also asked for the details of quality control at the level
of individual fishing vessel to include guarantees concerning the
fishermen's knowledge of good hygiene practices. The conditions
were issued during a meeting held on April 14-15 in Brussels,
Belgium by 15 members of the European bloc and representatives
from the east African region.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided on April 12 to temporarily suspend importation
of fish from Kenya and Tanzania. The decision did not feature
Uganda because Uganda already imposed a ban on March 22.
</P>
<P>
Due to a fish ban imposed by the EU in December 1997, the value
of fish exports dropped by 11.6 percent from 34.6 million dollars
in 1996/1997 financial year to 31 million dollars in 1997/1998
because EU countries used to be the main importers of Uganda's
fish products.

BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A total of 5,447 private
enterprises were established in Beijing in the first quarter of
this year, up 35.4 percent on the 1998 period, according to
statistics released by the Beijing Municipal Bureau for Industry
and Commerce.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Modest Growth Forecast for Namibia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian economy is
projected to grow below three percent this year despite the
expected good growth in tourism and fishing.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Business Day newspaper Tuesday quoted the annual
report of the Bank of Namibia as saying that the growth would be
far below the average growth rate of five percent envisaged in the
First National Development Plan, and would be insufficient to
bring about an improvement in the per capita income of Namibians.
</P>
<P>
The paper did not say exactly when the annual report was
released.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the bank's governor, Tom Alweendo, as saying that
positive growth prospects for this year were expected to come from
the fishing and tourism industries as mining could remain weak
because of depressed international commodity markets.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is expected to benefit from the depreciation of the
Namibian dollar last year.
</P>
<P>
Fishing also seemed to have recovered fully and expectations
were that the sector's growth would surpass the robust rate of
last year. The projected growth rate of below three percent,
however, overturns a dismal one percent growth rate recorded last
year.
</P>
<P>
The projected economic growth would still be outstripped by the
country's population growth -- currently at about 3.2 percent a
year. This would mean gross domestic product per capita would keep
declining, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Chain Store Sales Exceed 100 Billion Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China's booming chain store
industry recorded 100 billion yuan (12 billion US dollars) in
sales last year, up 70 percent on an annual basis, according to a
recent report released by the China Internal Trade Bureau and
Chain Store Association.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 sales volume for supermarkets, convenience stores and
large warehouse stores hit 60 billion yuan, up 43 percent on 1997.
</P>
<P>
China has 71 chain store enterprises with annual sales
exceeding 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Total 1998 retail sales of consumer goods stood at 2,900
billion yuan, up 6.8 percent on 1997.
</P>
<P>
Zha Lihua, an official with China Internal Trade Bureau, noted
that chain store corporations have adopted measures including
mergers, restructuring, acquisitions and partnerships in recent
years. Related measures enabled the corporations to expand their
scale and effectively use the tangible resources of small chain
stores.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-seven of 121 enterprises with annual sales exceeding 50
million yuan were partnership chain stores, up 6.7 percent on 1997.
</P>
<P>
Zha pointed to the declining annual sales of large department
stores and the rapid growth of the chain store industry has
injected vigor into the retail sales industry.
</P>
<P>
She added that China's rural market offer vast consumption
potential. However, according to Zha, the shortage of goods
suitable to the rural market and inconvenient transportation has
limited efforts to tap existing potential
</P>
<P>
China has introduced concrete measures to accelerate the reform
of sales patterns in order to stimulate domestic consumption, and
will further develop the rural market potential by establishing
chain stores and expanding sales outlets.
</P>
<P>
Analysts further noted that strengthening management over the
trade and wholesale markets will help fuel growth of the chain
store industry.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Cotton Industry Facing Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Falling global commodity prices
and a slump in seed cotton yield for 1998/1999 season has put
zambia's cotton industry under severe pressure.
</P>
<P>
Seed cotton output for the current season has fallen by as much
as 25 percent to between 70,000 and 80,000 tons from the 105,000
tons of the previous season,Times of Zambia reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On the world market, the price of lint cotton has fallen by
31.25 percent in 12 months from 80 U.S. cents a pound, while the
excessive rains at the beginning of the season have affected
Zambia's cotton output.
</P>
<P>
Both Lonrho cotton managing director Nicky Wilkinson and Amaka
cotton ginneries general manager Titus Ikowa, representing some of
the leading players in the country's cotton industry, pointed to
the general slack in the world economy particularly in South East
Asia, which has dampened demand for the commodity.
</P>
<P>
Whereas farmers were offered 570 kwacha (about 24 U.S. cents)
per kilogram of seed cotton last year, the offer price this season
will depend on the development that will take place on the market.
</P>
<P>
Indications so far point to a price offer which is either equal
to last year's or slightly less.
</P>
<P>
Lonrho cotton has this season given out four million dollars in
pre- financing loans to farmers although the company is still owed
1.8 million dollars in credit by the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson said it is unhealthy for his company to continue
carrying over the debt overhang from the farmers because it will
greatly reduce the company's ability to provide financing for the
production.
</P>
<P>
On the quality of Zambia's seed cotton, he said the country's
seed cotton is among the highest grade in terms of quality but
that the packaging of the product in polypropylene has affected
the lint and final textile products.
</P>
<P>
Lonrho cotton will introduce cotton picking bags made of cotton
and jute packing bags as a way of resolving the problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, "Lonrho cotton believes in the Zambian cotton
industry, we believe in long term profitability, and with the
land, the climate and the human resource the industry will win out
in the end if the fundamentals are right," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ikowa said there is no need for Zambian raw cotton to be
exported before it is processed and value added to it because the
country has the capacity to process the cotton.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Expressway System Ranks Eighth Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua)-- China had put a 6,258-km
expressway system into operation by the end of last year, with the
length ranking eighth in the world, an official of the Ministry of
Communications said here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 12,600 km of expressways are still under construction,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
China initiated the construction of expressways in 1988 and
accelerated related projects during the 1990s. An average of 1,372
km of expressway was built annually in the past three years, with
1,487 km completed in 1998 alone.
</P>
<P>
China has used over 4.5 billion U.S. dollars provided by
international monetary organizations and foreign governments. A
large amount of funds was raised by various expressway companies
issuing H-shares in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
State funding and private investments have also accounted for a
substantial portion of related funds.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the length of the expressway systems
still falls short of demand. His ministry has plans for completing
two north-south and two east-east expressways by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
China will have five north-south and seven east-west
expressways by 2010, he added.

MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has ordered the release of an additional 200 million pesos
(5 million U.S. dollars) for an emergency loan facility to workers
who lost their jobs or suffered income cuts as a result of the
currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Philippines' Social Security System (SSS)
Carlos Arellano said Tuesday that borrowers must present a
certification from their employers attesting that they suffered
lower pay not earlier than July 7, 1997 as a result of job
rotation or reduced work hours.
</P>
<P>
The additional funding brings to 500 million pesos (12.5
million dollars) the total amount intended for emergency loans to
workers. The 300 million pesos (7.5 million dollars) already
allocated for the program after it was launched in April last
year, has been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
Arellano said the loan facility will be open to active SSS
members who were affected by the crisis, including overseas
Filipino members.
</P>
<P>
The SSS will process a maximum loan of 12,500 pesos (312.5
dollars) at a 6-percent interest rate per annum and payable in two
years after a 12-month moratorium until the 200 million (5 million
dollars) is exhausted.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM to Meet Israeli Prime Ministerial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov is to arrive in Israel on Thursday in a gesture to despel
talks that Russia favors incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in the May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
According to the Israeli Foreign Ministry, Ivanov is slated to
meet with three prime ministerial candidates Ehud Barak of the
Labor party, and Yitzhak Mordechai of the center party and
Netanyahu of the Likud bloc.
</P>
<P>
The meetings were arranged at the request of the Russian side,
which is seeking to counter the impression that Russia has been
intervening in Israel's election campaign in an effort to promote
Netanyahu's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
When Netanyahu visited Moscow last month, Russian Prime
Minister Yevgevy Primakov was widely reported to have said if
he were an Israeli citizen, he would vote for Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
After hearing those remarks of Primakov, Barak, Mordechai and
leaders of other political parties launched their attacks against
Netanyahu, saying Netanyahu's Russian visit was nothing but an
election campaign in Moscow to drum up support of over 600,000
Russian immigrants in Israel.
</P>
<P>
While in Israel, Ivanov is also set to hold meetings with
President Ezer Weizman, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and
Minister of Industry and Trade Natan Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials are expected to raise the issue of
Russia's sales of military technology and equipment to Iran, as
well as Russia's reported plan to sell anti-tank weaponry to
Syria.
</P>
<P>
The issue of promoting strategic cooperation between Israel and
Russia will also be on the agenda.

<HEADLINE> France: Legal Basis Needed for Oil Embargo on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- France said on Tuesday that a solid
legal basis is needed to impose an oil embargo on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
France expressed doubt about the U.S. call for oil embargo
which it said could turn the Adriatic Sea into a second Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"There is no disagreement about the objective (of blocking
Yugoslavia's oil import), but we need a solid legal basis which
does not exist," said French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine in an
interview with the daily newspaper Le Figaro.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia imports oil from tankers calling at the coast of
Montenegro and through oil pipelines running through its
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. daily New York Times said that Washington has proposed
imposing an oil embargo on Yugoslavia by banning oil shipments by
the sea.
</P>
<P>
"The objective is logic. But we need a solid legal basis. But
it does not exist. We need to think about it more," said Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
American officials said that it is ridiculous to risk the lives
of NATO pilots bombing oil storage centers and refineries in
Yugoslavia, while Belgrade continues to obtain oil supplies from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials made the proposal at a NATO ambassadors' meeting
last week in Brussels, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said that the Americans made the proposal in "a
somewhat rash way" because the proposal has not been subjected to
enough study.
</P>
<P>
"To transform the Adriatic Sea into a Persian Gulf is not
necessarily a good idea," he said.

Reality Check researchers, who made a survey of 3,000 house-the
holds countrywide, looked at eight criteria: formal housing; an
inside toilet; inside water; rubbish removal; more than basic
education; enough food; above minimum income; and employment.
</P>
<P>
Most people surveyed live in formal brick homes, nine percent
in shacks, and around three in 10 in rural farm homes or huts.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the homes had an inside flush toilet. Inside tap
water is enjoyed by almost all whites and Indians and one third of
black people.
</P>
<P>
Seven in 10 black family use electricity. More than nine in 10
whites, Indians and coloreds have their rubbish removed at least
weekly against 55 percent of black house-holds.
</P>
<P>
Only two percent of whites, three percent of Indians and 11
percent of coloreds, against one third of Black people, go hungry
a few times a month.
</P>
<P>
Education has steadily improved. Almost all African children
are now receiving some education.
</P>
<P>
One in three people surveyed have a full-time job, while a
quarter are jobless.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that income levels were difficult to pinpoint
since many people refused to reveal this information.

convoys in Kosovo last week.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO's "mistaken" bombing of a refugee convoy last Wednesday
has led to a surge in skepticism with a significant minority of
British voters "thinking again" about their support for the air
raids on Yugoslavia, according to the Guardian/ICM opinion poll
published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Labor Party leader Tony Blair, now prime minister, had told
Liberal Democratic Party leader Paddy Ashdown on polling day in
1997 that he would form a coalition government with the Liberal
Democrats even if he won a bigger than expected majority.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Political Settlement of Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua)-- Chinese government calls for
immediate halt of military action so as to bring the settlement of
Kosovo crisis back to the track of political settlement, Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Sun Yuxi said here Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"If NATO sends ground forces to Yugoslavia, it will make the
regional situation deteriorated and more complicated," said the
spokesman in reply to a question at a routine press conference.
</P>
<P>
Since air strike against Yugoslavia began about four weeks ago,
Chinese government has for many times called on NATO to stop
military action and seek political solution of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin has reiterated on four occasions
the stand of the Chinese government, which is quite unprecedented.
In his oral message to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
his letter in reply to U.S. President Bill Clinton, Jiang stressed
that China opposes the random use of force or the threat of use of
force by dint of military advantage.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Kosovo issue should be solved fairly and
reasonably through negotiations under the prerequisite that the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia should be
respected, and legitimate rights and interests of all ethnic
groups in Kosovo guaranteed.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO Secretary General Javier Solana announced on Monday
that the Apache "tank killers" will come into action next week.
This could mark a qualitative jump in the NATO engagement against
Yugoslavia. The U.S. sophisticated helicopters will let NATO
forces get closer to the ground instead of staying at high
altitude during bombing operations.
</P>
<P>
-- A column of vehicles, apparently civilian, from 20 to 25
kilometers long, is moving near Pristina and heading toward
southern Kosovo. About 850,000 people are displaced or considered
in danger inside Kosovo, according to NATO.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The flow of Kosovo Albanians seeking refuge in Albania or
Macedonia stopped on Monday, after the cutting of diplomatic
relations between Belgrade and Tirana and the closure of borders.
This has caused new worries about the fate of thousands of people.

BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's
current official visit to Canada has scored "positive achievements,
" Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sun Yuxi said at a routine press
conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that Premier Zhu paid an official visit to Canada from
April 14 to 20 at the invitation of Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien. It is the first official visit to Canada paid by Zhu in
his capacity of premier and also a return visit for Chretien's
China tour last year.
</P>
<P>
Sun said, Premier Zhu and Canadian officials including Chretien
held frank, friendly and constructive talks on Sino-Canadian
relationship and regional and international issues of common

bilateral negotiations for China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and affirmed the progress on this issue. The
two sides have also expressed determination to make more efforts
for reaching an agreement on this issue as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican FM for Regional Conflict Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Minister of Foreign
Affairs and Cooperation Leonardo Simao has called for the setting
up of regional conflict resolution mechanism as an effective
functional agency of the Southern African Development COmmunity
(SADC).
</P>
<P>
Simao made the call Monday during a speech at parliament, the
Noticias newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are making efforts in safeguarding regional peace through
joint exercises and changes of experience among regional
partners," he said.
</P>
<P>
After recalling the Mozambique's participation of liberation
struggle in Zimbabwe and South Africa, Simao said the challenges
now facing southern Africa are regional stability, economic growth
and development.
</P>
<P>
The African continent is getting more and more marginalized in
the globalization process due to the unstable factors in the Great
Lakes region and Angola, in Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Lesotho, as
well as constant border conflicts, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the foreign minister, his government believed that
peace does not necessarily mean without war. The instability in
Mozambique's neighbors mean lack of security in the country
itself, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has been working for regional stability through
diplomatic and security channels such as enhancing cooperation and
coordination to prevent and eliminate crisis.
</P>
<P>
Simao revealed that his country will take actions against
crimes to ensure stability in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The sub-region is rich in natural resources, with 90 percent of
the world's platinum, 85 percent of chromium, 75 percent of
manganese and 50 percent of gold.

standardization, quality assurance, metrology and testing next
month now that the funds have been secured.
</P>
<P>
Financial Mail weekly Tuesday quoted COMESA Secretary General

</P>
<P>
The money is intended to help member countries develop

industries in training.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha said industry is of critical importance in revitalizing
 economies in the region and the integration of African economies
in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
Given the globalization of trade inherent in the current world
order, it is important for the countries in the region to not only

<HEADLINE> Border Trade on Increase in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The total value of imports and
exports in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province for the first
quarter this year has reached 243.13 million U.S. dollars, up 7.5
percent from the corresponding 1998 period.
</P>
<P>
The import value for the first quarter was 103.57 million U.S.
dollars, 30.9 percent more than last year, and exports were 95.1
million, a slight increase over the same period of last year. So
far, 148 enterprises in the province have engaged in import and
export business, 12 more than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that imports have focused on timber, paper pulp,
steel, and chemical materials, occupying 83.2 percent of the total,
and timber import value was 29.39 million U.S. dollars, 28.4
percent of the total. The main exports have been clothing, light
industrial products, food, and textiles, with textiles accounting
for 34.3 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Ji Qingfu, an official with the Heilongjiang Provincial Border
Trade Administrative Bureau, said there are two reasons for the
increase. One, greater competitiveness has inspired the vitality
of the enterprises; two, enterprises initiated some timely changes
to suit the changing market. For example, the state's forest-
protection policy has accelerated imports of timber and paper pulp
from Russia.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Occupation of Lebanese Village Disrupts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel's occupation last week
of a village in south Lebanon has forced the U.S. to cut short a
mediation effort aimed at having a Lebanese gendarmerie unit
deployed in the village, a local daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. holds that the fencing off of the village of Arnoun by
Israeli army was a surprise and disrupted an effort that had been
supported by the Lebanese government, the Haaretz daily said.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed that Hezbollah guerrillas were using Arnoun as
a launching pad for attacks on its military outposts in the
so-called security zone in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had suggested that Beirut send government troops into
the village, which sits just outside the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government had first denied the initiative, made
at Israel's behest, for fear that the deployment of such forces
would be interpreted as an action directed against Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
But it eventually agreed to station gendarmes in the village
since the gendarmerie is a police unit and will be perceived to be
upholding Lebanese law and sovereignty, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Washington's mediation effort, however, was terminated after
Israeli soldiers entered Arnoun and set up barbed wire around it
last Friday, several days after an Israeli soldier was killed by
a roadside bomb near the village.
</P>
<P>
Arnoun came under spotlight in mid-February when the Israeli
army fenced off this mostly-deserted village to include it into
the security zone, claiming that Hezbollah guerrillas had used it
as bases in violation of a ceasefire understanding reached in
1996.
</P>
<P>
But with the support of the Lebanese government, angry student
protesters tore down the fence a few days later.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the 15-kilometer-deep "security zone" in south
Lebanon in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its northern
border areas.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since been the most active
guerrilla groups fighting to end the Israeli occupation.

side would strictly observe the principles set in the Sino-

Friendship and ensure the relations between China and Japan to
develop in a healthy way.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi made remarks at a

He said that Tokyo and Beijing are friendship cities, and China

<P>
"The erroneous remarks by an individual are unpopular and will
surely meet the opposition from the peoples in both China and
Japan," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The newly elected Governor of Metropolitan Tokyo Ishihara
Shintaro made an anti-China speech recently, which, according to
Sun, has hurted the feelings of the Chinese people and has done
harm to the Sino-Japanese ties and China has expressed its

<HEADLINE> Decline Moderates in Singapore's External Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The long-unabated decline in
Singapore's external trade moderated in March with the total trade
falling by 9.4 percent year-on-year after five consecutive months
of two-digit contraction, according to data released Tuesday by
Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB).
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic export (NODX) declined 3.2 percent, an
improvement over the more severe declines of 6.0 percent and 5.9
percent in January and February respectively. There were signs of
improvement in the domestic export of electronic products which
shrank by a more moderate rate of 4.7 percent in the month.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil imports contracted by 9.3 percent in March, a more
moderate figure than the double-digit declines in the proceeding
months.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, non-oil re-exports (NORX) remained weak, shrinking
by 15.4 percent during the month.
</P>
<P>
Domestic exports of oil fell by 7.9 percent in March, less
severe as compared to the 12.3 percent contraction in the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
Of the top markets for NODX, the EU market remained buoyant
with a growth of 6.4 percent, the U.S. market declined by 6.8
percent due in part to overall weakness in U.S. imports of
electronics (which accounts for 87 percent of Singapore's NODX to
the market) and the Malaysia market sank by 7.1 percent compared
to the more severe contraction of 10 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Japan market was marginally down 0.9 percent,
a sign of improvement compared with the two-digit declines in the
past 10 consecutive months, and the Hong Kong market plunged by
21.4 percent, the 11th consecutive month of decline.
</P>
<P>
However, NODX to the emerging markets deteriorated in March,
falling by 8.8 percent. But the China market is an exception which
expanded by 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the performance in March, the TDB said the
deterioration of Singapore's external trade experienced in the
preceding 10 months appeared to be stabilizing.

BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China today announced new
measures to stimulate domestic demand in order to reach the
projected 7 percent economic growth target for 1999.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here, Zheng Xinli, spokesman for the

The government has pledged to adjust its policies regarding
bank loans, investment regulations, and market access to encourage

To spur the market for consumer products, the government said

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate in New Zealand Hits New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand has, for the first
time since 1946, reported a negative annual inflation, a
government statistician said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a media release, government statistician Len Cook said the
consumers price index (CPI), which measures inflation, fell 0.1
percent in the fiscal year ending March 1999.
</P>
<P>
On a quarterly basis, prices in New Zealand fell 0.3 percent in
the first quarter of this year, after dropping 0.8 percent in the
previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Prices fell in the year to March, giving New Zealand one of the
 lowest inflation rates in the world.
</P>
<P>
Local economists say that tumbling interest rates in the
country have driven the fall. Late last year mortgage rates in New
Zealand fell to 30-year lows and interest rates are now 19 percent
lower than they were a year ago.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Chief Commends Report on Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, AAApril 20 (Xinhua) -- Executive director of the
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), Klaus Toepfer, Monday
praised a report of the world commission on forests and
sustainable development for mapping out a blueprint to solve the
global forest crisis.
</P>
<P>
The report entitled "our forests... our future" was released
monday in washington, the united states.
</P>
<P>
"the report offers a way out of the forest crisis because it
specifies reforms needed from abandoning subsidies and tax
incentives that provoke forest destruction to more openness in
timber allocation procedures and landscape planning," toepfer said
in nairobi, kenya's capital.
</P>
<P>
toepfer, who is also a member of the commission on forests,
noted the loss of millions of hectares of forest annually is
serious because of the ecological services forests provide in
terms of the hydrological cycle, soil conservation, biological
diversity and weather patterns.
</P>
<P>
after holding hearings on five continents, the commission on
forests released the report, saying that by changing the way
people manage forests, both development and forests can be
sustained.
</P>
<P>
through the public hearings the commission has organized, the
report gives a warning to people who live in the forests, who make
a living from the forests, and to other people who have a stake in
the future of the forests.
</P>
<P>
according to the report, from siberia to haiti, the world's
forests are exploited far beyond their ability to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
nearly 75 percent of the tropical forests in west africa have
been lost since 1950. thailand lost a third of its forests in the
1980's.
</P>
<P>
forests face an even shakier future with the global population
expected to grow by 50 percent in the first half of next century,
the report added. enditem

<HEADLINE> EDS-Details Added China Opens First Asset Management Company (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China's first asset management
company focusing on non-performing bank loans officially opened
today in the Chinese capital with State Council approval.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited Cinda Asset Management Corporation, with
registered capital of 10 billion yuan, will mainly deals with the
management of non-performing loans and assets transferred from
banks.
</P>
<P>
Cinda is an independent state-owned financial institution under
the supervision of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), China's
central bank. The company will also handle trust-related
transactions for the PBOC and various other financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Cinda President Zhu Dengshan said that the State Council's
decision to strip the China Construction Bank (CCB) of non-
performing loans and place same under the company's professional
management is based on objective judgment of the nation's current
economic and financial conditions, and international experience.
</P>
<P>
"The move demonstrates the government's clear understanding of
and resolve to solve existing problems," according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
PBOC Deputy-Governor Yan Haiwang pointed out that state-owned
commercial banks have played a significant role in financing
production and construction, and providing effective support for
national economic development.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that commercial banks have accumulated a
relatively high volume of non-performing loans due to various
problems related to domestic economic and financial operation, as
well as the impact of the regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned factors may threaten the healthy and stable
development of China's financial system and adversely affect the
national economy, he added.

"The establishment of Cinda is an important step in China's
financial system reform. Cinda will be a significant driving force
for preventing and minimizing financial risks, improving the
quality of credit assets and promoting further reform of state-
owned enterprises," Yan said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Ministry of Finance will allocate some 10
billion yuan in capital as the registered capital of Cinda and the
State Council will appoint and remove the company's president and
vice-presidents.
</P>
<P>
A supervisory committee has also been established to oversee
Cinda's management and operational decisions.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Dengshan said that Cinda will purchase non-performing loans
from the CCB in the near future.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Cinda's major business activities will involve
purchasing and performing trust management for non-performing
loans accumulated by commercial banks; debt retrieval and
restructuring; investment consulting; borrowing from financial
institutions and applying to the central bank for re-lending fund;
issuing bonds; direct investments; and various activities
involving other sectors.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has ratified Cinda's exemption from taxation
in the process of purchasing, assuming and handling non-performing
loans.
</P>
<P>
CCB President Zhou Xiaochuan said the CCB is actively clearing
credit assets in preparation for transferring non-performing loans
to Cinda.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the establishment of Cinda will help promote the
bank's internal management system reform.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Beijing, the Chinese capital, is
home to 256 species of birds, including 58 species under State
protection.
</P>
<P>
The city had only 136 species of birds in 1990. Wang Zengnian,
an expert with the Beijing Wildlife Protection Center, attributed
the increase to the capital's efforts to increase general public
awareness of the need for protecting birds and the large-scale
afforestation drive carried out over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The capital's forest coverage hit 41.22 percent by the end of
1998, with the per capita share of greenery standing at 8.18
square meters.

<P>
JERUSALEM, April 20 (Xinhua) - The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Jewish refugees from the Holocaust were deliberately
infected with malaria in medical experiments conducted by the
Australian army during World War II, according to The Age
newspaper in Australia. The experiments, conducted on 850 men to
help British and U.S. drug company profits, also included the use
of Australian soldiers recovering from surgery and German and
Italian POWs.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov is to meet with prime
ministerial candidates Ehud Barak and Yitzhak Mordechai, in
addition to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, when he arrives in
Israel on Thursday. The meetings are believed to be aimed at
countering the impression that Russia has been intervening in
Israel's election campaign in an effort to promote Netanyahu's
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel commemorated Tuesday its 18,939 soldiers fallen in
wars since the United Nations passed the partition plan for

<HEADLINE> China Increases Funding for Technology Upgrades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua)-- China allocated some 33.07 billion
yuan (3.98 billion US dollars) for technology upgrades in the
first quarter of the year, up 13.7 percent on the 1998 period,
according to today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
This year's plan calls for related funding of some 470 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Daily quoted officials from the State Economic and Trade
Commission as saying that the government will no longer approve
loans for new industrial construction projects, with the exception
of projects involving high technology and good market potential.
</P>
<P>
The major portion of funding will be channeled to upgrading
existing state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in order to renovate the
country's industries and restructure the economy. Profitable SOEs
and ongoing construction projects, especially projects scheduled
for completion this year, will enjoy priority in terms of
investments.
</P>
<P>
The majority of investments will be earmarked for the
development of products with potentially large markets and high
competitiveness on the international market, according to the
Daily.

<HEADLINE> EU Maintains Ban on E. African Fish Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Union will
maintain the ban on importing fish from Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda
although representatives from the three countries have tried to
persuade EU to lift it.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the three Lake Victoria countries held a
two-day technical meeting with EU in Brussels, Belgium last week,
trying to break the deadlock but in vain, The Guardian newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On March 30, EU announced a total ban on fresh and frozen fish
imports from the three east African countries following reports
that unscrupulous fishermen have been using chemical substances to
poison fish in Lake Victoria, the world's second largest fresh
water lake, posing threats to people's health.
</P>
<P>
The ban deals a heavy blow to the countries as Tanzania earns
85.6 million U.S. dollars annually from the fish industry along
the lake, providing 4,000 jobs, while Uganda earns some 70 million
U.S. dollars and Kenya earns some 91 million from the sector.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has claimed that the lake area on its side is poison
free as security forces have stepped up patrols. Uganda and Kenya
have also strengthened attacks on fish poisoning.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, EU has given conditions to the three
countries to fulfill before the ban could be lifted, sources said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Team Wins Environment Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 20 (Xinhua) - An Israeli and Palestinian
environmental team has received an international award from the
Time magazine for its work saving the lesser kestrel in Jerusalem
and the West Bank town of Jerico, a local daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Dan Alon from Israel and Professor Nader Hattib
from Bethlehem are among the recipients of Time's annual "Heroes
of the Planet", The Jerusalem Post said.
</P>
<P>
The award is given annually to people who have contributed
to protecting the earth from ecological dangers.
</P>
<P>
Alon and Hattib are responsible for a project aimed at saving
the lesser kestrels by, among other things, constructing nesting
boxes for them around Jerusalem and Jericho.
</P>
<P>
The lesser kestrel, a bird of prey, is under serious threat of
extinction worldwide. The number of lesser kestrels nested in the
Jerusalem and Jericho areas have decreased in the last several
years due to rapid growth of buildings.
</P>
<P>
Alon said he hoped the award will help promote cooperation in
environmental and conservation areas in the entire Middle East,
according to the newspaper.

consignments will also be built.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the project will be announced at a later

<HEADLINE> URGENT: Murderer of HK Residents Executed in South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Li Yuhui, who poisoned to death
five Hong Kong residents last year, was executed today in the city
of Shantou, south China's Guangdong Province, after the provincial
Higher People's Court rejected Li's appeal and upheld the original
death sentence verdict.
</P>
<P>
A native of Shantou, Li murdered five residents of Hong Kong on
July 21, 1998, at a so-called religious ceremony designed to
prolong their life as he claimed, and then slipped back to the
inland area with 1.2 million Hong Kong dollars which he took from
his victims.
</P>
<P>
Li, 47, was charged with killing the five Hong Kong residents
by offering them some so-called magic water, which was in fact a
mixture of mineral water and potassium cyanide that Li himself
prepared.
</P>
<P>
On March 23, this year, the Intermediate People's Court in
Shantou put Li on public trial. Convicted of intentional homicide
and robbery, Li was given the death sentence and deprived of his
political rights for life and all of his possessions.
</P>
<P>
Li then appealed to the Guangdong Provincial Higher People's
Court, but was rejected when the court confirmed that the original
ruling was accurate and fair, and should be maintained.

<HEADLINE> ADB Projects Positive Growth for Malaysia in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) has projected a positive growth of 0.7 percent for Malaysia
this year and 2.7 percent in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia itself officially forecast a 1-percent growth this
year against a contraction of 6.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama
Tuesday, ADB said in its report on the Asian Development Outlook
1999 released in Washington Monday that Malaysia's prospects for
recovery in the medium term depend on the government taking
credible action to reform the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The revival of investor confidence, which is the key to
sustainable growth, critically hinges on the speedy resolution of
the banking system's non-performing loan problem and of corporate
debt issues in an objective and transparent manner, ADB said.
</P>
<P>
According to ADB, expansionary monetary and fiscal policies in
Malaysia are expected to boost aggregate demand moderately in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Forecasts suggest that private consumption will grow by 0.8
percent while public consumption will grow marginally, private
investment will grow by 0.6 percent, public investment 2.2 percent
and exports of goods 3.8 percent in 1999, because of the likely
slow growth of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
The ADB report said that given the slight overall growth in the
domestic economy, imports are projected to rise by 6.6 percent,
leaving the current account in surplus.
</P>
<P>
Describing the forecast on Malaysia as "somewhat optimistic,"
the report said the projections assume the availability of
adequate domestic and external funds for financing the public
sector's borrowing requirements and covering the costs of bank
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
It said enhancing the productivity of human resources is a key
challenge for Malaysia's international competitiveness and
long-term development.
</P>
<P>
Increasing the skills of its labor force will enable Malaysia
to export more high-technology goods, thus increasing its export
competitiveness and enabling it to compete more effectively in the
global market, the report said.

</P>
<P>
The Chinese Premier said he came to Canada to follow out the

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of the Macao SAR Basic Law (42) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 42 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
What will be the nature of the municipal organizations of the
MSAR?
</P>
<P>
Municipal organizations have long existed in Macao. They used
to be called municipal assemblies of Macao and were later called
city halls.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are two city halls: Macao City Hall and
Islands City Hall. The city halls enjoy autonomy in both
administrative and financial affairs and are each composed of a
municipal assembly and a municipal executive council.
</P>
<P>
The municipal assembly is a policy-making body and its members
are elected directly and indirectly or appointed by the Governor,
while the municipal executive council is an executive organ and
its members are appointed by the Governor or elected by, and from
among, the members of the municipal assembly.
</P>
<P>
The city halls have the following main responsibilities and
duties:
</P>
<P>
-- Conduct city planning and make proposals in this regard;
</P>
<P>
-- Take charge of municipal works, public health and hygiene,
culture, sports and recreational facilities so as to maintain and
ensure a sound living environment for their residents; and
</P>
<P>
-- Issue licenses for vehicles and vendors in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Article 95 of the Basic Law stipulates that, in the light of
the actual conditions in Macao, the MSAR may set up non-policy-
making municipal organizations.
</P>
<P>
Entrusted by the government of the Region, such municipal
organizations shall provide services in such fields as culture,
recreation and environmental sanitation, and shall be consulted by
the government of the Region on the above-mentioned affairs.
</P>
<P>
This article of the Basic Law shows due respect for the system
of the municipal organizations of Macao and its development.
</P>
<P>
Retaining these organizations will help maintain social
stability and achieve a smooth transition. At the same time, it
also shows that it is not necessary to set up a two-tier organ of
power in a small place like Macao with a dense population.
</P>
<P>
Giving the municipal organizations of the MSAR non-political
power status will facilitate both their provision of services to
local residents and ensure unified leadership and management of
the Government of the MSAR.

<HEADLINE> China Constructs 400 Pilot Urban Residential Quarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of
Construction has built around 400 pilot residential quarters in
urban areas throughout the country in a bid to improve the quality
of life and provide models for the country's home builders.
</P>
<P>
According to Gao Zheng, an official in charge of the
construction of the experimental residential quarters, the
ministry has set high standards for building materials, design,
landscaping and other auxiliary facilities in the building of
these pilot residences, and every completed project should be 100-
percent certified, he said
</P>
<P>
He said that China is in the midst of massive housing
construction, building homes with a total of 300 million square
meters of floor space last year. To realize the goal of increasing
the per capita living space of urban residents to nine square
meters, the country needs to complete the building of apartments
with a total floor space of 240 million square meters every year.
</P>
<P>
"Speaking from an overall point of view, the quality of China's
housing construction is not high, and there also exists many
quality problems common in housing construction," said the
official, who stressed the necessity of building more experimental
residential apartments in different areas as a reference for all
builders.
</P>
<P>
The campaign to build experimental residential quarters was
first launched in 1986, and the program has helped improve the
overall quality of apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
Provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions are urged to
build at least 25 percent of their apartments according to the
standards set for experimental residential quarters.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Government Approves Agriculture Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
approved the country's first National Agriculture Policy which is
aimed at boosting food production and achieving self-sufficiency
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the policy, which was approved on Monday,
is to make the nation self-reliant in food through boosting
production of all crops, The Daily Star newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The policy stresses the need for optimum utilization of the
country's limited cultivable land, a cabinet member was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, it has proposed a lot of mechanism to strengthen the
private sector in agriculture. At the same time, it has underlined
the need for constant monitoring by the state that the fertility
of land is not affected due to use of bad fertilizer or seeds," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture policy proposes a provision for setting up an
Agricultural Loan Foundation to look after disbursement of
agricultural loans among certain categories of farmers.
</P>
<P>
And agricultural loan committees would be set up at different
levels, which would have a say in the process of disbursement of
agricultural loans among farmers, according to the policy, which
was placed before the cabinet in November last year.
</P>
<P>
The policy also keeps a prevision for inclusion of farmers'
representatives in the National Agriculture Committee, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, with an agriculture-based economy, has an annual
food shortage of about 2 million tons, and about 80 percent of its
126-million population live in rural areas.

TIRANA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Three foreign journalists and
their Albanian driver were killed Sunday after the car they were
riding fell into a ravine in northern Albania, an Albanian
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said an American couple and a French woman were
killed in the accident caused by a hail storm around noon near the
town of Tuka in northern Albania.

<P>
They were on their way back to Tirana after a visit to refugee
camps in the city of Kukesi bordering Yugoslavia's Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 130,000 Kosovo refugees have gathered in Kukesi since
NATO began bombing Yugoslavia late last month. Many robberies
targeting foreign journalists have reportedly happened in the city.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Denies Accepting U.S."Peace Force" in S. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The stance of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea on the withdrawal of U.S. troops from
South Korea has remained unchanged, said a leading Pyongyang
newspaper Rodong Sinmun on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. troops in South Korea serve as the commando for
aggression against the DPRK and offer the fundamental obstacle to
the unification of the Korean Peninsula, said a commentary in the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK would on no account change its stand. So long as the
U.S. maintains its military presence in South Korea, lasting peace
and reunification of the Korean Peninsula would be beyond
imagination, the article added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side has recently claimed, through South Korean
mouthpieces, that the DPRK would acknowledge the American military
presence if the South Korea-based U.S. troops stay on as "a peace
force."
</P>
<P>
South Korea echoed the claim by saying that the fifth round of
the four-party talks would not include American military presence
in its formal agenda, said the article.
</P>
<P>
The commentary reiterated that American troop withdrawal is the
basic topic for the talks. Without discussing the military pullout,
the talks will lose its significance, it said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Launches National Anti-Mosquito Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Tuesday launched a
national cleanliness and anti-mosquito campaign to bring about a
higher and sustained level of public consciousness about
cleanliness.
</P>
<P>
The campaign aims to intensify efforts to remove public apathy
toward maintaining cleanliness and destroying mosquito-breeding
grounds within human settlements.
</P>
<P>
Launching the campaign here, Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah
Ahmad Badawi called for greater efforts on a sustained basis to
deal with mosquito-related problems.
</P>
<P>
He said that as for the government it would mobilize its entire
machinery in the campaign and as for the community,
non-governmental organizations and the private sector, they would
be involved in setting up action groups to carry out cleaning up
work and ensure strict enforcement of legislation relating to
cleanliness.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that without public participation, combating the
mosquito menace would not achieve the desired results even with
the entire government machinery mobilized.
</P>
<P>
He also called for continuous research into behavioral links
between mosquitoes and humans.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was launched in the wake of the recent outbreak of
the Japanese Encephalitis (JE) and Nipah virus in pig farming
areas in the country, said to be passed from infected pigs to
humans by the Culex mosquito.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia destroyed some 650,000 pigs in the southern state of
Negeri Sembilan, most seriously affected by JE and the Nipah
virus, in the past month.
</P>
<P>
The deadly disease passed by mosquitoes from infected pigs to
humans has claimed dozens of lives in the country.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Governor's Remarks on Nanjing Massacre Refuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Newly-elected Tokyo Governor
Shintaro Ishihara's recent denial of the Rape of Nanjing committed
by Japanese militarists during World War Two has been bitterly
refuted by a leading Chinese historian as "ultra-nationalist."
</P>
<P>
Professor Gao Xingzu of the History Department of Nanjing
University said in a signed article published in Nanjing-based
Xinhua Daily on Sunday that Ishihara's remarks made in a
television interview on April 12 were meant to bring about a fresh
wave of anti-China campaign.
</P>
<P>
Gao, also chairman of a research society exclusive on the
Nanjing massacre, pointed out in the article that the historical
event was "not only the most representative and typical in the
crimes committed by the Japanese aggressors in China, but also the
most barbarian and the darkest ever chapter in human history."
</P>
<P>
During the six weeks after Japanese aggressors occupied Nanjing
on December 13, 1937, 300,000 Chinese civilians and disarmed
soldiers were slaughtered, together with countless cases of raping,
looting and arsons, and one third of the city burned down to the
ground. The incidents were judged to be a war crime by the post-
war Far Eastern international military tribunal.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, Ishihara, a representative veteran ultra-
rightist in Japan, said the Nanjing massacre was a "fabrication"
made by the Chinese. In the just-ended gubernatorial election, he
again defended Japan's crimes of aggression. "His nonsense will
only stir great indignation on the part of the Chinese people,"
the article said.
</P>
<P>
"Ishihara's denial of the war crimes is not in any way linked
with his ignorance of history... but based on his stubborn
adherence to ultra-nationalism," Gao said.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara's ultra-nationalism can be better illustrated by his
book published 10 years ago entitled "A Japan that Dares to Say No,
" which claimed that "it is the right time for Japan to get rid of
its character of slavery," urging a greater role for Japan in the
world arena, especially Asia, Gao noted.
</P>
<P>
These remarks, Gao pointed out, echoed the Japanese fascists'
vowed ambition to be "Asia's leader" in the early 1920's, which
led to a series of disastrous war by Japanese militarists against
Asian countries including China.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara's remarks came at a time when Japan, during high-level
official talks and a China-Japan joint communique issued last year,
acknowledged its aggression against China, pledged in-depth review
of and apologized for the enormous disaster inflicted on China
during the aggression.
</P>
<P>
"Never will we allow a resurgence of the militarist trend and
force in any form," the professor said, noting that a handful of
Japanese political rightists have always cast shadow over the Sino-
Japanese friendly relationship, which has seen an all-round
development since the normalization of official relations in 1972.
</P>
<P>
"We would advise Mr. Ishihara that he had better be sober
rather than be a wheeler-dealer running against the historical
trend," the article concluded.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Jobless People Estimated at 6.37 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of unemployed persons
in Indonesia this year will increase by 30 percent to 6.37
million, the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) predicted.
</P>
<P>
This assumption is closely related to the condition in 1998 in
which it was difficult and took a long time for unemployed persons
to find jobs, BPS' manpower researcher Hananto said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the number of unemployed persons in Indonesia was
5.06 million, Antara News Agency Tuesday quoted Hananto as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of veteran workers is expected to increase
to 4.5 million and job seekers not absorbed in the labor sector
would be 30 percent, or 1.35 million.
</P>
<P>
The rising number of newcomers estimated at 3.5 million as a
result of a high number of school dropouts will most likely raise
the number of unemployed persons in 1999, he added.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Indonesia's labor force was 89.6 million and increased
to 92.73 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's labor force in 1999 is expected to reach
95 million to 96 million.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis has raised the country's unemployment rate,
and most of the people who lost jobs as a result of the crisis are
employed in the informal sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the economic crisis, the agricultural sector has become
the primary sector in which the number of workers increased to 11
percent from 8 percent for urban areas and to 63 percent from 58
percent for rural areas.
</P>
<P>
He also noted a drop in the number of workers employed in the
industrial, electrical, gas, financial and banking sectors.
</P>
<P>
The number of job openings in these sectors drops to 23 percent
from 26 percent for urban areas, and to 13 percent from 15 percent
for rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis has also reduced workers' income by up to
28 percent for rural areas and 24 percent for urban areas.

<HEADLINE> Thai Opposition NAP Chief Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's opposition New
Aspiration Party (NAP) leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh has tendered
his resignation from the party leadership in a surprise move to
effect changes in the party line-up.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit, a former prime minister, took the move after an NAP
executive committee meeting on Monday. He said in a statement
available on Tuesday that his resignation should lead to changes
in accordance with the aspirations of party members, the people
and the calls from the mass media.
</P>
<P>
He said the upcoming changes would boost the party's
effectiveness in serving the people. The NAP will hold its annual
convention on April 27.
</P>
<P>
NAP deputy leader Chalerm Yoobamrung speculated that Chavalit's
true intention was to tactfully remove party Secretary-General
Snoh Thienthong, in view of a growing undercurrent within the
party relating to preparations for the next general elections.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit's departure automatically terminated the tenure of the
party executives.
</P>
<P>
There were speculations that Chavalit had intended to seek a
fresh mandate for himself and the party executives to steer the
party through a new round of elections.

<HEADLINE> Macao Governor to Support Future Chief Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira
said he would do his best to assist the first chief executive
designate of the future Macao Special Administration Region (SAR)
in constructing the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the local media on Monday, the governor however
gave no comments as to what qualifications the future chief
executive should have, noting only that such a question should be
considered and decided by the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
The most important thing the Macao government and the governor
himself should do at present is to closely cooperate with the
chief executive designate in constructing the SAR government, so
that the chief executive can start smoothly exercising the
governance of the SAR on December 20 this year, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
Rocha Vieira has been serving as governor of Macao for eight
years.
</P>
<P>
Consisting of 200 permanent Macao residents, the Selection
Committee was formed on April 10 and will hold the first plenary
session on April 23 to decide the candidate for the chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
Between April 12 and 17, nine Macao residents had applied to
vie for the candidacy.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Issue Industrial Bond in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will launch an
industrial development bond in Britain this month to raise money
for the country's industrial development.
</P>
<P>
The bond will formally introduced on April 22 by Finance
Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria, who is now in Paris at a two-day
meeting of Bangladesh Aid Consortium, The Independent newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government is looking forward to raising 100 million U.S.
dollars by selling the bond, which would be in dollars, and
investors would get an interest rate of 8.6 percent and have the
opportunity of drawing both the interest and the principal in
dollars.
</P>
<P>
It might take several months to release the bond that is
targeted primarily at Bangladeshis living in the Middle East and
in other countries, said Golam Rahman, additional secretary of the
Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The bond is intended to encourage Bangladeshi expatriates to
make investment by guaranteeing them the benefits that accrue due
to change in the exchange rates of hard currencies form time to
time, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Bangladesh sought 2.04 billion dollars in foreign
aid at the Paris meeting which would end on Tuesday, but the
country's donors earlier had announced that they would not make
aid pledges at the meeting this year.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Makes Progress in Anti-Drug Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has made progress in its
national anti-drug campaign launched last December and drug
enforcement agencies have called for a more sustained effort in
the campaign against illicit drug trafficking and abuse.
</P>
<P>
Since December last year, the number of drug-related arrests
has jumped by 77 percent to 7,640 while 3,820 new drug cases have
been identified for further investigation, according to a report
recently released by the National Anti-Drug Committee on progress
of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the arrests and cases were recorded in four
targeted areas -- Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, the central province of
Nghe An and the northern border province of Lang Son.
</P>
<P>
During the first three months of the campaign, 541 drug-related
cases were prosecuted, with 857 persons put on trial by provincial
courts, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Since the introduction of the provisions on strengthening drug
control in the country in 1993, 128 criminals involved in drug
cases have been executed, including 60 in 1998 and 19 in the past
three months.
</P>
<P>
The report estimates that there are approximately 200,000 drug
addicts in Vietnam, with the majority under 25 years old.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's drug enforcement officers said drug abuse has never
before been so rampant among the country's student population.
</P>
<P>
Drug usage has even been discovered among officers of state
administrative agencies. One survey conducted in Vietnam's
transport and communications sector showed that the number of drug
users in the sector was as high as 7,000.
</P>
<P>
Officials have been also worried over the recent trend in
replanting opium plants in remote and isolated areas in 10
northern provinces, especially Lai Chau and Son La.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that Vietnam is a major transshipment
thoroughfare for narcotics produced in the notorious "Golden
Triangle" opium-growing region bordering Myanmar, Laos and
Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Italy Hopes for Equal Merger With Deutsche Telekom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government hopes that
the proposed merger between Telecom Italia and Deutsche Telekom
will be on an equal basis, Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema said
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his weekly press briefing, D'Alema stressed that
before the merger can be taken into full consideration the method
and timetable for the privatization of Deutsche Telekom must be
made clear.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot accept that privatized Telecom Italia be merged with
a company which has the German state as its controlling
stockholder," D'Alema added.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Italian government confirmed that Italy's
biggest telecommunication company Telecom Italia has a tentative
plan to merge with its German counterpart Deutsche Telekom to form
the world's second largest telecommunication group, following
Japan's NTT.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Italian Finance Minister Vicenzo Visco said that
merger between the two telecom companies would have to be on a 50-
50 basis and the management of the new group should be absolutely
fair.
</P>
<P>
The German government, with 74 percent stake in hand, is
Deutsche Telekom's biggest shareholder while the Italian
government holds only 3.4 percent stake in privatized Telecom
Italia, so the Italian government urged the German government to
privatize Deutsche Telekom before the implementation of the
merger plan.
</P>
<P>
The proposed marriage, if realized, would create a 215-billion-
U.S. dollar telecommunication giant surpassing the hitherto
biggest Exxon-Mobil merger case.

BUCHAREST, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Romanian presidential press
office confirmed Monday that the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) has requested Romania to give NATO "unlimited
access to its sky," and Romanian President Emil Constantinescu
will discuss the issue with leaders of different parties on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Romania will make its response at a top meeting of national
defense committee after the president's Tuesday discussion.
</P>
<P>
NATO raised the request last Saturday, but the request did not
include the use of Romanian airports and other ground facilities,
Romanian press said.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between Romania and NATO, NATO airplanes are
permitted to enter Romanian sky"under the urgent and unexpected
circumstances".
</P>
<P>
Romania's ruling party unions said the country should comply
with NATO's request, because Romania has placed its strategic
focus on joining NATO and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
However, the Social Democratic Party of Romania,the largest
opposition party, called on the country to avoid involvement in
NATO strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Nicolae Vacaroiu, the party's deputy chief, said Romania has
already signed peace agreements with Yugoslavia, and the bilateral
relations have always been harmonious.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's long-stalled
peace talks between the government and the rebel Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) will resume on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Former foreign minister Maria Emma Mejia will attend the talks
on behalf of the government.
</P>
<P>
The FARC will be represented by its spokesman Raul Reyes,
leaders Manuel Marulanda and Jorge Briseno, as well as commanders
Joaquin Gomez and Fabian Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
The talks will examine FARC's proposal for Cartagena del Chaira
municipality to join the five that make up the area of detente in
Caqueta department.
</P>

The two sides will also seek a common agenda.
</P>
<P>
FARC suspended in January the peace talks in protest against
what they described as the government's apathy to the killing of
civilians by anti-rebel paramilitarists in rural communities in
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The armed conflicts in Colombia, which have lasted for nearly

<HEADLINE> Mexico, US, Canada to Address Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from financial
sectors of Mexico, the United States and Canada will meet on April
29 in Washington to examine measures against the millennium bug, a
computer failure in interpreting time that could cause information
chaos.
</P>
<P>
Participants will discuss the issuing of more currencies to
meet the possible excessive demand of withdrawing by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
A top official in charge of computer systems of the Bank of
Mexico said Mexico's central bank will have a stock of some 10
billion U.S. dollars in case of a contingency caused by the demand.
</P>
<P>
The amount is equal to nearly half of daily electronic payments
of the bank, estimated at some 24 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He assured that precautions have been taken to prevent the
possible repercussion on Mexico's projected inflation rate,
estimated by the government in 1999 at around 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The monetary basis will not be affected", he said.
</P>
<P>
Mexico will need about 350 million dollars to deal with the
millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
The central banks of the U.S. and Canada also announced to
issue more currencies to face an excess of demand at the end of
1999 in fear of the possible chaos caused by the millennium bug.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay Limits Stopovers to U.K. Malvinas-Bound Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay decided on Monday to
impose a limit on the number of stopovers by British military
planes on its territory as it suspects they carry passengers "
surreptitiously" to the Malvinas (Falkland) Islands.
</P>
<P>
The decision, sent to London on Friday, obliged the British
government to keep the frequency to one or two military flights
per month.
</P>
<P>
Uruguayan Foreign Minister Didier Opertti has reportedly
informed his Argentine counterpart Guido di Tella and President
Carlos Manenm of the decision.
</P>
<P>
After Chile banned the landing of Malvinas-bound British war
planes due to General Augsto Pinochet's detention in London, the
British government requested Uruguay's assistance at the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay agreed that it would permit stopovers of passenger
planes in Montevideo provided they land somewhere in Argentina
first before heading for the Malvinas.
</P>
<P>
A British request for stopovers in Brazil has been rejected.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay, Brazil and Paraguay are Argentina's partners in the
Southern Common Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
Argentina is seeking to re-open commercial flights to the
Malvinas. However, Britain still prohibits Argentine planes from
landing on the disputed islands.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of the Macao SAR Basic Law (41) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 41 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Will the public functionaries who have stayed on from the
previous Government continue to enjoy the same benefits and
treatment as before?
</P>
<P>
It is provided in Article 98 of the Basic Law that the public
functionaries who will continue their services after the
establishment of the MSAR will retain their salaries, allowances
and benefits no less favorable than before. They will also retain
their seniority.
</P>
<P>
It is clear from this provision that those public functionaries
who will continue their services will receive more pay and better
treatment than before.
</P>
<P>
Also, Article 98 of the Basic Law provides that the Government
of the MSAR shall pay to the public functionaries who are entitled
to them under the laws previously in force in Macao, remain in
employment when the MSAR is established, and retire afterwards, or
to their dependents, pensions and allowances due to them on terms
no less favorable than before, irrespective of their nationality
or place of residence.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Government and the public functionaries
themselves shall each pay a sum of money to the Fund of Pension of
Macao each month as a guarantee for the pension of the public
functionaries who are entitled to a pension according to law and
who will get it after their retirement.
</P>
<P>
Both the Government and the public functionaries themselves
shall pay their contribution to the Pension Fund at a certain
percentage.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the portion of the money in the Fund to be used to pay
the pension of the public functionaries who will retire after the
return of Macao shall be handed over to the MSAR.

<HEADLINE> Alataw-Urumqi Train Route Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
URUMQI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A double-decker tourist train from
Alataw Pass in northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
arrived here Monday morning after a 10-hour journey, marking the
opening of this new route.
</P>
<P>
Alataw Pass, 90 kilometers long and 20 kilometers wide, is a
passage linking China with central and western Asia, and is well-
known as a "wind funnel" due to its harsh weather.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the State Council, China's highest government body,
approved Alataw Pass as an open port, and this new Eurasia Bridge
from the port city of Liangyungang in East China to Rotterdam in
the Netherlands is now fully linked.
</P>
<P>
Over the past eight years, the port has handled 8 million tons
of import and export goods and has turned over 1.5 billion yuan in
taxes to the State.
</P>
<P>
More than 190 domestic enterprises have invested in the port
and over 300 domestic and overseas-funded enterprises are doing
foreign trade business in Alataw Pass, which has been developed
into a 7-sq-km new town with sound infrastructure facilities.
</P>
<P>
The opening of this route will be significant for promoting
the local tourism industry and the economic development of western
China and opening it up to the outside world.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Drops in First Quarter (Update) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- In the first quarter, China's
actual use of foreign investment slid down 14.6 percent from the
same period last year to 7.34 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the contractual foreign investment stood at 8.72 billion US
dollars, basically the same as the corresponding period in 1998,
said Ye Zhen, spokesman with the National Bureau of Statistics, at
today's press conference.
</P>
<P>
Exports witnessed a drop in the quarter as a result of the
impact of Asian financial crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics of the General Administration of
Customs, import and export climbed 0.3 percent to 70.26 billion US
dollars in the first quarter, of the total, export declined 7.9
percent to 37.27 billion US dollars, up 0.7 percentage points over
the fourth quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports rose 11.6 percent to 32.99 billion US dollars, up 8.9
percentage points over the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
The falling exports to Southeast Asian nations bottomed out in
the quarter and rose 1.8 percent while the growth of exports to
Europe and the United States witnessed a drop.
</P>
<P>
Of which, exports to the United States grew 8.4 percent, down
14.3 percentage points in terms of growth grate from the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Exports to European Union countries slid 2 percent as against
the 30.4 percent growth in the same period last year. Meanwhile,

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Allows Collectives to Contract Small Oil Fields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Small oil fields in the Tarim
Basin in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are
now allowed to be contracted by collectives on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of the efforts of the Tarim Oil Exploration
and Development Headquarters to implement the State Council's
reform policies aiming to push the oil industry, which was once
under the influence of the planned economy and state monopoly, to
a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Since last March Ma Wenlong, a staff member of the Tarim oil
exploration area, has already piloted a project contracting a
small remote oil field together with 37 other colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that he was granted rights for the employment of
workers, purchase of materials, the use of funds and distribution
of income.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, our initiative can be brought into full play and better
economic results can be achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the contracts, Ma and his team will turn
over 12,000 tons of crude oil to the Headquarters a year. The
sales income of surplus oil is divided between Ma's team and the
headquarters in a ratio of 7:3.
</P>
<P>
Administrative expenses and the wages of the employees are paid
by the sales income owned by the team.
</P>
<P>
The output of Ma's oil field, the smallest in the Tarim Basin,
which has proven reserves of 860 million tons of oil and natural
gas, has increased to the present 80 tons per day compared with 30
tons a day before he took over.
</P>
<P>
The oil field originally turned out 170 tons of oil a day when
it first went into operation in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ma now employs 37 workers, only one-third of the original staff
members of the oil field. Production cost of oil per ton is 200
yuan, making up only 14 percent of the original cost.
</P>
<P>
"The contract and reform system is in the interests of both
individuals and enterprises," said Wu Xiaolin, an employee.
</P>
<P>
"We used to be paid the same no matter whether the output was
one ton or 10,000 tons. Now our income is directly linked to
production," said Wu.
</P>
<P>
Wu and his colleagues expressed the hope that the reform would
be further implemented.
</P>
<P>
According to an official in charge of the headquarters, all
three small oil fields that have been contracted by collectives
have achieved good economic performance.
</P>
<P>
However, he said frankly that the reform is still on a trial
basis. Some staff members still have doubts about the reform.
Stipulations and regulations are yet waiting to be worked out
properly.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urged to Play Role in Solving Yugoslavia Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov on Monday accused NATO of implementing a "scorched earth
tactic" in Yugoslavia and urged the United Nations to play an
active role in seeking a peaceful solution to the ongoing Balkan
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference here, Ivanov elaborated on
Russia's proposal for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in
Yugoslavia which has suffered from more than three weeks of
massive bombardment by NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
Among the preconditions for a peaceful solution, Ivanov said,
all forms of military operations including "violence and
oppression" should be halted in Yugoslavia and NATO should
withdraw its offensive troops from Yugoslavia's neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, Belgrade should pull extra troops and
police force out of its southern province of Kosovo, guarantee
safe returns of refugees of different races and religious beliefs,
and facilitate work of international humanitarian organizations in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The proposal also includes a resumption of political
negotiations between Yugoslav leaders and ethnic Albanian leaders
in Kosovo on an extensive autonomy in the southern Yugoslav
province and international assistance in economic reconstruction
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said the implementation of the plan needs extensive
international help and the United Nations with rich experience in
peacekeeping should play a vital role in ending the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said he believed NATO is planning to launch ground
operations against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
According to Ivanov, NATO's ground operation plans include
partial occupation of Kosovo and subjecting it to NATO's military
control or dismembering Yugoslavia after occupying the entire
Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
NATO troops are carrying out a brutal "scorched earth tactic"
in Yugoslavia to pave the way for NATO's occupation of the country,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Large Neolithic Burial Ground Unearthed in Central-south China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A large burial ground dating
back to the middle period of the Neolithic Age some 7,000 years
ago was recently unearthed in Tujiatai in central-south China's
Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of more than 30,000 square meters, the
Tujiatai Cultural Site is not only the largest primitive relic
ever found in the Dongting Lake area, one of the world's oldest
rice-growing areas, but also the most ancient archeological find
yet discovered in the southern reaches of the Yangtze River,
China's longest.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have unearthed 16 graves over a 150-sq-m area
where they found three skeletal remains, two men and a woman.
</P>
<P>
These primitive people, 1.6-1.8 meters tall, were not much
different from their modern descendants, according to Zhang
Qinglong, head of the excavating team, which began the work in the
area last month.
</P>
<P>
One of the tombs is in the shape of a canoe 3.2 meters long and
0.6 meter wide. Zhang explained that the canoe must have been the
main means of transport by which the these people keep in touch
with the outer world, because Tujiatai was an islet in the lake
several thousands years ago.
</P>
<P>
A ceramic pot with grain decoration and in shape of a pair of
bulging breasts also was found in this tomb, which archeologists
say represents the worship of women's reproductive power in a
matrilineal society.
</P>
<P>
They believe this tomb is located in the center of the burial
ground because of its unique shape and artifacts, and also because
it is the only grave that is aligned from north to south.
</P>
<P>
A large amount of pottery has been unearthed at the site, the
oldest of which may date back some 8,000 to 9,000 years. The
archeologists said this find will be most valuable for studying
the primitive life-style, environment and plants of that time.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Calls for Return of Kosovo Issue to Political Means </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Monday emphasized that the halt of NATO airstrikes against
Yugoslavia is a necessary precondition for solving the Kosovo
crisis, according to the Russian Presidential Press Office.
</P>
<P>
During a 50-minute telephone conversation with his U.S.
counterpart Bill Clinton, Yeltsin called for urgent measures to
take the problem back to the political track.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also urged implementation of the basic principles
agreed upon during a recent meeting between Russian foreign
minister and the U.S. secretary of state in Oslo, which, he
believed, would help reverse the worse-going Kosovo situation.
</P>
<P>
During the Oslo meeting, according to Yeltsin, the two sides
agreed to resume negotiations on the framework of granting Kosovo
extensive self-governing rights based on the precondition of
complete respect of Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also discussed the returning of ethnic
Albanian and Serbian refugees. Yeltsin stressed the necessity of
the participation by Yugoslav leaders in solving this problem
under the supervision of the international community.

<P>
MADRID, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Spain's former foreign minister,
Fernando Moran Lopez, on Monday condemned NATO for blindly
following the U.S. hegemonism over the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister, in a speech broadcast by a local

It was reported that Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
would meet U.S. president Bill Clinton to discuss the Kosovo
crisis in the upcoming NATO Summit scheduled to be held in

TIANJIN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin Port, the largest

</P>
<P>
The import volume grew 28.7 percent to 3.46 million tons, with
the export volume falling by 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Increasing domestic trade has sparked an increase in the port's
import volume. However, the adverse impact of the Asian financial

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updated China's Economy Grows 8.3 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China managed to maintain a fast
economic growth of 8.3 percent in the first quarter of this year,
despite the negative impact by the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
A double-digit expansion in fixed-asset investment and a steady
growth in consumer spending contributed to the bulk of the
nation's gross domestic product (GDP) that totaled 1.6784 trillion
yuan in the three months, spokesman Ye Zhen of the National Bureau
of Statistics told a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The farming sector witnessed a four percent growth during the
period, while the industrial sector chalked up an increase of 9.7
percent and the tertiary sector seven percent, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
"As the State's policy of increasing investment and stimulating
domestic demand keeps to take effect, the national economy has
maintained a favorable momentum," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fixed-asset investment expanded by 22.7 percent year-on-year in
the first quarter and the sales volume of consumer goods rose 7.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Profitability of enterprises picked up markedly as a result.
The industrial sector recorded a net profit of 11.27 billion yuan,
six times more than the same period of last year, and the number
of loss makers fell in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
Ye said that a deflationary trend has continued, with the
retail price index down 2.9 percent from the same period of last
year and the consumer price index falling by 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both urban and rural residents saw their pockets
swelling faster than last year. The average income per capita of
urban residents rose eight percent in real terms and that of rural
residents rose 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
But Ye cautioned that a remarkable slide in exports has been
dragging down the nation's economic growth and should be dealt
with seriously.
</P>
<P>
During the first three months, China's total exports fell by 7.
9 percent to 37.27 billion U.S. dollars and imports rose by 11.6
percent to 32.99 billion U.S. dollars, leading to a drop in trade
surplus.
</P>
<P>
"Our estimation is that China's exports this year will be most
probably less than last year's, or match that at best," Ye said.
</P>
<P>
Capital inflow also slowed down as the actual use of foreign
funds dipped by 14.6 percent to 7.34 billion U.S. dollars,
indicating there was still huge pressure from the impact by the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, contractual direct foreign investment stood at 8.72
billion U.S. dollars, about the same as in the first quarter of
last year, which suggested a possible turnaround in the trend of
capital inflow some time in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Ye said that the State's pro-active fiscal policy should be
further carried out to expand domestic demand, which is vital to
keeping a fast economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The government should also take effective measures to stimulate
private investment and consumer spending so as to offset the drop
in exports, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
He forecast an eight percent economic growth in the first half
of this year and regarded the central government's projection of
seven percent growth for the whole year as achievable.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze said Monday that his country would stay with the
Collective Security Pact of the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) if Georgia's conditions, proposals and requirements are met.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze told a press conference in the capital of Georgia,
Tbilisi, that rejecting earlier this month the renewal of the
treaty did not mean that Georgia had quit from it entirely,
according to Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
The president announced in a broadcast address on April 5 that
Georgia would give up its membership in the 1992 pact, which
expires this month, because participation in the treaty did not
bring any positive effects to the process of resolving the problem
of Abkhazia, a Georgian autonomous republic seeking independence
for a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that military cooperation between Georgia and
Russia needs improvement although the two countries have already
made progress in this area under bilateral commitment.
</P>
<P>
Georgia, which has Russian military presence, would continue to
work with Russia, adding that the scale and development of the
cooperation would depend on concrete conditions.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Details Added 7-Percent Target Attainable, SDPC Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Planning
Commission (SDPC), China's top economic policy maker, said today
that the country can expect a growth rate of eight percent for the
first half this year and that the government's projected seven
percent growth rate for the whole of 1999 is attainable.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, SDPC spokesman Zheng Xinli
said the economic recovery which began in the third quarter of
1998 has continued into the first quarter of this year, which
witnessed an 8.3 percent growth rate.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this encouraging development to the
implementation of government policies to increase investment in
infrastructure construction and stimulate domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the economy in the first three
months was characterized by the continued rapid growth of fixed-
asset investment and the improvement of investment structure.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the same period last year, investment in fixed
assets rose by 22.7 percent, while investment in agriculture,
transportation and post and telecommunications, and housing
sectors grew 122.1 percent, 46 percent and 35.5 percent,
respectively, the SDPC said.
</P>
<P>
The first quarter also saw a high growth rate and a remarkable
improvement in economic efficiency in the industrial sector, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to increased investment, industrial added value in the
first three months increased by 10.1 percent over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The highest growth rate was reported in the electronics sectors,
with the production of program-controlled switchboards, mobile
telecommunications equipment, personal computers, air conditioners
and color television sets all up by more than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
A particularly encouraging development is in the state-owned
industrial sector, which recorded a profit of 950 million yuan in
the first two months this year, compared with a loss of 5.46
billion yuan in the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The sales of manufactured products also recorded a steady
growth. The SDPC said sales of consumer products hit 760.4 billion
yuan in the first three months, a growth of 7.4 percent, or 10.6
percent in real terms when adjusted for the drop in consumer
prices.
</P>
<P>
The government's fiscal revenue increased by 26.1 percent in
the first quarter to stand at 232.4 billion yuan. Banks across the
country extended new loans totaling 143.7 billion yuan, an
increase of 52.3 billion yuan over the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The country's total foreign exchange reserves stood at 146.63
billion U.S. dollars by the end of March, an increase of 1.67
billion dollars over the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The SDPC said the major problem facing the Chinese economy now
is the severe export situation due to the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The drop in export's contribution to economic growth and in the
in-flow of foreign capital must be made up by further stimulating
the domestic market, the SDPC said.

Maungtaw which is also located in the same state.
</P>
<P>
Cargo has been able to be shipped directly from Sittway to
Bangladesh on an F.O.B. basis, thus facilitating trade activities
between the two countries bordering the Bay of Bengal.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Ministry of Commerce has asked companies in the
country conducting border trade to apply for the undertakings with
the requirement that a foreign currency account must be opened
with the state-run Myanmar Economic Bank in Sittway, according to
the latest issue of the local Myanmar Business News.
</P>
<P>
In the past, a majority of Myanmar's exports to Bangladesh had
to be shipped via Singapore, resulting in inactive trade relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Bangladesh initiated formal border trade in
September 1995 at the Maungtaw (Myanmar)- Teknaf (southeastern
Bangladesh) trade point. Their bilateral border trade stood at
5.6 million U.S. dollars in fiscal 1997-98 which ended in March,
the Business News said, adding that the trade volume for the
first nine months of 1998 was 2.3 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding, signed between the two
countries' major trade organizations in July last year in Dhaka,
envisages trade expansion and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Both Myanmar and Bangladesh are members of the BIMST-EC, a
sub-regional economic grouping formed in June 1997 by Bangladesh,
India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand bordering the Bay of
Bengal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar has also opened six border trade points with
neighboring China in the northeast, four with Thailand in the
southeast and one with India in the northwest.

<HEADLINE> Spaniard Puras Leads Catalunya Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Spanish driver Jesus Puras led the
Catalunya Rally by seven seconds on Monday as Citroen occupied the
top two places ahead of French driver Didier Auriol of Toyota.
</P>
<P>
Briton Colin McRae, winner of the last two championship rallies,
finished a distant 33rd place, almost seven and a half minutes off
the pace, because of mechanical problems in the fifth and sixth
stages.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, his Ford team said they would treat the rest of
the rally as a test session ahead of next month's all-asphalt
Corsican event.
</P>
<P>
Puras won four out of the day's seven stages after the opening
run was cancelled due to spectator safety concerns, teammate
Philippe Bugalski of France finished in second position.
</P>
<P>
The lighter two-wheel drive F2 cars hold a distinct advantage
over their four-wheel drive counterparts with their power-to-
weight ratio ideally suited to Catalunya's conditions.
</P>
<P>
The regulations allow Formula Two cars a minimum weight of 960
kilograms compared to the 1,230 kg minimum for four-wheel drive
competitors.
</P>
<P>
The Toyota pairing of Auriol and Spain's Carlos Sainz finished
in third and fourth position respectively, less than 20 seconds
behind leader Puras.
</P>
<P>
Auriol, winner of the event last year, broke two wheel rims on
the fifth stage but set the fastest time on the next test.
</P>
<P>
Reigning champion Tommi Makinen of Finland won the fourth stage
of the day and completed the leg in fifth spot, 34.3 seconds
adrift with Belgian Freddy Loix in sixth.
</P>
<P>
Skoda had German Armin Schwarz in eighth place.
</P>
<P>
The drivers face six stages on the longest leg of the rally on
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Treasury Bill Rate Falls to 2-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' 91-day Treasury
bill (T-bill) rate fell to a 25-month low of 10.361 percent Monday
while the peso breached the 38 to a dollar level, Manila Bulletin
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the average 91-day T-bill dropped to a two-year
low of 10.361 percent Monday, or 0.611 percentage points lower
than the previous week's 10.972 percent.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper attributed the drop of the T-bill rate to the
reduction in the overnight lending and borrowing rates of the
central bank as well as the one percentage point cut in liquidity
reserves recently.
</P>
<P>
The central bank Monday sanctioned the sharpest cuts in its
overnight borrowing and lending rates so far this year. Its
borrowing and lending rates were lowered by 0.5 percentage points
to 10.875 percent and 12.875 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted monetary authorities as saying there was still
room for further rate cuts in the central bank's overnight lending
and borrowing rates.
</P>
<P>
As interest rates continued to drop, the exchange rate also
took the same direction with the peso appreciating by as much as 9
centavos Monday, closing at 37.95 pesos against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted sources as saying the monetary authorities
have bought 1.8 billion U.S. dollars since January, boosting the
gross international reserves in the process to 13.4 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Capital Goods Imports Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's capital goods imports
last year dropped by 37.68 percent to 5.79 billion U.S. dollars
from a year earlier as a result of sluggish investment, a
government report said.
</P>
<P>
Among the capital goods whose import drastically declined last
year were stone, vegetable oil and leather processing machines, a
report issued by the Industry and Trade Ministry Monday said.
</P>
<P>
The import of stone processing machines dropped by 79.67
percent to 22.54 million dollars, vegetable oil processing
machines 74.17 percent to 13.8 million dollars and leather
processing machines 63.09 percent to 4.46 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the import of pulp factory equipment was up 36.7
percent to 312.76 million dollars and cable manufacturing machines
12.74 percent to 17.93 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The import of electrical machines (generators and transformers)
was down 48.48 percent to 356.89 million dollars and factory
equipment 39.43 percent to 729.21 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Only the import of electricity power generators (turbines)
increased 70.36 percent to 126.22 million dollars, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Other capital goods whose import drastically declined were
passenger cars, electronic and telecommunications equipment and
agricultural machines and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia imported capital goods worth 9.28 billion dollars in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The Investment Coordinating Board said it last year licensed
152 domestic investment projects against 351 projects in 1997
while the number of foreign investment projects approved last year
dropped to 221 from 259 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The agency attributed the drop in the number of investment
projects to funding, marketing and raw material difficulties as a
result of the prolonged economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> China's Agriculture Up Four Percent in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China's agricultural sector had a
four-percent year-on-year increase in the first quarter of the
year, National Bureau of Statistics Spokesman Ye Zhen said here
today.
</P>
<P>
According to a sample survey, the bureau expects the total area
sown to crops this year to reach 2.34 billion mu (156 million
hectares).
</P>
<P>
This represents an increase of 13.5 million mu (900,000
hectares) from last year's figure, including 525,000 mu (35,000
hectares) designated for grains, the spokesman told a press
conference here.
</P>
<P>
Ye said material supplies for the spring ploughing are
sufficient, and are better prepared than last year.
</P>
<P>
An investigation into the supply and demand of 13 major
materials needed for the spring ploughing in more than 800
counties across the country shows that the supply of 11 materials
is up to 95 percent of the demand.
</P>
<P>
Pesticides, seeds and large and medium-sized farm tools are
adequately provided, Ye added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Sign Fisheries Accord With Seychelles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will sign an offshore
fisheries agreement with the Seychelles, enabling the Thai fleet
to catch fish off Africa next year, according to the Thai
Fisheries Department.
</P>
<P>
the Seychelles is a source of tuna for many countries including
France, Japan and Spain. The Thai fleet has never fished in the
western Indian Ocean because Thailand has not negotiated offshore
fishery rights.
</P>
<P>
Dhammarong Prakobboon, director-general of the department, was
quoted Tuesday by the Bangkok Post as saying the agreement has
many advantages. First, there is no need for Thai trawlers to
change their nationality to that of the host country as required
by some nations.
</P>
<P>
Second, the Seychelles does not have a law requiring Thai
fleets to hire local workers as the country has only 70,000
people. Third, the license fee is very reasonable compared with
the sums charged by Indonesia and Myanmar. Fourth, Thai ships can
catch fish for six months a year off the Seychelles, a longer
season than in some areas.
</P>
<P>
The Seychelles also has big tuna-processing factories that want
to buy large volumes of tuna, so Thai trawlers can supply tuna to
those factories before bringing any remaining fish to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Seychelles' agriculture minister, Pronnie Jumeau, is
scheduled to visit Thailand in November to discuss the cooperation
agreement in detail.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, the world's largest canned-tuna exporter, imports
more than 13 billion baht (351 million U.S. dollars) worth of tuna
annually.

<HEADLINE> University Heads Gather in HK on Global Higher Education Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Over 40 heads of prestigious
institutions of higher learning from Britain, Canada, Australia,
China's Mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan met at a forum here Monday
to discuss strategies for higher education development in the next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-Chancellors and Presidents Forum on "Global Tertiary
Education Development," which opened at the Chinese University of
Hong Kong, is hosted by the Association of University Presidents
of China with an aim to promote international cooperation among
leading tertiary institutions.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the three-day forum, Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) stressed the importance of collaboration among
universities around the world.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that whilst the codification and transmission of
existing knowledge could be, though not satisfactorily, done
locally, the creation of new knowledge is wholly dependent on an
awareness of what is happening globally.
</P>
<P>
With the advent of information technology, "the need to have
some quality assurance mechanism not just at the national level
but the international level is more urgent than ever," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the ceremony, Wei Yu, vice-minister of
Education of the People's Republic of China, briefed the audience
on China's strategy of developing the country by relying on
science and education and the reform of the education system in
China.
</P>
<P>
China's higher education system has developed not only through
its own efforts but also through its links with the development of
higher education in other countries and regions throughout the
world, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
"In the last 20 years of reform and opening up, China has
established international exchange and cooperation in education
with many countries, which brings about ever closer inter-
university relations," Wei said.
</P>
<P>
At the forum, Wei also delivered a special lecture on the
development of modern distance education and the construction of a
life-long learning system. Others who delivered special lectures
included professor Yang Chen-ning, the Nobel Laureate in Physics,
and Antony Leung, chairman of the education commission of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Topics to be discussed at the forum include universities and
information technology, optimum size of university, management of
university, university research, science park, international
relationship, preparing students and graduate education and
lifelong education.

<HEADLINE> Cranes Find Heaven in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Local residents in the city of
Qiqihar in China's northernmost Heilongjiang Province have saved
101 cranes of different varieties over the past ten years, among
which 86 are red-crown cranes, and the other 15 are white cranes
and grey cranes.
</P>
<P>
A series of crane-protection measures taken by the local
government in the past few years, including publicity and severe
punishment for illegally hunting cranes, have instilled in the
residents' minds the importance of crane protection.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Deqi, a local farmer, found an injured crane while fishing.
He refused to sell it even at an attractive price, and instead he
took care of the bird for over ten days until it recovered before
returning it to the reserve.
</P>
<P>
A the volunteers' society for crane protection, set up in 1997
with more than 500 volunteers and some 300,000 yuan (36,000 U.S.
dollars) has also played an active role in crane protection. It
once saved two lost red-crown cranes which had strayed 1,000
kilometers away, and with the help of two farmers sent them back
to the nature reserve after a winter of caring for them.
</P>
<P>
Qiqihar is the main habitat for a number of rare birds, and 269
species, among which 35 are under state protection, are living in
the 210,000-hectare Zhalong State Nature Reserve in the
southeastern part of the city. Because of this, the city is also
called the Crane City for its large number and variety of cranes.

<HEADLINE> Prospects for Take-off Still Strong: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China's potential to maintain a
high economic growth rate will continue for at least another two
or three decades, according to a leading economist here.
</P>
<P>
Lin Yifu, at the China Center for Economic Research at Beijing
University, held that the present economic slowdown by no means
indicates an exhaustion of China's long-term economic vitality.
</P>
<P>
Lin attributed the current flaccidity to the changing supply
and demand conditions, a tighter control over funds as part of the
ongoing banking reform, and the long-term effect of infrastructure
projects.
</P>
<P>
Around 1992, investment enthusiasm prevailed across China,
fanned by seemingly bottomless demand. However, as China started
to enter a buyer's market in 1995, good investment projects became
harder to find.
</P>
<P>
The country has also launched a campaign to straighten out the
financial sector in a bid to rule out mounting bad debts, low
efficiency and cyclical economic overheating.
</P>
<P>
Besides, infrastructure construction aimed at fueling the
growth of national economy cannot be expected to spark the markets
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
Lin explained his views in an article published in Tuesday's
China Daily, saying that a country's economic growth relies on
three factors: increase in various production elements, capital
and technological advances.
</P>
<P>
Countries and regions including Japan, the Republic of Korea,
Singapore and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China
have sustained vibrant long-term economic growth through
introducing foreign technology and thereby expediting their own
industrial upgrading and economic transition.
</P>
<P>
When China embarked on the high economic growth track in the
late 1970s, the technology gap between China and developed
countries was much bigger than between Japan and the four small
Asian dragons when they started their economic take-off.
</P>
<P>
The process of bridging the technology gap will offer China
nearly 50 years of high economic growth, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the high proportion of China's rural population
leaves plenty of room for economic growth, and the country's high
capital accumulation rate will meet the enormous capital demand
while China is speeding up the pace of its economic growth.

<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A modern dance drama entitled
Shenzhen Story will be staged in Beijing from April 22-25 to mark
the 50th founding anniversary of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen was China's first Special Economic Zone after the
introduction of the country's reform and opening up policy, as the
setting of the story. The dance tells the story of three girls who
come to the city seeking the land of promise.
</P>
<P>
Their growing into maturity, life setbacks, and continuous
struggle for a better future are expressed in an unique artistic
way through dance.
</P>
<P>
According to the director Ying Eding, the script was rewritten
three times and the play had its debut in Shenzhen last December.
</P>
<P>
In order to portray this vivid dimension of modern life of
Shenzhen, the cast frequently visited real-life young fortune-
seekers and asked them to watch the show's rehearsals and offer
their opinions.

<HEADLINE> Outlook Improving, Salt Lake Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The head of fund-raising for
the Salt Lake City Olympics said that despite the loss of Johnson &AMP;
Johnson as a sponsor for the Winter Games, the outlook forsigning
sponsors is improving.
</P>
<P>
According to a report here, John Krimsky, head of Olympic
Properties of the United States, said today that Johnson &AMP; Johnson
made its decision in February during a meeting with Mitt Romney,
new president of SLOC, the Salt Lake City organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
"It's old news," Krimsky said. "They made their decision before
all the reports and reforms were made after the scandal. The
positive news is that we're talking to potential sponsors every
day. The outlook has improved."
</P>
<P>
No sponsors have signed since June, and talks stalled after the
Salt Lake City vote-buying scandal. Johnson &AMP; Johnson spokesman
John McKeegan said he did not blame the broken deal on the scandal
but said, "It was a backdrop to our discussions."
</P>
<P>
Romney doesn't share Krimsky's optimism. He announced budget
cuts last week because of a 350 million dollars shortfall he fears
taxpayers will have to pay. They must raise about 300 million
dollars to meet SLOC's 1.45 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
Krimsky says Romney's concerns are "premature until the scandal
gets behind us," adding he regarded last week's U.S. Senate
hearing as "our closure."
</P>
<P>
Krimsky intended to wrap up fund-raising in August but decided
in January to push that back a year.
</P>
<P>
"The sponsors that we talk to are assessing the environment in
which we find ourselves every single day," Krimsky said today. "
And when they have to invest millions of dollars and the
reputation of their products and service, they have to be very,
very careful."
</P>
<P>
Krimsky has complained that Salt Laker organizers have not
nailed down any in-state sponsors. "We cannot expect the rest of
the country to fund the Games unless we can state companies on the
scoreboard," he said.

<HEADLINE> Jiefang Daily Slams Tokyo Governor's Anti-China Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai-based Jiefang Daily
on Sunday published a signed article slamming the anti-China
remarks uttered by newly-elected Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara turned a blind eye to the crimes committed by Japanese
aggressor troops in the Nanjing massacre during World War II,
alleging that the criminal acts were merely "fabrications" by the
Chinese. He also accused the Kakuei Tanaka cabinet of abandoning
Taiwan, which led to the births of several right-wing
organizations in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The article, entitled "Ishihara's election merits attention,"
said that all these remarks aimed at reversing historical records
have angered the Chinese people and have been bitterly criticized
by them.
</P>
<P>
The article reminded Ishihara that he is facing financial
straits in his prefecture. If he is incapable of solving the
problems, it would be embarrassing for him and he would be on
tense terms with his subordinates.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, it will be hard for him "to realize his political
ambitions."
</P>
<P>
If he makes a bad start after assuming office, no one knows for
certain for how long this "political star" would stay "popular,"
said the article.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China has developed its first
electricity-powered train for inter-city or downtown suburban
transport, which can reach an average speed of 120 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
The train was jointly developed by the Changchun Passenger Car
Plant, the Kunming Railroad Administration Bureau and the Zhuzhou
Electricity-Powered Locomotive Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Electricity-powered locomotives are considered safe, convenient,
pollution-free, and ideal for shuttling between cities and between
downtown and suburban areas.
</P>
<P>
The first train of the type, named "Spring City", has finished
trials at a railway test center in Beijing. The first train for
commercial use will travel between Kunming City, southwest Yunnan
Province, and the nearby stone forest during the '99 Kunming
International Horticulture Exposition which begins on May 1st.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' International Reserve Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The gross international reserve of
the Philippines has reached a record high of 13.2 billion U.S.
dollars in April, the country's central bank governor Gabriel
Singson said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Singson said in an interview that the reserve is beefed up by
the secondary reserve comprising foreign currency deposits at the
country's various banks.
</P>
<P>
This amount is still short of the reserve target of 15 billion
U.S. dollars for the full year set by the International Monetary
Fund, he said.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the increase in the reserve was the effect of the
good performance of the country's stock market whose shares of
stock are attracting foreign funds into the financial system.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the implementation of the government's
economic measures has resulted in the improvement of foreign
investors' trust in the country's financial system.
</P>
<P>
The government has put in place efficient monetary and fiscal
measures to caution the impact of crisis like massive outflow of
foreign funds due to unfavorable developments in the country, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Army to Resume Anti-Rebel Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Armed Forces of the
Philippines (AFP) are expected to resume normal counter-insurgency
action when the suspension of military operations (SOMO) against
rebels ends at midnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The SOMO is very specific up to April 19 and we will go back
to normal operation by then," AFP Chief of Staff Joselin B.
Nazareno told reporters on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada ordered the suspension of
military operations to pave the way for the release of Army
General Victor Obillo and Captain Eduardo Montealto. Both officers
were freed by the New People's Army (NPA) last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nazareno said Obillo and Montealto are still undergoing
debriefing at the AFP Intelligence Service.
</P>
<P>
Obillo is the highest ranking military officer captured by the
NPA in its guerrilla war with the government. Obillo and Montealto
had been held hostage for 59 days.
</P>
<P>
The debriefing will determine how extensive the two officers
had been influenced by their captors or if they had leaked any
sensitive information to the NPA, Nazareno said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Manufacturing Output Continues to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Economic slowdown and weak market
demand continued to drag down the output of the Philippines'
manufacturing in February 1999, the National Statistics Office
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The value of production of the manufacturing posted a
year-on-year drop of 8.1 percent in February 1999 while the volume
of production declined by 8.3 percent, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The value and volume of production of the country's
manufacturing sector contracted by 3.2 percent and 4.3 percent
respectively in January 1999 from a year earlier, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year decreases in February 1999 in value of
production were observed in seven out of 16 major sectors,
including petroleum products, basic metals, apparel, non-metallic
mineral products, transport equipment, food manufacturing and
paper and paper products.
</P>
<P>
The value of production in petroleum products posted the
biggest drop of 13.7 percent since October 1998 due to the
economic slowdown and also the low price of imported crude oil,
the office said.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the 16 sectors posted year-on-year decreases in the
volume of production during the period, led by food manufacturing
which dropped by 9.7 percent, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors which largely contributed to the decline of the
overall volume of production were apparel, basic metals, transport
equipment, non-metallic mineral, petroleum products, paper and
paper products and electrical machinery.
</P>
<P>
The situation was slightly improved when compared
month-on-month with January 1999, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing production had a near-zero month-on-month
contraction in February 1999 while sales turned in a double-digit
growth, it said.
</P>
<P>
On capacity utilization, the office said, manufacturing
establishments operating below 70-percent capacity were 41.8
percent in February 1999 compared with 39.4 percent a year ago,
the office said.
</P>
<P>
About 13.5 percent operated at full capacity in February 1999
compared with 17.8 percent a year ago, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Capacity utilization is defined as the ratio of output of a
plant to its maximum rated capacity.

<HEADLINE> Relics on Net, Websites to be Better Regulated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Computer networks should be used
to introduce Chinese culture to the world, while protecting
cultural relics, suggests a State Bureau of Cultural Relics
official.
</P>
<P>
"As a convenient and instant source of information, the
Internet can satisfy people's curiosity about ancient China and
help them understand Chinese culture," said Hou Junkun, director
of the bureau's Science and Education Division, quoted by today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Information about Chinese relics can be found at more than 60
websites. These sites were established by local museums and relics
bureaus primarily from Shannxi, Sichuan and Henan provinces and
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Hou stressed that establishments of these websites would not
have been so smooth without the efforts of devoted domestic
computer experts.
</P>
<P>
Foreign involvement, although not forbidden by the bureau, is
rare. To better regulate these websites, the bureau ordered them
placed under strict scrutiny last month.
</P>
<P>
Local museums and relics bureaus are required to obtain
official approval before introducing China's World Heritage sites,
places being excavated, the latest archaeological findings and
cultural relics under state protection on the Internet, according
to a bureau circular issued last month.
</P>
<P>
Computer and relics experts are preparing for a nationwide
information network of cultural relics, expected to be completed
this year. It will enhance research regarding relics and improve
the exchange of information.

<P>
PARIS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Two seeds were toppled in the first
round matches as the Monte Carlo Open unveiled its competition on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Boris Becker of Germany toppled 17th-seeded Cedric
Pioline of France 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 while Hicham Arazi of Morocco beat
11th-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia 6-1, 6-4 within one hour
in the 2.45 million US dollars tournament.
</P>
<P>
Becker, the 31-year-old veteran, a losing finalist last week in
Hong Kong to Andre Agassi, is showing that he's still a fighting
force on clay as he said that "I'm the best player to have never
won on clay - for now."
</P>
<P>
With a 9-0 slate, Becker got off to a good start in his first
clay surface match since last July, trading early breaks with
Pioline in the opening set but then turning on his power to surge
to a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
He snapped up the opener after 47 minutes and looked like he
would run away with the second set. However, Pioline won the next
set, only his second set in five matches against the German, a
three-time finalist here.
</P>
<P>
In other first round matches, No. 14 seed Tommy Haas of Germany
advanced over Russian teenager Marat Safin 6-4, 6-2. America's
Vince Spadea beat another young hopeful, when he dismissed world
junior champion Roger Federer of Switzerland 7-6, (7-3), 6-0.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Confident with Stability of Renminbi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A recent public opinion poll
shows that most Chinese residents are fully confident that the
Renminbi will remain stable amid the negative impact of the Asian
financial crisis, according to China Economic Times.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted in seven major Chinese cities, Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Harbin, Dalian and Wuhan, and
indicates that about 76 percent of the polled people said "no"
when being questioned whether China would devalue its currency,
and 42 percent say that they are not worrying about it.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by the Beijing-based Social Survey
Institute of China (SSIC), also shows that nearly two thirds
believe that China is capable of maintaining the stability of the
Renminbi, and another 18 percent say they believe in the Chinese
government's strong actions in keeping it stable.
</P>
<P>
Many people think that China has contributed a lot to
stabilizing the global economy in the past few years, and Hong
Kong's economy is strongly backed up by the central government's
promise that the yuan will not be devalued.
</P>
<P>
They also agree that devaluation will harm the interests of
foreign investors in China, at a cost of increasing China's debts
and threatening the stability of the Asian market.
</P>
<P>
China has a sound international payment system with revenues
exceeding expenditures and it has cut interest rates for the yuan
and raised export tax rebates. All these factors have provided a
solid foundation for stabilizing the Renminbi exchange rate,
according to financial specialists.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Defense Minister Werner
Fasslabend warned here Monday that the Kosovo crisis is the
biggest humanitarian and political catastrophe facing Europe ever
since World War Two.
</P>
<P>
To maintain order and stability in the Balkan region is vital
to peripheral countries, and Austria vows to seek a peaceful
solution to the Kosovo crisis, Fasslabend told the press after
meeting with his Hungarian counterpart Szabo Janos.
</P>
<P>
The debate in Austria on whether to join the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) should be brought to a halt, because
the country's security policy should not be the main topic of the
general elections, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fasslabend was on a one-day visit to Hungary for discussions
with Hungarian leaders about bilateral relations and the Kosovo
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Wise Escapes UEFA Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- England Premier League soccer club
Chelsea skipper escaped suspension when UEFA gave his green light
to play against Mallorca in the second leg of the European Cup
Winners' Cup semifinals on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The UEFA disciplinary committee in Geneva dismissed the case
against Wise who had been accused of biting Mallorca's Marcelino
in the shoulder during the first leg at Stamford Bridge two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
It decided that although Wise's "unsporting gesture warrants
clear disapproval, there is no legal basis in UEFA's disciplinary
regulations for imposing a disciplinary sanction".
</P>
<P>
Dick Jol, the Dutch referee, did not book the midfielder for
the incident which was caught by television cameras.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, UEFA said that Wise appeared to make an attempt
to bite Marcelino after a goalmouth incident.
</P>
<P>
UEFA confirmed on Monday they can impose sanctions for
incidents not seen by the referee if such incidents correspond to
"gross unsportsmanship".
</P>
<P>
UEFA said: "The incident must be so serious that failing to
punish it would contradict general legal opinion."
</P>
<P>
But the committee, chaired by Alain Courtois of Belgium,
dismissed the case.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea, the Cup Winners' Cup holders, were held to a 1-1 draw
by Mallorca in London. The second leg is in Spain on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> England to Bring 2,500 Children to 2006 World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and Britain's leading football knight Sir Bobby Charlton on Monday
launched England's Welcome to the World -- a project which will
bring more than 2,500 children from all corners of the globe to
England to take part in the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
It is the latest weapon that the organizers unveiled in the
battle to host the four-yearly extravegenza.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will cost four million pounds on bringing
children from all 203 FIFA affiliated members to spend two weeks
in England, is the main feature of England's theme for its bid --
Putting Young People First.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said that the children will have the chance to
attend World Cup matches, live with local families as part of a
cultural exchange, attend coaching sessions and generally enjoy
the World Cup experience.
</P>
<P>
All their travel and other expenses will be paid for out of the
profits of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Alec McGivan, the director of England's bid, told a news
conference: "In what will be the world's biggest ever sports-
related cultural exchange, 12 young people from each of FIFA's 203
affiliated members will be invited to come to England for the
World Cup."
</P>
<P>
"We believe England's Welcome to the World to be the biggest
sport-related cultural exchange programme ever undertaken. It is
part of our vision to make the 2006 World Cup more than a sporting
festival. We will make it a great festival of international
friendship; about all a great festival of youth. We know the rest
of the footballing world will share our enthusiasm and our passion
for this idea," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking at No. 10 Downing Street
today, said: "Everyone is excited about the possibility of having
the World Cup in England, but we also want to create a football
legacy that will run beyond 2006.
</P>
<P>
"I know that young people are the future of this great sport. I
believe that England's commitment to put young people first will
make the 2006 World Cup in England a truly unique experience."
</P>
<P>
Sir Bobby Charlton said: "If our bid is successful, then it is
our hope that the impact of the tournament will reach far beyond
the 32 qualifying nations and far beyond 2006, It will mean that
every footballing nation in the world will share the experience of
England 2006."
</P>
<P>
The soccer legend denied suggestions that the offer was an
improper use of funds.
</P>
<P>
"If you want to be cynical, then people will say it's a kind of
bribe," said the 1966 World Cup winner.
</P>
<P>
"But it's not. We will make a good profit out of the World Cup
if we are successful and we should put some of it aside to give
back to the rest of the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sports Minister Tony Banks said that the minor crowd
trouble after Manchester United defeated Arsenal 2-1 in an epic F.
A. Cup semifinal replay last week would not have a negative impact
on England's bid.
</P>
<P>
Although Manchester United and Arsenal fans were seen to be
involved in scuffles on the pitch at Villa Park, Banks said: "
There was no trouble as far as I could see but a joyous fiesta of
football supporters who went on the pitch to cheer their heroes.
There might have been a minor fracas but it was not harmful to our
bid."

<P>
LONDON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Ireland's Ken Doherty advanced
into the second round of the World Snooker Championships in
Sheffield on Monday with a 10-3 victory over England's Steve James.
</P>
<P>
Doherty, 8-1 ahead overnight, saw James taking the first two
frames of the second session before he produced a century break
then potted a long black to secure victory.
</P>
<P>
Doherty, last year's runner-up, was left to reflect on a missed
opportunity to compile a maximum 147 -- worth 167,000 pounds (269,
600 U.S. dollars). His chance came in the penultimate frame when
his positioning let him down after sinking 13 reds and 13 blacks.
</P>
<P>
"It was a great opportunity because the balls were so nice," he
admitted. "I just got a bit straight on the black."
</P>
<P>
Doherty now faces Nigel Bond of England in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Alain Robidoux became the second seeded player
eliminated when he lost 10-6 against England's Nick Walker.
</P>
<P>
James Wattana of Thailand edged to a 5-4 overnight lead in his
first round, best-of-19 frames, clash with Hong Kong prospect
Marco Fu.
</P>
<P>
Fu, ranked 377th in the world, was making his championship
debut.

<HEADLINE> More Businesses to Help Fight Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China will encourage more
businesses to become involved in the management of pollution
control facilities.
</P>
<P>
Yin Gai, director of the technology and standards department of
the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA), said
that the administration will authorize a number of companies to
operate pollution control facilities.
</P>
<P>
With the country's enhanced environmental protection efforts,
many cities and enterprises have installed such facilities.
However, a large number have not operated well due to weak
environmental awareness, backward technology and poor management.
</P>
<P>
The SEPA selected 17 companies last December to run anti-
pollution programs on a trial basis and the companies will be
issued licenses in May if they are running well, said Yin who
attended a meeting here recently on the management of pollution
control facilities.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that detailed policies will be drafted to encourage
more companies to become involved.

ban Levski Kyustendil from hosting three matches and to impose 720,
000 leva (720 Deutsche marks) fine on the club.
</P>
<P>
The decision is in connection with an incident which took place

</P>

CSKA refused to take the field after the incident.
</P>
<P>
The BFU Technical Committee ruled that no points be awarded
from the match to any of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Levski Kyustendil will deposit a complaint at the BFU
Appellative Commission against the decision of the Disciplinary
Committee, the club's Executive Director Emil Nakov said.
</P>

before the BFU Executive Committee and even before UEFA and a

<P>
BERLIN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Joerg Berger returned to coach the
struggling Eintracht Frankfurt Monday with the daunting task of
saving the club from relegation for the second time after 1989.
</P>
<P>
Berger, who took the helm of Frankfurt club from January 1989
through April 1991, succeeded Reinhold Fanz, who was fired the
previous day after only four months during which Frankfurt won
just one of nine games.
</P>
<P>
"I have come here to achieve the impossible in the last seven
games. I would not have taken the job if I didn't believe I could
do it. I am convinced it is possible, there are still 21 points on
offer," said the 54-year-old Berger.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt are ranked 17th with 23 points, four shy of safe 15th
place currently occupied by SC Freiburg. Berger's contract runs
until June 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Fanz had replaced Horst Ehrmanntraut, who was fired December 8,
on January 2, but was under fire from club president Rolf Heller
from the first day. He was the seventh Bundesliga trainer forced
to leave early and the 245th in the league's 36-year history.

<HEADLINE> Arsenal Trounce Wimbledon 5-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Arsenal
narrowed its gap to one point with English Premier League
pacesetter Manchester United after a 5-1 win over Wimbledon on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ray Parlour slotted in the opener in the 34th minute but
Arsenal really ran wild in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Vieira made it 2-0 in the 49th minute with a left-
footed rocket from the edge of the area off a pass from Nigel
Winterburn and the floodgates were opened.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal scored three goals in a three minute spell, with
Wimbledon's Ben Thatcher making it 3-0 in the 56th after a header
from Nigerian Nwankwo Kanu rebounded off the upright and into the
path of the luckless defender.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Bergkamp, who floated in the ball for Kanu's header,
made it 4-0 in the 57th with a right-footed shot that goalkeeper
Neil Sullivan could only deflect in at the far post.
</P>
<P>
Kanu, robbed of one goal, then made sure of another by linking
up with Vieira and finishing a long-legged run into the box with a
toe-in on the line as Sullivan dived in vain.
</P>
<P>
Carl Cort pulled a goal back for Wimbledon in the 70th minute
with a header off a free kick but there were no celebrations from
a visiting team that was never in the match and could have gone
considerably further behind.
</P>
<P>
United, who now have a game in hand over Arsenal and who beat
the Londoners 2-1 in an epic F.A. Cup semifinal replay five days
ago, have 67 points while Arsenal have 66.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea, who have played the same number of games as Arsenal,
are third on 64.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal beat Wimbledon 5-0 a year ago in the match that sent
them a point clear of United and on the way to the title.
</P>
<P>
In Monday's clash, Arsenal scored the same number of goals but
were left one point short of their rivals. But, on this sort of
form, nobody will be counting them out.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Families Keen to Install Second Telephone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 30,000 families in
Beijing have applied for an additional domestic telephone since
telecom authorities cut the fees on March 1st this year.
</P>
<P>
The figure is 232 percent of that for the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The cost of installing a first telephone in Beijing has been
lowered from 3,600 yuan (430 US dollars) to more than 1,000 yuan (
120 US dollars) as approved by the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
There is now no charge to install a second or additional phone
line in a single family, according to the regulation. This was
part of a Ministry of Information Industry plan to cut telephone
installation fees.
</P>
<P>
Many people joined a long line in front of the Beijing
Municipal Telephone Office to apply for telephone installation,
eyewitnesses said.
</P>
<P>
And about 100,000 Beijingers have submitted applications since
March 1. More than 60,000 of them have had the telephones
installed including a second phone for 10,000 families.
</P>
<P>
There are now an average of 48 telephones for every 100
residents in the Chinese capital.

<HEADLINE> Floods in Yangtze River Still Possible This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Big floods are still possible in
the Yangtze River valley this summer, especially in the middle and
upper reaches.
</P>
<P>
The warning came from Li Antian, director of the Yangtze River
Water Resources Committee (YRWRC), who said there is a high
probability that the upper river valley will experience bigger
floods than last year.
</P>
<P>
There has been little rainfall in the Yangtze River valley
since last winter and many experts predict that when it comes it
will be concentrated during the flood season this year, according
to experts at a recent meeting on flood control.
</P>
<P>
Jin Xingping, deputy chief engineer of the hydrology bureau
under the YRWRC, predicted that the highest water level of the
mainstream and tributary of the Yangtze, the longest river in
China, will be higher this year than that in the previous years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the possible increase in the number of typhoons in
the lower reaches will add to the possibility of big floods this
year.
</P>
<P>
Nie Rongfang, senior engineer with the Hunan Provincial Water
Resources Department, has called that regions in the valley should
be fully prepared for the possible disaster.
</P>
<P>
Local governments along the river have been asked to complete
anti-flood projects as quickly as possible.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The world's forests are
exploited far beyond their ability to reproduce, said the World
Commission on Forest and Sustainable Development, a
non-governmental organization on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 75 percent of West Africa's tropical forests have been
lost since 1950 while Thailand lost a third of its forests in just
10 years in the 1980s, said the group in a report.
</P>
<P>
Forests face an even shakier future with the global population
expected to grow 50 percent in the next half century, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
The Commission co-chaired by Former Swedish Prime Minister ola
Ullsten calls for a set of global, national and local-level
arrangements to involve people in all decisions concerning their
forests.
</P>
<P>
The report challenges a handful of countries with some 85
percent of the world's forests to exercise leadership in
protecting the forest environment.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi-based U.N. Environment Program said it is important
that the report offers a way out of the forest crisis the world is
facing.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Refugee: We Want to Live in Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- An ethnic Albanian refugee, who
just arrived two day ago in Kukes, north Albania, said Monday that
Kosovo refugees want to live in peace.
</P>
<P>
Sitting in a tent which his six-member family was sharing with
another family of four, 24-year-old Ali Geci said that he heard
two huge explosions in the night of March 24.
</P>
<P>
Windows and doors of his house were shaken open, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
He, along with his wife, father, mother, younger sister and
brother was forced to leave their home in Mitrovica, a town 40
kilometers to the Kosovo capital of Pristina, on April 15.
</P>
<P>
They traveled three days to reach Kukes after crossing the
border at the Morina post.
</P>
<P>
"During the first night after our arrival, I slept in the open
air to let kids stay in the car and it was raining and cold. But
the second night we were given a tent and it was much better." he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has loss contact with his elder sister, who has
a one-year-old baby, on their way to Albania.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where she is now, " said the young man, who is
now helping Italian humanitarian workers to do sanitation work in
the refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
"We don't like the fighting and war in Kosovo and we want to
live in peace. When all this calms down, we will return to our
home. But for the moment, we want to go to Germany to join my
elder brother, " he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked if he thinks the German embassy will give them visas
to go, Geci replied he is not sure whether the German ambassador
will issue visas for them or not.
</P>
<P>
He said that he supports Imbrahim Rugova, the moderate ethnic
Albanian leader in Kosovo, who stands for a peaceful solution to
the Kosovo issue through political negotiations with Serbs.
</P>
<P>
"We can wait one year, two years or three years and for people
it is no problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What we want is a Kosovo with no Serb police and military. And
as for the common Serb people, they are free to choose to stay in
Kosovo or leave," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), which is seen by Yugoslavia
as a terrorist organization, could not succeed because they have
no sufficient food to eat and no camps to live, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Almost all ethnic Albanians in Kosovo wants the problem to be
solved through peaceful means," said the young Kosovo Albanian,
whose wife prepared two small cups of coffee for us when the talk
was going on.
</P>
<P>
The coffee was good but the life here was miserable.
</P>
<P>
"Food is no problem. Besides other food items, every child can
have one liter of milk and adult half a liter each day, " Geci
said satisfactorily.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Stop Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Conference on Use of Children
as Soldiers in Africa opened here Monday, calling African states
concerned to take measures to prevent children from being
conscripted.
</P>
<P>
The conference was hosted by the Mozambican Ministry of Social
Action Co- ordination, the Mozambican News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will focus on such issues as the use of children as
soldiers and the reintegration of these children into society.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 people representing governments of different African
countries, non-governmental organizations and international
institutions participated in the meeting which will last for four
days.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there are at least 300,000 children under
18 years of age involved in armed conflicts around the world.
</P>
<P>
U.N. representative for child soldier affairs, Olara Otunnu,
said at the opening of the meeting that the governments of African
states should take up the responsibility for protecting children
in the armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He deplored that the wars in the continent have made thousands
of children killed or orphaned.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu pointed out that the governments concerned should make
efforts to sensitize the whole society so that no more children
would be involved in the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Only the youths over 18 years of age can be recruited, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. representative also suggested the establishment of "a
global commune" to help the children soldiers to return to society
through entertainment programs on radio and television.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the world community to help those children in
Kosovo who have neither drinking water nor food.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economist Predicts Gentle Global Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES. April 19 (Xinhua) -- An American economist said
Monday that the global economy is experiencing "a gentle recovery"
from its worst crisis in 60 years, citing the ability of the
international financial markets to withstand the fallout from
Brazil's currency devaluation.
</P>
<P>
Bharat Nauriyal, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance, one
of the U.S. largest diversified insurance and financial services
organizations, also pointed to the 52 percent jump in oil prices
over the last two months as another indicator of recovery. The
turnaround in oil prices presages a likely reversal in commodity
prices and could bear implications for the global inflation cycle
in the coming year, said the economist in Nationwide's
Second-Quarter Global Economic Outlook.
</P>
<P>
Nauriyal attributed the ongoing recovery to short-term rate
cuts and money-supply growth -- two factors that are
policy-induced rather than driven by changes in fundamental
economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that some concerns about the lasting power of
this recovery are justifiable.
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent 50 basis point cut in interest rates by the
European Central Bank, Nauriyal said that he remains inconvinced
that the global economy is fully out of trouble. He cited the
future of China's currency, a U.S. equity market correction led by
a pull-back in consumer spending and a Y2K problem-induced global
downturn next year as the "prominent risks" in this outlook.
</P>
<P>
While there are risks ahead, Nauriyal said that things could be
better if China upholds its pledge to not devalue its currency and
the gradual turnaround in Asia will continue to reinforce itself.
He added that the expected rate cuts finally delivered last week
by the European Central Bank will stimulate growth in Europe and
the U.S. will continue to remain prosperous long enough for global
imbalances to gradually work themselves out.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the United States, Nauriyal said that while a
slowdown is still forecast, this projection remains unusually
divorced from reality. Consumer confidence has almost regained its
record levels as the dynamics of falling unemployment and the
absence of inflation continue to boost real household income.
</P>
<P>
Considering that fourth-quarter 1999 growth in the United
States is likely to be abnormally strong this year due to
Y2K-related inventory buildup, Nauriyal said that this calls for
an upward revision of the 1999 U.S. growth projection from 2.3
percent to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Asia spearheaded by corporate restructuring, Nauriyal said
that a gradual recovery continues. He said that nowhere in Asia is
the scale of restructuring more prominent and visible than in
Japan, anticipating that unemployment will exceed 5 percent by
year end. With consumer spending down and Japan experiencing its
fifth straight quarterly decline in gross domestic product,
Nauriyal said that he expects the government to attempt to reflate
the economy by printing more money.

<HEADLINE> WHO Head Stresses Pregnancy Safety in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Director-General of the World
Health Organization (WHO), Gro Brundtland, Monday urged the
African countries to pay more attention to pregnancy safety.
</P>
<P>
She said in Maputo, capital of Mozambique, that Africa should
not lose precious human resources any longer, pledging that her
organization will fulfill its commitment to pregnancy safety.
</P>
<P>
Brundtland, who arrived here Monday for a two-day visit to the
southern African country, made the call at a forum on the issue of
maternal death.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican News Agency quoted her as saying that African
women face the highest danger of death when pregnant or when
giving birth compared with other women in the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
In some African countries, the maternal death rates at one of
every 16 pregnant women while in Europe or North America, the rate
is only one of every 4,000, she noted.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 8,000 Mozambican women die as giving
birth every year.
</P>
<P>
Brundtland held talks with Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano in Maputo Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chissano pledged to maintain good cooperation between
Mozambique and the World Health Organization, saying that his
government will give priority to health when working out programs.
</P>
<P>
This is Brundtland's first African trip after she was elected
Director- General of WHO last May. She will also visit Zimbabwe
and Cote d'Ivoire after her tour in Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Apache Helicopters Fail to Turn up in Tirana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Apache helicopters Monday
once again failed to turn up in the Rinas air force base in
Tirana, capital of Albania.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Air Force officer told reporters that the Apaches would
not arrive Monday for reasons he said he did not know.
</P>
<P>
NATO supreme commander Wesley Clark, during his short visit to
Albania last Saturday, said that the 24 Apache helicopters, which
have arrived in an Italian air base, would come "very shortly".
</P>
<P>
It was widely speculated that the U.S. helicopters would come
on Sunday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Air Force officer said that he had no information on
when the helicopters will come eventually.
</P>
<P>
The Rinas air base, which has been put at the disposal of the
NATO forces, was not as hectic as it was on Sunday when
helicopters involved in humanitarian tasks and U.S. C-17 transport
jumbos carrying arms and army vehicles kept landing and taking off
almost non-stop.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Vehicles carrying guided missiles and launching
assemblies, which were seen being loaded onto trucks and carried
away to an unknown destination from the Rinas air base on Sunday,
were roaming on roads near the airport.
</P>
<P>
The presence of U.S. soldiers was more visible to the public
from a day ago as more and more U.S. armed vehicles with
heavily-armed soldiers mounting on top of them rolled out of the
airport and run on roads mixed with civilian cars.
</P>
<P>
NATO, which has been bombing Yugoslavia in a bid to make
Yugoslav President bow to its conditions for settling the Kosovo
crisis, is sending 8,000 troops to carry out what is called the
humanitarian "Allied Harbor" operation and 2,000 U.S. armymen to
man and support the 24 Apache helicopters.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: Apaches Due in Albania Tuesday (Wrap-up) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon announced Monday
that 24 Apache attack helicopters will move from Italy to their
new base in Albania on Tuesday and they could be ready for attacks
on Serbian forces in a week.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon hopes that the low-flying aircraft would increase
NATO's ability to destroy Serb tanks and troops sweeping Kosovo,
but would also be vulnerable to heavy Serb anti-aircraft fire.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a briefing at the Pentagon, U.S. Air Force Brig.
Gen. Charles Wald said that heavy rains in recent days had caused
very muddy conditions at Tirana airport, where the helicopters
will be based, but the Army had put down aluminum mats for them.
</P>
<P>
In another development on Monday,U.S. President Bill Clinton
said he would ask U.S. Congress for emergency funds to pay for
NATO's Kosovo air campaign and for resolving the refugee crisis
resulting from the war.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a White House event, Clinton did not say how much
is being requested, but said he hopes Congress will approve it
"right away."
</P>
<P>
However, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said it would be
roughly six billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Congressional sources said they expected the request to include
5.45 billion U.S. dollars for the war and about 491 million U.S.
dollars for the refugee crisis.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the emergency spending would "ensure that we have
the resources to sustain the air campaign to ensure that we
achieve our goals while maintaining our high level of general
military readiness."
</P>
<P>
"The need for this funding is urgent, immediate, clearly in the
national interest," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"There are... lives hanging in the balance. And so I hope in a
spirit of genuine bipartisanship the Congress will move the
package right away."
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Clinton spoke with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin for 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Clinton and Yeltsin had spoken since
the start of the airstrikes, and the conversation came after
Yeltsin named a special envoy for the crisis last week.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said that the two reviewed the agreement and
disagreement concerning the Kosovo crisis. The two sides continue
to disagree on NATO's bombing and the deployment of NATO troops in
Kosovo to implement a peace agreement, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States is seeking NATO support for
cutting off seaborne shipments of oil into Yugoslavia to limit
President Slobodan Milosevic's ability to fight ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Refusing to give details on the U.S. plan, Lockhart said only
that NATO was considering "a variety of things" that could loosen
Milosevic's grip on power.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that these are ideas that are worth pursuing, and
that's what's being discussed," he said.

The fire began on the Everglades' western edge Saturday,
possibly ignited by a vehicle's catalytic converter.

<P>
Fanned by erratic, swirling wind, it quickly became the largest
of more than 2,450 blazes that have burned 130,000 acres in the
state this year.
</P>
<P>
The fire raced across 35,000 acres Saturday and had burned a
total of about 90,000 acres by Monday, said Bernadine Thomas, a duty
officer with the state Division of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters from Texas and Arizona were called in to help.

<P>
With rainfall 90 percent below normal during Florida's dry
season from December through April, officials fear a repeat of last
summer, when fires blackened 500,000 acres and forced 100,000
people from their homes.
