<HEADLINE> An `Outlaw' Wins Quarter Horse Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUIDOSO DOWNS, N.M. (AP) -- The outlaw horse with an attitude  
stole the biggest sprint in quarter horse racing. 
</P>
<P>
	A Delightful Dasher, who reminds his owner of ``a teen-age boy  
with a black leather jacket,'' prevailed in a stirring three-horse 
match race Monday to win the 41st running of the $2 million All 
American Futurity at Ruidoso Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-year-old gelding with a penchant for kicking and biting  
anyone within range, ran down the filly Significant Speed and the 
previously undefeated Chicks Call Me 
</P>
<P>
	A Delightful Dasher took the lead in the final strides and  
finished a head in front of Chicks Calls Me, who also caught 
Significant Speed just before the wire. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was worth $1,040,145 to owner Gwendolyn Eaves of  
Midland, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaves, a retired horse breeder and bridge player from Midland,  
Texas, had the fourth place finisher in the 1998 All American with 
Hes My Dasher. That horse was undefeated going into the futurity, 
but Eaves said she felt much more confident this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's kind of a half-way outlaw, but he's got so much heart,''  
she said. ``We saved him for this race and it paid off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Significant Speed, breaking from the No. 3 post, left the gate  
so fast, that she quickly opened up a length lead on the rest of 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``She made it look like we all got a bad start,'' said A  
Delightful Dasher's jockey, Joe Badilla. 
</P>
<P>
	The filly stretched her lead midway through the race and looked  
like a winner. But Badilla, running next to the inside rail, 
switched his whip from his right hand to his left and his horse 
responded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I switched sticks about midway and got within three-quarters  
of her,'' Badilla said. ``Then I switched back to the right and 
then there was no doubt I was going to catch her. It was a matter 
of when and how. I caught her about 20 yards from the wire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer John Bassett said Badilla's decision to switch from his  
right hand to his left got the winner rolling. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't break like he can, but that mare (Significant Speed)  
left so fast ... we had to make up some ground. I saw Joe whipping 
him right-handed. We weren't doing a whole lot. All of a sudden he 
switched sticks and hit him left handled and it just shot him out 
of a rocket,'' Bassett said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Delightful Dasher covered the 440 yards in 21.60 seconds and  
as the second choice in the betting behind Chicks Called Me paid 
$7.40, $3.20 and $2.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicks Call Me, owned by the Tulsa, Okla., partnership of C.E.  
Tuggle and W.R. Anglin, earned $291,240 and lost for the first time 
in seven races this year. He paid $3 and $2.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacky Martin, the jockey of Chicks Call Me, said his horse got  
off to the worst start this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was standing perfect, and he just didn't break,'' Martin  
said. ``He just kind of hopped in the air when the gates opened. It 
took 50 to 75 yards to get heads up with the other horses and the 
filly still had us beat a length. He ran a super race once he left 
the gates. No excuses, he just didn't leave running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Significant Speed, owned by the Scarlett Hill Farm of  
Weatherford, Texas, got the third place purse of $124,817 and paid 
$5.40 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the fourth in five races for A Delightful Dasher,  
who also won the $525,000 Rainbow Futurity over the same track in 
July. It also was the first win in the futurity for Eaves, Badilla 
and Bassett. 
</P>
<P>
	In the winner's circle celebration, Bassett took a moment to  
remember his late father, Joe Bassett, who got him started in 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father qualified a horse to this race in the 1960s, but  
wasn't fortunate enough to win it,'' Bassett said. ``He taught me 
everything I know about training a horse. Dad, wherever you are, 
this one's for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The order of finish after the top three was: Tiny First Down,  
Southern Cash Man, He Rocks, Familiar Faces, Moolah Memories and 
Tell Her More. Snappy Dragon was scratched from the race because of 
a chipped bone in his left knee.

<HEADLINE> Bush Dismissive of NAACP Flag Push </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIMPSONVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Declaring outsiders should ``butt  
out'' out of the issue, George W. Bush was dismissive Monday of an 
NAACP effort to push for a national tourism boycott of South 
Carolina to force down the Confederate flag from its Statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning in the state, Bush said the NAACP's boycott plans  
were initiated by ``some people who don't live in South Carolina, 
evidently'' and he reiterated his position that ``I think the good 
people of South Carolina can'' settle the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if the civil rights group should back off, Bush said,  
``That's up to the NAACP.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate appearance later in the day, Bush said ``my advice  
is for people who don't live in South Carolina to butt out of the 
issue. The people of South Carolina can make that decision.'' That 
prompted cheers from holiday festival-goers in Simpsonville, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't particularly like it when people came in to tell me  
what to do in Texas,'' Bush added. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush should show more concern about the flag dispute, state Rep.  
Leon Howard, a black Columbia Democrat, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an issue that it takes leadership to address,'' Howard  
said. ``And (when you) find people waffling and dancing around and 
not wanting to take the issue head-on, then it's a lack of 
leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's stance shows he ``is wooing the white voters of South  
Carolina to support his candidacy,'' the Rev. H.H. Singleton, 
president of the Conway branch of the NAACP, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and other candidates are courting South Carolinians for the  
Feb. 19 Republican primary, which is considered an important early 
barometer for how candidates will do in the conservative South. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag controversy has embroiled South Carolina for several  
years. The state is the only one in the nation to fly the 
Confederate flag over its Statehouse, although Georgia and 
Mississippi incorporate part of the design into their state flags. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  
says the flag is a symbol of racism. But supporters say the flag 
represents Southern heritage and honors South Carolinians who died 
in the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic candidate Bill Bradley said in April that ``I  
wouldn't fly it. I think that it sometimes offends a large part of 
the population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walking in a Labor Day parade and attending another Labor Day  
festival in Simpsonville, Bush also said ``it's up to the people of 
South Carolina to figure out how best to fund their schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina residents will vote next year about whether they  
want a lottery to fund education improvements. South Carolina's 
schools lag behind others in Scholastic Assessment Test scores.

<HEADLINE> Gamecocks' Skip Holtz Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina offensive coordinator Skip  
Holtz, son of coach Lou Holtz, was hospitalized with stomach pains 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was in pain Thursday and it kept getting worse,'' Lou Holtz  
said. ``We don't know what it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Skip's condition keeps him out, his father would take a more  
active role in an offense that looked feeble and mistake prone in a 
10-0 loss to North Carolina State Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gamecocks committed eight fumbles, losing four, and  
quarterback Phil Petty threw an interception and struggled to keep 
the ball from squirting out of his hands in the soggy conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Without his offensive coaching leader, Lou Holtz said he would  
get more involved in South Carolina's attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you how many games I've coached how few times  
I've been shut out,'' the coach said. ``I haven't been to bed yet, 
I can't sleep after losses. I am going to be more intense than I've 
ever been.''

<HEADLINE> Hackers Vandalize C-Span Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hackers vandalized the Internet site of the  
C-SPAN cable network Sunday, replacing its Web page with a bizarre 
note that included lyrics from a punk rock band. 
</P>
<P>
	The hackers, calling themselves ``United Loan Gunmen,'' also  
claimed responsibility for the defacement of the Internet site for 
ABC just weeks ago. The group is believed to be relatively newly 
formed, and its only known attacks have been the ones against 
C-SPAN and ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at C-SPAN, the public affairs cable network that  
broadcasts House and Senate proceedings and other public affairs 
programming, could not be reached Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site for C-SPAN was temporarily replaced with a black  
page carrying the logo for the hacker group. It also included 
lyrics from a song by the punk band, Dead Kennedys, that purports 
to be a conversation between a U.S. government official and the 
leader of a Middle Eastern country. 
</P>
<P>
	The defacement against C-SPAN was first reported on a Web site,  
Attrition.Org, which tracks hacking efforts on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Despite Dennis, Drought Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- The remnants of Dennis spread rain across  
the mid-Atlantic states on Monday, but authorities said days of 
precipitation and flooding weren't enough to cancel the devastating 
drought. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a hurricane, then a tropical storm and now downgraded to a  
tropical depression, Dennis spawned minor flooding in Virginia and 
threatened to cause showers in Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, heavy rains drenched parts of North Carolina,  
Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey and New York. Raleigh, N.C., got 
more than 7 inches of rain, and water reservoirs in New Jersey were 
up an inch and a half. Still, much of the East remained parched. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't break a drought with one storm,'' said National  
Weather Service meteorologist Joel Kline. ``You need to increase 
your water over a long period of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would have been more helpful if the quick and heavy downpours  
were spread out more evenly, said Jim Poirier, a Weather Service 
meteorologist in Mount Holly, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The hard, dry ground can only soak up so much water and the rest  
just runs off into storm drains and streams. ``It's like filling a 
flower pot too quickly,'' Poirier said. 
</P>
<P>
	For days last week, the storm wreaked havoc on North Carolina's  
coast. As a hurricane, it sideswiped the Outer Banks, then went out 
to sea and stalled. It backtracked and came ashore on Saturday, 
then slowly made its way inland, dumping up to 20 inches of rain on 
coastal North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was blamed for a tornado in Hampton, Va., on Saturday  
that ripped roofs off houses and apartments and damaged about 800 
cars. A federal disaster declaration was announced Monday.

<HEADLINE> Smart Guy Wins Pennsylvania Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENSALEM, Pa. (AP) -- After losing the lead with a furlong to go,  
Smart Guy came on a second time and beat Ghost Ring by a head to 
win the $300,000 Pennsylvania Derby at Philadelphia Park on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Bobby Colton, the bay colt, which was purchased from a  
sale in Maryland two years ago for $10,000, went right to the front 
of the 10-horse field and set the pace for the first mile of the 
1 1/8-mile race for 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghost Ring, ridden by Aaron Gryder, took the lead after a mile  
and ran with Smart Guy second for about 20 yards, then Smart Guy 
came on again. 
</P>
<P>
	With Ghost Ring on the outside and Smart Guy on the rail, the  
colts battled head to head to the wire with Smart Guy getting there 
first in 1:49 2-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Pineaff, the winner of the Tampa Bay Derby and a ninth-place  
finisher in the Belmont Stakes, closed ground on the leaders in the 
stretch but was another five lengths back in third. 
</P>
<P>
	Smart Guy earned $180,000 to raise his lifetime total to  
$373,290 for the Goodfellas Stable of Wilmington, Del.

<HEADLINE> Union, Teachers, Say Strike May End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- After negotiating through the weekend,  
representatives of both Detroit's public schools and striking 
teachers voiced optimism that a settlement was near. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks resumed Sunday morning and continued without a break until  
11 p.m. EDT, when representatives for both sides emerged with 
settlement proposals, a sign that talks had progressed to final 
stages, a district spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dialogue was to resume at noon today.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, they'll be able to work out what remains of the  
details,'' said Stan Childress, a spokesman for the district's 
interim chief executive, David Adamany. ``Both sides sounded 
optimistic that could happen'' as early as today, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Elliott, the president of the Detroit Federation of  
Teachers, told the Detroit Free Press in today's editions that an 
agreement on substantial issues had been reached, but that 
stumbling blocks of an economic nature remained. 
</P>
<P>
	Childress said ``all of the issues had economic implications,''  
though he declined to elaborate whether such issues included merit 
pay, which had been mentioned as a sticking point. 
</P>
<P>
	As negotiators met Sunday behind closed doors inside the Schools  
Center Building, about 125 people rallied outside to show support 
for the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
	``No more second-class education for Detroit youths,'' said Cass  
Tech High School math teacher Steve Conn. ``Equal opportunity now. 
That should be the banner at the union hall. That should be the 
banner right here at the Schools Center Building. Give Detroit 
youth and give Detroit teachers what they deserve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rally was organized by a group of teachers and community  
supporters who want the teachers' union to push harder for smaller 
class sizes and other concessions. The district educates 172,000 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Conn said he believes teachers could be called as soon as  
Tuesday to vote on a new proposal. Although he has not seen what 
has been negotiated, he called on teachers to reject whatever 
contract was presented. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will likely have some reforms that we want, but I'm here to  
say it's not going to be enough. It's not what we deserve. And it's 
not really what we can get if we continue to fight,'' Conn said. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the message of speaker after speaker during the  
two-hour rally. Speakers also criticized Adamany, Mayor Dennis 
Archer, who installed a reform school board earlier this year, and 
Gov. John Engler, who supported installing the reform school board. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous contract between the school system and the 9,200  
teachers represented by the union expired June 30, and an extension 
ran out Aug. 30. Teachers voted that day to go on strike, stalling 
the scheduled start of classes. 
</P>
<P>
	A state law bans walkouts by educators. Adamany has said  
lawmakers likely would invoke that 1994 no-strike law, which fines 
teachers one day's pay for each day on strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers attending the rally Sunday said they weren't worried.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to let threats scare me,'' said Reanatta  
Waldman, a special education teacher at Joy Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
	Adamany has said that if the strike continues, the school  
district plans to begin notifying other school employees Tuesday 
when they can expect layoffs.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- San Francisco's Livan Hernandez left Monday's  
game against the New York Mets with tightness in his rib cage. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander threw one warmup pitch in the bottom of the  
third inning of the scoreless game before grabbing his left side. 
Giants manager Dusty Baker and a trainer went to the mound to check 
Hernandez before taking him out of the game and replacing him with 
Mark Gardner. X-rays were negative, and he will be re-evaluated 
when the team returns to San Francisco on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez hit a long drive to right field in the top of the  
third and may have injured himself swinging. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez (7-11) went two innings, allowed one hit and struck  
out one. Acquired from Florida on July 24 for minor league pitchers 
Jason Grilli and Nate Bump, he is 0-5 in five starts against the 
Mets this season. He is 2-6 in 11 career starts against them.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Assaults GOP Tax Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- President Clinton chose an overcrowded  
elementary school Monday as the backdrop for a renewed assault on 
the Republican-passed tax cut plan, which Democrats contend would 
steal money from desperately needed school construction programs. 
</P>
<P>
	At Coleman Place Elementary School, built in 1924, Clinton  
called on Republicans in Congress to ``leave politics at the school 
house door'' and embrace his proposal for tax breaks to help school 
districts repair, expand and modernize schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, before addressing parents, teachers and students who  
had gathered on the school softball field, joined in renovating one 
of the schools classrooms. Using a cordless electric drill, the 
president fastened about eight screws to attach the top of a 
computer table. 
</P>
<P>
	Then addressing the crowd, Clinton attacked the GOP tax cut  
plan, which he already has promised to veto. ``It means larger 
classes, fewer students and more leaky roofs,'' said Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Later at a Labor Day picinic at the home of the mother of Rep.  
Bobby Scott, D-Va., Clinton renewed his attack on the GOP tax 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before we have this big tax cut the Republicans have proposed,  
we ought to take care of the big challenges facing America,'' 
declared the president, ticking off protecting Social Security, 
Medicare and education ``We ought to get this country out of debt 
for the first time since 1835 before we give the money away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	En route to the picnic, Clinton in a helicopter flew over some  
tornado damage in the Hampton, Va., area. Earlier he had declared 
the region a disaster area, making victims eligible for federal 
assistance. About 250 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed and 
about a dozen people injured by the storm over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not against cutting taxes'' said Clinton at the school,  
but that the Republican's $792 billion cut over 10 years would mean 
sharp cuts in domestic spending including education. The Democrats 
have suggested a more modest nearly $300 billion cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke in front of temporary trailers used by Coleman  
students as classrooms because of lack of school space. He said 
Virginia schools alone use e 3,000 such trailers and there are 
similar classroom shortages and schools in need of repair 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	About a third of American public schools, or 25,000 buildings,  
need extensive repair or replacement, according to the General 
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. The GAO also 
calculated that $112 billion is needed just to repair existing 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our schools are crumbling and it is a national disgrace,''  
declared AFL-CIO president John Sweeney in remarks preceding the 
president's. 
</P>
<P>
	This fall, Congress considers a 34-year old law that governs the  
bulk of federal education spending. The White House is expecting a 
fight over Clinton's bond proposal for school modernization, which 
would provide $24.8 billion in tax credit bonds over two years. The 
Clinton administration claims that amount would make it cheaper for 
local school districts to modernize up to 6,000 schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also claims Republicans' $792 billion tax cut  
program almost ignores school needs in favor of tax breaks for the 
wealthy, such as eliminating the estate tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has promised to veto the GOP tax cut this fall.  
</P>
<P>
	School districts nationwide spent $18.7 billion on school  
construction in 1996, the latest year for which data was available 
according to census bureau. The districts spent $15.9 billion in 
1995 and $14.4 billion in 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Jarrod Washburn scattered five hits over  
7 2-3 innings and Troy Glaus hit a three-run homer Monday as the 
Anaheim Angels beat Roger Clemens and the New York Yankees 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
	In what looked like a pitching mismatch going into the game,  
Washburn, winless in four starts this year with a 9.15 ERA, struck 
out three and walked one to earn his first victory of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the longest outing of his two-year career, Washburn (1-3)  
gave up a pair of runs on solo homers by Shane Spencer, his 
seventh, in the fifth inning and Chili Davis, his 17th, in the 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Magnante relieved after Washburn allowed an RBI single to  
Derek Jeter with two out in the eighth. Jeter went 1-for-4 and is 
hitting .353, second in the AL to Boston's Nomar Garciaparra. 
</P>
<P>
	Troy Percival pitched the ninth for his 27th save. He struck out  
pinch-hitter Darryl Strawberry with a runner on to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens (12-8) got off to a rocky start, giving up Glaus' homer  
in the opening inning, then allowing a two-run shot by Jim Edmonds 
in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens gave up five runs and hits in 4 2-3 innings, with four  
walks and three strikeouts. Obviously having difficulty spotting 
his pitches, the hard-throwing right-hander made 103 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	The win, only the Angels' second in their last 13 games, gave  
them the season series against New York, 6-4. They were 6-5 against 
the Yankees last year, the only team to win a season series against 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Glaus lined a 2-2 pitch deep into the bullpen behind the left  
field fence to jump-start the Angels. The homer, his 25th, came in 
just his fourth at-bat ever against the four-time Cy Young 
Award-winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens walked Edmonds and Tim Salmon with one out and got Mo  
Vaughn on a pop foul before Glaus' home run. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmonds, who has missed most of the season after undergoing  
shoulder surgery in April, gave Anaheim a four-run lead in the 
fifth when he hit Clemens' 2-0 fastball over the wall in left after 
Darin Erstad led off with a single. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Allen Watson replaced Clemens with two out in the fifth and  
struck out Glaus to end the inning. The left-hander, who led the 
majors in home runs allowed as a starter with the Angels, has now 
retired 13 first-batters in a row. ... Chuck Finley is expected to 
make his next scheduled start for the Angels on Friday at 
Minnesota. Finley was scratched from his turn Sunday with a lower 
back strain, but an MRI was normal. A lower back strain also kept 
Salmon out of Sunday's game, but he was the designated hitter for 
the final game of the series against New York. ... Yankees CF 
Bernie Williams missed the game with inflammation of his left 
shoulder.

<HEADLINE> Knievel Stunt Inspires Daredevils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Photos NY121; NY22    	
</P>
<P>
	TWIN FALLS, Idaho (AP) -- A dirt ramp among the Russian olive  
trees at the Snake River Canyon's south rim is the only physical 
remnant of Evel Knievel's attempt to cross the chasm on a 
steam-powered ``Sky-Cycle'' 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He failed spectacularly. But the fanfare surrounding the Sept.  
8, 1974, jump was so great that Knievel's star-spangled image 
became indelible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Combined with his patriotic uniforms and his amazing name, he  
was the all-time coolest thing in the world,'' said Ed Petkus, a 
Boise State University marketing professor. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel remains famous a quarter century later as the greatest  
daredevil and self-promoter since Harry Houdini, and the forebear 
of a generation of thrill seekers and extreme-sports enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact on Twin Falls has been just as profound, putting the  
gem of a southern Idaho city on the map and still drawing thousands 
of people every year to the canyon that's carved into the high 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
	Others wish only that they had been delivered from Evel.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know a thing it brought to the community,'' said Jim  
Munn, former Twin Falls County sheriff who was a deputy at the 
time. ``It's a day we should try to bury. He never did anything for 
Twin Falls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Local merchants are planning to host Knievel starting Sept. 16  
for a commemoration of the event, and the Sky-Cycle itself was 
shipped into town for display. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel's son, Robbie, has bested many of his father's more  
famous motorcycle jumps. In May, he even cleared the Grand Canyon 
at one of its narrowest points. While others also jump over 
vehicles and fountains and between tall buildings, no one has tried 
the Idaho feat again. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think about the canyon jump and think they can do it.  
I'll tell you, God hasn't moved that canyon one inch and I don't 
see any daredevils lined up to jump it,'' Knievel, 61, recently 
told Huddlin' with the Pros, an online sports magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel did not respond to calls from The Associated Press to  
his publicist. 
</P>
<P>
	The Butte, Mont., native started what became his life's work by  
jumping a motorcycle over a pit of rattlesnakes and two cougars. In 
1968, he flew 150 feet over the fountain at Caesar's Palace in Las 
Vegas and crashed, leaving him in a coma for days. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel survived, and then raised the stakes. Lacking federal  
approval to jump the Grand Canyon, he remembered the gaping maw of 
the Snake River Canyon -- 1,700 feet wide and 500 feet deep at what 
became his launch site. 
</P>
<P>
	He leased a small plot along the canyon rim from Keith Qualls'  
family and recruited rocket engineer Bob Truax to design the 
Sky-Cycle X-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea was for its 5,000 pounds of thrust to push the  
rocket-shaped craft over the abyss before Knievel deployed the 
parachute on the north side. A metal ramp reaching 180 feet into 
the air and pointed up at a steep 56-degree angle was built atop 
the earthen berm. 
</P>
<P>
	Twin Falls during ``jump week'' took on the atmosphere of a  
carnival as Knievel partied, fans flocked in and the media focused 
on what was happening to the bucolic Magic Valley. The bloom was 
soon off the rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel was accused of punching an NBC cameraman. A reporter had  
a cigar put out on his forehead. A beer truck was broken into and 
emptied. City property was destroyed. And a number of merchants 
said Knievel's entourage left without paying bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a two-sided coin,'' then-county Commissioner Merl  
Leonard said. ``There were a lot of nice people who rode their 
motorbikes from the East Coast. But there also were some motorcycle 
riders -- gangs, let me put it that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a high school band from his hometown playing to a crowd of  
about 20,000, Knievel was secured inside the cockpit and the 
Sky-Cycle was fired up. But his parachute opened just as he cleared 
the ramp. 
</P>
<P>
	After soaring about 1,000 feet -- far enough, some observers  
said, to have crossed the river -- Knievel wound up landing about 20 
feet from the river on the rocky south bank. He sustained only 
scrapes and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	The jump was broadcast live on paid, closed-circuit television  
and later was on ABC's ``Wide World of Sports.'' Knievel claimed he 
earned $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The daredevil is retired in Florida, where he underwent a  
successful liver transplant this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Evel of popular myth broke every bone in his body at one  
time or another. Knievel's own estimate is 30 to 35 fractures, but 
in Twin Falls the legend is what sells. 
</P>
<P>
	``You ask people around the world, in Europe, if they know about  
Twin Falls and they say no,'' said Qualls, who still owns the land 
where the jump took place and wouldn't mind doing it again. ``You 
mention Evel Knievel and it all comes back.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Assaults GOP Tax Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- President Clinton chose an overcrowded  
elementary school Monday as the backdrop for a renewed assault on 
the Republican-passed tax cut plan, which Democrats contend would 
steal money from desperately needed school construction programs. 
</P>
<P>
	At Coleman Place Elementary School, built in 1924, Clinton  
called on Republicans in Congress to ``leave politics at the school 
house door'' and embrace his proposal for tax breaks to help school 
districts repair, expand and modernize schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, before addressing parents, teachers and students who  
had gathered on the school softball field, joined in renovating one 
of the schools classrooms. Using a cordless electric drill, the 
president fastened about eight screws to attach the top of a 
computer table. 
</P>
<P>
	Then addressing the crowd, Clinton attacked the GOP tax cut  
plan, which he already has promised to veto. ``It means larger 
classes, fewer students and more leaky roofs,'' said Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Later at a Labor Day picinic at the home of the mother of Rep.  
Bobby Scott, D-Va., Clinton renewed his attack on the GOP tax 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before we have this big tax cut the Republicans have proposed,  
we ought to take care of the big challenges facing America,'' 
declared the president, ticking off protecting Social Security, 
Medicare and education ``We ought to get this country out of debt 
for the first time since 1835 before we give the money away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	En route to the picnic, Clinton in a helicopter flew over some  
tornado damage in the Hampton, Va., area. Earlier he had declared 
the region a disaster area, making victims eligible for federal 
assistance. About 250 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed and 
about a dozen people injured by the storm over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not against cutting taxes'' said Clinton at the school,  
but that the Republican's $792 billion cut over 10 years would mean 
sharp cuts in domestic spending including education. The Democrats 
have suggested a more modest nearly $300 billion cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke in front of temporary trailers used by Coleman  
students as classrooms because of lack of school space. He said 
Virginia schools alone use e 3,000 such trailers and there are 
similar classroom shortages and schools in need of repair 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	About a third of American public schools, or 25,000 buildings,  
need extensive repair or replacement, according to the General 
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. The GAO also 
calculated that $112 billion is needed just to repair existing 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our schools are crumbling and it is a national disgrace,''  
declared AFL-CIO president John Sweeney in remarks preceding the 
president's. 
</P>
<P>
	This fall, Congress considers a 34-year old law that governs the  
bulk of federal education spending. The White House is expecting a 
fight over Clinton's bond proposal for school modernization, which 
would provide $24.8 billion in tax credit bonds over two years. The 
Clinton administration claims that amount would make it cheaper for 
local school districts to modernize up to 6,000 schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also claims Republicans' $792 billion tax cut  
program almost ignores school needs in favor of tax breaks for the 
wealthy, such as eliminating the estate tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has promised to veto the GOP tax cut this fall.  
</P>
<P>
	School districts nationwide spent $18.7 billion on school  
construction in 1996, the latest year for which data was available 
according to census bureau. The districts spent $15.9 billion in 
1995 and $14.4 billion in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Teacher Strike Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Striking teachers and the school board agreed  
Monday on a tentative contract that could end a weeklong walkout 
over reforms sought by the schools chief hired to turn the troubled 
district around. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers could be back in school by Wednesday, and the  
district's 172,000 students would return Thursday, negotiators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to recommend to the teachers that they accept this  
contract,'' Detroit Federation of Teachers President John Elliott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers won agreements for smaller classes and raises of up to  
4 percent, and defeated proposals for merit pay and longer school 
days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the nation's biggest teacher strikes in recent years,  
Detroit students missed four days of class last week and would miss 
class again Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers walked out in defiance of a Michigan law that bars  
teacher strikes and fines them one day's pay for each day they 
strike. Legislative leaders had said they would move to seek 
sanctions against the teachers Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, which represents 9,200 teachers, had been unhappy  
with proposals for a longer school day, merit pay, class size and 
other reforms administrators sought after the Legislature voted in 
March to replace Detroit's elected school board with one appointed 
by the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar school takeovers have been enacted in Chicago and  
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools in Detroit, the nation's 10th-largest city, have been  
beset by mismanagement and chronically low test scores, attendance 
and graduation rates, and the new chief executive, David Adamany, 
said the reforms were aimed at turning those trends around. 
</P>
<P>
	The original contract offer proposed merit pay raises of up to  
$3,000 a year to teachers with good attendance, three years of 
satisfactory performance, advanced coursework and national 
certification. 
</P>
<P>
	The union contended that the criteria for the merit pay system  
were unclear and could allow administrators to reward undeserving 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the merit pay provision was absent from the final deal,  
Adamany said it could be implemented without union approval. He 
also said the contract gives the district tighter control of 
teacher absenteeism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably accomplished about two-thirds of the proposals for  
greater accountability in this district,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The district also dropped its proposal to lengthen the school  
day from 6 hours to 8 1/2 hours. Teachers had said making classes 
smaller was a more important reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The new contract includes provisions for smaller class sizes  
starting during the 2000-01 school year for 44 elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said all along that this was a strike for real school  
reform, and we meant it,'' Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott said teachers would vote Wednesday morning on returning  
to class, though the actual contract vote would be held later by 
mail and could take a week to 10 days to complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the old contract, the median salary for a Detroit teacher  
with a bachelor's degree was $50,978. For those with a master's 
degree, the median was $58,494. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the teachers rejected an offer to extend their  
contract, spurning their own negotiators' recommendations and 
stalling the scheduled start of classes on Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the teachers brought their message to the street,  
toting signs saying ``No contract, no work'' as they marched in the 
city's Labor Day parade.

<HEADLINE> Jana Novotna Retires From Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Surrounded by teen-agers with booming serves and  
ground games to match, Jana Novotna decided Monday to leave tennis, 
announcing her retirement at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna, who will be 31 next month, said she would keep her  
tournament commitments for the remainder of the year and then put 
away her rackets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been thinking about this for a very long time,'' she  
said. ``It's really difficult to point out one thing. I just feel 
the time for it is right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna's decision comes less than a month after longtime rival  
Steffi Graf announced her own retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very ironic, actually,'' Novotna said. ``When I was 14  
years old, when I started my career, when I traveled for my first 
international tournament, I happened to play Steffi Graf in the 
first round. It is pretty incredible that we are retiring in the 
same year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna said a nagging ankle injury had nothing to do with the  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physically, I'm fine,'' she said. ``There is really no  
problem, My ankle injury doesn't have anything to do with the 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But after losing in the third round of the Open last Friday to  
Anke Huber, Novotna expressed doubts about her future. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I feel I can no longer compete with these players or I  
cannot physically be out there and stay in the top 10 and play on 
the level I would like to play, then I will think about leaving,'' 
she said. ``But for right now, I want to take time to think about 
everything and don't make any emotional statements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It took just three days for her to make the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	Novotna won her 24th WTA Tour event this season at Hanover,  
beating Venus Williams in the final. She has earned more than $10 
million in a career that began in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna said the new generation of women players is more  
physically fit than ever before. One of those baseline boomers is 
Serena Williams, who said she would miss Novotna's voice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the sweetest voice I've ever heard,'' she said. ``It's so  
light. You'd think someone with her stature, her size, how long 
she's been around the tour and stuff, I never realized that her 
voice was like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna said her victory at Wimbledon a year ago fulfilled her  
greatest ambition in tennis and made her decision to leave the 
sport less troubling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning Wimbledon last year and having the wonderful year that  
I had just made everything much easier,'' she said. ``I said 
throughout my career that winning one Grand Slam tournament would 
be very fulfilling and it would be a dream come true for me. It 
finally did happen. That was the greatest thing that ever happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can just look back and be very happy and very thankful for  
the career that I've had. I'm very happy with this decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was at Wimbledon in 1993 that she suffered her greatest  
disappointment. Leading Graf 4-1 and 40-15 in the third set, five 
points away from the championship, she came apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf rallied to win the title, leaving Novotna in tears as she  
accepted the runner-up trophy from the Duchess of Kent. It was one 
of the most emotional moments in the tournament's history. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Novotna was No. 2 in the world and made it back to the  
finals at Wimbledon again, this time beaten by Martina Hingis, left 
again to accept the runnerup trophy and the Duchess' sympathies. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, last year came the breakthrough when she defeated  
Hingis in the semifinals and Nathalie Tauziat in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Given her frequent meetings with the Duchess, Novotna was asked  
whether she had discussed the retirement decision with her. 
</P>
<P>
	She laughed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I called her last night,'' Novotna said. ``She said,  
`Don't do it.' I said, `I have to. I'm still going to come (to 
Wimbledon) because I have the little badge.'''

</P>
<P>
	MARTINEZ, Calif. (AP) -- Byron Benton Burnes, former president of  
the National Association of the Deaf, died Aug. 25 after a brief 
illness. He was 95. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnes, known as ``B.B.B.,'' served as president of the NAD from  
1946 to 1964 and taught at the California School for the Deaf in 
Berkeley for 28 years. Burnes also taught at the Minnesota, 
Colorado and South Dakota schools for the deaf. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnes became deaf from complications from influenza and chicken  
pox when he was 15.

<P>
	BURBANK , Calif. (AP) -- Marguerite Chapman, who starred in a  
series of World War II movies and later as a secretary in Marilyn 
Monroe's film the ``The Seven Year Itch,'' died Tuesday. She was 
81. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1940 to 1943, Ms. Chapman appeared in 18 movies, ranging  
from Charlie Chan comedies to armed services booster films as a 
member of Warner Bros.' singing and dancing Navy Blues Sextet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Chapman was eventually cast as a leading lady in  
``Destroyer'' with Edward G. Robinson and Glenn Ford and in 
``Appointment in Berlin'' opposite George Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	After the war, she continued to win leading roles in such films  
as ``Relentless'' opposite Robert Young and ``The Green Promise'' 
with Walter Brennan. But by the 1950s, Ms. Chapman had slipped into 
supporting roles, notably as a secretary in ``The Seven Year Itch'' 
in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Chapman had top billing again in her final film, ``The  
Amazing Transparent Man'' in 1960, but the film was critically 
panned. 
</P>
<P>
	As Ms. Chapman's film career waned, she made guest appearances  
in television series including ``Richard Diamond, Private 
Detective,'' ``Rawhide,'' ``Perry Mason,'' ``Hawaii Five-0'' and 
``Marcus Welby, M.D.''

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Stanley Weigel , a retired federal judge  
who made decisions on school desegregation and the U.S. involvement 
in Nicaragua, died Wednesday a few months after suffering a stroke. 
He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Weigel ordered the city's schools desegregated in 1971. In the

<HEADLINE> Probe Ordered Into N.M. Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The state's top prison and law  
enforcement officials announced an investigation Monday into why a 
privately run prison didn't notify state police about a riot in 
which a guard was stabbed to death. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-hour riot Aug. 31 at the medium-security Guadalupe  
County Correctional Facility in Santa Rosa left one guard dead and 
an inmate wounded. The prison is run by Florida-based Wackenhut 
Corrections Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said Wackenhut didn't notify state police about the  
riot and told the state Corrections Department at least an hour 
after the two men were stabbed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't hesitate for a New York minute to push for charges  
against somebody if their actions jeopardize the lives of the 
corrections officers in that facility or my own officers who 
responded to that riot,'' Public Safety Secretary Darren White 
said. ``If warranted I would go to the top of the corporate 
ladder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wackenhut spokesman Pat Cannan has said he would not comment on  
White's criticisms. A woman at Wackenhut headquarters said that 
Cannan was unavailable for comment until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Corrections Secretary Rob Perry said he plans to gather  
independent prison experts from around the country to review the 
situation. State investigators will assist the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Wackenhut runs more than two dozen prisons nationwide.  
</P>
<P>
	In the past nine months, four inmates and a guard have died in  
Wackenhut-run prisons in New Mexico. In addition, two guards were 
injured in a disturbance Aug. 17 at a prison run by another 
company.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Heirs Buy St. Louis Blues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Fresh from a failure to buy a sports empire in  
Denver, Wal-Mart heirs Bill and Nancy Laurie have purchased the St. 
Louis Blues and Kiel Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale, which coincided with the opening of the Blues'  
training camp, was announced late Monday afternoon in a statement 
released by the team. Terms of the sale were not immediately 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase caps a months-long effort by the Lauries, a  
Columbia, Mo., couple, to enter the world of professional sports 
ownership, and a nearly year-long effort by the partnership that 
owned the Blues to recoup its investment. In March, the Lauries 
were unsuccessful in their attempt to buy the NHL's Colorado 
Avalanche and the NBA's Denver Nuggets and their new home, the 
Pepsi Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nancy and I are looking forward to building on the strong  
Blues hockey tradition in the St. Louis community,'' Bill Laurie 
said in a statement. ``We have been searching for the right sports 
opportunity for several years and, to our delight, we found it 
right down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Laurie planned to meet with the team Tuesday morning, with  
an 11 a.m. (CST) news conference at the Kiel Center to follow. The 
Lauries are the second Columbia entry into the St. Louis sports 
market in recent years; Stan Kroenke is a minority owner of the 
NFL's St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauries were at a movie in Columbia on Monday night, and did  
not immediately return a call to The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauries' Denver deal fell through when shareholders of  
Ascent Entertainment Group, which owned the sports properties, 
filed suit, claiming the $400 million sale price was as much as 
$150 million too low. An out-of-court settlement resulted in an 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Several groups of investors, including one led by former Denver  
Broncos quarterback John Elway, bid on the teams and the arena. The 
winner of that auction, a group headed by Colorado billionaire 
Donald Strum, was then to bid one-on-one against the Lauries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauries declined to take part in the $1 million-per-bid  
second auction, and Strum bought Ascent's sport assests for $461 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiel Partners, a consortium of local businessmen that owns the  
Blues, announced Dec. 30 that it had hired Goldman Sachs, a New 
York investment bank, to explore the team's financial options. They 
included selling the Blues, selling Kiel Center, bringing an NBA 
team to the city, or overhauling Kiel Center's capital structure, 
which includes $96 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months ago, Kiel Parters officially announced that the team  
was for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership said it pumped more than $70 million into the  
team and Kiel Center over the previous four years to cover 
shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the third NHL team to change hands this year. Deals for  
two or three more are pending or in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Walton Laurie is the daughter of the late Bud Walton, who  
with his late brother Sam co-founded Wal-Mart. Bill Laurie is a 
former basketball player at Memphis State, and he and his wife own 
Crown Center Farms in Columbia, where they raise quarter horses and 
Appaloosas. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple made the largest single donation to the University of  
Missouri in its history in 1996, offering $10 million toward the 
constuction of a new basketball arena. The donation was withdrawn a 
year later after the Lauries felt the university wasn't make enough 
progress toward its construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Stan Kronke, who is married to Nancy's sister and fellow  
Wal-Mart heir Ann, is a minority owner of the St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues made it to the second round of the playoffs last  
season, losing to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars in 
six games.

<HEADLINE> States May Get Little From Financier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	So far, regulators have seized $57.5 million of Martin Frankel's  
assets and are eyeing millions more in a frozen Swiss bank account. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel is believed to have embezzled at least $218 million, and  
now regulators are hoping he will help them recover it, presumably 
in a bid for leniency. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel was arrested in Germany on Saturday night, ending a  
four-month international manhunt for the 44-year-old alleged rogue 
financier. But if state officials were expecting cooperation, his 
German lawyer, Thomas Piplak, said Frankel is considering fighting 
extradition to avoid possible retribution from those he is accused 
of cheating. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have linked at least three foreign bank accounts --  
in Switzerland, Italy and Germany -- to Frankel, said Keith Wenzel, 
director of Missouri's Department of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators also hope they'll be able to liquidate homes,  
diamonds and jewels belonging to Frankel, Wenzel said Monday. 
Frankel may have been financing his run with more than $10 million 
in diamonds and gold he bought before fleeing, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some regulators doubt they'll recover much more than they've  
already identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like they're counting on full recovery,'' said  
Marilyn Elam, a spokeswoman for Tennessee's Department of Commerce 
and Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators say Frankel used pseudonyms and partners  
to buy small insurance companies in states with reputations for lax 
insurance regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, regulators said, Frankel's unlicensed brokerage --  
apparently run out of his $3 million Greenwich, Conn., mansion -- 
siphoned money from the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Now regulators in those states -- Mississippi, Arkansas,  
Tennessee, Oklahoma and Missouri -- are banding together to recover 
the lost funds. Tennessee managed to seize $57.5 million, and has 
given $17.5 million of that to other states. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the states, not insurance policyholders, that would lose  
if the insurers remain in the red. 
</P>
<P>
	The states guaranteed the policies and will have to pay any  
amount not recovered from the insolvent insurance companies. Most 
of the policies, including 12,000 in Tennessee, are burial plans 
worth several thousand dollars apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be a long wait before any money changes hands.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping to have it wrapped up within a couple of years,''  
Wenzel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel might still spend months in custody in Germany, where he  
was captured by federal and international authorities, even if he 
waived extradition to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance companies can spend a year or longer in receivership  
in a typical case, and ``this one is more complicated than most,'' 
said John Knox Walkup, the former Tennessee attorney general who is 
handling the receivership of the Tennessee insurer, Franklin 
American. 
</P>
<P>
	Auditors are still trying to understand how much money is  
missing. A lawsuit filed by some of the companies puts the loss at 
$915 million, but Wenzel said: ``I don't think any of the 
regulators ever thought it was that high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel also is thought to have allegedly stolen as much as  
$1.98 billion from the St. Francis of Assisi Foundation, which 
investigators say he established last year in the British Virgin 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's unclear whether much -- if any -- of that money ever  
existed or whether Frankel merely claimed it was there. The 
foundation was set up as a charity that bought insurance companies, 
investigators said.

<HEADLINE> Spielberg May Take Kubrick Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Steven Spielberg may be lined up to direct what  
would have been Stanley Kubrick's next film project, a newspaper 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubrick, who died in March just days after completing ``Eyes  
Wide Shut,'' had planned to make a futuristic film called ``AI,'' 
about a young ``robot'' boy adopted by a childless woman, The 
Sunday Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner Bros., the studio with which Kubrick worked for many  
years, and the director's family appear enthusiastic about 
Speilberg possibly seeing the project through, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before his death, Kubrick had lengthy and detailed talks with  
close friend Spielberg about the film, the paper said. Spielberg 
confirmed that he has read ``the very long treatment'' as well as 
seen the storyboards for ``AI,'' but the newspaper did not say 
whether he has agreed to take on the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg is working on the third Jurassic Park movie and an  
adaptation of the book ``Memoirs of a Geisha.''

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame's Party Started Too Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- The least excessive celebration in the  
entire state might have been the one Notre Dame receiver Bobby 
Brown staged after catching a 2-point conversion pass in the 
Michigan end zone. Thanks to some hair-trigger officiating, it also 
turned out to be one of the most costly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Should he have done it?'' Irish coach Bob Davie asked Sunday  
without waiting for an answer. ``No. Does he know he made a 
mistake? Yes. Will he do it again? No. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just unfortunate,'' he added, ``that it had an impact on  
the game like it did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Davie went on to defend the excessive celebration rule  
and the NCAA's no-nonsense interpretation -- ``I'm an advocate of 
making it tight,'' the coach said -- it's also clear he was still 
smarting from the sting of Michigan's breath-stealing 26-22 win 
over Notre Dame on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The result wasn't secured until the clock ran out on a final  
Irish drive at the Wolverines 12, but the moment that caused 
college football's latest controversy came at the 4:08 mark. That's 
when Brown caught a pass from quarterback Jarious Jackson in the 
corner of the end zone, jumped to his feet, stuck both his thumbs 
into the ear holes of his helmet, and facing the crowd, imitated a 
moose with wriggling antlers. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials immediately whistled Brown for celebrating  
``excessively'' and slapped a 15-yard penalty on the Irish, sending 
them back to their own 20 for the ensuing kickoff. Michigan running 
back Anthony Thomas, inserted into the middle of the return 
formation for just such an occasion, then fielded the kick and 
returned it 20 yards to the Notre Dame 42. 
</P>
<P>
	As if making a last stand with almost half the field already in  
front of them wasn't tough enough on the Irish defense, Notre Dame 
safety Ron Israel got whistled for a hit out of bounds two plays 
later. That gave Michigan another large chunk of real estate, and 
with 1:38 left to play, Thomas crashed into the end zone from 2 
yards out with what proved to be the decisive score. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown defended himself at first, saying, ``It was just something  
personal. I thought because I did it quick, he (the official) 
wouldn't see it. It was pure excitement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it turns out, the gesture might have been less innocent than  
that. At Michigan Stadium, members of the band roam through the 
crowd during the game, serenading sections with the theme from the 
cartoon show, ``Rocky and Bullwinkle.'' The fans respond by doing 
what most of us would call a moose, but what veterans of the 
stadium call a ``Bullwinkle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a senior who's played at Ann Arbor before, Brown likely would  
have been familiar with the gesture -- and the veteran officiating 
crew working the game even more so. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could be a coward or a man about it,'' Brown said. ``I'm  
mature enough not to run away from saying I might have cost my team 
a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, you can't pass a playground today without seeing the same  
gesture being traded back and forth a dozen times. And this one, 
lasting barely seconds, took place in the overheated cauldron of 
the Big House, as Michigan Stadium is known, on a 90-degree day 
near the end of one of the most exciting contests in one of the 
most storied and passionate rivalries the game has to offer. At the 
moment Brown caught the ball, there were 111,523 fans looking on -- 
the largest crowd to see a college football game -- most of them 
wildly partisan Wolverine fans. 
</P>
<P>
	And because he got up and imitated a moose for an instant, he's  
the one guilty of taunting? 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently so.  
</P>
<P>
	The excessive celebration rule has been around for a half-dozen  
seasons, but it was tightened considerably in 1995. Then, a 12-man 
NCAA committee culled examples of what it considered over-the-top 
celebrating and packaged a 30-minute film for schools, conferences, 
coaches and officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia athletic director Vince Dooley, who was chairman of the  
NCAA football rules committee at the time, said, ``What we're going 
to eliminate is when it goes from spontaneity to delayed, prolonged 
activity. Some of these things are even rehearsed. You can tell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the National Football League clamped down on celebrating,  
fans started complaining that the acronym NFL stood for the ``No 
Fun League.'' Davie disagreed with a subsequent decision by the pro 
league to relax the rule, saying what he sees on some Sundays 
leaves a bad taste in his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you monitor what is (excessive) and what isn't?'' he  
said. ``It's hard. And I think the NCAA does a tremendous job with 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, they might have done the job a little too well.  
</P>
<P>
	What Brown did Saturday wasn't excessive. But by helping  
Michigan win its season opener, he certainly contributed to some 
partying that was excessive by the time Saturday night rolled 
around. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Reports: GM Offers Lifetime Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- General Motors Corp. has offered a guarantee of  
lifetime employment to many employees as part of negotiations for a 
new contract with the United Automobile Workers, a newspaper 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's three-year contracts with the major automakers are  
due to expire Sept. 14. Under existing contracts, workers 
effectively have lifetime employment because the terms bar 
automakers from allowing employment to fall by more than 5 percent 
nationally or in any of a dozen regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Under GM's proposal, the lifetime offer would cover current  
workers with more than 10 years' experience, The New York Times 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said the company's proposal is aimed at addressing  
workers' job security fears while allowing GM to reduce overall 
employment more rapidly. Edd Snyder, a GM spokesman, refused to 
confirm or deny the contents of the offer, telling The Associated 
Press today that GM does not discuss proposals under negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW was expected to pick a focus company whose proposal  
would offer the union the richest and easiest-to-obtain package of 
wages and benefits. It would then take that deal and use it as a 
model in negotiations with the remaining automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The contracts with GM, Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG  
cover 407,000 workers. The UAW hasn't held a national strike during 
negotiations since 1976. But it has used plant-level strikes as a 
bargaining tool -- the last in 1996 against GM.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Vow Probe Into Waco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress returns this week with Republicans  
intent on investigating the latest Waco dispute and asking whether 
Janet Reno should resign over what one senator said was a Justice 
Department ``in shambles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Democratic side, Sen. Charles Schumer of New York said  
Sunday he had written GOP committee chairmen asking them to put off 
hearings until an independent investigator finishes looking into 
new controversies swirling around the 1993 siege of the Branch 
Davidian compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumer, on ABC's ``This Week,'' said hearings would probably  
descend into partisan squabbling. ``My worry is that congressional 
investigations would bring up a lot of heat and not very much 
light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Congress must be involved.  
``You can't have the country misled for six years by the Justice 
Department and the FBI and not have Congress do something about 
it,'' he said on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is recent FBI revelations that it fired several  
flammable tear gas canisters at a storm shelter hours before the 
main Branch Davidian building went up in flames. The FBI and the 
Justice Department had previously denied use of any incendiary 
devices, and investigations will focus on whether this 
misinformation was the result of a bureaucratic slip-up or a 
coverup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department insists there is no change in conclusions  
that it was David Koresh and his followers that started the fatal 
fire. The department also stresses that military special operations 
officers were on the scene only as observers and advisers, and not 
in an illegal capacity as participants in the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Any GOP-led investigation would be sure to touch on the  
competence of Reno, who has constantly clashed with Republicans 
over campaign finance and Chinese spying scandals, to be attorney 
general. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, on  
NBC's ``Meet the Press'' and CNN's ``Late Edition,'' said he had 
lost confidence in Reno's ability to lead. ``The Justice Department 
is in a shambles. There is a demoralization over there because they 
realize they are not doing the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FBI Director Louis Freeh, in contrast, is the ``single best''  
director he had known, Hatch said. On Freeh's reported differences 
with Reno, Hatch said ``you don't want some milquetoast guy in 
there who won't stand up and do what's right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schumer, however, said there was a double standard in attacking  
Reno and defending Freeh when it was the FBI that was apparently 
responsible for not getting the facts to Reno, their ultimate 
superior. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, asked by reporters Saturday if he had  
confidence in Reno and Freeh, pointedly supported Reno but not 
Freeh. On Freeh, he said he said there wasn't ``any purpose to 
assign blame until the investigation is concluded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno is expected to name an outside investigator sometime this  
week, with the emphasis on an impartial judge, possibly a 
Republican, who is respected by both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the attorney general has said, she wants to get to the  
bottom of this and will appoint an outside investigator to do just 
that,'' Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh was not FBI director at the time of the Waco siege, but  
did head the agency later when Reno, relying on FBI information, 
was denying that flammable devices were used against the Branch 
Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe Louis Freeh is to blame too,'' Gramm said. ``Maybe they  
both should go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, on CNN, said it was  
``very regrettable that people up to and including the president 
are now being asked to choose sides. This is unprecedented. I have 
never seen a situation like this where there has been this split 
between the two agencies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hatch also said he had talked to both Reno and Freeh this  
week and had been assured by both that they were on good terms and 
reports of differences between the two were blown out of 
proportion. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Sunday, filmmaker Michael McNulty, who has questioned  
government findings that the Davidians were responsible for their 
tragic end, said on ``Fox News Sunday'' that he had new evidence 
that federal operatives were firing ``long streams of automatic 
weapons fire'' at the back of the compound, preventing those inside 
from escaping the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Former FBI agent Richard Schwein, who was at Waco, said that was  
``absolutely false,'' that ``not one round was fired by an FBI 
agent during that tragic day.'' Schwein, on Fox, also denied that 
military officers on the scene as observers had any role in 
operations against Koresh and the Davidians.

	Mussina (15-7) hasn't pitched since Aug. 22, when he was hit on  
the shoulder by a line drive off the bat of Chicago's Brook 
Fordyce. He's still sporting an ugly bruise, but hasn't written off 
the possibility of returning this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He threw yesterday lightly off the mound. I'm not saying he  
could start ... but perhaps he could be ready for that first game 
against Oakland,'' Orioles manager Ray Miller said Monday. ``That's 
tentative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other starters with far less experience, Sidney Ponson and  
Jason Johnson, might skip a turn in September. Ponson, 22, has gone 
five straight starts without a win and Johnson has pitched nearly 
100 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to give Ponson a pause. I'd like to do the same thing  
with Johnson after his next start,'' Miller said. ``Just give them 
a week and let them freshen up. Both kids are young and have high 
futures. It would be pretty silly to keep popping them out there 
every five days if it looks like they're wearing down.' 
</P>
<P>
	Mussina isn't the only pitcher still hurting after getting hit  
by a ball. Reliever Arthur Rhodes bruised the index finger on his 
left hand in that Aug. 22 game against Chicago and is unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indefinite was the word I got yesterday. I've been short the  
last two days,'' Miller said. ``I keep going in and asking (trainer 
Richie Bancells) and he keeps saying day-to-day. ... Indefinite is 
a little longer than day-to-day, I think.''

<HEADLINE> Badgers Not Worried About Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin will be one receiver short when  
it takes the field Saturday against Ball State. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Chambers, the only Big Ten Conference wideout to average  
more than 20 yards per catch last season, broke a bone in his right 
hand in the ninth-ranked Badgers' 39-point season-opening win over 
Murray State. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more he catches, the more he gets those fingers hit with  
the ball. It would just keep irritating that bone so they felt if 
he stayed out and not catch the ball for a while he could heal that 
up fairly quickly,'' coach Barry Alvarez said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Davis, a sophomore flanker and kick returner, will step in  
at split end for Chambers, Alvarez said. Davis played at the wide 
receiver position early on in his freshman season and led Wisconsin 
with three receptions for 57 yards against UCLA in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel pretty comfortable at the split end position,'' Davis  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmad Merritt played more minutes Saturday after Chambers went  
out with the injury, catching three passes for 63 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ahmad came up huge for us,'' quarterback Scott Kavanagh said.  
``I've got a lot of good receivers. I've got all the confidence in 
the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez said he would not speculate whether Chambers would be  
able to play at Cincinnati on Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Wisconsin not only has Davis and Merritt  
available to play at receiver, but can also look to sophomore 
Conroy Whyte and freshman Lee Evans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got better depth right now at wide receiver, ... by far  
the best depth that we've had,'' Alvarez said. ``If there's one 
position where we have any luxury to lose a top guy it would be 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Demetrius Brown injured his knee on the same drive  
as Chambers but Alvarez said he was likely to play Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demetrius is walking very well today ... but I think he's got  
a chance to play,'' Alvarez said. ``He really looked pretty good 
today.''

<HEADLINE> Frankel May Fight Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- Since his arrest, Martin Frankel has run  
and rerun through his head the events of the last months: how it 
came to pass that he traded his Connecticut mansion for a 
one-person cell in northern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	German attorney Thomas Piplak visited Frankel, accused of  
bilking clients out of millions, in jail Monday and described the 
man as depressed, exhausted and -- above all -- fearful that the 
people he is accused of swindling might seek revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	So great are Frankel's fears, Piplak said, that he is  
considering fighting extradition to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we got the impression that he's not secure because there  
are strong, powerful groups after him, of course we would do 
everything to keep him here,'' Piplak said. ``He fears being 
attacked, because he knows a lot of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel was arrested Saturday night in Hamburg's Hotel Prem,  
ending a four-month international manhunt for the 44-year-old 
alleged rogue financier. Police say he siphoned at least $218 
million from several insurance companies; a lawsuit by some of them 
puts the loss at $915 million. 
</P>
<P>
	As much as $1.98 billion may also be missing from the St.  
Francis of Assisi Foundation, which investigators say was 
established by Frankel in the British Virgin Islands last August. 
</P>
<P>
	When police used a spare key to open his hotel room on Saturday,  
they say they found him with an unspecified sum of cash, diamonds, 
a computer and numerous fake passports. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was surprised by being arrested; he didn't expect it,''  
Piplak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unshaven and appearing morose during the hourlong meeting with  
his lawyer, Frankel didn't elaborate on the who he thinks might 
pursue him. 
</P>
<P>
	Piplak suggested Frankel back up his concerns with a written  
statement for the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	But Piplak said Frankel -- who has been described by other  
acquaintances as a pathological liar -- is worried that people won't 
take him seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doubtful whether anybody will believe him,'' Piplak said.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have not yet received extradition papers from the  
United States, and Frankel is being held on a German charge for 
possessing a fake British passport. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamburg's Holstenglacis prison, where Frankel can expect to pass  
the months before his extradition case is decided, has a reputation 
as a tough place filled with drug suspects awaiting trial. Piplak 
said Frankel is receiving no special treatment despite his high 
profile. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel has his own cell, with bath and toilet to accommodate an  
unspecified organ disorder that requires him to drink lots of 
water, his lawyer said. For now, he wears his own clothes -- a blue 
shirt and khaki pants -- and has requested kosher meals for 
religious reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But the isolation of the cell has made Frankel feel alone in a  
country where he has no friends or family. Cynthia Allison, the 
35-year-old woman who accompanied him in Germany who was also 
briefly arrested then released, is nowhere to be found, Piplak 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has no contacts, has no family,'' he said. Why Frankel  
chose to hide out in Germany remains unclear to his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	But even though fighting extradition would prolong his stay in  
prison in a foreign land, Frankel's fears appear to be outweighing 
his sense of isolation. 
</P>
<P>
	Piplak said it's not the criminal charges Frankel fears, it's  
his adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not afraid to go back to the United States, he's afraid  
he won't be secure,'' Piplak said. ``His main feeling is being 
frightened.''

<HEADLINE> Chargers Sign Coveted CB Lewis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Cornerback Darryll Lewis, who was released  
Saturday by the Tennessee Titans, agreed to terms on a two-year 
deal with the San Diego Chargers on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, going into his ninth NFL season, will receive a $600,000  
signing bonus and a $400,000 salary for this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers have until 1 p.m. Tuesday to clear a roster spot  
for Lewis. It's believed they are trying to trade cornerback Dwayne 
Harper. Harper wasn't at practice Monday and his locker was cleaned 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bobby Beathard didn't immediately return a phone  
call Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis intercepted an AFC-high 25 passes over the last five  
years. He played under Chargers defensive backs coach Rod Perry 
when he held the same job with the Oilers from 1995-96, and earned 
a Pro Bowl spot in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis was cut by the Titans because he lost his starting job and  
the $2 million he was due to make is too much to pay a nickel back. 
He was beaten out for the starting job by second-year pro Samari 
Rolle.

<HEADLINE> Pirates Recall Prospect Hermansen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Chad Hermansen, Pittsburgh's top prospect, and  
third baseman Aramis Ramirez are among five minor league players 
who will be added to the Pirates' active roster Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates have recalled Hermansen, Ramirez and right-hander  
Jason Boyd from Triple-A Nashville. Boyd was acquired from Arizona 
last month as the player to be named later in the Tony Womack 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	They also purchased the contracts of right-hander Mike Garcia  
from the Mexico City Red Devils of the Mexican League and catcher 
Tim Laker of Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirates manager Gene Lamont said that Hermansen, an outfielder  
who had 32 homers and 97 RBIs at Nashville, would make his first 
major league start Tuesday night against San Diego left-hander 
Sterling Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, who was the Pirates' starting third baseman last season  
for a brief time, was hitting .327 with 21 homers and 74 RBIs at 
Nashville.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Parade in Milford, N.H. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILFORD, N.H. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush on Monday won the  
best float award in a Labor Day parade he didn't attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer, Elizabeth Dole, Steve Forbes and Dan Quayle did  
attend. They shook hands with parents toting cameras and tossed 
candy to scurrying children. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who arrived in Manchester late Monday afternoon, had a  
look-a-like on his float, which also featured a look-a-like 
Theodore Roosevelt and photos of every Republican president this 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	``The judging had nothing to do with popularity, but I would say  
Bush is very popular here in Milford,'' said Robert Philbrick, 
Labor Day parade organizer for the past 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes spoke at a Veterans of Foreign Wars hall, decrying a  
``hollowing out'' of the military. He said it is wrong for the 
government to put Americans in uniform while not spending enough on 
defense to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've reduced our Army's strength by 50 percent; our Air  
Force, 50 percent; the Navy, almost 40 percent,'' Forbes said. 
``This is not a money issue or a military issue. It's a moral 
issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a picnic in Salem, Dole said she wants to put the IRS on a  
short leash. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Quayle echoed the attacks on Bush that he and other  
Republicans have made throughout the campaign. ``I don't believe 
the people of New Hampshire or America want to just coronate 
someone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle acknowledged he has serious obstacles in the campaign --  
mainly, raising money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money is a factor,'' he said. ``I've been outspent in  
elections before and won, but I've never been outspent 10- or 
20-to-1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer, who finished a three-day visit to New Hampshire on  
Monday, said his campaign received its 90,000th donation during the 
trip. That's more contributions than Forbes' 40,000-plus or Arizona 
Sen. John McCain's 35,000. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky said what matters isn't how many  
people donate to the campaign, but how much they give. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said donations to his campaign average $50 to $55. Forbes  
said most of his are $25 to $100. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the Republicans has come close to raising as much as  
Bush's more than $50 million.

<HEADLINE> Pfizer Takes On Federal Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. is trying to  
convince doctors the best drug for children's ear infections is not 
the cheap, proven antibiotic the government recommends, but 
Pfizer's own pricey product. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in January  
that amoxicillin should be doctors' first choice for treating ear 
infections, which account for 25 million visits to doctors' offices 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC ranked Pfizer's competing Zithromax among other  
antibiotics that ``lack good evidence'' for effectiveness against 
ear infections. 
</P>
<P>
	But the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen uncovered a  
schedule for Pfizer teleconferences targeted at doctors nationwide 
``to counter the CDC guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We urge you to inform the nation's pediatricians ... of this  
campaign so they are not duped into draining the Medicaid program 
of needed resources and of wasting large amounts of money on 
treating other patients with this needlessly expensive and 
second-rate drug for ear infections,'' the advocacy group said in a 
letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pfizer spokeswoman defended the campaign, saying the Food and  
Drug Administration had approved Zithromax for treating ear 
infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Consequently, ``everything we're doing is under the umbrella of  
what we're allowed to do according to the FDA,'' said spokeswoman 
Mariann Caprino. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC is ``just basically weighing in with yet another  
opinion,'' she added, noting the agency's amoxicillin 
recommendation is not an official treatment guideline. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Pfizer teleconference schedule, Caprino said ``it's  
not a corporate document that came down from on high'' and it 
probably came from ``someone in one of our sales forces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer has aggressively promoted Zithromax to doctors and  
parents, including giving away the drug's beanbag mascot ``Max the 
Zebra.'' Max lives on an Internet site called KidsEars, which tells 
parents to ask their doctors about Pfizer's drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Zithromax, which had $1 billion in sales in 1998, has become  
popular largely because it is only given once a day for five days. 
In comparison, amoxicillin is taken twice a day for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	A standard treatment of amoxicillin for a 22-pound baby costs  
less than $10, while Zithromax costs about $30. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA approves the sale of U.S. drugs, but it almost never  
ranks one drug as better than another, leaving the decision to 
doctors and medical societies. Because choosing the best antibiotic 
for each infection is crucial -- especially now that bacteria evolve 
to resist treatments --the CDC issued its recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC said using higher doses of amoxicillin can overcome some  
resistant ear infections, but the same tactic doesn't work with 
Pfizer's Zithromax. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stand behind what we recommend in the guidelines, and it's  
not surprising that not everybody's happy about the recommendations 
that we made or that a company whose product was not in the first 
line recommendations isn't happy,'' said Dr. Scott Dowell, the 
leading author of the CDC paper. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he noted, the CDC was making ``suggestions'' and ``didn't  
have any intent of endorsing any specific commercial product or 
company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bigger issue is which drug would best benefit children.  
</P>
<P>
	On May 18, Dr. Russell Steele, vice-chairman of pediatrics at  
Louisiana State University, hosted a Pfizer teleconference in which 
he questioned the effectiveness of amoxicillin against resistant 
infections and proposed using the family of antibiotics that 
includes Zithromax as a first choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele, who was paid by Pfizer for his presentation, said the  
CDC's suggestion of increasing the dose of amoxicillin to overcome 
resistant infections would be too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	But a 1998 study concluded the Pfizer drug ``had an unacceptably  
high failure rate,'' said study author Dr. Candice Johnson of 
Children's Hospital in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	In that study, Augmentin, which combines the antibiotics  
amoxicillin and clavulanate, wiped out children's ear infections 83 
percent of the time, while Zithromax only worked in 49 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been involved in studies of this sort for about twenty  
years and this is the lowest rate I've ever seen for an 
antibiotic,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele countered that when the study tested one of the most  
common types of bacteria that causes ear infections, the 
differences between the two drugs were too small to be significant. 
</P>
<P>
	Praising the CDC for providing guidance, Johnson said, ``It's  
been a very confusing thing for the average doctor and practice to 
know what drug to use.''

<HEADLINE> British Foreign Minister Hails Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- In a sign of strong support for the single European  
currency that Britain has yet to adopt, Foreign Secretary Robin 
Cook said Monday that the euro has shown itself to be a boon for 
its 11 member nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Already there are signs that the euro is bringing new strength  
to the economies that are part of it,'' Cook said in a speech to 
Japanese business leaders at the British Embassy in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	While lauding the euro, the British minister did not stray from  
the government's official ``wait-and-see'' approach to the single 
currency, saying that a decision to join the euro would be subject 
to the support of the people. There has been strong resistance in 
Britain to dropping the pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook, however, said acceptance of the euro is evident by its  
growing use in international bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first six months of this year, the value of international  
debt issued in the eight-month old currency was more than that 
issued in U.S. dollars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is a complete reversal of the figures of only the  
previous year,'' he said. ``This represents not only the confidence 
of the markets in the euro but a source of investment for the 
long-term on which European companies can draw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the euro had become a major stimulus for economic  
restructuring -- from helping France create new jobs to allowing 
European borrowers to reap the benefits of lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound is facing new challenges from the euro and  
Britain has been getting criticism from European Union officials 
for refusing to join the common currency, which was launched Jan. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pound is clearly becoming a minor satellite of the much  
larger euro,'' Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the outgoing top finance 
official of the EU, recently said. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain, along with Sweden, Denmark and Greece, stayed out of  
the euro when the other 11 EU members launched the single currency 
</P>
<P>
	``We will join the euro only if Britain is ready to reap the  
benefits of membership,'' Cook said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling Labor Party government has said that if the economic  
conditions are right, it will call a referendum within the next few 
years on whether to abandon the pound for the euro. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Bid Launched To Save Belfast Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Cautioning that he had no  
``magic wand,'' the American architect of last year's Northern 
Ireland peace accord launched a diplomatic mission Monday to 
salvage the unraveling agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell, who met delegations from  
Northern Ireland's four major parties, said the province's rival 
British Protestant and Irish Catholic political leaders ``must 
seize this opportunity'' or condemn their land to perpetual 
instability. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell oversaw 22 months of often agonizing negotiations that  
produced the Good Friday accord of 1998. At its heart, the 
agreement called for the speedy establishment of a four-party 
Cabinet composed equally of Protestants and Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
	But the main Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, has refused  
to accept members of the IRA-linked Sinn Fein as government 
colleagues until the Irish Republican Army agrees to disarm. The 
accord specified disarmament should be completed by next May, but 
the IRA has refused to start. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said he hoped to sell a compromise formula within weeks  
that would allow the Cabinet to be formed and the IRA -- as well as 
other outlawed groups with too little support to factor in the 
Cabinet's make-up -- to start destroying its tons of hidden 
weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell emphasized he had no ``magic wand that will wave away  
these problems'' and that the real power rested with those who 
would form the 12-member Cabinet: the Ulster Unionists, Sinn Fein, 
the moderate Catholics of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, 
and the hard-line Protestants of the Democratic Unionists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of them sought public office and the power that comes  
with it. With that power comes responsibility,'' Mitchell said. 
``At this time and place, that means having the courage and wisdom 
to find a way to overcome the obstacles to implementation of the 
agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic Unionists, entitled to two Cabinet posts like  
Sinn Fein, totally reject the accord. The party's leader, the Rev. 
Ian Paisley, met Mitchell but said afterward he would shun 
Mitchell's efforts ``to give the kiss of life to this wretched and 
dirty deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An opinion poll published Monday in the Belfast Telegraph  
newspaper suggested that majorities of Protestants and Catholics 
alike would support a compromise whereby the Ulster Unionists 
accepted Sinn Fein as government colleagues on the same day the IRA 
destroyed its first cache of weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, who would lead the  
government, said he supported the concept of ``jumping together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But his senior negotiator, Reg Empey, said the Ulster Unionists  
doubted the IRA would disarm. He cited the group's suspected links 
with an arms-smuggling plot uncovered by the FBI six weeks ago in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``What signal do you think that sends us about their  
sincerity?'' Empey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell plans to meet seven minor Northern Irish parties  
Tuesday and discuss his assessment Wednesday with the British and 
Irish governments, which jointly sought his intervention.

<HEADLINE> Despite Dennis, Drought Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- The remnants of Dennis spread rain across  
the mid-Atlantic states on Monday, but authorities said days of 
precipitation and flooding weren't enough to cancel the devastating 
drought. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a hurricane, then a tropical storm and now downgraded to a  
tropical depression, Dennis spawned minor flooding in Virginia and 
threatened to cause showers in Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, heavy rains drenched parts of North Carolina,  
Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey and New York. Raleigh, N.C., got 
more than 7 inches of rain, and water reservoirs in New Jersey were 
up an inch and a half. Still, much of the East remained parched. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't break a drought with one storm,'' said National  
Weather Service meteorologist Joel Kline. ``You need to increase 
your water over a long period of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would have been more helpful if the quick and heavy downpours  
were spread out more evenly, said Jim Poirier, a Weather Service 
meteorologist in Mount Holly, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The hard, dry ground can only soak up so much water and the rest  
just runs off into storm drains and streams. ``It's like filling a 
flower pot too quickly,'' Poirier said. 
</P>
<P>
	For days last week, the storm wreaked havoc on North Carolina's  
coast. As a hurricane, it sideswiped the Outer Banks, then went out 
to sea and stalled. It backtracked and came ashore on Saturday, 
then slowly made its way inland, dumping up to 20 inches of rain on 
coastal North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was blamed for a tornado in Hampton, Va., on Saturday  
that ripped roofs off houses and apartments and damaged about 800 
cars. A federal disaster declaration was announced Monday.

<HEADLINE> Kent Desormeaux Injured in Spill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) -- Kent Desormeaux, one of thoroughbred  
racing's top jockeys, broke two bones in his wrist and sustained a 
deep leg bruise Monday in a spill at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
	Desormeaux was taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital in nearby La  
Jolla after being thrown from his mount, The Key Rainbow, the 3-2 
favorite in the 10th race. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no apparent injuries to the horse.  
</P>
<P>
	Desormeaux, who injured his right wrist and upper left leg, will  
be sidelined indefinitely, according to track spokesman Dan Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old jockey was attempting to get The Key Rainbow  
between Isle Of Man and Zippersup in midstretch when Zippersup bore 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	The Key Rainbow appeared to clip heels and fell, with Desormeaux  
falling in front of the horse. 
</P>
<P>
	Desormeaux, who rode Real Quiet to victories in the 1998  
Kentucky Derby and Preakness, was treated briefly at the track 
before being transported to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Zippersup, ridden by David Flores, finished third behind  
Embraceable You and Isle of Man in the one-mile race on turf, but 
was disqualified and placed last following a stewards' inquiry. 
Vaclav was moved up to third.

<HEADLINE> Wildfire Threat Hits Calif. Resort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIG BEAR LAKE, Calif. (AP) -- Dry wind fanned scattered wildfire  
flare-ups in the San Bernardino Mountains, while shops and hotels 
throughout this resort tallied losses from a low tourist turnout 
over the Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Although no flames from the contained 63,486-acre blaze reached  
town, the heavy smoke from the fire burning to the northeast led 
many would-be vacationers to cancel trips. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad because this is a totally tourist-driven town,''  
Linda Goldsmith, co-owner of Goldsmith Ski &AMP; Snowboard Rental, said 
Sunday. ``This is an important weekend for this valley.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though she hadn't added up sales receipts, she said the number  
of customers and traffic on the road in front of the store was 
definitely down. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Budd, owner of the Fireside Lodge, said the fire threat  
``absolutely destroyed us.'' On most Labor Day weekends, the lodge 
is full, he said. But by Sunday, it was only 80 percent occupied. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters had the blaze contained by Saturday night, meaning  
a defensible fire line had been constructed around its perimeter. 
However, they pushed back the estimated time for finally 
controlling the blaze to Friday, Troy Corn, a spokesman at the 
command center, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting a little warmer now and a few little hot pockets  
are popping up,'' Corn said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,200 firefighters remained Sunday night to mop up the  
blaze, which has destroyed 19 structures and cost $9.7 million to 
suppress. At its height, some 2,700 firefighters from across the 
nation battled the fire 90 miles east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze was one of seven California wildfires that burned more  
than 130,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire near Big Bear Lake started Aug. 28 near Lake Arrowhead.  
By Friday, many vacationers had canceled their trips, fearing that 
a shift in wind could send the blaze into town. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some people held firm.  
</P>
<P>
	``We rented a cabin a few weeks ago and kept checking with the  
place to make sure everything was OK,'' said Chris Hager, 32, as he 
relaxed, next to Big Bear Lake while his 13-year-old son, Tyler, 
baited a fish hook with salmon eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been perfect,'' Hager said, although they hadn't caught  
any fish. 
</P>
<P>
	To the west, the resort town of Lake Arrowhead appeared  
unaffected by the wildfire threat as kayakers, boaters and families 
packed the south shore Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was scary seeing the huge clouds of smoke earlier this  
week, but now we're busy, we're real busy,'' said Amber Ricciardi, 
a hostess at Garibaldi Grille. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials closed all trails and roads in San Bernardino National  
Forest on the north side of Big Bear Lake for safety reasons. 
Twelve of the 13 closed campgrounds remained off limits through the 
weekend. Only one, Holcomb Valley campground, with 17 sites, was 
reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	Clusters of fires continued to burn today at Plumas National  
Forest and Angeles National Forest; in the Shasta-Trinity area, 22 
miles north of Redding; and in the Big Bar Complex, 28 miles 
northwest of Weaverville. 
</P>
<P>
	A 3,500-acre wildfire that began Sunday along Washington's  
Columbia River gorge forced the evacuation of more than 10 homes 
for a brief time. Authorities were worried today about forecasts 
for 30 mph wind during the afternoon that could spread the fire 
into new areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Six wildfires in Montana, Utah and Idaho were contained last  
week.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Big Leaguer Admits Homosexuality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For all of his major league career, Billy Bean  
felt the loneliness and the fear of being a gay man in the macho 
workplace of professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Bean, a marginal outfielder who spent parts of six seasons with  
the Detroit Tigers, Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres, said 
in The New York Times on Monday that he was afraid he would have 
been ostracized if he revealed his homosexuality while playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to Hooters, laughed at the jokes, lied about dates  
because I loved baseball,'' he said. ``I still do. I'd go back in a 
minute. I only wish that I hadn't felt so alone, that I could have 
told someone, and that I hadn't always felt God was going to strike 
me dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such prominent athletes as Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova  
and Greg Louganis have spoken of their homosexuality, but such 
acknowledgments in baseball are rare. One player to do so was 
former Dodgers outfielder Glenn Burke, who died of AIDS in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Bean, 35, last played in the majors in 1995, with the Padres. He  
said the deaths of his father, college roommate and first partner 
spurred him to be more open about his sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Bean was profiled by The Miami Herald following the  
death of former Loyola Marymount teammate and Cincinnati Reds 
pitcher Tim Layana in a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I missed the funeral of my college roommate, one of my best  
friends,'' Bean said in the 3,500-word story in the Times. ``Tim 
would have understood if I had told him. I began to think, I'm not 
living some horrible existence, I'm proud of my life. Where do I 
finally draw the line and just say, `Accept me or don't'?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He waited so long because he didn't want to ``embarrass what I  
hold sacred -- my family and baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bean is a restaurant owner in Miami Beach. A message by The  
Associated Press was left for him on the answering machine of his 
new restaurant, Mayya. 
</P>
<P>
	Bean was married for three years and didn't have his first  
homosexual experience until he was 28. He said he never dated 
another ballplayer and does not know if there are other gay 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``One would think so,'' he told the Times. ``But if they were as  
deeply closeted as I was, who would know?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bean came to the majors in 1987, joining the Tigers before he  
was 23. He hit his second pitch for a double and singled his next 
two times up. But his career was unexceptional, a .226 average in 
272 games with five homers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Riggleman, who managed Bean with the Padres and now manages  
the Chicago Cubs, called Bean a ``class act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It surprised me that he's gay, but it doesn't diminish my  
feelings,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bean said he decided to make a major decision following the  
death of a partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told myself that if it ever came around again that I found  
somebody, I would sacrifice everything for that relationship,'' he 
told the Herald. ``And ultimately, that's what I did. The death of 
my friend made me so cynical about baseball.''

<HEADLINE> Two New Fires Burn in the West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIG BEAR LAKE, Calif. (AP) -- Firefighters battled Monday to  
control a handful of fires in the West, including two new ones in 
Oregon and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Near Big Bear Lake and other popular resorts in the mountains 80  
miles northeast of Los Angeles, firefighters were finishing off a 
63,486-acre blaze after containing it Saturday night. The fire 
began Aug. 28 and has cost about $10 million to suppress. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials don't expect to have it under control until Friday.  
The fire has destroyed 19 structures, including several homes, and 
52 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	About 65 firefighters were trying to contain a 2,500-acre  
wildfire that broke out Sunday along the Columbia River gorge in 
Washington state. More than 10 houses were evacuated briefly. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire in central Oregon burned nearly 2,000 acres and  
threatened at least one home on the Warm Springs Indian 
Reservation. Authorities said the blaze, which began Sunday, was 
the work of an arsonist. Flames spread quickly through mixed grass 
and timber land. 
</P>
<P>
	Other wildfires in Montana, Utah and Idaho were contained last  
week.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Schools Want Strike Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Amid hints that a settlement could be close,  
striking teachers brought their message to the street Monday, 
toting signs saying ``No contract, no work'' as they marched in the 
city's Labor Day parade. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations between teachers and the school board resumed  
Monday, with district officials voicing optimism about reaching a 
deal on Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both sides have indicated that today we could likely see a  
settlement,'' district spokesman Stan Childress said Monday. ``I do 
know that all of the issues that had been on the table were 
embodied in the final settlement package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Elliott, the president of the Detroit Federation of  
Teachers, told the Detroit Free Press he was confident an agreement 
could be reached Monday. He said the union and the school district 
had reached agreement on substantial issues, but that stumbling 
blocks of an economic nature remained. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers in the 172,000-student district rejected an offer to  
extend their contract last week, spurning their own negotiators' 
recommendations for another extension and stalling last Tuesday's 
scheduled start of classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Issues have included class size and reforms proposed by the  
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Some teachers marching in the parade predicted a settlement  
wasn't close. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be far inadequate,'' teacher Steve Cohn said of  
any possible offer. Teacher Phyllis Harris, a member of the union's 
executive board, said teachers can't decide how to vote on a 
proposed contract until they actually see it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to get the package first,'' said Ms. Harris, who  
wasn't taking part in negotiations. ``They haven't brought us 
anything back yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The previous contract between the school system and the 9,200  
teachers represented by the union expired June 30, and an extension 
ran out Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers had been unhappy with proposals for a longer school  
day, merit pay and other reforms proposed by the troubled 
district's new chief executive, David Adamany. He took the place of 
the superintendent after the Legislature voted in March to replace 
Detroit's elected school board with one appointed by the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been speculation that the teachers could face  
increasing pressure this week to head back to the classroom based 
on a 1994 no-strike law that fines teachers one day's pay for each 
day on strike. 
</P>
<P>
	State House Speaker Chuck Perricone and Senate Majority Leader  
Dan DeGrow have said they will call back legislators this week, if 
necessary, to explore action to end the strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm moving to invoke fines on the illegally striking  
teachers,'' said state Sen. David Jaye. ``I want Detroit teachers 
to lose a day's pay for every day they strike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the walkout continued, the city's schoolchildren looked for  
other ways to occupy their time. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark DeMarco, 9, likes the extended summer playtime but said he  
wants to go back to school. His grandmother, Leatha Jones, 49, said 
she hopes a settlement comes soon, but she supports the teachers. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Natwest Bids for Legal &AMP; General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- National Westminster Bank PLC on Monday announced  
a $17.2 billion agreement to take over life insurance and pension 
provider Legal &AMP; General Group PLC. But some analysts considered 
the bid risky and expensive, and investors bid both companies' 
shares down. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders in Legal &AMP; General will get $3.37 a share in cash  
and stock. The price puts a slight premium on the $3.30 at which 
Legal &AMP; General traded Friday after news broke of the takeover bid. 
But it constitutes a hefty 20 percent premium on the price earlier 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We deem it a fair price,'' NatWest chief executive David  
Wanless said. ``We're buying an exceptional business and are 
creating a complete financial services company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, NatWest shares, which had fallen Friday on rumors of  
the deal, slipped further, trading at $18.20 on the London Stock 
Exchange, down from $18.34. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal &AMP; General eased to $3.24, but still was buoyed by the  
prospect of becoming part of a significant new force in the British 
financial services market. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could be a transforming deal turning it into a real  
powerhouse. But it's not without risks,'' said David Raye, an 
analyst at HSBC Securities in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``Half of us think they paid too much and half too little. It's  
a full price and there's got to be real growth there ... but it's 
not inconceivable it could be achieved,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	There also are doubts about whether selling life insurance and  
pensions through banks can be made to work in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	If the deal -- which needs shareholder approval -- goes through,  
the merged group would have a value of about $48 billion and employ 
76,000 people. The two companies said the takeover would mean 
annual cost savings of some $208 million by the end of 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipated savings would be achieved by merging the two  
company's life and general insurance businesses, fund management 
and head office functions. 
</P>
<P>
	NatWest will finance the offer by issuing new shares, borrowing  
and tapping internal funds. NatWest shareholders would hold about 
75 percent of the combined company's shares and Legal &AMP; General 
shareholders the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there had been no shortage of proposals from investment  
banks, ``there's never been a proposition that has had this kind of 
business fit,'' Legal &AMP; General Chief Executive David Prosser said. 
</P>
<P>
	NatWest chairman Sir David Rowland would be chairman of the  
merged group and Wanless, NatWest's chief executive, deputy 
chairman. Prosser would also be deputy chairman, but would report 
to Wanless.

<HEADLINE> Imported Vehicle Sales Up in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Sales of imported vehicles rose 3 percent in August  
from the same month last year, an industry association announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Importers sold a total of 17,086 cars, trucks and buses last  
month, compared with 16,588 sold in August last year, the Japan 
Automobile Importers Association said. 
</P>
<P>
	The August increase in imports followed a 5.9-percent  
year-on-year drop in July, a 15.8-percent rise in June and a 
0.2-percent fall in May. 
</P>
<P>
	For August, the association said imported passenger cars rose  
3.2 percent to 16,422 while truck imports fell 2.4 percent to 662. 
Sales of buses in August totaled 2, compared with 3 buses sold a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures come as Japan is struggling to emerge from its worst  
economic downturn in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	German automakers sold a total of 9,107 vehicles in August, down  
0.4 percent from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of U.S.-made vehicles, which totaled 3,727, were up 15.4  
percent. They were followed by British automobiles, which totaled 
sales of 1,447, up 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Swedish automakers sold 789 vehicles, down 6 percent, and French  
carmakers sold 707, down 3.4 percent. Sales of Italian cars in 
Japan totaled 501 in August, down 4.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Dionne Warwick's Home Robbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Five men dressed as repairmen  
entered Dionne Warwick's home, tied-up her brother and housekeeper 
and stole thousands of dollars worth of goods, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer, who owns a house in Rio's upscale Jardim Botanico  
district, was reportedly on tour in Asia at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	According to local press reports, about $53,000 in cash and  
goods was stolen during Thursday's robbery. The thieves left behind 
a gold record, apparently because they were unable to pry it from 
the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Police inspector Carlos Gomes said Monday that he was waiting to  
hear from the singer's brother, Henry Clifford, before he could 
confirm what had been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifford and the housekeeper Jose Laurindo were not harmed.

<HEADLINE>  Man Killed After Attacking Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT SAID, Egypt (AP) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who  
has survived a series of assassination plots and attempts, brushed 
off an attack Monday that left him grazed and the assailant dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The afternoon attack came as hundreds of people chanting  
Mubarak's name and carrying his photograph thronged the streets of 
Port Said to welcome the presidential motorcade. 
</P>
<P>
	Mubarak, riding in a black luxury car, was visiting the northern  
city to tour industrial projects and deliver a speech ahead of a 
presidential referendum in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the president was waving ... through the car's window, a  
person approached the motorcade holding a sharp tool and inflicted 
a light wound,'' said a statement from the president's office. It 
indicated Mubarak was wounded on the arm. 
</P>
<P>
	The special security guards immediately killed the assailant,  
the statement said. The statement did not explain how the assailant 
was killed, but witnesses said he was shot several times by 
Mubarak's guards. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacker was identified as Said Hassan Suleiman, 40, a  
clothing vendor who ``has been known for impulsive behavior and 
recklessness.'' The police statement added that he had ``no 
political affiliations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suleiman was a common criminal, police sources said without  
elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Monday, Suleiman's neighbors, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said they believed he was an Islamic fundamentalist. 
They said he was arrested nearly two months ago for suspicion of 
belonging to a militant group but was released three days later. He 
always carried a pocket knife, they added. 
</P>
<P>
	Mubarak's wound was treated with a disinfectant. Appearing  
composed, he spoke as scheduled about an hour after the attack and 
made no mention of it. He had changed from a brown suit to a dark 
blue one. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources said Mubarak then went to spend the night at the coastal  
resort of Sharm el-Sheik, where a day before he had presided over 
the signing of a new Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. He is 
scheduled to travel to Libya on Wednesday for an Organization of 
African Unity summit. 
</P>
<P>
	A guard was cut slightly on a finger when he tried to stop  
Suleiman from reaching Mubarak during the attack about 100 miles 
northeast of Cairo at the northern end of the Suez Canal. 
</P>
<P>
	Egyptian television later showed videotape of cheering crowds,  
but cut away as shots rang out and did not show the attack. The 
next pictures showed Mubarak at the meeting hall, where supporters 
clapped and chanted ``Mubarak is the people's beloved! We salute 
you Mubarak!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak called Monday to wish the  
Egyptian president a speedy recovery, Barak's office said. Egypt's 
Middle East News Agency reported that Libyan leader Moammar 
Gadhafi, Jordanian King Abdullah II, and Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat also sent good wishes. 
</P>
<P>
	The most serious of the attacks on Mubarak came in June 1995,  
when Muslim militants fired on his limousine as it was driving 
through Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on the way to an OAU summit. 
</P>
<P>
	His predecessor, President Anwar Sadat, was assassinated in 1981  
by Islamic militants angered at his having signed a peace treaty 
with Israel in 1979. Mubarak, who was Sadat's vice president, 
became president after the assassination. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has launched a harsh crackdown on Islamic  
fundamentalism in Egypt and in recent years declared the movement 
crushed, with most of its leaders in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Mubarak is preparing for a presidential referendum Sept. 26 that  
he is expected to win. It would be his fourth six-year term in 
office.

<HEADLINE> States Press HMOs To Pay On Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	After months of phone calls and letters trying to collect  
thousands of dollars from Horizon Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New 
Jersey, Dr. Anthony Musarra was fed up. 
</P>
<P>
	Late payments from the health maintenance organization were  
forcing the Absecon, N.J., internist into debt to pay his office 
expenses, so he asked the state for help. 
</P>
<P>
	He was one of more a dozen doctors who accused the HMO of late  
payments. On June 15, state regulators warned Horizon it could be 
fined up to $10,000 for appropriate claims not paid within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Within days, Musarra said, checks started arriving, and Horizon  
apologized for the delay. However, Horizon denies allegations about 
late payments, said spokesman Fred Hillmann. He said the company 
pays 30 million claims a year and only a few thousand are in 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	States are becoming more aggressive in making sure that plans  
pay claims from doctors and hospitals. Many states have passed laws 
to specify how quickly HMOs must make payments. States including 
New York, Florida, North Carolina and Louisiana have started 
imposing fines. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it goes to the state, the plan gets worried and does  
something about it,'' Musarra said. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators say they're acting to protect patients, noting that  
some health providers illegally bill patients when an HMO balks at 
paying. And patients could be hurt if hospitals or doctors have to 
curtail services because of financial problems resulting from claim 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Murray of Port Charlotte, Fla., said bill collectors  
sent by doctors and hospitals hounded her late husband, J.C. 
Murray, while he was dying of heart disease. The Murrays expected 
his HMO, Physician Corp. of America (since purchased by Humana), to 
cover his medical bills but the health plan resisted, saying the 
Murrays had not paid their premiums on time. The couple denied the 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time I took him to the hospital he asked me to sue  
them, but I never did,'' said Ms. Murray, who eventually paid some 
of the bills herself. 
</P>
<P>
	HMO industry officials defend their record in paying claims on  
time but say they're not surprised more states are closely 
scrutinizing payments. 
</P>
<P>
	``States are getting more into the micromanagement of health  
plans in a lot of areas,'' said Susan Pisano, spokeswoman for the 
American Association of Health Plans. 
</P>
<P>
	HMO officials say payments often are delayed because doctors and  
hospitals make mistakes in filling out claims, or send claims in 
late. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, Colorado,  
Pennsylvania, Vermont and Virginia have passed laws this year 
requiring HMOs to pay bills within a certain time or face penalties 
or fines, according to the National Conference of State 
Legislatures. In all, 27 states now have HMO prompt-payment bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital executives and doctors say the fines are too small to  
have much impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting fined $1,000, what's that do to a large corporation?''  
said Sarah Smith, of the Greater New York Hospital Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Clifford Sales, a Westfield, N.J., surgeon, contends that  
HMOs purposely withhold money to increase profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``When my wife called the plumber, he doesn't leave without  
getting paid, but with HMOs, we are forced to wait and wait and 
wait,'' said Sales, who filed a complaint with New Jersey 
regulators claiming about $52,000 in overdue payments from Oxford 
Health Plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxford, whose claims-paying ability has come under scrutiny in  
New York and New Jersey, acknowledges it had problems paying bills 
on time a year ago but says it resolved them. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxford has paid $71,100 in fines this year to the New York  
Insurance Department.

<HEADLINE> California May Require Booster Seats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREEDOM, Calif. (AP) -- Donny Baltazar rides proudly to  
kindergarten every morning in the front passenger seat, toying with 
the large, loose seat belt that slides up over his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like it up here in front,'' he says. ``I like to play with  
the seat belt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donny's been riding shotgun for two years, ever since his mom,  
Marguerita Baltazar, took him out of the car seat mandated in 
California for children under 4 years old and 40 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But safety advocates point out that seat belts can be as  
dangerous to children as air bags. They say California's law 
doesn't go far enough. Children as old as 6 also are usually too 
small for a seat belt designed for an adult. The shoulder straps 
slide dangerously up their necks, and the lap belts sit across 
their vulnerable abdomens, not low on their hips. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Gray Davis is considering a measure passed by the  
Legislature last week that will put kids like Donny back into 
booster seats or harnesses through their seventh birthday. The 
devices cost $20 to $110. 
</P>
<P>
	If signed, it will be the toughest child passenger safety law in  
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children are irreplaceable,'' said Judy Barrett-Miller, a  
consultant for the California Coalition For Children's Safety And 
Health in Sacramento. ``Traffic accidents are the leading cause of 
death for children who this law applies to. If we want to safeguard 
our children, this is the best approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration study of  
traffic accidents involving children under 15 found that 71 percent 
of deaths and 66 percent of injuries could be eliminated if the 
children used an appropriate child safety seat, booster seat or 
seat belt on every ride. 
</P>
<P>
	California Highway Patrol officer Debby Bratby -- who sees  
first-hand the dangers children face in car accidents -- wouldn't 
dream of driving her 5-year-old daughter anywhere without buckling 
her into a booster seat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The seat belt could come across the neck, and in children that  
windpipe is real sensitive, so it could kill them. And then there's 
the internal injuries that can be caused by the lap belt,'' she 
said. ``Parents just aren't aware of the dangers. We really need 
this law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the  
U.S. territories have car seat laws, most of which cover children 
up to about 4 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer and safety advocates say those laws have saved  
thousands of lives. From 1979, when no states had car seat 
requirements, until 1984, when most had been enacted, deaths among 
children under 4 dropped 30 percent nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, supporters of the new law say, it's time to protect the 4,  
5 and 6 year olds. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama and Massachusetts require booster seats or harnesses for  
children who have grown out of their car seats, but those laws only 
apply to children under 6, one year less than the California 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would boost the potential fine for a second  
violation of child-seat requirements to $250, although violators 
could take classes in lieu of the fine. 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. Jackie Speier, who sponsored the legislation, said  
it's unsafe to simply use seat belts to restrain 4- to 6-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We dump them into a car's seat belt that's designed for a man  
weighing about 168 pounds,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Assemblyman Bruce Thompson opposed the bill, saying it  
represents government prying unnecessarily into the lives of loving 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't want the government to come in and tell them what  
to do,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorena Roche of Watsonville said she had no idea that her  
children -- 4-year-old Joe and 5-year-old Anna -- were unsafe in seat 
belts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept them in the car seats, just like the law says, until  
they were old enough,'' she said. ``I certainly would put them in 
something else if it would be safer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new law, if signed, wouldn't take effect until Jan. 1, 2001,  
allowing time for a broad, statewide education effort. Plans 
include television and print advertising, and in-school training. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Baltazar said she realizes Donny could be safer.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know it wouldn't be as dangerous if he was in a car seat,  
but he really wouldn't like it and I would have to hear about it,'' 
she said.

<HEADLINE> Violence Predicted in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Peace efforts in the war-torn  
Democratic Republic of Congo hit a new snag Monday when a rebel 
leader accused President Laurent Kabila of violating a peace accord 
brokered last week and issued a veiled warning that hostilities 
could resume. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congolese Rally for Democracy, which has been fighting to  
depose Kabila since August 1998, has objected to his decision to 
appoint Lt. Gen Sylvestre Luesha as head of his armed forces. The 
decision was announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Luesha is an ethnic Mai Mai, who make up one of the groups meant  
to be disarmed under a peace deal brokered in Lusaka last week, the 
Rally for Democracy's chief negotiator Bazima Karaha said in an 
interview Monday. The loose-knit group has clashed with the rebels 
during the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	Karaha warned that if Luesha were not removed from his post,  
``We will carry on and disarm him''. 
</P>
<P>
	A letter voicing the objection was sent to the Joint Military  
Commission, which is overseeing the Congo cease-fire, but no reply 
had been received, Karaha said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a threat. It is a violation. This man must be  
disarmed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rival rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba told reporters in  
Pretoria that he agreed with Karaha that Luesha was a bad choice, 
but said he would not go so far as to tell Kabila what to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Karaha added that the cease-fire appeared to be holding.  
</P>
<P>
	``The guns are silent. We believe this should be the end of the  
war in the Congo,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Karaha, who flew in to South Africa on Saturday to hold talks  
with President Thabo Mbeki, was Kabila's former foreign minister. 
He joined the rebels after accusing Kabila of nepotism and 
corruption and failing to chart a clear political course. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil war in the former Zaire, which erupted a year after  
Kabila overthrew its former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, has drawn in 
forces from five other countries. Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola have 
been propping up Kabila's regime, while Uganda and Rwanda have been 
supporting the rebels trying to overthrow him. 
</P>
<P>
	Wamba encouraged South Africa's continuing involvement in the  
peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	``The emphasis in the DRC has shifted from fighting to  
negotiation, an area in which South Africa has rich experience,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Teacher Strike Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Striking teachers and the school board agreed  
Monday on a tentative contract that could end a weeklong walkout 
over reforms sought by the schools chief hired to turn the troubled 
district around. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers could be back in school by Wednesday, and the  
district's 172,000 students would return Thursday, negotiators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to recommend to the teachers that they accept this  
contract,'' Detroit Federation of Teachers President John Elliott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers won agreements for smaller classes and raises of up to  
4 percent, and defeated proposals for merit pay and longer school 
days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the nation's biggest teacher strikes in recent years,  
Detroit students missed four days of class last week and would miss 
class again Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers walked out in defiance of a Michigan law that bars  
teacher strikes and fines them one day's pay for each day they 
strike. Legislative leaders had said they would move to seek 
sanctions against the teachers Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, which represents 9,200 teachers, had been unhappy  
with proposals for a longer school day, merit pay, class size and 
other reforms administrators sought after the Legislature voted in 
March to replace Detroit's elected school board with one appointed 
by the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar school takeovers have been enacted in Chicago and  
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools in Detroit, the nation's 10th-largest city, have been  
beset by mismanagement and chronically low test scores, attendance 
and graduation rates, and the new chief executive, David Adamany, 
said the reforms were aimed at turning those trends around. 
</P>
<P>
	The original contract offer proposed merit pay raises of up to  
$3,000 a year to teachers with good attendance, three years of 
satisfactory performance, advanced coursework and national 
certification. 
</P>
<P>
	The union contended that the criteria for the merit pay system  
were unclear and could allow administrators to reward undeserving 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the merit pay provision was absent from the final deal,  
Adamany said it could be implemented without union approval. He 
also said the contract gives the district tighter control of 
teacher absenteeism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably accomplished about two-thirds of the proposals for  
greater accountability in this district,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The district also dropped its proposal to lengthen the school  
day from 6 hours to 8 1/2 hours. Teachers had said making classes 
smaller was a more important reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The new contract includes provisions for smaller class sizes  
starting during the 2000-01 school year for 44 elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said all along that this was a strike for real school  
reform, and we meant it,'' Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott said teachers would vote Wednesday morning on returning  
to class, though the actual contract vote would be held later by 
mail and could take a week to 10 days to complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the old contract, the median salary for a Detroit teacher  
with a bachelor's degree was $50,978. For those with a master's 
degree, the median was $58,494. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the teachers rejected an offer to extend their  
contract, spurning their own negotiators' recommendations and 
stalling the scheduled start of classes on Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the teachers brought their message to the street,  
toting signs saying ``No contract, no work'' as they marched in the 
city's Labor Day parade.

<HEADLINE>  Sammy Sosa Hits 58th Home Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa hit his major league leading 58th  
homer Monday, giving him a four-homer lead over Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa drove a 2-1 third-inning pitch from Cincinnati's Juan  
Guzman over the left-field wall and onto Waveland Avenue. The drive 
came against a 15 mph wind blowing in at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa is six games ahead of his pace during his 66-homer season  
last year. His 58th last season came in Chicago's 142nd game. The 
Cubs played their 136th game Monday and have 26 remaining. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Greg Heading to Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico (AP) -- Motorists lined up half a mile  
outside gas stations, and residents and tourists packed 
supermarkets in the Mexican resort town of Cabo San Lucas on Monday 
as Tropical Storm Greg became Hurricane Greg and closed in on land. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg's winds strengthened Monday to 75 mph over the Pacific  
Ocean, and the center of the storm was projected to pass just west 
of Cabo San Lucas, a town on the southernmost tip of the Baja 
California peninsula that is popular with American sports 
fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 p.m. EDT, the center of the hurricane was 85 miles  
southeast of Cabo San Lucas and was drifting to the northwest. 
Forecasters expected it to pick up speed, and tropical storm winds 
extended 115 miles from the center. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities declared a hurricane watch for the southern part of  
the peninsula, and the ports of Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del 
Cabo closed to all traffic, port captain Andres Alberto Ordaz told 
the government news agency Notimex. 
</P>
<P>
	Juancho Polson, a fishing boat operator, would normally be  
hauling U.S. sport fishermen around at this time of year. But he 
pulled his boat out of the water early Monday, and spent the rest 
of the day preparing for Greg. ``I'm filling up because the storm 
is coming,'' Polson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lines outside gas stations stretched up to half a mile, and  
supermarkets were filled with both residents and tourists stocking 
up on emergency supplies, Notimex said. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal authorities declared a red alert, meaning all  
emergency workers were on call, said city official Antonio Alvarez 
Acevedo. Representatives of the army and navy were meeting to plan 
rescue operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a tropical depression in the Gulf of Mexico moved  
over a sparsely populated stretch of the mainland just south of the 
Texas border Monday, dropping up to 10 inches of rain, Mexico's 
National Water Commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	The unnamed depression was just east of Ciudad Victoria, about  
125 miles south of the U.S. border, the commission said in a 
statement. The storm had winds of 35 mph, and was moving 
north-northwest at 8 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico issued a tropical storm warning along a 250-mile stretch  
of coast from Tampico to the U.S. border. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, rain associated with the storms caused flooding across  
Mexico over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	In Coahuayana, 290 miles west of Mexico City, about 200 homes  
were flooded and residents evacuated to a school after a river 
overflowed its banks because of 10 to 15 inches of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Rains also washed out a stretch of highway connecting the resort  
city of Acapulco with the beach resort of Zihuatenejo, south of 
Mexico City, on Saturday. Cars carrying tourists backed up for 
miles on either side of the five-yard breach. 
</P>
<P>
	Highways were cut off by flooding and mudslides farther south on  
the Pacific coast in Oaxaca state. About 50 families were evacuated 
from their homes after the Perros River overflowed its banks.

<HEADLINE> Metzenbaum Assails Terrorist's Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Howard Metzenbaum, a ferocious liberal in his  
days in the Senate, has reacted to a new book by trying to banish 
it from the U.S. marketplace. And its author, he says, deserves the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Without even reading the book, Metzenbaum took the unforgiving  
position against the memoir of Abu Daoud, a planner of the deadly 
kidnapping of athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu Daoud, whose real name is Mohammed Oudeh, was a Palestine  
Liberation Organization leader whose Black September guerrillas 
took Israeli weightlifters hostage. Two athletes were killed during 
the assault. Nine others died when German police bungled a rescue 
attempt. A German policeman and five terrorists also were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the dead: David Berger, a weightlifter from the Cleveland  
suburb of Shaker Heights with dual citizenship who had moved to 
Israel to pursue his dream of being an Olympian. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger grew up three doors away from Metzenbaum, who was with  
the athlete's parents as they watched the horror unfold on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his reputation as a civil libertarian, Metzenbaum can't  
see giving First Amendment protection to Abu Daoud. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sure don't want him to profit by means of this evil and  
killing of people,'' said Metzenbaum. ``He ought to be 
incarcerated. He actually ought to pay with his own life, after 
being tried by a jury or a court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abu Daoud's memoir, ``Palestine: From Jerusalem to Munich,'' was  
published earlier this year in France, renewing the heartbreak of a 
family that has been grieving since September 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just couldn't believe he was free all those years,'' Dorothy  
Berger, the mother of David, said from her Cleveland home. ``It is 
so unfair to me. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've lived with this for 27 years,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The company that bought the U.S. publication rights and is now  
having the 600-page book translated has amassed a file about 2 
inches thick full of protest letters, mostly from Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have decided not to respond to these, including phone calls  
which are quite disruptive -- screaming,'' said Arcade's president 
and publisher, Richard Seaver. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a book that we took in with a lot of thoughtfulness,'' he  
said. ``We're doing it because it's a very strong book showing the 
other side of a story we've only published one side of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver described the Munich chapter of the book as an  
explanation, not a boast. ``Believe me, he's so contrite about 
that,'' the publisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the book came out in France, The Associated Press described  
its account of Munich as a plan to use Israeli athletes as 
negotiating chips, with the deaths blamed on Germans who betrayed a 
pledge to let the Palestinians leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Berger said she already has spoken with the managers of two  
local bookstores. One was nice but the other was a younger man who 
seemed to have no idea what she was talking about, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Metzenbaum has been asking bookstore chains to place no orders  
for the book to make it more difficult for Abu Daoud to make money 
off his explanations of events. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no obligation for a bookseller to stock a book,''  
said Metzenbaum. ``If they're presented with 100 books, they don't 
choose all 100.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company's titles include the memoir of Israeli Prime  
Minister Shimon Peres and many books about the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	Metzenbaum, the publisher added, ``certainly has the right to  
his own opinion, but I do note that he hasn't read the book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Finan of the American Booksellers Foundation for Free  
Expression, an industry group, said it's hard not to sympathize 
with people who dislike the idea of terrorists profiting from 
describing their acts, but suppressing a book is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are absolutists about First Amendment protected material,  
whether the author is somebody who is charged with a crime or 
somebody who is simply loathsome,'' Finan said from New York.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Plans Fight Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Faced with soaring numbers of people  
infected with HIV, Cambodian health officials announced plans 
Monday to enforce condom use in the nation's commercial sex 
outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 100 Cambodians catch the deadly virus each day --  
the highest infection rate in Asia, according to the Health 
Ministry's HIV/AIDS Control Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate is a substantial increase over last year's estimates of  
50 to 70 new cases a day, suggesting that AIDS awareness campaigns 
have not changed Cambodians' sexual habits, health officials said 
at a press briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health Ministry released several alarming statistics on the  
country's AIDS epidemic to hammer home an appeal to Prime Minister 
Hun Sen and international aid agencies to quickly support plans for 
expansion of a pilot program of nationwide condom use. 
</P>
<P>
	Police enforcement of mandatory condom-use in brothels -- known  
as the ``100 Percent Condom-Use Program'' -- has proved in testing 
to effectively shut down Cambodia's most common route of infection, 
health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sex trade is considered the main link in the spread of HIV,  
with almost half of the country's 20,000 sex workers believed to be 
infected with the killer virus. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we can apply the 100 percent program, we hope it will  
reduce the rate of infection,'' said Dr. Tia Phalla, deputy 
director of the HIV/AIDS Control Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The program is expected to cost $1.7 million annually.  
</P>
<P>
	Prostitution is technically illegal in Cambodia, but it is  
socially tolerated and mostly ignored by police, who often reap 
`protection fees' from brothels. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials said Monday that an estimated 200,000  
Cambodians -- or 1.75 percent of the population -- are HIV positive, 
an increase of 50,000 from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 Cambodians die of AIDS every day.

<HEADLINE> Capriati Leaves U.S. Open in Tears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jennifer Capriati spoke of her teen-age  
rebellion and confusion as she sought to close the door on her 
past. Yet she revealed how fragile she remains, leaving the U.S. 
Open once again in tears. 
</P>
<P>
	An hour after losing to Monica Seles 6-4, 6-3 in the fourth  
round Monday, Capriati began a news conference by reading a 
statement she wrote before the tournament and saved until she was 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there is much mystery, much question to what happened,  
and I must also say many lies,'' the 23-year-old player said of the 
collapse of her career in 1993, her subsequent arrests on 
shoplifting and drug possession charges, and her rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I made mistakes by rebelling, by acting out in confused  
ways,'' she said, taking deep breaths as she read. ``But it was all 
due to the fact I was very young and I was experiencing my 
adolescence. Most of you know how hard that can be. When you do it 
in front of the world, it is even harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She spoke of taking a different path than other players,  
learning a lot about herself and life along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I knew there would be so much pain in learning life's  
lessons,'' she said, ``I would have been hesitant to take the path 
that I took. It's the only thing I do regret. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me say that the path I did take for a brief period of my  
life was not of reckless drug use, hurting others, but it was a 
path of quiet rebellion, of a little experimentation of a darker 
side of my confusion in a confusing world, lost in the midst of 
finding my identity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made mistakes, and yes, I am to blame, and no one else. I am  
sorry to my loved ones that I humiliated and embarrassed. And I'm 
sorry to my fans who feel I let them down. I'm sorry to myself for 
causing such pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capriati said she has put much of her past behind her and feels  
she's moving in the right direction as she starts a new chapter in 
her life. She added that this would be the last time she speaks 
about the past, and asked the media to respect her wishes to stay 
away from the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the statement was something she had been wanting to  
write for a long time, and that this felt like the right moment. 
She had told her father about it -- Stefano Capriati sat in the 
interview room listening to her -- but hadn't told her mother, who 
is divorced from her father. 
</P>
<P>
	Then in response to questions about her statement, Capriati said  
she wrote it because she was ``tired of all the questions'' about 
her past, ``all the mystery. Just once and for all, I wanted to get 
it over with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Capriati never really clarified the events that led to her  
arrests or what happened to her afterward. The ``mystery'' remains 
untold, and Capriati said she's still not ready to talk about it 
publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	Told that other athletes have experienced a sense of relief  
sometimes after talking openly about their problems, Capriati said 
she thought that's what reading her statement would do for her and 
that she wanted to make sure she explained herself the right way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just really didn't know how to handle it, just how to go  
about saying it, afraid I was going to say something wrong,'' she 
said. ``I didn't know really what to say that was just going to be 
right or I wasn't going to get in trouble. ... Maybe that's why 
I've played with a lot of anxiety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until that point in the long news conference, Capriati kept her  
composure, talking about her statement, her ``self-inflicted'' 
problems, the match with Seles. 
</P>
<P>
	Then she was asked, ``Do you still see the media as your  
adversary?'' Capriati hesitated. She has been the subject of mostly 
sympathetic stories her entire career, despite her troubles, yet 
she remains wary of the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to start crying. It's nothing bad, it's just ...''  
</P>
<P>
	Capriati broke off and began sobbing uncontrollably.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a little overwhelming, that's all,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	A WTA Tour representative, Jim Fuhse, asked her if she wanted to  
stop. Capriati shook her head. 
</P>
<P>
	``It needs to be done,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We can stop if you want to,'' Fuhse said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just wish I didn't have to talk about this stuff all the  
time,'' Capriati said, sobbing more heavily. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuhse led her away, and her father came over to put his arms  
around her. Outside the interview room, a reporter who has long 
known her also tried comforting Capriati as she kept crying. 
Finally, after a few minutes, Capriati made her way down the hall 
to the locker room and away from the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	She had left tournaments in tears before -- the U.S. Open in 1992  
after losing in the third round, the Australian Open in 1993 after 
losing in the quarters, among others. She spoke now of being 
stronger than in those days, being able to keep things in 
perspective, yet she remains in some ways as fragile as ever.

<HEADLINE> EU Unemployment Falls to 9.3 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Unemployment in the European Union fell  
to 9.3 percent in July from 9.4 percent in June, the EU's 
statistics office reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobless rate was 10.3 percent in July 1998.  
</P>
<P>
	The EU unemployment rate compared to 4.3 percent in the United  
States in July and 4.9 percent in Japan. The U.S. unemployment rate 
fell in August to 4.2 percent, matching the 29-year low reached in 
March and May. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 11 nations that use Europe's single currency, the euro,  
unemployment fell to 10.2 percent in July from 10.3 in June, 
according to Eurostat's monthly report. In July 1998, the 
unemployment rate in the euro-zone nations was 10.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Luxembourg continued to register the lowest unemployment in the  
EU, at 2.8 percent. Spain had the highest at 15.9 percent, although 
the Spanish jobless rate also registered the fastest fall over the 
year, from 18.8.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Sign Top Two Picks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Rangers agreed to terms with both  
of their first-round draft picks Monday, right wing Pavel Brendl 
and center Jamie Lundmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Brendl, 18, was chosen fourth overall in June's NHL entry draft,  
while Lundmark, also 18, was selected ninth. The Rangers acquired 
the fourth pick from the Tampa Bay Lightning for goalie Dan 
Cloutier, forward Niklas Sundstrom and first and third-round picks 
in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	New York also moved up from 11th to ninth to take Lundmark,  
giving up center Marc Savard and acquiring the rights to Calgary 
Flames left wing Jan Hlavac and a third-round pick in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Brendl led the Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League with  
a league-leading 73 goals along with 61 assists in 68 games last 
season, also leading the league with a plus-68 rating. The 6-foot, 
200-pound Czech native made the WHL All-Star team while capturing 
rookie of the year honors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundmark, who also played in the WHL last season, was second on  
the Moose Jaw Warriors with 91 points (40 goals, 51 assists) in 70 
games.

<HEADLINE> Jackson May Help Iranian Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has often negotiated  
freedom for foreign-held captives, says he's now trying to help 13 
Iranian Jews awaiting trial for espionage in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are working diligently to try to get 13 Jews freed from  
Iran. We hope that Iran will assume its rightful place in the 
family of nations,'' at the United Nations, Jackson said Sunday 
after delivering a guest sermon at a Manhattan church. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jews being held include at least one rabbi and several  
educators who were arrested in March as alleged spies for Israel 
and the United States. They could face the death penalty if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Israel and the United States have dismissed the spy charges  
as unfounded, and along with France, Germany and Amnesty 
International lodged protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he was planning a trip to Iran, Jackson replied,  
``Well, we're trying -- we're working on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Abraham Foxman, national director of the  
Anti-Defamation League, reached out to Jackson for help after weeks 
of what Foxman called ``quiet diplomacy'' failed to win the group's 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 19, Iran rebuked a call by the U.S. State Department for  
the Jews' release. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is as though Iran asks the U.S. to release, before trial,  
all those who are arrested in the U.S. on espionage charges,'' the 
official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran has tried and executed 17 Iranian Jews for espionage in the  
past two decades, including two in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson has worked to free captives before. He negotiated with  
Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic for the release of three 
American servicemen in May. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, he went to Syria and won the release of a Navy  
lieutenant whose jet was shot down during a raid over Syrian 
anti-aircraft positions in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	Several months later, Jackson talked Fidel Castro into releasing  
48 American and Cuban political prisoners. In 1990, he helped win 
the release from Iraq of more than 700 foreign women and children 
detained as human shields against an American military attack.

<HEADLINE> Hernandez Exits With Rib Tightness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- San Francisco's Livan Hernandez left Monday's  
game against the New York Mets with tightness in his rib cage. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander threw one warmup pitch in the bottom of the  
third inning of the scoreless game before grabbing his left side. 
Giants manager Dusty Baker and a trainer went to the mound to check 
Hernandez before taking him out of the game and replacing him with 
Mark Gardner. X-rays were negative, and he will be re-evaluated 
when the team returns to San Francisco on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez hit a long drive to right field in the top of the  
third and may have injured himself swinging. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez (7-11) went two innings, allowed one hit and struck  
out one. Acquired from Florida on July 24 for minor league pitchers 
Jason Grilli and Nate Bump, he is 0-5 in five starts against the 
Mets this season. He is 2-6 in 11 career starts against them.

<TEXT>
<P>
	VENICE, Italy (AP) -- Meryl Streep in a movie by the man who gave  
us ``Scream''? 
</P>
<P>
	Look for her in the lead role of Wes Craven's ``Music of the  
Heart,'' a sentimental story about a violinist who teaches music in 
a Harlem school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that Craven's young fans who love blood and horror  
will be shocked by this film,'' Streep told RAI state TV. 
</P>
<P>
	She was in town Monday for a screening of the movie at the  
Venice Film Festival, which runs through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for being a perfectionist, Streep said she studied violin  
for two months before shooting began. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am much less attentive to detail in my work than I was in  
the past. I don't consider this positive but this way I am able to 
spend more time with my children,'' Streep told the Italian news 
agency ANSA. 
</P>
<P>
	Madonna was originally going to star. The movie was several  
months into pre-production last year when she quit, citing creative 
differences with Craven.

<HEADLINE> Ill Jerry Lewis Hosts Telethon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jerry Lewis fought off double vision and  
headaches to host his annual Labor Day Telethon, singing ``Sitting 
on Top of the World'' but resting backstage much of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He experienced some double vision and his blood pressure  
spiked,'' said Jim Brown, a telethon spokesman. ``With the double 
vision he literally could not read the cue cards, and with a live 
broadcast it becomes impossible to continue when you can't read.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis appeared Sunday night for the first three hours of the  
event that raises money for the Muscular Dystrophy Association. He 
sang a duet with Martin Short and performed another solo and was 
expected to return at the end of the show, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, 73, was hospitalized last month with viral meningitis.  
Two neurologists monitored his condition throughout the broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34th annual telethon was broadcast live on the Internet in  
English, Spanish and Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
	With six hours remaining, more than $20 million had been raised.  
Last year, a record $51.57 million was pledged.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Assaults GOP Tax Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- President Clinton chose an overcrowded  
elementary school Monday as the backdrop for a renewed assault on 
the Republican-passed tax cut plan, which Democrats contend would 
steal money from desperately needed school construction programs. 
</P>
<P>
	At Coleman Place Elementary School, built in 1924, Clinton  
called on Republicans in Congress to ``leave politics at the school 
house door'' and embrace his proposal for tax breaks to help school 
districts repair, expand and modernize schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, before addressing parents, teachers and students who  
had gathered on the school softball field, joined in renovating one 
of the schools classrooms. Using a cordless electric drill, the 
president fastened about eight screws to attach the top of a 
computer table. 
</P>
<P>
	Then addressing the crowd, Clinton attacked the GOP tax cut  
plan, which he already has promised to veto. ``It means larger 
classes, fewer students and more leaky roofs,'' said Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Later at a Labor Day picinic at the home of the mother of Rep.  
Bobby Scott, D-Va., Clinton renewed his attack on the GOP tax 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before we have this big tax cut the Republicans have proposed,  
we ought to take care of the big challenges facing America,'' 
declared the president, ticking off protecting Social Security, 
Medicare and education ``We ought to get this country out of debt 
for the first time since 1835 before we give the money away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	En route to the picnic, Clinton in a helicopter flew over some  
tornado damage in the Hampton, Va., area. Earlier he had declared 
the region a disaster area, making victims eligible for federal 
assistance. About 250 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed and 
about a dozen people injured by the storm over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not against cutting taxes'' said Clinton at the school,  
but that the Republican's $792 billion cut over 10 years would mean 
sharp cuts in domestic spending including education. The Democrats 
have suggested a more modest nearly $300 billion cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke in front of temporary trailers used by Coleman  
students as classrooms because of lack of school space. He said 
Virginia schools alone use e 3,000 such trailers and there are 
similar classroom shortages and schools in need of repair 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	About a third of American public schools, or 25,000 buildings,  
need extensive repair or replacement, according to the General 
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. The GAO also 
calculated that $112 billion is needed just to repair existing 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our schools are crumbling and it is a national disgrace,''  
declared AFL-CIO president John Sweeney in remarks preceding the 
president's. 
</P>
<P>
	This fall, Congress considers a 34-year old law that governs the  
bulk of federal education spending. The White House is expecting a 
fight over Clinton's bond proposal for school modernization, which 
would provide $24.8 billion in tax credit bonds over two years. The 
Clinton administration claims that amount would make it cheaper for 
local school districts to modernize up to 6,000 schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also claims Republicans' $792 billion tax cut  
program almost ignores school needs in favor of tax breaks for the 
wealthy, such as eliminating the estate tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has promised to veto the GOP tax cut this fall.  
</P>
<P>
	School districts nationwide spent $18.7 billion on school  
construction in 1996, the latest year for which data was available 
according to census bureau. The districts spent $15.9 billion in 
1995 and $14.4 billion in 1994.

<HEADLINE>  Bid Launched To Save Belfast Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The American who helped deliver  
Northern Ireland's peace agreement began closed-door discussions 
today in hopes of saving the 17-month-old accord. 
</P>
<P>
	The British and Irish governments hope former Sen. George  
Mitchell can secure agreement by local parties on two key 
unfulfilled sections of the 1998 Good Friday accord: the formation 
of a joint Protestant-Catholic administration for Northern Ireland 
and the gradual disarmament of the province's outlawed paramilitary 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``The political leaders of Northern Ireland must seize this  
opportunity,'' Mitchell said at the British government's Castle 
Buildings, a drab office block where the historic accord was struck 
on Good Friday 1998 after 22 months of grueling negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, has refused to  
form the envisaged four-party Cabinet until the Irish Republican 
Army accepts its obligation to disarm. 
</P>
<P>
	The outlawed IRA, rooted in the most militant Catholic areas,  
refuses to disarm and says its July 1997 truce should be 
sufficient. The IRA-linked Sinn Fein party, which received 17 
percent of the vote in Northern Ireland, insists it must receive 
two posts in the intended 12-member Cabinet regardless of the IRA's 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither I nor anyone else has a magic wand that will wave away  
these problems. But I believe it can be done,'' Mitchell said, but 
added that it was up to the political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of them sought public office and the power that comes  
with it,'' he said. ``At this time and place, that means having the 
courage and wisdom to find a way to overcome the obstacles to 
implementation of the agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell was scheduled to meet separately with delegations from  
Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionists during consultations scheduled 
through Tuesday. His diplomatic efforts in Belfast were expected to 
last several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The major Catholic-supported party, the moderate Social  
Democratic and Labor Party, said the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein 
were equally to blame for the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know that there have been breaches of the IRA  
cease-fire -- we don't need a trial,'' said SDLP negotiator Brid 
Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	As political delegations arrived, a few dozen people  
demonstrated in support of the accord. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mitchell faced a tough task.  
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Mitchell cannot work miracles,'' The Irish Times said  
in an editorial. ``The unionists and Sinn Fein have to realize that 
they need each other, and that they have to make forward movement 
possible for each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sinn Fein negotiator Alex Maskey said that if he were Mitchell,  
``I would have a return ticket organized already.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Cuts Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Ryan Leaf and Jim Druckenmiller are peas from the same pod --  
disappointing first-round draft choices whose teams don't seem to 
want them. 
</P>
<P>
	But while both survived Sunday's NFL cutdown day, they did it  
with different attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I feel like I was given an opportunity? No, I don't,'' said  
Druckenmiller, the 49ers' 1997 first-round draft pick, who was one 
of four quarterbacks kept by San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``But does it matter what I think? It really doesn't matter what  
I think because I'm not the one in charge. It's up to the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want an opportunity. If it can't be here, then it's got  
to be somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Steve Mariucci conceded that keeping four quarterbacks was  
unusual, and hinted that a trade might be in the works that would 
send Druckenmiller elsewhere while the 49ers stick with Steve 
Young, Jeff Garcia and Steve Stenstrom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it's possible to do that the entire season,''  
Mariucci said of keeping four QBs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you end up getting banged up in one position or you have a  
certain need that you have to fill and you've got a lot of guys 
sitting watching Steve Young work, then you've got to rethink that 
whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf, who has a surgically repaired throwing shoulder that won't  
allow him to play for half the season, said he wanted to be traded 
rather than placed on injured reserve. He wasn't, staying on the 
roster behind Jim Harbaugh and Erik Kramer, while Craig Whelihan, 
who replaced him last year, was waived. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels like I got drafted again,'' said Leaf, who had  
monumental problems both on and off the field after being the 
second overall pick in the 1998 draft. ``Now we get the perfect 
situation where I come into and you've got the two veteran 
quarterbacks there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other big-name casualties Sunday was Tennessee  
cornerback Darryll Lewis, who had 25 interceptions in the past five 
years. He was a salary cap cut, and immediately had a bunch of 
teams coming after him. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, a nine-year veteran, was beaten out for the starting job  
by second-year Samari Rolle and then cut in what looks like a 
difference of opinion between coach Jeff Fisher and Jeff Diamond, 
the new team president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nowhere in this did we ever expect not to have Darryll back,''  
Fisher said. ``I believe he can still play a number of years, if 
not as a starter, as a premier third-down nickel back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver made a notable technical cut -- John Elway, who officially  
retired in April, but was kept on the roster as insurance if he 
changed his mind. The move also saved salary cap money. 
</P>
<P>
	Another casualty was 1994 Heisman Trophy winner Rashaan Salaam,  
let go by the Raiders, who kept former New York Giants running back 
Tyrone Wheatley instead. Wheatley had been cut earlier in the 
preseason by Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gave him a long look, but Wheatley has really caught our  
eye over the last two weeks, both in practice and games. Special 
teams play also was a major factor,'' coach Jon Gruden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle placed star wide receiver Joey Galloway, who is holding  
out, on reserve, although they can activate him when he signs. The 
Seahawks also announced the retirement of 35-year-old Howard 
Ballard, a 12-year veteran, who has arthritis in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other veterans released Sunday were punter Louie  
Aguiar of Kansas City; linebacker James Francis, oft-injured 
offensive tackle Kevin Sargent and center Rod Payne, a third-round 
draft pick in 1997, by Cincinnati; eight-year running back Bernie 
Parmalee by Miami; kick returner Eric Metcalf by Baltimore; and 
38-year-old long snapper Mike Morris by Minnesota, which also cut 
tight end Eric Moss, Randy's older brother. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets cut special teams player Corwin Brown, a favorite of  
coach Bill Parcells in New York and New England. New Orleans cut 
Danan Hughes, a free-agent wide receiver who spent seven seasons 
with Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins, meanwhile, put wide receiver Lamar Thomas, a  
starter last season, on injured reserve. The New York Giants did 
the same with left guard Lance Scott, meaning Luke Petitgout, the 
team's first-round draft choice, will start. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona made an unusual move by keeping both its kickers, Joe  
Nedney and Chris Jacke. The Cardinals hope to trade one to a team 
looking for a veteran placekicker.

<HEADLINE> Underdog Bruins Remain Confident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- UCLA coach Bob Toledo realizes his team is  
facing Ohio State at the worst possible time. 
</P>
<P>
	And he expects the Bruins to beat the Buckeyes.  
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, his players feel the same way.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're UCLA, we're going to tell our kids that,'' Toledo said  
Monday. ``We're going to respect our opponents, they better have 
some respect for us, too. We have a pretty good program. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're to go back there and play our hearts out, we're going to  
play to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the surface, it doesn't look good for UCLA.  
</P>
<P>
	--The 14th-ranked Bruins (1-0) will face the 13th-ranked Buckeyes  
(0-1) without 11 players -- most of them starters -- who were 
suspended for the season's first two games for illegally obtaining 
handicapped parking permits. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Bruins will also be without pass rushing specialist Travor  
Turner, who sustained a season-ending knee injury in UCLA's 38-7 
victory over Boise State on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	--UCLA might also be without standout wide receiver Danny Farmer,  
who caught 58 passes for 1,274 yards and nine touchdowns last 
season. Farmer missed the opener because of a sprained ankle, and 
his status for the Ohio State game is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Buckeyes, 23-12 losers to No. 8 Miami in the Kickoff  
Classic on Aug. 29, haven't started a season with two losses since 
1986. That means Ohio State will have had 13 days to lick its 
wounds and prepare for the Bruins, who, mainly because of the 
suspensions, will field an inexperienced team against an angry 
opponent before a hostile crowd of about 94,000. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Buckeyes have won 20 straight home openers, and have won 32  
of their last 33 non-conference games at Ohio Stadium dating to a 
23-20 loss to Stanford in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The only loss since then came on Sept. 22, 1990, when Southern  
California beat Ohio State 35-26. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll be ready to play,'' Toledo said of the Buckeyes.  
``Hopefully, our players will be ready as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to it; playing a team like this is one of  
the reasons our players came to school here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo admitted he kept his team under wraps somewhat against  
Boise State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to do a few things, try to do them well, get out with  
a win,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Junior quarterback Drew Bennett, who struggled in the first half  
against Boise State in his first career start but was much better 
in the second half, realizes his second start will be against a 
much better opponent in a different atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, he expressed confidence.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't think you can win, there's no point,'' he said.  
``If we can pull this one out and get all our guys back (from 
suspension), I think we'll have something to feed off. We'll have a 
real intimidating team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett and freshman Cory Paus alternated against Boise State,  
and Toledo said the plan will be the same against Ohio State. But 
within the next few weeks, he'll settle on one quarterback to play 
the majority of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's quite a challenge,'' Paus said of facing the Buckeyes.  
``You can't ask for anything more for a second game. The earlier, 
the better. I'm sure I'll be a little nervous, the normal person 
would be. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to work a little harder this week because  
we're going to be facing a better team. If you can (be successful) 
against one team, there's no reason you can't do it against 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman defensive back Ricky Manning, impressive against Boise  
State in his first college game with seven tackles, including three 
for losses, said he's been looking forward to facing Ohio State all 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be a lot of hard hitting, a lot of trash  
talking, a lot of smash-mouth,'' he said. ``That's just how it is. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can beat Ohio State. I've watched them on film;  
they're a good team but I'm not overwhelmed by them. The best 
team's going to win. You can't go into a game thinking you're going 
to lose.''

<HEADLINE> Comeback Excites Giants' Williams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- After missing the last two seasons  
with an eye injury, you better believe Brian Williams is excited 
heading into the New York Giants' regular-season opener at Tampa 
Bay on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Williams isn't acting like a giddy rookie, the veteran  
Giants center admitted this game is going to be special after what 
he has been through since a freakish poke in the eye nearly ended 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
	One obvious sign was the way the 11-year veteran reacted last  
week when he watched game film prior to the exhibition finale 
against Baltimore. Knowing he wasn't going to play because of a 
bruised knee, Williams felt his mind wandering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait,'' Williams said after returning to practice  
Monday. ``After I banged my knee, I woke up and all I thought about 
was Tampa Bay. I couldn't help it. I'm really excited. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's totally different tempo out there,'' the 33-year-old  
added. ``You'll see totally different things as far as the 
defenses. There will be a lot more big plays out there in the game. 
It's exciting. I can't wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams hasn't played in a regular season game since the Giants  
faced New England in the final game of the 1996 season. 
</P>
<P>
	On the third day of the 1997 training camp, he was poked in the  
right eye by defensive lineman Bernard Holsey during a blocking 
drill. The blow fractured the eye orbit and caused double vision, 
which didn't clear until this past December following a couple of 
surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams has tried to downplay his return, but it's been obvious  
he is a steadying influence on a line that performed badly last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I bring different things to the game and things to the  
team, but I am not a missing link,'' Williams insisted. ``I never 
felt that way. I just feel I am another player in there, and I work 
well with the other guys and they work well with me. That's what 
matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coming back has not been a snap for Williams. Early in camp he  
criticized his own blocking techniques, and felt he was slow 
adjusting to some of the defensive fronts. He also wondered how 
well he would play after the long layoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Now comes the real thing, and the Buccaneers are going to be a  
test with a defensive line that features a trimmed down and even 
quicker Warren Sapp. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be a big test for me as far as where I'm at,''  
Williams said. ``As far as being in with the guys and knowing my 
plays and assignments and recognition of the defenses, I feel 
pretty confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the major concerns for the Giants coming into the game  
will be the rookie guard to the left of Williams, first round draft 
pick Luke Petticoat. He was forced into the starting lineup two 
weeks ago after Lance Scott tore up his knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams has taken Petticoat under his wing. All this week, he  
has been talking to the former Notre Dame tackle discussing 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Before each play, they double check their assignments and then  
point out the middle linebacker to each other. It's really not 
necessary, but it's a way of making the rookie feel comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants need that because they did not get the running game  
going in the preseason, and they are coming into the season opener 
without leading rusher Gary Brown, who sprained a knee last week. 
He'll be out three to four weeks, leaving rookie Sean Bennett and 
cancer-survivor LeShon Johnson to carry the load. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams isn't worried.  
</P>
<P>
	``As far as the line goes, we are very confident in who is going  
to be back there,'' Williams said. ``On the other hand, the line 
has to improve on the running game. We have to step it up this 
week. These guys are great pass rushers, and they will put a lot of 
heat on us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that's what he has been waiting for.

<HEADLINE> Imported Vehicle Sales Up in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Sales of imported vehicles rose 3 percent in August  
from the same month last year, an industry association announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Importers sold a total of 17,086 cars, trucks and buses last  
month, compared with 16,588 sold in August last year, the Japan 
Automobile Importers Association said. 
</P>
<P>
	The August increase in imports followed a 5.9-percent  
year-on-year drop in July, a 15.8-percent rise in June and a 
0.2-percent fall in May. 
</P>
<P>
	For August, the association said imported passenger cars rose  
3.2 percent to 16,422 while truck imports fell 2.4 percent to 662. 
Sales of buses in August totaled 2, compared with 3 buses sold a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures come as Japan is struggling to emerge from its worst  
economic downturn in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	German automakers sold a total of 9,107 vehicles in August, down  
0.4 percent from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of U.S.-made vehicles, which totaled 3,727, were up 15.4  
percent. They were followed by British automobiles, which totaled 
sales of 1,447, up 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Swedish automakers sold 789 vehicles, down 6 percent, and French  
carmakers sold 707, down 3.4 percent. Sales of Italian cars in 
Japan totaled 501 in August, down 4.4 percent.

	Detroit Schools Want Strike Settled  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Amid hints that a settlement could be close,  
striking teachers brought their message to the street today, toting 
signs saying ``No contract, no work'' as they marched in the city's 
Labor Day parade. Negotiations between teachers and the school 
board resumed today, with district officials voicing optimism about 
reaching a deal on Labor Day. ``Both sides have indicated that 
today we could likely see a settlement,'' a district spokesman 
said. ``I do know that all of the issues that had been on the table 
were embodied in the final settlement package.''

	School Security Raises Concerns  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As children head back to school,  
security-conscious school administrators are also having to think 
about students' rights. Police officers, metal detectors, student 
ID cards and surveillance cameras are part of life in the nation's 
schools as a result of tragedies such as last April's incident in 
which two Columbine High School students gunned down a dozen 
classmates and a teacher before killing themselves. Nadine 
Strossen, national president of the American Civil Liberties Union, 
says ``students' privacy rights and freedom of speech are under 
attack from within.''

capital of East Timor today as pro-Indonesia militias continued a 
wave of terror, torching homes and reportedly slaughtering hundreds 
of civilians. World leaders indignantly called for Indonesia to 
make good on its pledge to provide security in the provincial 
capital, Dili. But witnesses said Indonesian troops were aiding the 
militias and trying to intimidate journalists and U.N. workers into 
fleeing the territory. ``The situation remains out of control,'' a 
police chief said. ``The government there is no longer 
functioning.''

still the top priority. Albright, making a two-day stopover en

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Declaring that their common task is fighting  
terrorism, Israel and the Palestinians expressed hope today that a 
pair of car bombings will not knock the newly revived peace process 
off track. Police said five arrests were made in yesterday's 
bombings in northern Israel. Authorities kept the identities of 
those taken into custody secret-- as well as those of the three 
slain men, apparently the bombers. A court said the gag order was 
requested because the investigation could uncover plans for 
further, imminent attacks.

<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Fourteen Russian troops died today in  
a shootout with Islamic militants, while residents of the southern 
republic of Dagestan became increasingly angry that federal forces 
have failed to oust the rebels despite a month of fighting. The 
militants, seeking an independent Islamic state, have battled 
Russian troops since seizing several villages in Dagestan on Aug. 
7. Government troops have pushed the rebels out of some areas, but 
renewed violence has made clear that the militants are still intent 
on attacking Russian targets.

Sense,'' starring Bruce Willis in the tale of a boy who's a magnet

<HEADLINE> Wife of Umpire Who Lost Job Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Kim Coble, the wife of an American League  
umpire who lost his job last week, died Sunday of cancer. She was 
44. 
</P>
<P>
	She is survived by her husband, Drew Coble, 51, and two  
children, Jason Bryant and Kiersten. 
</P>
<P>
	Coble was one of 22 umpires whose resignations, which were  
effective last Thursday, were accepted by major league baseball. He 
disputed that he tendered his resignation as part of a failed 
strategy by the umpires' union to force baseball to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
	Coble was listed as one of the umpires who turned in their  
resignations on July 14. But he contended he never signed a letter 
of resignation. The umpires' union will try to regain the jobs in 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Coble had worked sparingly this season because of his wife's  
illness.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Mascot Sued for Hitting Fan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A New Jersey man has filed a $35 million  
lawsuit against the Oriole Bird, claiming he got roughed up by the 
mascot during a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Minervini of Keansburg, N.J., alleges that Jeff Gartner,  
one of the three men who perform as the Baltimore Orioles mascot, 
struck him with his tail, pushed him in the chest and took his 
property without permission. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kind of reminds me of Jimmy Carter and the rabbit,'' Orioles  
owner Peter G. Angelos told The (Baltimore) Daily Record, referring 
to the former president's contretemps with a bunny during a canoe 
trip. He declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In his lawsuit, Minervini names two escorts, two policemen and  
an usher who he claims manhandled him and falsely arrested him 
during a May 1997 home game against the New York Mets. The 
Baltimore Orioles and the Maryland Stadium Authority also are named 
in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Minervini is seeking $5 million in damages for each of the seven  
counts in the complaint. He does not specify what, if any, physical 
injuries he suffered. 
</P>
<P>
	His complaint, filed Friday in Baltimore Circuit Court, does not  
say whether he was booked on assault charges and a police spokesman 
was unavailable Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Wagner, the Orioles' director of community relations, said  
the organization had no comment on the matter. Neither Minervini 
nor his attorney Jesse E. Cox could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gartner is the second Orioles mascot to land in court this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	John J. Krownapple, a former Oriole Bird, filed a $200,000  
lawsuit in July against a Philadelphia man who he says pushed him 
off the right field wall at Camden Yards during a game in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendant, Louis Vitigliano, is charged with second-degree  
assault and reckless endangerment. Krownapple says he chipped a 
bone in one ankle and badly bruised the other after falling 10 feet 
from the wall. Trial is scheduled for later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Another of the current Oriole Bird mascots, Bradley Lowe, was  
assaulted by a New York man in 1994. Lowe did not press charges at 
the time nor has he since filed suit.

<HEADLINE> Life on the Run Prepared Bradley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Room service and television are facts of life  
for professional athletes. To Bill Bradley, they meant opportunity 
wasted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every city we enter is full of crises and problems that never  
reach us in a hotel room,'' he wrote during his days as a New York 
Knick. 
</P>
<P>
	So Bradley used his peripatetic existence to study America. He  
dined with fans, consulted with local politicians, visited 
out-of-the way neighborhoods. ``Under his guidance, we'd visit an 
art museum in Houston, or a spectacular shoreline vista in Oregon, 
or attend a political lecture in Boston,'' recalled former Knick 
Phil Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	But such a lifestyle carried risks: After a night game in  
Chicago, Bradley and two friends were robbed at gunpoint while 
meeting outside the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley titled his basketball memoirs ``Life on the Run.'' These  
days, the former New Jersey senator is back on the run, 
crisscrossing the nation in his campaign for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	To both basketball and politics, Bradley has applied the same  
serious, studious, workaholic attitude. He is a 6-foot-5 
contradiction: independent and introspective, but drawn to public 
pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime supporters say they are drawn to Bradley's integrity  
and intelligence, though his meticulousness can be maddening. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill goes through this minute and detailed and, from my point  
of view, excruciating soul-searching before he comes to a 
decision,'' said Bradley's wife of 25 years, Ernestine. ``That's 
just who Bill is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley turned down a scholarship at basketball powerhouse Duke  
to attend Princeton. When professional basketball beckoned, he left 
for Oxford. Supporters urged him to run for president in 1988 and 
1992, but he declined -- only to enter the 2000 campaign as the 
underdog to Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	If not for his contrary streak, he might be in the other party  
today. Bradley came to Washington in 1964 as a summer intern for 
Pennsylvania Rep. Richard Schweiker, a Republican, and quickly 
moved to the presidential campaign of Republican William Scranton. 
</P>
<P>
	But on his own that summer, he sat in the Senate gallery and  
watched the debate over the Civil Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when I became a Democrat,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is famously frugal despite a wealth now exceeding $5  
million. His rumpled clothing stood out amid the flashy dressers on 
the Knicks. In 1996, his final year as a senator, he was still 
puttering around New Jersey in a 1984 Oldsmobile with 160,000 miles 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
	His biggest vice is cashews. His wife worries that eating too  
many will worsen his double chin. 
</P>
<P>
	William Warren Bradley, an only child, was born July 28, 1943 in  
Crystal City, Mo., a factory town of 3,500 on the Mississippi 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Warren, a Republican, was the quiet, dependable  
president of the local bank, physically limited due to severe 
arthritis. His mother, Susan, was a former teacher who had her son 
take lessons in everything from typing to swimming, the French horn 
to the French language. (Dad drew the line at ballet.) 
</P>
<P>
	Young Bill spent countless hours alone with a basketball, pieces  
of lead in his sneakers to improve his jumping. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen a little boy as focused as Bill was,'' said  
Carol Cunningham, who lived next door. ``This concept that if you 
were going to do anything, then you had to do it the very best you 
can, is from his mother. She had the strongest will I've ever seen 
in any human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a freshman at Princeton, Bradley ``was constantly afraid of  
flunking out,'' said classmate Dan Okimoto. ``He approached studies 
with the same intensity, commitment, determination, discipline that 
he approached basketball. He would go study until 2 a.m. after a 
basketball game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Bradley found time to teach Sunday school at Princeton's  
First Presbyterian Church and to have a social life, including some 
dates with Diane Sawyer, then a student at Wellesley College. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-time All-American at Princeton, Bradley led the U.S.  
basketball team to the gold medal at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	He raised eyebrows outside the sport as well. In 1964, New York  
Post columnist Leonard Shecter wrote, ``In 25 years or so our 
presidents are going to have to be better than ever. It's nice to 
know that Bill Bradley will be available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Knicks offered him a contract in 1965, Bradley declined  
and attended Oxford University on a Rhodes Scholarship. He traveled 
through Europe, played other sports, gained 30 pounds, grappled 
with religious faith. 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball ultimately reclaimed his interest, and in 1967 the  
Knicks signed ``Dollar Bill'' Bradley to a four-year, $500,000 
contract. He joined the team in midseason after five months in the 
Air Force Reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	There were many jokes about Bill Bradley the athlete, including  
this one: on his highest jump, a newspaper could not fit under his 
feet. Bradley laughed his way to 10,439 career points, two 
championships and a place in basketball's Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970, a documentary production company wanted Bradley to  
interview poet Marianne Moore, a sports fan. Company employee 
Ernestine Schlant, who lived in Bradley's building on the 
Manhattan's west side, slipped the proposal underneath his door. 
</P>
<P>
	The project was scrubbed when Moore fell ill. But Bradley and  
Schlant began dating and were married in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Bubbly and talkative next to her low-key husband, the  
German-born Schlant is now a professor of German and comparative 
literature at New Jersey's Montclair State University. Their 
daughter, Theresa Ann, is 22 and a college student. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple fretted that Bradley's New Jersey-Washington commute  
was depriving e their daughter of a full-time dad. When Theresa was 
10, she moved to Washington and enrolled in school. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernestine became the commuting parent; Bill became the  
breakfast-fixing, drive-to-school dad, and took to the task. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe it or not, he makes the best cereal mixtures,''  
marveled his wife. ``You don't just pour one brand of cereal in a 
plate, but you mix the various brands, and you add raisins or you 
add blueberries or you add whatever you bought the night before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ernestine's daughter from a first marriage, Stephanie, has four  
children, who crane their necks to talk to the man they know as 
``Papa Bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley ran for Senate in 1978 from his adopted state of New  
Jersey. At 35, he became the nation's youngest senator. 
</P>
<P>
	His signature achievement, the 1986 tax reform, offered a window  
into his style. First he immersed himself in the tax code. Then he 
wrote a detailed plan, published in 1984 as ``The Fair Tax.'' He 
crossed party lines to work with the Reagan administration. He even 
shot hoops in the House gymnasium with Rep. Marty Russo, D-Ill., 
while lobbying for his support. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley breezed to re-election in 1984 but got the political  
scare of a lifetime in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	While he raised more than $12 million and appeared in playful  
ads shooting baskets, Republican challenger Christie Whitman 
criticized him for refusing to discuss tax increases imposed by 
Democratic Gov. Jim Florio. Whitman came within 50,000 votes of an 
upset. 
</P>
<P>
	The close call prompted Bradley to be more outspoken on issues  
dear to his heart, like race relations. In a 1992 speech, he 
whacked a pencil against the Senate lectern 56 times to dramatize 
the beating of black motorist Rodney King by Los Angeles police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley says he is thankful he declined to run for president in  
1992. His wife was diagnosed with breast cancer later that year, 
and Bradley was by her side as she recovered from surgery and 
chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Declaring politics ``broken,'' Bradley announced in 1995 that he  
would retire from the Senate the following year. Disappointed 
supporters wondered if his days in politics were over. 
</P>
<P>
	But it turns out that Bradley just needed some time to be Bill  
Bradley. He spent two years traveling, consulting, teaching and 
listening, before finally declaring himself ready for the game of 
his life.

<HEADLINE> Titans' Evans Suspended for 1 Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Defensive lineman Josh Evans, the  
Tennessee Titans' leading tackler during the preseason, has been 
suspended for a month after failing drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans began the suspension on Monday. He will be eligible to  
return to practice on Oct. 4, the day after the Titans' fourth 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear what drug was found in his system.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a matter between Josh and the league office, and has  
been handled between the two and (is) something we can't really 
comment on,'' said coach Jeff Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans, who is in his fifth season as a Titan, had 21 tackles and  
two sacks during preseason play and had been expected to get 
significant playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he started 11 games at right defensive tackle and had  
3.5 sacks and 54 tackles -- 31 solo and 23 assists.

<HEADLINE> The 25 Greatest Adventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Want to endure gut-wrenching flights at  
Cosmonaut boot camp in Russia, go diving in the near freezing 
waters of the Arctic, spend two weeks hiking in Iran? 
</P>
<P>
	Me neither.  
</P>
<P>
	But there's a growing number of people who do like that sort of  
thing, and National Geographic Adventure magazine has the list for 
them -- the 25 greatest adventures in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adventure travel is a burgeoning industry. There are a lot of  
people with a real yen to do something more than just sit on a 
beach when they travel and who have the resources to do it,'' 
explained Mark Jannot, executive editor of the new magazine from 
the National Geographic Society, which goes on sale Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Billed as the first annual adventure list, it includes a  
half-dozen newly available exploits along with others that have 
been around for a while but remain the editors' choice for most 
exciting. 
</P>
<P>
	Walking with the Masai in Tanzania is among the new treks listed  
in the fall edition of the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip is available to ``six athletic adventurous  
participants,'' the magazine reports -- for a walk that covers 150 
miles in 17 days, escorted by outfitters and local Masai guides. 
</P>
<P>
	Walkers cross the vast savanna amid elephants, cape buffalo,  
zebras, giraffes and their predators, tour the famous Olduvi Gorge 
and conclude their trip during the annual migration of wildebeest. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news, donkeys carry the gear. The bad news, the price  
is $6,495. 
</P>
<P>
	It took a team of editors and researchers six months to collect  
nominations and compile the list of the cream of the travel crop, 
Jannot said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most extraordinary, he said, is cosmonaut training  
in Star City, Russia. ``It's an opportunity not may people will end 
up having.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That exploit carries a hefty $14,950 price tag for a week at the  
Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center outside Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour promises flights in a specially equipped aircraft that  
provides periods of weightlessness, rides in a massive centrifuge 
that simulates launch and reentry in a rocket and, for certified 
divers, a chance to join cosmonauts training for weightlessness in 
a giant water tank. 
</P>
<P>
	Jannot fondly recalled his own adventure on one of the listed  
trips: paddling along the Tatshenshini River in the Yukon, a 
rafting trip now open to kayakers too. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing for me that was so extraordinary about that trip was  
the sense that you have of isolation and being somewhere, 
relatively speaking, no one has gone before,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the river has been open to travel for a few years, ``you  
never see anyone else. The number who have gone on that river are 
fewer than the number of people I see when I walk to the deli for 
lunch,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25 great trips aren't ranked, so there's no number one  
adventure. Jannot said the group tried to provide diversity both in 
location and for people with different interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans of shipwrecks and the cold, for example, might enjoy  
visiting the ship H.M.S. Breadalbane. The vessel sank in the 
Canadian arctic in 1853 and the cold water has preserved its 
remains, 340 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
	The northernmost wreck ever found on the sea floor was located  
in 1980 and now submersible vessels carry visitors to the site. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a seven-hour flight from Ottawa, plus another half-hour hop  
in a small plane, but the $9,980 trip also includes evening 
presentations by marine biologists and the local Inuit and an 
outing to a polar bear den. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who prefer hiking to diving there's a 13-day trek in  
Iran, beginning with the ruins of the ninth century Castle of 
Assassins, a walk through the Elburz Mountains north of Tehran then 
down to the tea plantations on the Caspian Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Other trips featured by the magazine editors include:  
</P>
<P>
	--Searching for lost tribes in Irian Jaya, the Indonesian half of  
the island of New Guinea. 
</P>
<P>
	--Joining the nomadic Kazaks of western Mongolia for hunting  
trips using Eagles to catch prey.	   --Kashmir on wheels, a bicycle trip into the Himalayas 
</P>
<P>
	--Climbing the Dolomites, a chain of 10,000-foot peaks in  
northern Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	--Scuba diving in Mexico's Noboch Nah Chich, the largest known  
underwater cave system. 
</P>
<P>

in different areas or different types of outings, the trips aren't 
ranked.

<HEADLINE> Metzenbaum Assails Terrorist's Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Howard Metzenbaum, a ferocious liberal in his  
days in the Senate, has reacted to a new book by trying to banish 
it from the U.S. marketplace. And its author, he says, deserves the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Without even reading the book, Metzenbaum took the unforgiving  
position against the memoir of Abu Daoud, a planner of the deadly 
kidnapping of athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu Daoud, whose real name is Mohammed Oudeh, was a Palestine  
Liberation Organization leader whose Black September guerrillas 
took Israeli weightlifters hostage. Two athletes were killed during 
the assault. Nine others died when German police bungled a rescue 
attempt. A German policeman and five terrorists also were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the dead: David Berger, a weightlifter from the Cleveland  
suburb of Shaker Heights with dual citizenship who had moved to 
Israel to pursue his dream of being an Olympian. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger grew up three doors away from Metzenbaum, who was with  
the athlete's parents as they watched the horror unfold on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his reputation as a civil libertarian, Metzenbaum can't  
see giving First Amendment protection to Abu Daoud. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sure don't want him to profit by means of this evil and  
killing of people,'' said Metzenbaum. ``He ought to be 
incarcerated. He actually ought to pay with his own life, after 
being tried by a jury or a court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abu Daoud's memoir, ``Palestine: From Jerusalem to Munich,'' was  
published earlier this year in France, renewing the heartbreak of a 
family that has been grieving since September 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just couldn't believe he was free all those years,'' Dorothy  
Berger, the mother of David, said from her Cleveland home. ``It is 
so unfair to me. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've lived with this for 27 years,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The company that bought the U.S. publication rights and is now  
having the 600-page book translated has amassed a file about 2 
inches thick full of protest letters, mostly from Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have decided not to respond to these, including phone calls  
which are quite disruptive -- screaming,'' said Arcade's president 
and publisher, Richard Seaver. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a book that we took in with a lot of thoughtfulness,'' he  
said. ``We're doing it because it's a very strong book showing the 
other side of a story we've only published one side of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver described the Munich chapter of the book as an  
explanation, not a boast. ``Believe me, he's so contrite about 
that,'' the publisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the book came out in France, The Associated Press described  
its account of Munich as a plan to use Israeli athletes as 
negotiating chips, with the deaths blamed on Germans who betrayed a 
pledge to let the Palestinians leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Berger said she already has spoken with the managers of two  
local bookstores. One was nice but the other was a younger man who 
seemed to have no idea what she was talking about, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Metzenbaum has been asking bookstore chains to place no orders  
for the book to make it more difficult for Abu Daoud to make money 
off his explanations of events. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no obligation for a bookseller to stock a book,''  
said Metzenbaum. ``If they're presented with 100 books, they don't 
choose all 100.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company's titles include the memoir of Israeli Prime  
Minister Shimon Peres and many books about the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	Metzenbaum, the publisher added, ``certainly has the right to  
his own opinion, but I do note that he hasn't read the book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Finan of the American Booksellers Foundation for Free  
Expression, an industry group, said it's hard not to sympathize 
with people who dislike the idea of terrorists profiting from 
describing their acts, but suppressing a book is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are absolutists about First Amendment protected material,  
whether the author is somebody who is charged with a crime or 
somebody who is simply loathsome,'' Finan said from New York.

	BIG BEAR LAKE, Calif. (AP) -- Firefighters battled Monday to  
control a handful of fires in the West, including two new ones in 
Oregon and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Near Big Bear Lake and other popular resorts in the mountains 80  
miles northeast of Los Angeles, firefighters were finishing off a 
63,486-acre blaze after containing it Saturday night. The fire 
began Aug. 28 and has cost about $10 million to suppress. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials don't expect to have it under control until Friday.  
The fire has destroyed 19 structures, including several homes, and 
52 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	About 65 firefighters were trying to contain a 2,500-acre  
wildfire that broke out Sunday along the Columbia River gorge in 
Washington state. More than 10 houses were evacuated briefly. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire in central Oregon burned nearly 2,000 acres and  
threatened at least one home on the Warm Springs Indian 
Reservation. Authorities said the blaze, which began Sunday, was 
the work of an arsonist. Flames spread quickly through mixed grass 
and timber land. 
</P>
<P>
	Other wildfires in Montana, Utah and Idaho were contained last  
week.

<HEADLINE> Ill Jerry Lewis Hosts Telethon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jerry Lewis fought off double vision and  
headaches to host his annual Labor Day Telethon, singing ``Sitting 
on Top of the World'' but resting backstage much of the time before 
returning for Monday's finale. 
</P>
<P>
	``He experienced some double vision and his blood pressure  
spiked,'' said Jim Brown, a telethon spokesman. ``With the double 
vision he literally could not read the cue cards, and with a live 
broadcast it becomes impossible to continue when you can't read.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis appeared Sunday night for the first three hours of the  
event, which raised a record $53.1 million in pledges for the 
Muscular Dystrophy Association. He sang a duet with Martin Short 
and performed another solo. He returned Monday for the final four 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thrilled and grateful for the support of our viewers, and  
filled with hope that the dollars we've raised will translate into 
new research breakthroughs to help us conquer the muscle-wasting 
diseases,'' Lewis said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, 73, was hospitalized last month with viral meningitis.  
Two neurologists monitored his condition throughout the broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34th annual telethon was broadcast live on the Internet in  
English, Spanish and Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
	The telethon broke last year's mark of $51.6 million, and the  
final figure was expected to climb because many local stations 
extended their broadcast after the show's official end, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis has vowed to conduct the telethon each Labor Day until a  
cure is found for neuromuscular diseases, Brown said.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars Keep Third Kicker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin doesn't  
believe in luxuries. That's what made his decision to keep a third 
kicker, Steve Lindsey, so surprising. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to deny the impact Lindsey had as a kickoff specialist in  
the preseason, Coughlin went against his own instinct, and kept the 
second-year player from Mississippi on the 53-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
	In the matter of six weeks, Lindsey went from a mere extra leg  
at training camp to one of the biggest surprises on the Jaguars 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
	He found out he had made it when his fiancee called up the  
Jaguars internet site Sunday and noticed Lindsey's name was missing 
-- from the list of players who had been waived. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're sitting there, thinking, they've got to cut 17  
people,'' Lindsey said. ``It would be more than easy for them to 
say, `Let's get rid of the kicker.' It came as a total surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His impact was hard to deny. The rookie sent 11 of his 18  
kickoffs into the end zone during the preseason. That takes the 
strain off a kickoff coverage unit that has struggled over the 
team's first four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin was so impressed that he chose to keep a third kicker  
over a ninth defensive back, the number he traditionally carries. 
Veteran cornerback Deon Figures was released and second-year 
cornerback Cordell Taylor, last year's second-round draft pick, was 
traded to the Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lindsey proved himself to be a valuable commodity for this  
team,'' Coughlin said. ``You rank the players to see how well they 
contribute to the team. After considering the roster, you have to 
consider him an important improvement to the defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsey attempted only one field goal in the preseason, although  
he made some long kicks in practice and during pre-game warmups 
that stoked Coughlin's interest. There's a chance the new kicker 
could be used for long field goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Jacksonville's other kicker is just one year removed  
from the Pro Bowl. Mike Hollis enters the season having made 13 
consecutive field goals. Kickoff depth has never been his strength, 
however, and his problems are exacerbated by a bad back. He had 
offseason surgery on two ruptured disks that still bother him on 
kickoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as it helps the team out, I'm fine with it,'' Hollis  
said. ``Steve's a great kicker. He deserves a job somewhere. Having 
a guy like that is important for the kickoff coverage. We've tried 
for four years to get it squared away. Hopefully, Steve Lindsey is 
the answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he is, Lindsey might have to tinker with his schedule a bit.  
His wedding date is set for Oct. 23. That happens to be the Jaguars 
bye week. 
</P>
<P>
	``If coach let's us, we'll get married then,'' Lindsey said.  
``If not, I guess we'll wait until the end of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, it will be better than the way he spent last year.  
After being waived by the San Francisco 49ers before training camp, 
Lindsey returned to Oxford, Miss., where he worked on his kicking 
game and made ends meet by working at a collection agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was making people real mad,'' he said. ``It was not where I  
wanted to be. It's good to be back.''

<HEADLINE> Buckeyes Hold Spirited Practices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Three months until the game with Michigan  
and four weeks before the first Big Ten game, Ohio State turned 
mean and nasty in practice last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very intense,'' wide receiver Reggie Germany said of  
the Buckeyes' workouts. ``It was like full go. Tempers were 
flaring. It got exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So heated were the exchanges between teammates that Germany said  
he had to take an extra precaution to make sure he didn't get his 
head turned around backwards by friendly fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to put my mouthpiece in for once in practice,'' he said  
with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of a 23-12 Kickoff Classic loss to Miami on Aug. 29,  
Ohio State's practices turned into a survival test. Instead of 
walking through plays in anticipation of Saturday's home opener 
against No. 14 UCLA, the 13th-ranked Buckeyes used the workouts to 
purge themselves of the bad feelings left over from the defeat by 
the Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the kids responded pretty well,'' coach John Cooper  
said of last week's physical sessions. ``What did we get 
straightened out? I hope a lot of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami dominated the Buckeyes, outgaining them 398-220 while  
running and passing for more yards. It was Ohio State's first loss 
in a season opener in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Hurricanes needed a big play, they got it. They had  
gains of 44, 50, 42, 67 and 23 yards to tilt momentum, field 
position and the scoreboard in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
	They also ground it out when they needed to, eating up 7:39 of  
the fourth quarter on a 79-yard drive that included only nine 
passing yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed in our football team -- not any one area,''  
Cooper said. ``That's not like us to play like we did. We played 
almost like we didn't want to be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Na'il Diggs agreed that the Buckeyes played less than  
spirited football. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was definitely an emotional pitch that wasn't there,''  
he said. ``I definitely saw it when we came back and watched the 
film. It was not a couple of guys, it was everybody. We weren't 
running down the field. We weren't playing hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why that was, Diggs said, ``It was a lot of little things  
that threw us off. A lot of the guys just didn't want to be there. 
It was an away game, early in the season against a good team. It 
was a lot of little things that got to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Buckeyes are confronted by UCLA, which opened its season  
with last Saturday's 38-7 victory over Boise State. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to win just by showing up,'' Cooper warned.  
``We're anxious to play a game. After you get beat, you like to 
come back the next day and get it out of your system. It's been a 
long 10 days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins are a dangerous opponent because of their firepower,  
Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got great offensive skills people,'' he said.  
``They've got three or four of the best wide receivers we'll play 
against. And they've got a stable of running backs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said Miami's 49-45 upset of previously unbeaten and  
third-ranked UCLA last year gave his players an indication of how 
good the Bruins are. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't think they're good on offense, look at what they  
did last year against Miami,'' Cooper said. ``They had 670 yards of 
offense against Miami -- a Miami team that kicked our butts up one 
side and down the other last week.''

<HEADLINE> Hazardous Materials Get on Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Despite safety measures instituted by federal  
regulators following the ValuJet crash three years ago, hazardous 
materials are still making their way on board the nation's 
airliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The fiery ValuJet crash that killed 110 people in the Everglades  
was blamed on oxygen generators carried in cargo. Now banned on 
passenger airlines, the explosive-triggered generators have flown 
or been intercepted at least 20 times since the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration came under attack in the  
ValuJet investigation for in-house problems controlling hazardous 
materials, hazmat for short, and some of the same problems persist. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's training and enforcement in the field may not be as  
strong as Washington thinks they are, violations routinely take two 
years to process, headline-grabbing proposed penalties often shrink 
to smaller fines, and airlines have been slow to install mandated 
fire gear on older aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the ValuJet crash, the biggest change was a requirement  
proposed by the FAA more than a year later to add fire detection 
and suppression equipment to old cargo holds by 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Forms filed by the industry show only 11 percent of the nation's  
fleet has been converted halfway to the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	On the plus side, a new force of 140 inspectors and lawyers work  
exclusively on hazmat enforcement, shippers are under scrutiny for 
the first time, and unprecedented criminal charges over the ValuJet 
crash riveted the industry in July. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no way to guarantee hazmat never flies, but closer  
scrutiny of everything going onto planes and better training of 
people clearing packages to fly are reducing the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	A major contributing factor in the ValuJet crash was the failure  
of ground crews with the discount carrier and a maintenance 
contractor to realize the improperly packaged generators could 
easily ignite. 
</P>
<P>
	Like about 80 percent of the nation's airlines, ValuJet was what  
is known in the industry as a ``will-not-carry'' airline, which 
means it doesn't knowingly accept hazmat for its flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash disclosed vague wording in FAA rules about whether  
will-not-carry airlines were required to train workers to recognize 
hazmat. A report due within days from the inspector general's 
office of the Transportation Department will address the 
will-not-carry issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Wilkening, FAA manager of dangerous goods and cargo  
security, said that issue was resolved in April 1998 with written 
guidance from FAA lawyers and the security division to the work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an open issue. We feel it's enforceable,'' Wilkening  
said. ``Our agents have been provided guidance that will-not-carry 
carriers must have recognition training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as recently as last November, agency sources told The  
Associated Press that an FAA instructor told newly hired security 
inspectors that training may be required, but no enforcement action 
can be taken against violators. 
</P>
<P>
	The interpretation offered in training ``would be wrong,'' said  
FAA spokeswoman Rebecca Trexler. ``We believe the regulation is now 
clear enough to enforce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the amount of fines proposed by the FAA for hazmat  
violations are up from $2.3 million in 1994 to $19.6 million in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But there often is a gap of two years or more between a  
violation and the FAA's proposed penalty. And the fine amount tends 
to shrink. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. was cited for shipping 100 signal flares  
with UPS in March 1997. The $150,000 proposed fine was settled for 
$75,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A California supplier of toys and novelties was cited for a 1996  
delivery of a five-gallon drum of flammable glue, which leaked at 
the same UPS sorting center in Kentucky. The company had no idea 
what the FAA was talking about when first approached about the 
violation because so much time had passed. The proposed fine of 
$75,000 fell to $35,000 when the case was closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Fully staffed since the summer of 1997, the new hazmat teams  
have organized special inspections in 20 cities in addition to 
routine checks. 
</P>
<P>
	For every airline inspected, the FAA has set an undisclosed  
ratio for the number of shippers that also must be checked to 
attack an obvious problem area -- ignorance on the part of people 
preparing air shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talk to shippers every day that don't really know anything  
about these regulations,'' said Jim Powell of Torrance, Calif., a 
hazmat training consultant. ``It's just something they think their 
carrier will take care of for them.''

<HEADLINE> Hockey Announcer Lecavalier Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Rene Lecavalier, who hosted French-language NHL  
games for Radio-Canada for more than 30 years, died Monday. He was 
81. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montreal-born Lecavalier was best known in Quebec, but was  
widely recognized as one of the top sports commentators in the 
history of Canadian radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sad day. ... I don't know of anybody who was respected  
more in all of the years he was the voice of the Canadiens,'' 
former Montreal Canadiens great Jean Beliveau told the Montreal 
Gazette. ``He would describe what was happening and for days 
afterwards the people would still see it in their minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lecavalier joined Radio-Canada in 1937 as a war correspondent  
based in North Africa. Lecavalier hosted cultural radio shows for 
the CBC's French-language division from 1941 to 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in 1952, the man who had dreamed of becoming a hockey  
player did the next best thing and became the radio commentator for 
the Canadiens until he retired in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout his career, Lecavalier earned an enormous amount of  
respect for his attention to the proper use of French and excellent 
diction in sports coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from hockey, Lecavalier covered the Olympics from 1960 to  
1984, with the exception of Munich in 1972 and Moscow in 1980. He 
also regularly covered the Commonwealth and Pan American games. 
</P>
<P>
	He was inducted into both the Hockey Hall of Fame and Quebec's  
sports hall of fame, and was honored in 1996 with a lifetime 
achievement award from Sports Media Canada, the country's sports 
press association.

<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- The Carolina Hurricanes helped solidify  
their defense Monday, signing Marek Malik to a multiyear contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5, 210-pound Malik had two goals and nine assists in  
52 games last season after being recalled from the minors on Dec. 
8, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In four NHL seasons, Malik has three goals, 15 assists and 90  
penalty minutes in 107 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marek has made consistent improvement since first joining the  
organization and is coming off one of his best professional 
seasons. He has the opportunity to step up and be among our top 
defensemen,'' Carolina assistant general manager Jason Karmanos 
said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Journal Entries Tell of Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Journal notes purportedly made by two  
friends who were lost while hiking in the New Mexico desert 
describe in detail how one killed the other before rescuers reached 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The diary ascribed to Raffi Kodikian and his friend who was  
killed, David Coughlin, also included farewell notes to friends and 
burial instructions, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I killed &AMP; buried my best friend today. Dave had been in pain  
all night. At around 5 or 6 he turned to me &AMP; begged that I put my 
knife through his chest. I did, &AMP; a second time when he wouldn't 
die. He still breathed &AMP; spoke so I told him that I was going to 
cover his face. He said OK. He struggled but died. I buried him w/ 
love. God &AMP; his family &AMP; mine, please forgive me,'' Kodikian wrote 
in a journal entry dated Aug. 8, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodikian, 25, has told investigators Coughlin, 26, pleaded with  
him to end his pain after the two men got lost early last month 
while camping in Carlsbad Caverns National Park and ran out of 
water. Kodikian said they believed they would die. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators won't say exactly what they think happened, but  
they don't buy Kodikian's story and have charged him with murder. 
He is free on $50,000 bail and living with his parents near 
Doylestown in suburban Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Secret Service is currently examining the journal for  
fingerprints and analyzing the handwriting to determine whether 
Coughlin actually wrote in the diary, said Gary McCandless, chief 
of detectives for the sheriff's office. 
</P>
<P>
	On one page is a farewell note signed ``David Andrew'' and  
addressed to Coughlin's girlfriend, Sonnet Frost. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sonnet, Baby, I write this with a shaking hand. ... I do not  
know what to do right now, but I am in utter agony and I know you 
would understand. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH! I have barely eaten &AMP; drank 
since Wed. evening. Nobody is coming to help. I love you! ... We 
had forever but now all we have is eternity. ... Eternally yours, 
David Andrew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another entry in the journal read, ``We will not let the  
buzzards get us alive. God forgive us.'' Another written by 
Kodikian said, ``Dave has asked that his remains be cremated and 
thrown over the edge of the Grand Canyon. I leave the handling of 
my remains to my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kodikian's lawyer, Gary C. Mitchell, said the killing was an act  
of mercy because the two were lost in the desert in searing heat 
without water. He said the two had agreed to help one another die. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said Coughlin tried to help Kodikian slit his wrists  
``They were too weak and the knife too dull to accomplish that,'' 
Mitchell said, explaining superficial scratch marks police found on 
Kodikian's wrist. ``And then Raffi, the stronger of the two, did 
what he though his best friend wanted him to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have said Coughlin was not near death when he was  
stabbed, and the men's campsite was just 275 feet from a trail, and 
a mile and a half from their car. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the Eddy County, N.M., sheriff's office made  
public excerpts from the journal, and the newspaper itself said 
obtained others but did not disclose how. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff M.A. ``Chunky'' Click and Gary McCandless, chief of  
detectives, were unavailable for comment Monday on the newspaper's 
story. Both were expected to be out of the office until later this 
week.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa hit his major league leading 58th  
homer Monday, giving him a four-homer lead over Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa drove a 2-1 third-inning pitch from Cincinnati's Juan  
Guzman over the left-field wall and onto Waveland Avenue. The drive 
came against a 15 mph wind blowing in at Wrigley Field.

<HEADLINE> Hardcourt Spurs Victorious Agassi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Midway through their first set at the U.S. Open,  
Arnaud Clement began huffing and puffing, chasing down Andre 
Agassi's shots from one side of the court to the other. 
</P>
<P>
	And right then, it was clear that the 21-year-old Frenchman who  
gave Agassi so much trouble on the red clay of Roland Garros, would 
be no problem on the green hard courts of the National Tennis 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Clement, who came within two points of beating Agassi at the  
French Open, arrived for this round-of-16 match Monday wearing a 
bandana and wraparound goggles. He could have used a bicycle to 
keep up with the second-seeded Agassi, who advanced into the 
quarterfinals of the U.S. Open with a 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	What was the difference from the French Open, Agassi was asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``I played him at the U.S. Open,'' he said. ``It's a hardcourt.  
It's much different. He's very fast. When he has time, he can 
really take the ball with a backhand and hurt you. On the 
hardcourt, I can hit through a little bit easier, end the point 
when it calls for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the French, Clement was up a set and leading 30-0 in the  
fourth before Agassi won nine straight games to turn the match 
around. That win came at the start of a stretch that has now 
produced 32 victories in 36 matches for Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
	No dramatic comeback was necessary on a humid afternoon when the  
air seemed as heavy as some of Agassi's serves and Clement was left 
to toss his racket in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt good, start to finish, Agassi said. ``I was making him  
earn everything out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi led the French player on a merry chase, some of his shots  
kissing the lines, others overpowering his opponent. Invariably, 
Clement would go one way and Agassi's shots would go the other way. 
Passing shots, ground strokes, short points, long points, Agassi 
brought the whole arsenal on the lightning-fast court. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's never my intention to keep a point going if I can end  
it,'' Agassi said. ``He's quick and doesn't give you much pace. He 
can bait you into taking unnecessary risks. You don't want to fall 
victim to that. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to play disciplined tennis, punching the clock, stay  
disciplined with your shot selection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On one Clement return that was well wide, Agassi hit a winner  
anyway, just because he could. 
</P>
<P>
	Clement did manage to break Agassi in one game, no small  
accomplishment at the Open, where that had happened just once 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, Agassi just wore his man down.  
</P>
<P>
	``My game is built around my work ethic,'' he said, ``making  
every point as valuable as the last, getting on top of my opponent 
and sucking the life out of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 29, Agassi keeps reinventing himself.  
</P>
<P>
	After getting as high as No. 2 in the rankings in 1994 when he  
won the Open and 1995 when he won the Australian Open, his ranking 
dipped as low as 122 two years ago, when he sat out three Slams, 
playing only at Flushing Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
	He then dedicated himself to coming back and says he now is in  
better shape that at any time in his career. The reason? ``Hard 
work,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's individual why people break down,'' he said. ``I never  
fell in the rankings because of injuries. My game didn't leave me. 
I fell because I wasn't in shape. There's a certain work ethic to 
why I fell. I knew I could address it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He finished 1998 ranked sixth in the world, then won the French,  
completing a personal Grand Slam. Then he reached the finals at 
Wimbledon and now is in position to finish the year as No. 1 in the 
world if he wins the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Next for Agassi is the quarterfinals against qualifier Nicolas  
Escude, who upset No. 10 Marcelo Rios 6-2, 6-3, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no intentions of making further dreams come true for  
him,'' Agassi said.

<HEADLINE>  Gore Lashes Out at GOP Contenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore ripped into  
Republican rivals he said are ``buckling'' to anti-union pressure 
and pushing measures that would cripple labor's political clout. 
</P>
<P>
	He mentioned none by name, but ``paycheck protection'' has been  
an issue in Texas, where Gov. George W. Bush is the leading GOP 
contender. Gore aides distributed complaints from Texas labor 
leaders about the issue, even as Gore pounded the point at labor 
rallies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the anti-labor folks have put pressure on these  
candidates and they've buckled to it,'' said Gore. ``It is designed 
to bust unions. It's probably the single most notorious 
union-busting proposal to come along in years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore continues to gain support from Democratic Party leaders,  
picking up an endorsement today from U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't take this step lightly,'' Harkin said, appearing with  
Gore at a Labor Day visit to a park in a working-class Des Moines 
neighborhood. ``Gore is right for Iowa, he is right for America and 
he is right for our working families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is the ability of union leaders to use dues of members  
for political purposes. Many Republicans push for proposals that 
would require individual union members to annually give approval 
for such use, and dub the issue ``paycheck protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders and many Democrats argue the move would  
effectively eliminate the ability of unions to be political 
players, and call it ``paycheck deception.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been surprised at some of the Republican candidates for  
president who have felt so much pressure from the far right wing 
that they have found it necessary to endorse this idea,'' said 
Gore. ``It was out of the mainstream of the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that voters in California voted on the issue in a  
referendum in the last election, rejecting it soundly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most moderate Republicans have really stayed away from it,''  
said Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore faces opposition only from former New Jersey Sen. Bill  
Bradley in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, and 
most polls show him with an early lead. 
</P>
<P>
	A Boston Globe/WBZ-TV poll found that Bradley and Gore are  
running neck and neck in New Hampshire. Among 400 likely Democratic 
primary voters, Gore led Bradley, the former New Jersey senator, by 
40 percent to 36 percent, the Globe reported Sunday. That amounts 
to a statistical dead heat because it falls within the poll's 
margin of error of 5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been occasional tensions between the White House and  
labor, mainly over trade issues, and Gore has devoted heavy 
attention to court labor and block Bradley from gaining ground with 
that key Democratic group. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sweeping through the state in a two-day swing touching  
areas of the state where labor has a high presence. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, he picked up the endorsement of Secretary of State  
Chet Culver, also with solid labor ties. 
</P>
<P>
	At his stops, Gore hammered hard at labor themes, pledging to  
``close the loopholes'' that have shifted the balance of power 
against the nation's workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore vowed to push for laws preventing striking workers from  
being replaced and demanded another increase in the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always believed we need to close the loopholes that  
have allowed some of the union-busting tactics that began with the 
Reagan-Bush crowd,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	He warned against ``a concentration of power'' that is unhealthy  
for workers and said he'd bring balance to the workplace. As he 
worked to shore up labor backing, Gore also was moving ahead 
organizationally. 
</P>
<P>
	He is returning to the state next weekend to kick off a marathon  
round of organizational meetings in all of Iowa's 99 counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he was looking to head off Bradley, the public rhetoric  
centered around Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The words 'outrage' and ``Republican'' kind of go together  
when you talk about risky tax schemes,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some polls show Gore faring poorly against potential Republican  
opponents, but he said there's a campaign ahead that will allow him 
to make a case that voters will buy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The struggle for the future of this country is a marathon, not  
a sprint,'' Gore said. ``We've always found it within us to make 
the right choices.''

<HEADLINE> Movie Industry Sets Summer Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- At a time when the Internet, video rentals  
and cable and satellite television offer plenty of diversions, 
movie theaters were still as popular as ever this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	From Memorial Day weekend to Labor Day, the take at U.S.  
theaters was estimated at just less than $3 billion, shattering the 
previous high of $2.6 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong summer showing has helped push ticket sales for the  
year up 6 percent over last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a culture that likes to get out of the house,'' said  
Tom Sherak, head of distribution for 20th Century Fox. ``We like to 
get away from our problems. Movies give us the opportunity for two 
hours to get out and get away and just let go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A record 11 movies have taken in more than $100 million each,  
and a 12th is expected to join the club. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer's films also have had staying power. In summer 1998,  
movies on average took in 27 percent of their total gross in the 
opening weekend, said Wayne Lewellen, distribution president for 
Paramount. This summer, that average was down to 24 percent, 
indicating films are lasting longer in theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only were the films good enough to keep moviegoers going  
back for more, but blistering heat over much of the nation also 
helped send people to air-conditioned theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	The season started with a bang. ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The  
Phantom Menace'' opened May 19 and became the fastest movie ever to 
gross $100 million, hitting that in five days. The 20th Century Fox 
release has taken in about $420 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks before ``Phantom Menace,'' audiences got a preseason  
warmup with Universal's ``The Mummy,'' an unexpected horror smash. 
And over Memorial Day weekend, Universal slipped in ``Notting 
Hill,'' the Julia Roberts-Hugh Grant romance. 
</P>
<P>
	``'Star Wars' didn't scare us off,'' said Nikki Rocco, head of  
distribution for Universal. ``We knew we had two big hits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bookending those movies around ``Phantom Menace'' paid off for  
Universal. ``Mummy'' kept going to gross $155 million and ``Notting 
Hill'' collected $115 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Then things got crowded. Between ``Phantom Menace'' and current  
box-office champ ``The Sixth Sense'' came a rare period when a 
different movie opened atop the box office in each of nine straight 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so competitive that no matter how good you were, you  
got knocked out the next weekend by another movie,'' said Paul 
Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which 
tracks movie attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phantom Menace'' was followed by New Line's ``Austin Powers:  
The Spy Who Shagged Me.'' The Mike Myers spy spoof has grossed 
about $205 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The string of high-grossing wonders also included ``Tarzan,''  
``Big Daddy,'' ``Wild, Wild West,'' ``The General's Daughter,'' and 
``Runaway Bride,'' Roberts' second comedy of the summer to top $100 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The usual late-summer doldrums, when movie attendance usually  
trails off, never materialized, largely because of ``Sixth Sense'' 
and the surprise hit ``The Blair Witch Project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The low-budget ``Blair Witch'' is on track to gross about $140  
million. ``Sixth Sense,'' about a boy who communicates with the 
dead, has been No. 1 the last four weekends and should finish well 
above $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The bawdy teen comedy ``American Pie'' also topped the box  
office in July and should pass $100 million this fall, making it 
the 12th summer film to hit that mark. 
</P>
<P>
	There's still a solid slate of films for fall and the holidays,  
and 1999 could break the full-year record of $6.95 billion set last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let the fall begin,'' said Fox's Sherak.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Activists Protest Hyundai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Dozens of civic activists staged a  
boisterous demonstration Monday, denouncing the nation's largest 
conglomerate for allegedly diverting company funds to manipulate 
stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The founder and owner of the Hyundai conglomerate is Chung  
Ju-yung. His sons control most key Hyundai subsidiaries, which 
produce cars, ships and semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Arrest the Chung family,'' protesters shouted through  
bullhorns in front of the main Hyundai building in Seoul. They 
carried placards and pickets denouncing the alleged stock price 
manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
	One Hyundai executive was arrested and nine others were barred  
from leaving the country last week pending investigation of what 
prosecutors said is the largest stock price manipulation scheme in 
South Korean history. 
</P>
<P>
	In the alleged scheme last year, at least two Hyundai affiliates  
illegally diverted $183 million in company funds to boost the stock 
price of Hyundai Electronic Co. from $12.30 per share to $26.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Local media, quoting unidentified prosecution sources, said  
Hyundai made at least $416 million off the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, prosecutors questioned Kim Hyong-byuk, head of  
Hyundai Heavy Industry Co., a unit of the Hyundai group, for 
alleged involvement. His company allegedly diverted $157 million in 
company funds for the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say the alleged mastermind is Lee Ik-chi, head of  
Hyundai Securities Co. Lee was scheduled to appear before 
prosecutors Tuesday for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Civic groups believe the scheme could not have been possible  
without direct or tacit approval from the group's owners, the Chung 
family. However, so far there is no evidence against the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock price manipulation is punishable by a prison term of up to  
10 years or a fine of up to three times the profit gained. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea's conglomerates, including Hyundai, are being pushed  
by the government to restructure by shedding money-losing 
subsidiaries, thus lowering debt burdens.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andre Agassi is on a roll.  
</P>
<P>
	Seeded No. 2 in the men's singles, Agassi reached the  
quarterfinals at the U.S. Open on Monday by defeating Arnaud 
Clement of France 6-4, 6-4, 6-3. He has lost just one set in the 
year's final Grand Slam tournament, to Justin Gimelstob in a 
third-round match. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi has had his serve broken only once in his last 41 service  
games and has held serve in his current nine-match winning streak 
97 of his last 100 games. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SOMETHING IN COMMON:* Yevgeny Kafelnikov is Russia's No. 1  
player. His coach, Larry Stefanki, is American. 
</P>
<P>
	So, how is an American coach different from a Russian coach,  
Kafelnikov was asked Monday? 
</P>
<P>
	``Larry has a Russian background,'' Kafelnikov said, revealing a  
little-known fact about Stefanki, a former player. ``His 
grandfather is from Ukraine. I understand him, he understands me. 
It works on that basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WINNERS AND LOSERS:* When seventh-seeded Serena Williams  
defeated No. 16 Conchita Martinez 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 in a fourth-round 
match Monday, her numbers were somewhat staggering. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams had 12 aces while serving at only 57 percent. Martinez  
was successful on 75 percent of her first serves. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams had 52 unforced errors to just 25 for her Spanish  
opponent, but made up for it with 45 winners. Martinez had just 
seven winners. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RECORD-BREAKER:* When Frenchman Nicolas Escude upset  
10th-seeded Marcelo Rios, he became the first qualifier to reach 
the quarterfinals at the U.S. Open in the Open era. He had been the 
ninth man to reach the fourth round as a qualifier, following 
Tiemuraz Kakulia in 1976; Robert Green, 1984; Jaime Yzaga, 1985; 
Gary Donnelly, 1986; Mark Woodforde, 1987; Martin Laurendeau, 1988; 
Paul Haarhuis, 1989; and Gianluca Pozzi, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FAST LIFE:* Serena Williams will turn 18 later this month, but  
figures she is not part of the ``next generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if she thought younger players will develop a  
serve-and-volley game, Williams said ``maybe the next generation is 
going to bring it back, incorporate it more into the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She explained further.  
</P>
<P>
	``I mean younger girls. I can't stick around too long. It's  
always going to be someone else's turn. This is my turn now. The 
next generation ... it's just going to be their turn soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SERVING IT UP:* Serena Williams took over the Chase ace race  
Monday when she had 12 in her 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 fourth-round victory 
over Conchita Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	That gave Williams 27 aces for the tournament, putting her ahead  
of Irina Spirlea, who hit 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chase Manhattan Bank is donating $50 for every ace served  
during women's singles matches at this year's U.S. Open to fund the 
Chase Tennis Camp for Girls, the first free citywide program 
established in New York to help develop the skills of talented 
female players, ages 10-16. More than 150 girls will participate in 
the Sept. 18-Oct. 23 program, and they will be recognized at the 
season-ending Chase Championships of the WTA Tour, which will be 
held Nov. 15-21 at New York's Madison Square Garden.

<HEADLINE> Schools Begin 'Student Profiling' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALLINGFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Much like the FBI developing  
psychological profiles to track terrorists and serial killers, 
school psychologists are putting together checklists of 
characteristics common among students prone to violence. 
</P>
<P>
	With the pain of the deadly shootings at Columbine High School  
in Littleton, Colo., still fresh, Wallingford Superintendent of 
Schools Joseph Cirasuolo said he would be remiss not to adopt 
``student profiling'' in his district of 7,000 pupils. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our purpose in doing that is to intervene well before they  
ever decide to go out and buy a gun and do some damage,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The profile of a potentially violent student will be given to  
staff throughout the district's 12 schools. If someone fits the 
description, the student's parents will be notified, Cirasuolo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intervene early if we think a youngster has reading  
problems. We intervene early if we think a youngster has adjustment 
problems and matters of that type,'' he said. ``So why shouldn't we 
intervene early if we think a youngster may be prone to violence?'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are similar efforts across the country. In Granite City,  
Ill., school administrators are measuring students against a 
behavior checklist that includes abusive language, cruelty to 
animals and writings reflecting an interest in ``the dark side of 
life.'' Students who fit the profile can undergo counseling, be 
transferred to an alternative education program or even be 
expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics call ``student profiling'' an overreaction to the rash  
of school shootings, including the Columbine attack in which 15 
people died. They fear that children who do not reflect an image of 
the perfect student could be unfairly labeled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Different doesn't mean dangerous,'' said American Civil  
Liberties Union spokeswoman Emily Whitfield. ``Not only are 
students being unfairly targeted but, in some cases, there's not a 
whole lot of thought going into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, there is increasing demand from school districts  
for training on warning signs. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents led conferences on school violence recently in  
Hamden, Conn., and Lansing, Mich., instructing teachers on 
behavioral science and psychological profiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Blauvelt, president of the National Alliance for Safe  
Schools in Slanesville, W.Va., said he has spent the summer 
crisscrossing the country, giving workshops in schools from Georgia 
to Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't call it panic, but people are saying, 'Look we  
realize that we are not prepared to deal with a major crisis and we 
need to be prepared,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are plenty of character checklists for teachers to draw  
from. The National School Safety Center in Westlake Village, 
Calif., has created a list of 20 warning signs. The American 
Psychological Association and MTV produced a guide called, 
``Warning Signs.'' In ``The Memphis Conference: Suggestions for 
Preventing and Dealing with Student Initiated Violence,'' 
criminologist William Reisman lists 50 telltale indicators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Metal detectors, video cameras -- all the equipment creates a  
false sense of security,'' Reisman said. ``The problem is the heart 
and mind of the kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One publication widely read by school administrators this summer  
was ``Early Warning, Timely Response: A Guide to Safe Schools.'' 
The guide from the National Association of School Psychologists, 
the U.S. Department of Education and other agencies was 
commissioned by President Clinton last year and distributed to 
schools nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The guide has 16 features that may distinguish violence-prone  
children, including social withdrawal, feelings of rejection, and 
poor academic performance. But association spokeswoman Elizabeth 
Kuffner warned that the guide should not be used to predict which 
students will go on a rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Definitely there are warning signs. Definitely there are  
things to look for. But to just say a kid fits this profile, we 
don't think is a good idea,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed higher Monday  
on the back of last week's surge on Wall Street as fears eased 
about another rise in U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the trend was the Jakarta Stock Exchange, where the key  
index slumped more than 4 percent because of mounting violence in 
East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Indonesia shares opened higher in reaction to Friday's  
gains on Wall Street, dealers said sentiment turned negative later 
as foreign investors began selling stocks on concerns over rising 
violence in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta market's Composite Index slumped 4.4 percent, or  
24.769 points, to 540.427. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the blue chip Hang Index rose 206.85 points, or  
1.6 percent, closing at 13,385.16. On Friday, the index had lost 
189.25 points, or 1.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said the Hong Kong market was boosted by the strong  
performance on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average 
surged 235.24 points to close at 11,078.45, a rise of 2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq rose 108.34 to 2,842.58, surpassing the previous high  
for a one-day point gain, 103.16, set on June 16. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Stocks surged after the Labor Department reported that  
employers added 124,000 jobs to their payrolls in August, fewer 
than most economists had expected. The figures eased about rising 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose  
126.52 points, or 0.72 percent, to end the day's trade at 
17,756.51. On Friday, the average closed down 1.26 points, or 0.01 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders in Tokyo said investors were also awaiting the release  
of Japan's April-June gross domestic product data on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a serious shrinkage in GDP, Japan's second  
supplementary budget will expand,'' and that will help stocks, said 
Tsuyosi Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities. He added he 
doesn't expect the data to be very bad. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 109.62 yen  
late Monday, down 0.12 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and below its 
late New York level of 110.05 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean shares closed sharply higher on the back of Wall  
Street's gains. The main Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 
32.60 points, or 3.6 percent, to 943.22. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher, boosted by the rise in  
technology stocks. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index rose 
65.17 points, or 0.8 percent, to 8,130.28. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher in line with  
regional markets. The benchmark NZSE-40 Captial Index rose 11.56 
points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,150.32. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher on a sharply  
lower-than-expected local inflation rate for August and on Wall 
Street's strong gains over the weekend. The 30-company Philippine 
Stock Exchange Index rose 13.38 points, or 0.6 percent, to 
2,168.47. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher across most  
sectors on Friday's strong gains in the United States and some 
renewed buying after the market had succumbed to profit-taking for 
most of last week. The All Ordinaries Index closed at 2990.1, up 
27.7 points, or 0.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mixed. The benchmark Straits  
Times Index rose 6.6 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,099.78. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed higher on  
bargain-hunting. The Composite Index, which tracks 100 blue-chip 
stocks, rose 7.46 percent, or 1.0 percent, to 752.78. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai stock prices closed lower. The Stock Exchange of  
Thailand index fell 7.04 points, or 1.63 percent, to 424.08.

<HEADLINE> Dennis Moves to Virginia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELHAVEN, N.C. (AP) -- As coastal residents began to repair the  
storm damage, rainfall from the remnants of Dennis drifted 
northward across Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Flood watches were in effect today for parts of Virginia,  
Maryland and West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle from the storm, by 
now a tropical depression. A flash flood watch for parts of North 
Carolina's northeast Piedmont and coastal plain was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	As of this morning, the Raleigh-Durham area had gotten 7.4  
inches of inches of rain in two days. In southeastern Virginia, a 
tornado struck the town of Hampton during the weekend, causing an 
estimated $7.2 million in damage and slightly injuring a dozen 
people 
</P>
<P>
	With the storm centered over Virginia, the last of the rain was  
expected to be out of North Carolina by tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some very dry areas, some areas in desperate need of  
rain,'' Highway Patrol Sgt. Jeff Winstead of the state's emergency 
response team told The Charlotte Observer in today's editions. 
``Still, I don't think torrential rain is really what people were 
hoping for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis spread about 2 inches of rain over drought-stricken New  
Jersey during the weekend and more showers were forecast today and 
Tuesday. However, reservoirs were still about 10 percent below 
normal and no water restrictions had been lifted, Loretta 
O'Donnell, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental 
Protection, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting into a drought takes a while and leaving a drought  
takes a while, too,'' said Jim Poirier, a meteorologist with the 
National Weather Service in Mount Holly. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Carolina Highway Patrol said five people died in  
accidents on rain-slickened roads over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Pamlico County, several caskets had washed out of private  
cemeteries and propane gas tanks had floated around the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have numerous propane tanks all over the place,'' said Tim  
Harvey, the county's emergency management coordinator. ``If you 
want to barbecue, this is the place to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Formed Aug. 24, Dennis skirted North Carolina's coast Aug. 30,  
went seaward 165 miles, stalled and then backtracked. All week 
long, it assailed North Carolina's coast with 14-foot waves and 
gale-force wind as forecasters tried to guess where it would go 
next. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time that I remember that a hurricane hit us  
directly and then turned around and came back and hit us again,'' 
said Henry ``Farmer'' Styron. ``It was a double whammy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Styron is among the residents of Cedar Island, which was  
sideswiped by Dennis on its way up the coast and clobbered again 
Saturday when its eye passed directly overhead. About 100 homes and 
businesses were flooded on Cedar Island, northeast of Morehead 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatteras Island's main road, N.C. 12, was reopened Sunday after  
thundering surf ripped out some sections of road and buried others 
under drifted beach sand. But only four-wheel-drive vehicles were 
permitted on the southern end of the island, where state highway 
crews spent Sunday laying a new asphalt road. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said tourists would not be allowed back on Hatteras  
Island before Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatteras' neighbor, Ocracoke Island and its 700 residents, also  
suffered through a week with Dennis. Much of the island lay 
underwater Sunday, and the only ferry service was to bring 
emergency workers and supplies from the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	Flooded streets were nothing new in Belhaven, where nearly 6  
feet of water surged from nearby creeks into the community of 2,400 
that lies 6 feet above sea level on the Pungo River. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had five storms in the last four years that have hit  
us,'' Town Manager Tim Johnson said Sunday. ``And we thought we had 
finally missed one. But darned if it didn't come back and get us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Bonnie sent water into Belhaven homes last year.  
Afterward, the federal government announced it would pay to elevate 
379 homes so they wouldn't be out of the flood plain. The project 
hasn't been completed yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been demoralizing to be flooded this often,'' Johnson  
said. ``People here expect to experience hurricanes. But this is a 
bit much for anyone to stomach.''

<HEADLINE> British Olympian Cleared of Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Linford Christie, the 1992 Olympic 100-meter  
champion, was cleared Monday of drug charges by British track 
authorities, but he still must await a final ruling by track and 
field's world governing body. 
</P>
<P>
	The UK Athletics panel ruled it ``could not be proved beyond  
reasonable doubt'' that Christie used prohibited substances despite 
traces of the steroid Nandrolone showing in a urine sample he gave 
after a meet in Germany in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie, who admitted to being ``bitter'' about the charges,  
said he was delighted at being ``totally exonerated by the 
disciplinary committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always confident of this outcome having maintained from  
the outset that I had done nothing wrong,'' he said in a statement. 
``I am relieved that the disciplinary committee in their findings 
has shown that they totally support me in this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the International Amateur Athletic Federation will consider  
the findings of the UK Athletics investigation before deciding 
whether to take action against the 39-year-old sprinter. 
</P>
<P>
	The UK Athletics panel consisted of the same three members who  
cleared European 200-meter champion Doug Walker of a similar charge 
in July. The Walker decision was subsequently rejected by the IAAF 
and has been sent to an arbitration panel. 
</P>
<P>
	IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said each case is treated  
individually. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not automatic,'' he said of the decision to send a case  
to arbitration. The doping commission will review (the UK 
Athletics' findings) and decide ... whether to recommend to the 
Council to send Christie's case to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot jump to conclusions. Maybe Christie brought to the  
attention of the panel (in London) some element we don't know 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, UK Athletics -- the national governing body --  
said the disciplinary committee ``has unanimously decided to 
dismiss the disciplinary proceedings'' and lifted Christie's 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``The disciplinary committee concluded that it could not be  
proven beyond reasonable doubt that the substance present in the 
sample was derived from a prohibited substance,'' the statement 
said. ``Linford Christie has therefore been cleared of all 
charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri said the case was unusual because Christie is basically  
retired. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand that this has an impact on (Christie's)  
reputation -- he's been a great champion,'' he said. ``He's not just 
a champion in Britain, he's been a champion of the world. This is 
very important for him and for the IAAF.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christie, who runs for fun and coaching some British sprinters,  
was suspended after testing positive for Nandrolone after an indoor 
meet in Dortmund, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong anti-drug campaigner, Christie declared his innocence  
when the result of his test was announced Aug. 4 and vowed to clear 
his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie said the testing for Nandrolone was ``flawed.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The IAAF ... should halt all Nandrolone positives until they  
can actually say, `Yes, the testing is reliable, ' '' he said.

use in the nation's commercial sex outlets. Health officials said 
an estimated 100 Cambodians catch the deadly virus each day -- the 
highest infection rate in Asia. Police enforcement of mandatory 
condom-use in brothels has proved in testing to effectively shut 
down Cambodia's most common route of infection, health officials 
said. The sex trade is considered the main link in the spread of 
HIV, with almost half of the country's 20,000 sex workers believed 
to be infected with the killer virus.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One employee out of six reports being so  
angered by a co-worker in the past year that he or she felt like 
hitting the person -- but didn't, a new poll finds. Workers under 
age 35 and those in clerical, office and sales jobs were the most

	BELHAVEN, N.C. (AP) -- The storm called Dennis is finally leaving  
North Carolina after almost two weeks, but in its wake left some 
flood damage and traffic deaths. The National Weather Service says 
Dennis, which twice gained hurricane strength, dumped as much as 
six inches of rain on some areas of North Carolina. Police said 
five people died in traffic accidents on rain-slickened roads.

	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Pro-Indonesian militiamen set fire to the  
home of an East Timorese Nobel Peace laureate today, and the heads 
of victims were reportedly displayed on sticks outside the capital 
in a rampage following the territory's vote for independence. Days 
of rioting prompted tens of thousands to flee East Timor, and 
Australia launched an airlift to evacuate 200 U.N. elections 
officials from the island. A top U.N. envoy met in Jakarta with the 
Indonesian president amid accusations that Indonesian security 
forces were doing nothing to halt the bloodshed.

	Reports: GM Offers Lifetime Jobs  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- General Motors has reportedly offered a  
guarantee of lifetime employment to many employees as part of 
negotiations over a new contract with the United Automobile Workers 
union. The union's three-year contracts with the major automakers 
are due to expire Sept. 14. Under the existing contracts, workers 
effectively have lifetime employment because the terms bar 
automakers from allowing employment to fall by more than 5 percent 
nationally or in any of a dozen regions. The company's proposal is 
aimed at addressing workers' job security fears while allowing GM 
to reduce overall employment more rapidly, The New York Times 
reported today.

Strawberry, who rejoined the team four games ago after a 113-day 
drug suspension, also had an RBI double. Rookie Ed Yarnall won his 
first major league start for the Yanks.

<HEADLINE> Plummer Takes Shot at Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Quarterback Jake Plummer, whose sprained  
right thumb makes him still uncertain for Sunday's season opener at 
Philadelphia, went after the Arizona Cardinals' management Monday 
for its failure to reach a contract agreement with wide receiver 
Rob Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until someone upstairs realizes how important Rob Moore is to  
this whole offense and this season, we're going to have to learn to 
play without him,'' Plummer said. ``Hopefully, they'll realize that 
he's a game-breaker and a guy we have to have out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore has been at odds with the Arizona ownership since he was  
designated the team's franchise player in the off-season. The two 
sides reportedly have agreed to an annual salary of $5 million, but 
Moore wants a four-year deal and the Cardinals want three years. 
Moore also wants a bigger signing bonus than the team is willing to 
give. 
</P>
<P>
	Owner Bill Bidwill, when told of Plummer's remarks, said he  
thinks Moore ``is important, and we're trying to get him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer noted that last fall, when he signed a four-year, $29.7  
million contract extension, he emphasized that he was only part of 
the solution and was counting on the Cardinals to sign other 
important players. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has talked with members of the Cardinals' front  
office about the importance of signing Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team wants him here. We all want him in here,'' Plummer  
said. ``We can't negotiate Rob Moore's deal. If I could, I'd have 
him signed about six months ago. It's a thing I have no control 
over. It's up to the people upstairs that they make the move and 
get that deal done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without Moore, the only experienced wide receiver on the Arizona  
roster is Frank Sanders, who sprained his ankle in last Friday 
night's preseason finale against Oakland. Sanders said the injury 
is not serious and he should be at full speed by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore is one of three Cardinals still holding out in contract  
squabbles. The others are defensive tackle Mark Smith and rookie 
offensive tackle L.J. Shelton, the team's second first-round draft 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer said he has talked with Moore.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's frustrated. He wants to play,'' Plummer said. ``He's not  
the player who's going to mouth off and cuss this guy out. He's 
more a guy who's going to bite his tongue and hope things get taken 
care of. I hope it ends up not hurting him and I hope it ends up 
not hurting the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer took snaps during practice Monday for the first time  
since he sprained the thumb on his throwing hand against Tennessee 
Aug. 20. He was careful not to promise that he would be able to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plan on playing, but I don't want to go out there and force  
it, or reinjure it or not be able to throw the ball effectively,'' 
he said. ``I can hand the ball off all day, but I've got to be able 
to throw that deep ball, the out routes, the comebacks and all that 
sort of thing without losing any velocity on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Vince Tobin said he was encouraged by what Plummer was  
able to do in practice. Tobin said he will have to wait until later 
in the week to see how the thumb feels after the increased 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can play and not increase your chance of reinjuring  
yourself, then I think you play,'' Tobin said. ``If there is a 
chance you're going to set your progress back, then it doesn't make 
sense to play.''

<HEADLINE> Fisher Book Upsets Liz Taylor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eddie Fisher's tell-all book about his  
marriages to Elizabeth Taylor, Debbie Reynolds and Connie Stevens 
is out in bookstores, and Miss Taylor is not pleased. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Eddie Fisher must have been in another world when he  
wrote his book,'' she said in a statement released Saturday. ``Have 
you ever noticed that he is the only ex-husband I don't talk 
about?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Been There, Done That,'' was released last week and is billed  
as an ``insider tale of two decades of American pop culture and 
celebrity royalty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher wrote the book, published by St. Martin's Press, with  
celebrity profiler David Fisher, who is unrelated to the 
71-year-old singer. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he never thought of having a ``love affair'' with Miss  
Taylor, and only became intimate with her after she requested he 
visit her early one morning following the death of her husband, 
producer Mike Todd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw her as a beautiful, desirable woman. She was my  
best friend's widow, she was my friend,'' he wrote in the book. ``I 
assumed she wanted to talk about Mike. Which demonstrates how 
little I understood women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Taylor suggested that Fisher concocted stories about her in  
his book. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't seem to get his name out of my mouth, but I would  
never make up stories about him. I wouldn't have to,'' she said. 
``But I do hope he gets better.''

<HEADLINE> Not All Is Rosy on Labor Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Charles Goldman has a Labor Day wish: He won't  
be told, every time he turns on the television or picks up a 
newspaper, about how there's a good job for everyone in the 
miraculous 1990s economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Phoenix resident has been looking for full-time  
work as a mechanical engineer since he got his degree in 1995. It's 
not that he can't find work. Goldman toils on and off as a 
telemarketer or selling computer equipment. But those jobs are part 
time, lack benefits, and don't make use of his hard-earned 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very frustrated,'' said Goldman.  
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturing industry, where Goldman's education would be  
most relevant, is a dark spot in today's bright economy, losing 
nearly 1 million jobs in the past decade. No one seems to want to 
help the inexperienced young engineer make a start. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could maybe train and help us along a little bit,''  
wishes Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, the booming construction industry, which has added  
more than a million jobs since 1989, is rolling out the red carpet 
for inexperienced job seekers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Edgington, president of Edgewel Electric Inc. in Des  
Moines, Iowa, is investing in a new on-site training program, using 
computer CD-ROMs, in order to widen the pool of potential workers 
he can recruit from and get them trained more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can look at a lesser qualified, but capable person,'' said  
Edgington. ``We need people to get into this field and get 
trained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With unemployment at a 29-year low, work is relatively easy to  
find this Labor Day, but the U.S. job market is hardly a placid 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	For workers, times are tumultuous, with the significant  
transition under way in the mix of jobs available, skills required 
and benefits offered. For some, it has meant opportunity; for 
others frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the U.S. economy generated more than 21 million  
non-farm jobs between July 1989 and July 1999, according to the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest job gains have been in the service sector, with more  
than 12 million employees added. There are also more than 4 million 
more Americans working in retail and wholesale jobs. Jobs in 
finance, insurance and real estate have grown by nearly 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Job losses during the 10-year period have been confined mainly  
to manufacturing and mining. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department estimates that about three-quarters of the  
jobs created since President Clinton took office in 1993 pay more 
than $11 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are not low-wage, low-skill jobs,'' said Labor Secretary  
Alexis Herman. ``You've got good jobs being created at the high end 
of the wage scale, but the critical factor here is skills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the future, the Labor Department predicts that many of the  
fastest-growing jobs will require, if not a college degree, at 
least some special training. These include computer engineers, 
database administrators, desktop publishers, medical assistants, 
and securities and financial sales people. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor leaders, however, worry that those without education and  
training will be worse off as traditionally unionized manufacturing 
jobs, with high pay and good benefits, dry up. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobs on the low-skill end that are expected to be among the  
most plentiful in coming years? Cashiers and retail sales positions 
that pay an average of less than $300 a week -- below the poverty 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	Those in the market now for jobs, especially young people, are  
encountering other disquieting trends, says AFL-CIO president John 
Sweeney, who believes a growing malaise will boost union membership 
in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Young workers see fundamental inequities that education alone  
won't solve,'' Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among these is erosion in benefits offered by employers. Recent  
studies show: 
</P>
<P>
	--The percentage of workers with a high school diploma who are  
covered by employer-sponsored health insurance fell from 72 percent 
in 1989 to 69.5 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	--Overall, the annual growth in what employers spend on employee  
benefits has slowed during the 1990s to 4.2 percent from 8 percent 
in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	--Meanwhile, pay for top executives, including stock options, has  
more than quadrupled since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Another concern is that nontraditional work arrangements, such  
as temping and independent contractor status, are beginning to 
raise serious questions about who is legally responsible for the 
fair treatment of a growing number of workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the business community, however, bristle at any  
suggestion that American workers are worse off. They note that 
wages have grown at about the same rate as productivity during the 
1990s and in the past few years wages have been rising faster than 
inflation, $612 billion is spent annually on employee benefits and 
jobs are plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
	Says Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber  
of Commerce: ``The most frequent sign seen these days is 'Help 
Wanted.'''

<HEADLINE> No. 25 Arizona St. 31, Texas Tech 13 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- J.R. Redmond ran for 157 yards and two  
touchdowns and was the decoy to spring Delvon Flowers on a 40-yard 
scoring reverse that helped No. 25 Arizona State beat Texas Tech 
31-13 in the first Monday night game for either team. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond won the duel of touted tailbacks handily, piling up more  
yardage on a 56-yard scoring run 23 seconds into the second quarter 
than Red Raiders counterpart Ricky Williams had in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the top returning rusher in the Big 12 Conference,  
sprained his left knee twice in the third quarter. The second time, 
he was carried off the field after gaining a career-low 33 yards on 
13 carries and scoring on a 1-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' TD gave the Red Raiders a 7-0 lead 3:18 into the game.  
</P>
<P>
	The Sun Devils played the last three quarters without  
quarterback Ryan Kealy, who sprained his right knee dropping back 
to pass late in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	But they compensated with sophomore John Leonard, who was  
7-of-17 for 117 yards, big defensive plays, including five sacks, 
and Redmond, who also had a 3-yard scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Baker kicked field goals of 40, 35 and 34 yards to help  
deny Red Raiders coach Spike Dykes his 77th win, which would have 
made him the winningest coach in school history. Dykes record 
dropped to 0-6 in road openers against ranked teams since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Flowers' TD broke the Red Raiders' back 2:57 into the third  
quarter. Redmond ran to his right, then handed off to Flowers 
running left for a sprint to the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bruce Snyder opted for a 2-point conversion, and Leonard  
passed to Tariq McDonald to make it 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
	The next two Sun Devils scores came after spectacular catches by  
Todd Heap, who threw off the coverage by pulling up for a 41-yard, 
over-the-shoulder grab at the Tech 3-yard line that set up 
Redmond's second TD with 8:49 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes later, Heap pulled in a 22-yard throw from Leonard that  
led to Baker's last field goal and a 31-7 lead with 4:34 remaining 
in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Tech scored on defense in the fourth, when Leonard lost the ball  
and defensive end Aaron Hunt returned it 53 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams scored after Arizona State's Nick Murphy fanned on a  
punt and was charged with a fumble. Although the Sun Devils covered 
the ball, they lost it on downs. 
</P>
<P>
	After a Texas Tech penalty, Rob Peters threw a 37-yard strike to  
Derek Dorris at the 1. 
</P>
<P>
	It took two big plays by Arizona State safety Willie Daniel to  
keep the Sun Devils from falling farther behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Three plays after Peters took the Raiders to the Arizona State 9  
with a 55-yard scramble, Daniel jolted the ball loose from Dorris 
after a catch, and Al Williams recovered on the 1-yard line with 
6:19 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	And, on the first play of the second quarter, Daniel had a  
17-yard interception return that put Arizona State in position for 
Redmond's long run to tie it 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond ran 10 yards before hitting Tech safety Kevin Curtis.  
Linebacker Reagan Bownds moved over to help, but only knocked 
Curtis off Redmond, who kept his feet and outran the rest of the 
secondary.

<HEADLINE> Norway's Shipbuilders Stage Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- More than 20,000 workers staged a spot  
strike Monday to draw attention to troubles in Norway's shipyard 
industry that they fear could cost thousands of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The shipyards, which build both vessels and offshore oil  
platforms, have been hit by slowdowns in both the oil and shipping 
industries.As many as 4,000 people have already been laid off, and 
the industry fears that 15,000-25,000 jobs could disappear in all. 
</P>
<P>
	About 12,000 shipyard workers and 10,000 oil industry employees  
staged a one-hour protest Monday in hopes of pressing the 
government to take steps to stimulate the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The supply industry is already in a crisis, and steps are  
being taken too late to save large portions of the industry,'' the 
head of the Norwegian Oil and Petrochemical Workers Union, Lars 
Anders Myhre, was quoted as telling the Norwegian news agency NTB. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the government said it was considering measures that  
could include tax cuts for offshore oil projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The shipyards have been hit by a general slowdown. The yards  
specializing in offshore oil installations saw hopes of major 
contracts dwindle when companies postponed new projects as oil 
prices plunged to 12-year lows of about $10 per barrel last year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, prices have rebounded, and Norwegian unions said it was  
time for the government to push new projects.

<HEADLINE> Ill Jerry Lewis Hosts Telethon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jerry Lewis fought off double vision and  
headaches to host his annual Labor Day Telethon, singing ``Sitting 
on Top of the World'' but resting backstage much of the time before 
returning for Monday's finale. 
</P>
<P>
	``He experienced some double vision and his blood pressure  
spiked,'' said Jim Brown, a telethon spokesman. ``With the double 
vision he literally could not read the cue cards, and with a live 
broadcast it becomes impossible to continue when you can't read.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis appeared Sunday night for the first three hours of the  
event, which raised a record $53.1 million in pledges for the 
Muscular Dystrophy Association. He sang a duet with Martin Short 
and performed another solo. He returned Monday for the final four 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thrilled and grateful for the support of our viewers, and  
filled with hope that the dollars we've raised will translate into 
new research breakthroughs to help us conquer the muscle-wasting 
diseases,'' Lewis said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, 73, was hospitalized last month with viral meningitis.  
Two neurologists monitored his condition throughout the broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34th annual telethon was broadcast live on the Internet in  
English, Spanish and Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
	The telethon broke last year's mark of $51.6 million, and the  
final figure was expected to climb because many local stations 
extended their broadcast after the show's official end, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis has vowed to conduct the telethon each Labor Day until a  
cure is found for neuromuscular diseases, Brown said.

<HEADLINE> Book: Pope Pius XII Was Anti-Semitic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pope Pius XII's deep anti-Semitism contributed  
to his refusal to blatantly condemn Nazi atrocities during World 
War II, a new book says. 
</P>
<P>
	Among newly discovered documents cited by writer John Cornwell  
is a letter the pope wrote in 1919, when he was a Vatican diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter describes a group of revolutionary Jews in Munich,  
Germany, as ``a gang of young women of dubious appearance, Jews 
like all the rest of them, hanging around in all the offices with 
provocative demeanor and suggestive smiles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book, ``Hitler's Pope: The Secret History of Pius XII,'' is  
excerpted in the October issue of Vanity Fair. 
</P>
<P>
	Vatican officials contacted Monday wouldn't comment, saying they  
had not read the magazine story. 
</P>
<P>
	Pius XII has been criticized for failing to do more to help Jews  
during the war. The Vatican has consistently defended his conduct, 
claiming his behind-the-scenes work saved thousands of Jews. He has 
been praised for -- among other things -- ordering religious houses 
in Rome to hide Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornwell's sources include the pope's own files and depositions  
taken under oath 30 years ago to support his eventual canonization. 
Cornwell was given access to the secret Vatican archives because he 
initially set out to write a book vindicating the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornwell found that in 1942, envoys from Britain and the United  
States presented the pope with details about Nazi atrocities and 
asked him to condemn them. 
</P>
<P>
	But the strongest public denunciation the pope made during the  
war -- a Christmas Eve radio message in 1942 -- simply mourned the 
plight of ``hundreds of thousands who without any fault of their 
own, sometimes only by reason of their nationality or race, are 
marked down for death or gradual extinction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cornwell wrote that Pius XII knew 1,000 Jews from Rome were to  
be deported to the death camps in October 1943 but he did nothing 
to warn or save them. Only 15 of them survived the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornwell is the author of another controversial book about  
Vatican affairs, ``A Thief in the Night: The Death of Pope John 
Paul I.'' The book dispelled rumors that John Paul I was murdered 
by his own aides after serving for just 33 days in 1978.

	Indonesia Imposes Martial Law in E. Timor  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Stung by international criticism,  
President B.J. Habibie on Tuesday signed an order imposing martial 
law in East Timor. The Indonesian ruler's decision came as 
thousands of refugees fled Dili, the provincial capital, and 
anti-independence militias continued a wave of terror. World 
leaders urged Indonesia to make good on its pledge to provide 
security in Dili. But witnesses said Indonesian troops were aiding 
the militias and trying to intimidate journalists and U.N. workers 
into fleeing the territory.

	Teachers, Detroit Schools Reach Pact

<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit's public school teachers could return to  
the city's classrooms as early as Wednesday after they reached a 
deal today to end a six-day strike over reforms proposed by a new 
chief executive hired to fix the troubled district. The teachers 
struck in defiance of state law, and legislative leaders had said 
they would move to seek sanctions against the teachers tomorrow. 
The district's chief executive, David Adamany, had said lawmakers 
likely would invoke a 1994 law that bars strikes by teachers and 
fines them one day's pay for each day they strike.

	FALN Prisoners To Discuss Clemency  
</P>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Sixteen Puerto Ricans jailed on  
sedition and weapons convictions will hold a conference call 
Wednesday to decide whether to accept President Clinton's offer of 
clemency, supporters said today. The Puerto Rican Pro Human Rights 
Committee, which has led efforts to free the activists, said the 
prisoners would likely announce their decision before the deadline 
of 5 p.m. on Friday. The prisoners are members of the Armed Forces 
for National Liberation and the Macheteros, pro-independence groups 
that between 1974 and 1983 staged more than 130 bomb attacks in the 
United States. The attacks killed six people and injured dozens.

Taliban, who rule almost 90 percent of Afghanistan, including the

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A new book says Pope Pius XII's deep  
anti-Semitism contributed to his refusal to condemn Nazi atrocities 
during World War II. Author John Cornwell cites in the book a 
letter written by the pope in 1919 that describes a group of 
revolutionary Jews in Munich, Germany, as ``a gang of young women 
of dubious appearance, Jews like all the rest of them, hanging 
around in all the offices with provocative demeanor and suggestive 
smiles.'' The book, ``Hitler's Pope: The Secret History of Pius 
XII,'' is excerpted in the October issue of Vanity Fair.

including two doubles, helping the Indians bounced back from a 3-0

six innings. Dave Burba (13-7) allowed three runs, five hits and 
four walks in seven innings to win his fifth straight decision.

<HEADLINE> Arizona Replaces Four Starters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals claimed two wide  
receivers and two defensive tackles off the waiver wire Monday and 
released four players, including outside linebacker Tony McCombs, 
who started 13 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Also released were offensive lineman Allen Degraffenreid and  
wide receivers Tony Hamler and Chad Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals claimed wide receivers Mar Tay Jenkins, who had  
been cut by Dallas, and Mac Cody, who had been waived by St. Louis. 
They also picked up defensive tackles Corey Sears, who had been 
waived by St. Louis, and Angel Rubio, who was cut by San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenkins was the Cowboys' sixth-round pick this year out of  
Nebraska-Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, coach Vince Tobin announced he had replaced  
three starters for Sunday's season opener against the Philadelphia 
Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Hardy will start at tight end in place of Johnny  
McWilliams, Matt Joyce will start ahead of Anthony Clement at 
offensive left tackle and Zack Walz will be the right outside 
linebacker in place of Patrick Sapp. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Pittman moved ahead of Mario Bates as backup running  
back behind Adrian Murrell. Bates will remain the short-yardage 
running back and will return kickoffs. Pittman beat out rookie 
David Boston as the first-string punt returner. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin also welcomed offensive left guard Chris Dishman and right  
guard Lester Holmes back to practice on Monday. Dishman had been 
out since early in the training camp after undergoing arthroscopic 
surgery on his right elbow. Holmes is recovering from facial 
lacerations sustained in a car accident that crushed the right arm 
of teammate Ernest Dye. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyce, who had been playing guard in Dishman's absence, moves to  
tackle largely because Clement, who missed virtually all of his 
rookie season last year with back surgery, has had trouble doing 
his job with a broken bone in his left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin said he won't decide until after Thursday's practice  
whether Chris Jacke or Joe Nedney will be the kicker in Sunday's 
opener. The team took the unusual step of keeping both of them when 
the final roster cuts were announced Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Assassination Attempts Vs. Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak succeeded Anwar Sadat, who was  
assassinated by Jihad, an Islamic militant group, in 1981. Since 
then, several assassination attempts have reportedly been made on 
or plotted against Mubarak: 
</P>
<P>
	-- On Monday, a man identified as Said Hassan Suleiman, a clothes  
vendor, approached Mubarak's motorcade in the northern city of Port 
Said and grazed his arm with what appeared to be a knife. 
Presidential security guards killed Suleiman on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In December 1995, the Interior Ministry confirmed that the  
Jihad group had plotted to ram two explosives-rigged cars into 
Mubarak's car on his way to open a new parliament session that 
month. Police arrested 56 suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Testimony in the trial of Egyptian Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman in  
New York earlier in 1995 indicated there was a plot to assassinate 
Mubarak during a trip to the United States in 1993. The visit never 
took place. 
</P>
<P>
	-- On June 26, 1995 gunmen opened fire on Mubarak's motorcade in  
the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. Two Ethiopian policemen were 
killed and one was wounded. Relations with Sudan soured after Egypt 
and Ethiopia accused Sudan of having supported the assailants. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In November 1993, newspapers reported that security  
authorities headed off a plot to mine the airport at Sidi Barrani 
on the Mediterranean Sea before Mubarak stopped there en route to a 
meeting with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. The government 
confirmed only that there was an attempt on an important official. 
In 1994, two soldiers and a civilian were convicted and executed 
for the plot.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Co-Workers Want To Lash Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One employee out of six reports being so  
angered by a co-worker in the past year that he or she felt like 
hitting the person -- but didn't, a new poll finds. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers under age 35 and those in clerical, office and sales  
jobs were even more likely to feel like socking somebody, with 
about 22 percent in each of those groups admitting as much. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a serious problem for people who manage any of these  
groups. Their ability to recognize and deal with anger and 
potentially violent behavior is absolutely critical,'' said Frank 
Kenna, president of The Marlin Company, a North Haven, Conn., 
publisher of motivational, educational and safety materials for 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Marlin commissioned the telephone survey, focusing on workplace  
anger and stress, which was conducted July 6-27 by the Gallup 
Organization. Pollsters interviewed 750 full-time or part-time 
American workers aged 18 or over. The poll's margin of error was 
plus or minus 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has commissioned similar polls in past years.  
</P>
<P>
	This time, nearly half of respondents -- 49 percent -- said they  
generally are at least a little angry at work, compared to 42 
percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall stress levels among workers, however, are declining. In  
1999, 22 percent said they were extremely or quite stressed, 
compared to 25 percent in 1998 and 29 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The hitting question hasn't been asked since 1995, when 21  
percent of workers admitted to feeling like popping a co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
	High-tech office equipment seems to be contributing factor to  
worker stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two out of three workers -- 64 percent -- agreed at least  
somewhat that getting equipment such as computers, faxes and 
e-mail, to work properly is often frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
	That extra tension apparently pays off, however. Workers  
estimate that their colleagues spend an average of 75 minutes per 
day making personal use of company technology, including the phone, 
e-mail, the Internet and computer games.

<HEADLINE> Totally MAD Delivers 564 Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Next time you suspect someone of being an off-planet alien, ask  
them to identify the most famous saying of Alfred E. Neuman, and if 
they don't respond ``What -- me worry?'' call the cops. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuman, the gap-toothed, freckle-faced, redheaded mascot of MAD  
Magazine, may not worry, but he and every issue of MAD Magazine 
from 1952 to 1998 are now available on a set of CD-ROMs called 
Totally MAD, from Broderbund for PC-compatibles. 
</P>
<P>
	MAD Magazine was often the first form of rebellion for now-aging  
baby boomers; teachers and parents were offended by its twisted, 
satirical and gross humor. Which was precisely what made it a 
must-buy in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	But adolescent humor has staying power, and over the years the  
magazine has managed to remain forever 13 years old. And, the 
magazine says, it plays to a monthly readership of 1.2 million and 
is published in more than a dozen international editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-CD-ROM set contains 564 issues of the magazine. The  
user interface, not surprisingly, is a trash heap, created by an 
opening trash bin sequence. There's a search engine, animated 
cartoons and audio, as well as a video introduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Pumping through the various issues is a bit like leafing through  
a time capsule assembled by a committee of archivists all a hair 
off plumb. For those in their 50s, it's a nostalgia trip. For 
example, a satire of Dr. Ben Casey (hint, children: once a very 
popular medical drama) has bite only if you can remember when the 
show wasn't on past your bedtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything that was in the magazine is on the CD-ROM, including  
Spy vs. Spy by Antonio Prohias and the ``A MAD Look At...'' cartoon 
series by Sergio Aragones. 
</P>
<P>
	For all the satirical content, the user interface is nicely done  
and installation and setup are straightforward. That's to be 
expected from longtime software house Broderbund, which is now a 
unit of The Learning Company, which, in turn, is a division of 
Mattel, Inc. A software archive of warped humor coming from the 
same corporate parent as Barbie is a situation that probably should 
be explored in an upcoming issue of the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	All the content is printable, which makes it good fodder for  
refrigerator cartoons almost guaranteed to offend spouses, grown-up 
children and other uptight authority figures. 
</P>
<P>
	You can get a good idea of what's in store just by reading the  
system requirements on the software box: 
</P>
<P>
	``To run this program properly you should have a computer. (Our  
technical research shows that a working one is preferred.) Your 
computer should also have one of those little slide-out 'snack 
trays.' Take the snack out and put in one of the small round CD-ROM 
things that are in this package. 
</P>
<P>
	``Windows CD-ROM or NT 4.0 CD-ROM. (Windows with curtains and  
blinds are optional.) 
</P>
<P>
	``Pentium 90Mhz or higher. (Any slower and you'll be dead by  
the time you get to reading issue 245.) 
</P>
<P>
	``32 MB RAM, 30 MB hard-disk space, 2 byte soft chewy center.  
</P>
<P>
	``9'' shelf storage space for the box.  
</P>
<P>
	``SVGA graphics card and monitor, 256 colors minimum. (Warning:  
Colors may run if washed.) 
</P>
<P>
	``2x CD-ROM drive. (Use faster CD-ROM if you're in a hurry!)  
</P>
<P>
	``8-bit sound card to hear great audio ruined by your crappy  
2-bit computer speakers! 
</P>
<P>
	`` Mouse (or IBM-compatible chipmunk).  
</P>
<P>
	``OPTIONAL:   	
</P>
<P>
	``A chilled beverage.  
</P>
<P>
	``Fuzzy slippers.''  
</P>
<P>
	The only thing not to like about Totally MAD is the price, a  
stiff $69.95. If you're willing to pay it, Broderbund products are 
widely available at software outlets. If you live miles from 
anywhere you can also call Broderbund at (888) 829-3343.

<HEADLINE> States May Get Little From Financier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The states allegedly defrauded by money manager Martin Frankel  
stand to recover less than 40 cents on the dollar unless 
investigators locate a hidden supply of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators already have seized $57.5 million and are  
eyeing $26.5 million in a frozen Swiss bank account linked to the 
Connecticut-based money manager. 
</P>
<P>
	But Frankel is believed to have embezzled at least $218 million  
from several insurance companies, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	At that amount, states would have to cover 61.5 cents for every  
dollar invested in one of the insurance companies Frankel dealt 
with. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Frankel has been arrested in Germany, state officials  
hope he will help them find the missing money, presumably in a bid 
for leniency. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have linked at least three foreign bank accounts  
to Frankel, in Switzerland, Italy and Germany, said Keith Wenzel, 
director of Missouri's Department of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators also hope they'll be able to liquidate homes,  
diamonds and jewels belonging to Frankel, Wenzel said Monday. 
Frankel may have been financing his run with more than $10 million 
in diamonds and gold he bought before fleeing, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some regulators doubt they'll recover much more than they've  
already identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like they're counting on full recovery,'' said  
Marilyn Elam, a spokeswoman for Tennessee's Department of Commerce 
and Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators say Frankel used pseudonyms and partners  
to buy small insurance companies in states with reputations for lax 
insurance regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, regulators said, Frankel's unlicensed brokerage --  
apparently run out of his $3 million Greenwich, Conn., mansion -- 
siphoned money from the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Now regulators in those states -- Mississippi, Arkansas,  
Tennessee, Oklahoma and Missouri -- are banding together to recover 
the lost funds. Tennessee managed to seize $57.5 million, and has 
given $17.5 million of that to other states. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the states, not insurance policy holders, that would lose  
if the insurers remain in the red. 
</P>
<P>
	The states guaranteed the policies and will have to pay any  
amount not recovered from the insolvent insurance companies. Most 
of the policies, including 12,000 in Tennessee, are burial plans 
worth several thousand dollars apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be a long wait before any money changes hands.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping to have it wrapped up within a couple of years,''  
Missouri's Wenzel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel might still spend months in custody in Germany, where he  
was captured by federal and international authorities, even if he 
waived extradition to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance companies can spend a year or longer in receivership  
in a typical case, and ``this one is more complicated than most,'' 
said John Knox Walkup, the former Tennessee attorney general who is 
handling the receivership of the Tennessee insurer, Franklin 
American. 
</P>
<P>
	Auditors are still trying to understand how much money is  
missing. A lawsuit filed by some of the companies puts the loss at 
$915 million, but Wenzel said: ``I don't think any of the 
regulators ever thought it was that high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel also is thought to have allegedly stolen as much as  
$1.98 billion from the St. Francis of Assisi Foundation, which 
investigators say he established last year in the British Virgin 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's unclear whether much -- if any -- of that money ever  
existed or whether Frankel merely claimed it was there. The 
foundation was set up as a charity that bought insurance companies, 
investigators said.

<HEADLINE>  5 Arrested in Israel Car Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Declaring that their common task is fighting  
terrorism, Israel and the Palestinians expressed hope Monday that a 
pair of car bombings will not knock the newly revived peace process 
off track. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said five arrests were made in the Sunday bombings in the  
northern Israeli towns of Haifa and Tiberias. Authorities 
maintained a tight veil of secrecy over the identities of those 
taken into custody -- as well as those of the three slain men, 
apparently the bombers. 
</P>
<P>
	A Tiberias court said police requested the gag order because  
they believed the investigation could uncover further, imminent 
attacks being planned. The court ordered the men held another 11 
days and said police were investigating whether Israeli Arabs were 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Israeli Arab villages of Daburiya and Mashad, wakes were  
held for three men whom relatives said were the ones killed. 
Israeli security sources said DNA samples were taken from relatives 
of the three -- a procedure that has been used in the past to help 
identify the mangled, charred remains of suicide bombers. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Daburiya men are the bombers, it would mark the second  
time in eight days that Israeli Arabs have been involved in terror 
attacks. Last week, an Israeli Arab stabbed to death an Israeli 
couple, saying he wanted to kill Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	The two incidents have raised concern among Israeli Jews who  
nervously watch for any signs that the country's 1 million Arabs 
will turn against the state and come to identify with their 
Palestinian brethren in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has said in the past he would  
halt the peace process in response to terror attacks, but was 
unlikely to do so over Sunday's twin bombings. No bystanders were 
killed, and if the bombers were indeed Israeli Arabs, Barak could 
not hold the Palestinian Authority responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	``If indeed the investigation discovers that this time the  
terrorists were locals, Israel will have to do what it so often 
preaches -- improve its fight against terrorism,'' said a commentary 
in the liberal Haaretz daily. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombs went off just hours after the festive signing of a new  
West Bank land-for-security accord that also charts the course 
toward a permanent peace agreement by September 2000. The signing 
was widely seen as the opening of a new chapter in 
Israeli-Palestinian relations, following three years of deadlock 
under Barak's hawkish predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinian Cabinet formally ratified the agreement Monday  
night, Construction Minister Azzam Ahmad said. Ahmad would not give 
details about the vote, but said several ministers expressed 
reservations about the agreement, particularly over whether Israel 
would fulfill its obligation to relinquish West Bank territory and 
release Palestinian prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat reacted swiftly to the attacks,  
calling Barak and condemning the bombings. ``Terrorist attacks 
should be combated,'' Arafat said after a meeting Monday with the 
Israeli justice minister, Yossi Beilin. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Arafat has come under fire from Israeli leaders for  
not doing enough to rein in Palestinian militants and being too 
slow in condemning violence. However, with Israel on the verge of 
handing another 11 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian control, 
Arafat apparently does not want to do anything to hurt the new 
peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Beilin said he believed Arafat was serious about fighting  
terrorism. ``We all understand that terrorism is there to prevent 
us from achieving peace and we won't let it win,'' Beilin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli security forces were placed on high alert, saying there  
was concern that Islamic militants might try to stop the momentum 
in peacemaking with more attacks, especially during the Jewish High 
Holidays, which begin this weekend. The Palestinian movements Hamas 
and Islamic Jihad carried more than a dozen bombings in the past 
five years, killing scores of Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, Beilin and his Palestinian counterpart, Freih Abu  
Medein, signed an agreement to set up a liaison office to address 
legal grievances from both sides. The move is meant to give both 
Israelis and Palestinians redress on issues ranging from financial 
claims to criminal cases pending before the courts.

<HEADLINE>  5 Arrested in Israel Car Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Declaring that their common task is fighting  
terrorism, Israel and the Palestinians expressed hope Monday that a 
pair of car bombings will not knock the newly revived peace process 
off track. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said five arrests were made in the Sunday bombings in the  
northern Israeli towns of Haifa and Tiberias. Authorities 
maintained a tight veil of secrecy over the identities of those 
taken into custody -- as well as those of the three slain men, 
apparently the bombers. 
</P>
<P>
	A Tiberias court said police requested the gag order because  
they believed the investigation could uncover further, imminent 
attacks being planned. The court ordered the men held another 11 
days and said police were investigating whether Israeli Arabs were 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Israeli Arab villages of Daburiya and Mashad, wakes were  
held for three men whom relatives said were the ones killed. 
Israeli security sources said DNA samples were taken from relatives 
of the three -- a procedure that has been used in the past to help 
identify the mangled, charred remains of suicide bombers. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Daburiya men are the bombers, it would mark the second  
time in eight days that Israeli Arabs have been involved in terror 
attacks. Last week, an Israeli Arab stabbed to death an Israeli 
couple, saying he wanted to kill Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	The two incidents have raised concern among Israeli Jews who  
nervously watch for any signs that the country's 1 million Arabs 
will turn against the state and come to identify with their 
Palestinian brethren in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has said in the past he would  
halt the peace process in response to terror attacks, but was 
unlikely to do so over Sunday's twin bombings. No bystanders were 
killed, and if the bombers were indeed Israeli Arabs, Barak could 
not hold the Palestinian Authority responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	``If indeed the investigation discovers that this time the  
terrorists were locals, Israel will have to do what it so often 
preaches -- improve its fight against terrorism,'' said a commentary 
in the liberal Haaretz daily.

<HEADLINE> Steelers' Bettis Is Questionable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Steelers' offense, as listless  
during the preseason as it was at the end of last season, may not 
have a completely healthy Jerome Bettis for Sunday's season opener 
at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis, limited to less than a full week of practice during  
training camp by a left knee injury, was listed as questionable on 
Monday by coach Bill Cowher. Bettis' status will be updated 
depending on how much he practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to see him go back-to-back days,'' Cowher said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bettis, who has rushed for more than 1,000 yards in all three of  
his seasons with the Steelers, resumed practicing a week ago 
following his second arthroscopic knee surgery in seven months. But 
he backed off from contact work late last week when the soreness 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Bettis enjoys a pain-free week and is cleared to play in  
the first Steelers-Browns game since 1995, Cowher acknowledged it 
is unrealistic to expect the five-time 1,000-yard rusher to be in 
top game condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis has had no contact work since a 21-3 loss to Jacksonville  
on Dec. 28 completed the Steelers' season-ending five-game losing 
streak. The streak is tied with San Diego's as the longest in the 
NFL going into the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't help recognize that if you don't play a game in the  
preseason and haven't had a lot of practice, you're not going to be 
at the top of your game,'' Cowher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not done in the NFL. The only player I can remember doing  
it is Deion Sanders, who went 2-for-3 (in baseball) and came in 
here returning kicks and making interceptions. It was amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because game speed is so different from practice speed, it is  
difficult for an injured player to regain his timing and instincts 
just by practicing, Cowher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked to Jerome about it. It's a repetition thing. He's  
rusty now and he's the first to admit it,'' Cowher said. ``He isn't 
where he needs to be. But it's a 16-week season and it's important 
to keep that in perspective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Bettis plays, backup Richard Huntley and rookie Amos  
Zereoue will likely get most of the carries Sunday night against 
the expansion Browns. Huntley was Bettis' backup last year until 
his fumbling caused Cowher to lose confidence in him late in the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Zereoue, a third-round draft pick from West Virginia, led the  
Steelers with 170 yards on 43 carries during the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't expect Jerome, off his preseason work, to be at the  
top of his game,'' Cowher said. ``It is going to take a couple of 
weeks and it would be foolish to expect it to be otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis' absence clearly affected the Steelers' offense during a  
1-3 preseason that saw the starters go scoreless over three 
quarters in the final two games. 
</P>
<P>
	There is suspicion that new offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride  
held back part of the offense for the Browns, especially many of 
the downfield passing plays that have returned to the Steelers' 
play book since former coordinator Ray Sherman departed. 
</P>
<P>
	But an intricate offense that requires the quarterback and  
receivers to adjust on the fly and read defenses identically cannot 
always be installed and perfected on the practice field, Cowher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly haven't had a game plan in practice for any one  
team,'' Cowher said. ``I can't say I'm pleased with the degree of 
execution. We must be much more consistent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take some time. Repetition is the only answer.  
But we're very close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Kordell Stewart, who slumped badly late last season,  
was 5-of-8 and had two passes dropped in Saturday's 16-14 loss in 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``His mind set is very good right now,'' Cowher said.

<HEADLINE> eBay Removes Baby Sale Offers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Bids for an unborn child reached into six  
figures on the online auction house eBay, less than a week after a 
human kidney received million-dollar offers there. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials removed listings for three babies on the site  
and believe them all to be hoaxes, Steve Westly, eBay's marketing 
vice president, said Monday. The two earlier kidney sales were also 
thought to be shams. 
</P>
<P>
	While selling humans or their organs is illegal, eBay customers  
appeared interested in both. Bids for one of the children reached 
$109,100, while one of two listed kidneys had fetched a $5.7 
million offer. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the child listings, posted Sunday, offered a boy due to  
be born later this month to two students at the University of 
Chicago law school. It also offered ``intelligence scores of 
parents ... upon request.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials declined to release names of the purported  
baby sellers and would not say whether law-enforcement officials 
are investigating. But Westly said the latest auction likely took 
its cue from the kidney hoax. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the sudden we see this turn up in the press and we see  
a little flurry,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the San Jose, Calif.-based eBay banned the  
sale of guns and ammunition after people tried selling a missile, a 
bazooka, a rocket launcher and other military weapons.

<HEADLINE>  An `Outlaw' Wins Quarter Horse Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUIDOSO DOWNS, N.M. (AP) -- The outlaw horse with an attitude  
stole the biggest sprint in quarter horse racing. 
</P>
<P>
	A Delightful Dasher, who reminds his owner of ``a teen-age boy  
with a black leather jacket,'' prevailed in a stirring three-horse 
match race Monday to win the 41st running of the $2 million All 
American Futurity at Ruidoso Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-year-old gelding with a penchant for kicking and biting  
anyone within range, ran down the filly Significant Speed and the 
previously undefeated Chicks Call Me 
</P>
<P>
	A Delightful Dasher took the lead in the final strides and  
finished a head in front of Chicks Calls Me, who also caught 
Significant Speed just before the wire. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was worth $1,040,145 to owner Gwendolyn Eaves of  
Midland, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaves, a retired horse breeder and bridge player from Midland,  
Texas, had the fourth place finisher in the 1998 All American with 
Hes My Dasher. That horse was undefeated going into the futurity, 
but Eaves said she felt much more confident this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's kind of a half-way outlaw, but he's got so much heart,''  
she said. ``We saved him for this race and it paid off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Significant Speed, breaking from the No. 3 post, left the gate  
so fast, that she quickly opened up a length lead on the rest of 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``She made it look like we all got a bad start,'' said A  
Delightful Dasher's jockey, Joe Badilla. 
</P>
<P>
	The filly stretched her lead midway through the race and looked  
like a winner. But Badilla, running next to the inside rail, 
switched his whip from his right hand to his left and his horse 
responded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I switched sticks about midway and got within three-quarters  
of her,'' Badilla said. ``Then I switched back to the right and 
then there was no doubt I was going to catch her. It was a matter 
of when and how. I caught her about 20 yards from the wire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer John Bassett said Badilla's decision to switch from his  
right hand to his left got the winner rolling. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't break like he can, but that mare (Significant Speed)  
left so fast ... we had to make up some ground. I saw Joe whipping 
him right-handed. We weren't doing a whole lot. All of a sudden he 
switched sticks and hit him left handled and it just shot him out 
of a rocket,'' Bassett said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Delightful Dasher covered the 440 yards in 21.60 seconds and  
as the second choice in the betting behind Chicks Called Me paid 
$7.40, $3.20 and $2.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicks Call Me, owned by the Tulsa, Okla., partnership of C.E.  
Tuggle and W.R. Anglin, earned $291,240 and lost for the first time 
in seven races this year. He paid $3 and $2.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacky Martin, the jockey of Chicks Call Me, said his horse got  
off to the worst start this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was standing perfect, and he just didn't break,'' Martin  
said. ``He just kind of hopped in the air when the gates opened. It 
took 50 to 75 yards to get heads up with the other horses and the 
filly still had us beat a length. He ran a super race once he left 
the gates. No excuses, he just didn't leave running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Significant Speed, owned by the Scarlett Hill Farm of  
Weatherford, Texas, got the third place purse of $124,817 and paid 
$5.40 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the fourth in five races for A Delightful Dasher,  
who also won the $525,000 Rainbow Futurity over the same track in 
July. It also was the first win in the futurity for Eaves, Badilla 
and Bassett. 
</P>
<P>
	In the winner's circle celebration, Bassett took a moment to  
remember his late father, Joe Bassett, who got him started in 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father qualified a horse to this race in the 1960s, but  
wasn't fortunate enough to win it,'' Bassett said. ``He taught me 
everything I know about training a horse. Dad, wherever you are, 
this one's for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The order of finish after the top three was: Tiny First Down,  
Southern Cash Man, He Rocks, Familiar Faces, Moolah Memories and 
Tell Her More. Snappy Dragon was scratched from the race because of 
a chipped bone in his left knee.

<HEADLINE> ISI, Mitsubishi To Develop OS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Integrated Systems Inc., a major U.S. software  
maker, will develop a new operating system for hand-held computers 
with Japan's Mitsubishi Electric Corp., company officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Calif.-based software manufacturer has agreed with  
Mitsubishi Electric to jointly develop new microcontrollers for 
portable information devices, ISI Japan spokesman Yuzuru Matsumoto 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Mitsubishi spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, also  
confirmed the joint project. 
</P>
<P>
	Integrated Systems is the world's largest maker of operating  
systems for use with advanced microcontrollers, which will allow 
next-generation portable information appliances to easily access 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Matsumoto said the two companies aim to develop a device similar  
to hand-held computers currently on the market that use the Windows 
CE operating system of software maker Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	ISI is also considering cooperating with three other Japanese  
electronics makers in the same project, Matsumoto said. He added 
that he could not provide further details for now. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai newspaper said the other companies -- Hitachi  
Ltd., NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. -- will join forces with ISI and 
Mitsubishi. 
</P>
<P>
	The new gadgets will feature high-speed Internet access,  
improved word processing, as well as spreadsheet and schedule 
management functions, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Expos Release Third Baseman Andrews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Having lost patience in his offensive ability,  
the Montreal Expos released third baseman Shane Andrews following 
the team's 5-3 loss to Colorado on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal's first round selection in the 1990 amateur draft,  
Andrews was hitting just .181 with 11 homers and 37 RBIs in 281 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews, who hit .238 with 25 home runs and 69 RBIs last season,  
all career highs, lost his starting job to rookie Michael Barrett 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always tough to release players, no matter who they  
are,'' Expos general manager Jim Beattie said. ``Those are the 
decisions we have to make to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some young players coming up and we want to make sure  
that the playing time and the at-bats are going to go to the guys 
who have a chance to be with us next year. We didn't feel that 
Shane was going to be in that position.''

<HEADLINE> School Security Raises Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As America's children head back to school,  
security-conscious school administrators are also having to think 
about students' rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloody tragedies, especially last April's incident in which two  
students at Columbine High School in Littleton Colo., gunned down a 
dozen classmates and a teacher before killing themselves, left an 
indelible mark. As a result, police officers, metal detectors, 
student ID cards and surveillance cameras are part of life in 
schools across the nation. So are routine backpack searches, 
increased use of drug tests, stricter dress codes and less 
tolerance for schoolyard taunts or threats. 
</P>
<P>
	All of this worries Nadine Strossen, national president of the  
American Civil Liberties Union. ``We're seeing the equivalent of 
Fortress America, and students' privacy rights and freedom of 
speech are under attack from within,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ACLU, aggressively challenging policies in many public  
school districts, may be fighting an uphill battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the wake of increasing violence, courts seem to have become  
more deferential to school districts' genuine concern for student 
safety and security,'' said Cynthia Prettyman, general counsel for 
Palm Beach County, Fla., schools. ``Students still have rights and 
I'm sure the ACLU will stay on top of this, but any legal challenge 
will face a high hurdle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some students have won.  
</P>
<P>
	In Allen, Texas, senior Jennifer Boccia is back in school after  
having last spring's suspension expunged from her record. 
</P>
<P>
	She and nine other students wore black armbands to class to  
mourn the Columbine victims and to protest new rules imposed in 
their school as a result. Jennifer, an honors student, was 
suspended after ignoring an order to remove the armband. 
</P>
<P>
	``The school district just would not acknowledge that the First  
Amendment applies to students,'' said Diana Philip, an ACLU 
regional director in Dallas. ``We had to take them to court before 
an agreement could be reached.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Vasvari, the Ohio ACLU's legal director, cited two  
``invasions of student rights'' that were challenged successfully. 
In one, a Stow boy was suspended from classes for a personal 
Website entitled ``Stow High School Sucks.'' In another, a 
Youngstown area high school sought to administer drug tests for all 
students participating in extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The post-Columbine reaction is regrettable,'' Vasvari said.  
``When rights are whittled away, they tend not to return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Mississippi, the Harrison County School Board rescinded a  
policy that barred a Jewish boy from wearing his Star of David 
pendant after the ACLU sued on his behalf. School officials had 
considered it a gang symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Underwood, general counsel of the National School Boards  
Association, says school districts are well-served by programs 
emphasizing ``culture and climate -- how people treat each other; 
whether a respectful learning environment exists. 
</P>
<P>
	``We routinely get called for advice after a problem arises,  
after some policy is challenged,'' she said. ``We would like to 
field such calls earlier on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here are some questions and answers about students' rights:  
</P>
<P>
	Q: Students are just kids. Why do they have any rights?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Children, like adults, have legal rights. The Supreme Court,  
dating back to a landmark 1969 decision, has said students who 
attend public schools do not surrender all constitutional rights at 
the schoolhouse gate. For example, the court has said school 
officials cannot squelch students' freedom of speech based on ``a 
mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always 
accompany an unpopular viewpoint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What about students' privacy rights?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which protects against  
unreasonable searches and seizures, applies in public schools, but 
school officials get more leeway than police. And school searches 
of lockers and backpacks, even the use of metal detectors, are much 
easier to justify when the target is illegal drugs or weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, courts generally require ``individualized suspicion'' in  
certain circumstances, barring school officials from searching all 
students in a room just because one of them may have stolen some 
money or smuggled in a pack of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What about drug tests?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The law is still evolving on this issue. The Supreme Court  
ruled in 1995 that student athletes could be subjected to random 
drug tests because the athletic programs are voluntary and student 
athletes are role models. Since then, some lower courts have 
allowed drug testing of students engaged in other extracurricular 
activities. But some courts have struck down drug-testing policies. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, two Pottawatomie County high school students are  
challenging a policy requiring drug tests for students involved in 
extracurricular activities, such as choir or marching band, for 
which they receive academic credit. No court anywhere has ruled 
that all students can be subjected to random drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Is there somewhere students and teachers nationwide can find  
out the answers to specific questions? 
</P>
<P>
	A: No, the law on students' rights can vary from state to state,  
depending on state laws and court rulings.

<HEADLINE> Deaths of Homeless Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAPID CITY, S.D. (AP) -- When the first few bodies turned up in  
the gurgling trout stream that runs through a park in this city on 
the edge of the Black Hills, the deaths drew little attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Police investigated, but all the evidence indicated that the  
homeless men had spent their days and nights drinking along Rapid 
Creek and simply passed out and drowned. 
</P>
<P>
	As more men died, however, law officers became suspicious. The  
deaths now total eight in 16 months, three this year. In typical 
years, only about one homeless person turns up drowned along the 
creek. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just too many of them to say it's coincidence. But it  
could be,'' Police Chief Tom Hennies says. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have no witnesses who saw any of them go into the  
creek. There are no bullet holes, stab wounds or evidence of other 
injuries. Police don't know where most of the men entered the 
stream. 
</P>
<P>
	What investigators know is that six of the eight were Indians,  
and all but one had been drinking heavily just before they died. 
Most had blood alcohol levels of at least 0.25 percent, or more 
than 2 1/2 times the 0.1 percent level at which drivers are presumed 
to be drunk. 
</P>
<P>
	The homeless people who live under bridges along the creek  
believe someone is pushing unconscious or helpless drinkers into 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
	Clement Standing Elk says he and other street people no longer  
risk hanging out alone. ``We go around in packs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors reported to police include accusations that the creek  
people are being killed by a fellow homeless man, by racist 
skinheads, a motel owner, members of a Satanic cult, a big white 
man on a bicycle. One report even accused a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing Elk is among those who blame racist skinheads, and says  
the creek people have banded together to chase some of them away. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came by here. There were four of them and they said they  
were going to throw another dead Indian in the creek,'' Standing 
Elk says. 
</P>
<P>
	The homeless and others complain that the police and Pennington  
County Sheriff's Department are doing little to investigate the 
deaths because most of the victims are Indians, men whose names 
included Benjamin Long Wolf, Randelle Two Crow and Loren Two Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest to die was Timothy Bull Bear Sr., 49, from the town  
of Allen on the Pine Ridge Reservation. His body was pulled from 
the creek July 8. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what else to do. We've done everything we can  
do,'' Hennies says. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men who lead the task force investigating the deaths say  
they have even asked themselves whether they would do anything 
differently if the dead men had been affluent whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Sheriff's Deputy De Glassgow says he believes the  
investigation is being conducted the same as if all the victims had 
been white. And police Capt. Craig Tieszen says he is not 
embarrassed about how the cases have been handled. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers have interviewed scores of people. The FBI, state  
Division of Criminal Investigation and other experts have been 
consulted. Information is being entered into a computer to search 
for any links among the cases, and a $4,000 reward has been 
offered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is the case going to be solved in the near future? Not unless  
something breaks that we don't have right now,'' Glassgow says. 
</P>
<P>
	Rapid Creek leaves a Black Hills canyon and runs west to east  
through Rapid City, South Dakota's second-largest city with a 
population of 57,000. After a flash flood killed 238 people in June 
1972, the city bought up the creek's flood plain and turned it into 
park land. 
</P>
<P>
	People now stroll or ride bicycles on paved paths among flower  
beds, lawns and towering cottonwood trees. Anglers cast for trout 
in the stream. 
</P>
<P>
	And dozens of people live in the brush along the creek and under  
the street bridges, mostly unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
	The street people are not scared, says Dean Two Sticks, who  
lives under a bridge with Standing Elk. ``Why should we be scared 
to walk around on our river, on our grass, on our land?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He believes the deaths have stopped because of publicity, but  
will resume once the attention dies down. And he rejects the idea 
that the homeless people have been killed by one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not us doing it,'' he says. ``It's not the street people  
because we're family.''

<HEADLINE> Poor Preseason a Concern for Vikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- A lackluster exhibition season and  
trouble on defense have left the Minnesota Vikings with a bounty of 
worries and nothing resembling a Super Bowl favorite's swagger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody's where they want to be,'' cornerback  
Jimmy Hitchcock said. ``Throughout the whole team we've got to get 
better, not just any particular position. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody down to the water boys have got to do a better  
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings are thin at linebacker, where versatile backup Pete  
Bercich was placed on injured reserve with a major knee injury and 
starters Ed McDaniel (knee) and Dwayne Rudd (shoulder) have been 
limited. And the defensive line has been a shuffle, starting with 
Dimitrius Underwood's departure on Day 1 of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Vikings were outscored by the Jets 29-7 in the second  
half last week, Coach Dennis Green was as candid as he's ever been 
in assessing the team's personnel. He lamented its lack of 
defensive depth and said he was greatly troubled by inadequacies in 
the pass rush, pass protection, the running game and in creating 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hope that how you play in preseason will be an indication  
of how you're going to play in the season, if you play well,'' 
Green said after the Vikings' 38-17 loss. ``I don't think we 
necessarily played well. That could be a sign that we don't have 53 
players who can play well enough at this level. I know we got some 
that can. We'll try to focus on those.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green rummaged through the waiver wire Monday and picked up  
linebacker Rob Holmberg, a sixth-year pro who was cut by the New 
York Jets, and brought back pass-rusher Martin Harrison, whom the 
Vikings waived last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Jets coach Bill Parcells told Green that Holmberg was going to  
be available, so the Vikings kept close watch on him during the 
game at the Meadowlands on Friday night, when Bercich tore a knee 
ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to Parcells' recommendation, Holmberg went from the AFC  
favorites to the NFC favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Jets are a good team and now I come here and it's another  
good team,'' Holmberg said with a big smile. ``So, it's a great 
situation for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Bercich, Holmberg will back up at both weakside and  
strongside linebacker as well as playing special teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think he's an ideal fit,'' Green said.  
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota's high-octane offenses never got on track in the  
preseason, and that's frustrated receiver Randy Moss, the 1998 
Offensive Rookie of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't get things going, it's going to be a struggle,''  
Moss said. ``The expectations are so high ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings, who open their season Sunday against Atlanta, which  
stunned them in the NFC championship at the Metrodome, stumbled 
through a 2-2 preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	They've looked nothing like last year's team that parlayed a 4-0  
exhibition mark into a 15-1 regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you line up, you want to win, you want to play well,''  
safety Robert Griffith said. ``We have to work out some kinks.''

<HEADLINE>  Thrashers Take Ice in Mickey Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The Atlanta Thrashers stepped on the ice  
for the first time with numbers on their sweaters. It might have 
been a good idea to wear I.D. tags as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Hello, my name is ...  
</P>
<P>
	The NHL's newest team has plenty of catching up to do against  
the rest of the league, but the uneasy moments before Sunday's 
opening practice of training camp revealed the unseen ordeal of an 
expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little quiet in there,'' goalie Norm Maracle said.  
``A lot of guys don't know each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even coach Curt Fraser found it difficult to tell his players  
apart as they whizzed around the ice in a flurry of shooting, 
passing and skating drills. When they gathered around him during 
breaks, he gazed out on a bunch of strange faces looking to him for 
guidance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be tough to evaluate these guys the first couple  
of days,'' said Fraser, who used jersey numbers as his primary form 
of identification. ``They look a heck of a lot different off the 
ice than they do on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers will try to come together this week amid the palm  
trees and 90-degree temperatures of central Florida. Right away, it 
was clear this isn't your daddy's NHL anymore: Most of the guys 
showed up at the sprawling RDV Sportsplex wearing shorts, T-shirts 
and sandals. 
</P>
<P>
	But this won't be a summer vacation. The Thrashers have only six  
days of practice before their first exhibition game, Saturday night 
against the Nashville Predators. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser established a set of ground rules to keep players focused  
on their reason for being in Orlando. The golf course is off limits 
and curfew is at 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to need a lot of rest because I expect us to be  
competing every day,'' he said. ``I don't want us to be like 
expansion teams in the past. I want us to be set apart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser was familiar with the surroundings, having coached the  
minor league Orlando Solar Bears the last four years, but he was 
admittedly nervous when he stepped on the ice with his new team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to be up and running and get the first day out of  
the way,'' he said. ``Now we can get down to business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One player managed to catch the coach's eye right away. Right  
winger Kelly Buchberger, the third-oldest guy on the roster at 32, 
was first on the ice for the morning workout and never slowed down. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser has yet to name a captain, but Buchberger is the  
overwhelming favorite after playing on three Stanley Cup-winning 
teams in Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was terrific during every part of practice,'' Fraser said  
in admiration. ``He was talking and leading the guys. He's just 
what we're looking for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchberger, known for his work ethic and physical style, intends  
to play the same way in Atlanta that he did for 13 years with the 
Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just habit,'' he said with a shrug.  
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen-year-old center Patrik Stefan, the top overall pick in  
the NHL entry draft, was on the ice just two days after agreeing to 
a contract that could pay him excess of $10 million over the next 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm nervous, but it's exciting to be with a new team,'' Stefan  
said, insisting he felt fine after suffering two concussions in the 
International Hockey League last season. ``It's great to be on the 
ice again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other notable names on the 65-player roster are Damian Rhodes,  
who used to share the goaltending duties in Ottawa with Ron 
Tugnutt; center Ray Ferraro, who twice has tallied 40 goals; right 
winger Nelson Emerson, a five-time 20-goal scorer; and defensemen 
Darryl Shannon and Gord Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
	For most part, though, the expansion-team roster is comprised of  
journeymen and obscure prospects. To sort through all the names, 
Fraser divided the squad into four groups -- two practicing in the 
morning, two in the afternoon -- and will hold a series of game-like 
scrimmages today, Wednesday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, anything goes.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only way to evaluate properly is to let them do what got  
them here,'' said Fraser, who has everyone in camp except a couple 
of Russians trying to sort out visa problems in their homeland. 
``If that means playing tough and physical, they've got to show 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes is still wearing the black-and-red mask -- complete with a  
Canadian maple leaf -- he used last season with the Senators. A more 
appropriate piece of equipment is on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still waiting for my new mask,'' he explained. ``I'm  
supposed to get it Wednesday. The guy who does the painting for me 
takes his time, but he does a good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maracle was better prepared. The mask that once displayed the  
red-and-white Detroit logo has been repainted with a blue-and-gold 
design, the colors of his new team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted a fresh start,'' Maracle said. ``I didn't want to  
have the Red Wings stuff on my mask anymore.''

<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Cleveland Indians activated catcher Sandy  
Alomar from the 60-day disabled list Monday before their game 
against the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar had been sidelined since May 11 after undergoing  
arthroscopic surgery to remove a bone chip in his left knee. Before 
the injury, he was batting .317 with three home runs and 16 RBIs in 
22 games. 
</P>
<P>
	He hurt his knee blocking a Dave Burba wild pitch May 10. The  
trip to the DL was Alomar's first since 1995 and the seventh of his 
10-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	Left-handed reliever Jim Poole was designated for assignment to  
clear a spot on the Indians' 40-man roster.

winger Kelly Buchberger, the third-oldest guy on the roster at 32, 
was first on the ice for the morning workout and never slowed down. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser has yet to name a captain, but Buchberger is the  
overwhelming favorite after playing on three Stanley Cup-winning 
teams in Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was terrific during every part of practice,'' Fraser said  
in admiration. ``He was talking and leading the guys. He's just 
what we're looking for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchberger, known for his work ethic and physical style, intends  
to play the same way in Atlanta that he did for 13 years with the 
Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just habit,'' he said with a shrug.  
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen-year-old center Patrik Stefan, the top overall pick in  
the NHL entry draft, was on the ice just two days after agreeing to 
a contract that could pay him excess of $10 million over the next 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm nervous, but it's exciting to be with a new team,'' Stefan  
said, insisting he felt fine after suffering two concussions in the 
International Hockey League last season. ``It's great to be on the 
ice again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other notable names on the 65-player roster are Damian Rhodes,  
who used to share the goaltending duties in Ottawa with Ron 
Tugnutt; center Ray Ferraro, who twice has tallied 40 goals; right 
winger Nelson Emerson, a five-time 20-goal scorer; and defensemen 
Darryl Shannon and Gord Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
	For most part, though, the expansion-team roster is comprised of  
journeymen and obscure prospects. To sort through all the names, 
Fraser divided the squad into four groups -- two practicing in the 
morning, two in the afternoon -- and will hold a series of game-like 
scrimmages today, Wednesday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, anything goes.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only way to evaluate properly is to let them do what got  
them here,'' said Fraser, who has everyone in camp except a couple 
of Russians trying to sort out visa problems in their homeland. 
``If that means playing tough and physical, they've got to show 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes is still wearing the black-and-red mask -- complete with a  
Canadian maple leaf -- he used last season with the Senators. A more 
appropriate piece of equipment is on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still waiting for my new mask,'' he explained. ``I'm  
supposed to get it Wednesday. The guy who does the painting for me 
takes his time, but he does a good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maracle was better prepared. The mask that once displayed the  
red-and-white Detroit logo has been repainted with a blue-and-gold 
design, the colors of his new team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted a fresh start,'' Maracle said. ``I didn't want to  
have the Red Wings stuff on my mask anymore.''

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Activists Protest Hyundai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Dozens of civic activists staged a  
boisterous demonstration Monday, denouncing the nation's largest 
conglomerate for allegedly diverting company funds to manipulate 
stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The founder and owner of the Hyundai conglomerate is Chung  
Ju-yung. His sons control most key Hyundai subsidiaries, which 
produce cars, ships and semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Arrest the Chung family,'' protesters shouted through  
bullhorns in front of the main Hyundai building in Seoul. They 
carried placards and pickets denouncing the alleged stock price 
manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
	One Hyundai executive was arrested and nine others were barred  
from leaving the country last week pending investigation of what 
prosecutors said is the largest stock price manipulation scheme in 
South Korean history. 
</P>
<P>
	In the alleged scheme last year, at least two Hyundai affiliates  
illegally diverted $183 million in company funds to boost the stock 
price of Hyundai Electronic Co. from $12.30 per share to $26.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Local media, quoting unidentified prosecution sources, said  
Hyundai made at least $416 million off the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, prosecutors questioned Kim Hyong-byuk, head of  
Hyundai Heavy Industry Co., a unit of the Hyundai group, for 
alleged involvement. His company allegedly diverted $157 million in 
company funds for the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say the alleged mastermind is Lee Ik-chi, head of  
Hyundai Securities Co. Lee was scheduled to appear before 
prosecutors Tuesday for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Civic groups believe the scheme could not have been possible  
without direct or tacit approval from the group's owners, the Chung 
family. However, so far there is no evidence against the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock price manipulation is punishable by a prison term of up to  
10 years or a fine of up to three times the profit gained. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea's conglomerates, including Hyundai, are being pushed  
by the government to restructure by shedding money-losing 
subsidiaries, thus lowering debt burdens.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two 11-year-old children dancing in a parade  
celebrating Caribbean culture were killed Monday when they were hit 
by a float behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, after the parade was over, an 18-year-old man was  
killed by a float along the parade route. Police did not release 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first incident, Joseph Donn and Zacehel David were  
dancing behind a float attached to a truck that stopped suddenly. 
The driver of the next float couldn't stop in time and hit the 
children, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver that stopped suddenly was arrested on a charge of  
driving with a suspended license, police said. Four people, 
including two 10-year-old children, were taken to the hospital with 
minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of thousands of people from more than 12 island nations  
lined streets in Brooklyn for the annual West Indian American 
Carnival Parade, one of the city's largest ethnic festivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Caribbean immigrants wore the flags of their homelands as capes,  
donned brightly colored costumes with feathery headwear and sipped 
Jamaican beer and sugar cane drinks. Crowds waved flags and danced 
to pounding steel drums and calypso.

<HEADLINE> Best of the Rest Wins at Calder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Heavily favored Best of the Rest ran away with the  
$100,000 Spend A Buck Handicap on a sloppy track at Calder on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Best of the Rest, jockey Eibar Coa's fourth winner of the day,  
took the lead on the final turn and finished 9 1/2 lengths in front of 
Dancing Guy. High Security was third in the field of 10 older 
horses. 
</P>
<P>
	Best of the Rest is 3-for-3 on off tracks. The only time he has  
finished out of the money in 12 lifetime starts was in his one race 
on the turf. He has won seven times, earning $242,139. He won three 
stakes at Calder last year but did not make his first start of 1999 
until Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-year-old Florida-bred ran 1 1-16 miles in 1:44 3/5 and  
paid $4, $3.40 and $2.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Dancing Guy paid $11.80 and $6.20, while High Security was $3.40  
to show. 
</P>
<P>
	High Security broke on top with Best of the Rest right there on  
the inside. Turning down the backstretch High Security led by a 
length over Shamrock City with Best of the Rest third on the rail, 
followed by Fig Fest. At the half-mile pole High Security was in 
front by 1 1/2 lengths as the favorite came off the rail for running 
room. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving between High Security and Fig Fest, Best of the Rest took  
the lead at the quarter-pole and was all by himself from the 
eighth-pole to the wire. Dancing Guy rallied into second in 
mid-stretch and beat High Security by 1 1/2 lengths. Fig Fest was a 
half-farther back.

<HEADLINE> IMF Probes Russia's Use of Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund began a new probe  
Monday into whether the Russian central bank misused IMF loans, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe comes amid allegations that IMF loan money may have  
been illegally diverted through the Bank of New York. American 
investigators reportedly believe that up to $10 billion may have 
been funneled by Russians through the bank, and some suggested that 
IMF aid may have been among those funds. 
</P>
<P>
	However, IMF officials have insisted that the new investigation  
is unrelated to the allegations involving the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank probe is being conducted by the IMF and  
accounting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers, and looks into whether the 
bank misused IMF loans by means of foreign affiliates, a source 
close to the investigation told Dow Jones Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian central bank has misled the IMF about the state of  
its finances before, and the Russian government had to agree to 
independent reviews of its books as a condition for a $4.5 billion 
loan from the IMF approved in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has received the first $640 million installment of the  
loan. The second installment, expected next month, depends on the 
IMF's assessment of Russia's compliance with the loan terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to make excuses for ourselves, we are ready  
to provide the necessary information,'' Russian Deputy Finance 
Minister Oleg Vyugin was quoted as saying Monday by ORT television. 
</P>
<P>
	After the allegations of money laundering through the Bank of  
New York were made public, the United States -- the IMF's biggest 
member -- delayed deciding whether it should support new IMF loans 
to Russia until a full accounting is made of IMF money already 
lent. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier investigation by PriceWaterhouseCoopers found that  
the central bank in 1996 secretly moved $1.2 billion of its 
reserves to an offshore company, FIMACO, based on the Channel 
Island of Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer said the fund would  
have suspended Russia's loan program in place at the time if the 
truth were known. 
</P>
<P>
	Money laundering and capital flight have been major problems for  
Russia throughout this decade, with tens of billions of dollars 
pouring out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF investigation and the Bank of New York case are among  
several financial scandals that allegedly link prominent Russian 
political or business figures to corruption and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland is helping Russia investigate allegations that Swiss  
construction company Mabetex bribed top Kremlin officials, 
including President Boris Yeltsin, to win lucrative renovation 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra said  
Mabetex deposited more than $1 million in a Swiss bank account and 
a top Kremlin aide made the money available to Yeltsin and his 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin insisted Monday that neither he nor his  
family members have opened foreign bank accounts and said their 
income is ``absolutely transparent,'' according to presidential 
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin, speaking on Russian television.

<HEADLINE>  Gore Lashes Out at GOP Contenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore ripped into  
Republican rivals he said are ``buckling'' to anti-union pressure 
and pushing measures that would cripple labor's political clout. 
</P>
<P>
	He mentioned none by name, but ``paycheck protection'' has been  
an issue in Texas, where Gov. George W. Bush is the leading GOP 
contender. Gore aides distributed complaints from Texas labor 
leaders about the issue, even as Gore pounded the point at labor 
rallies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the anti-labor folks have put pressure on these  
candidates and they've buckled to it,'' said Gore. ``It is designed 
to bust unions. It's probably the single most notorious 
union-busting proposal to come along in years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore continues to gain support from Democratic Party leaders,  
picking up an endorsement today from U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't take this step lightly,'' Harkin said, appearing with  
Gore at a Labor Day visit to a park in a working-class Des Moines 
neighborhood. ``Gore is right for Iowa, he is right for America and 
he is right for our working families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is the ability of union leaders to use dues of members  
for political purposes. Many Republicans push for proposals that 
would require individual union members to annually give approval 
for such use, and dub the issue ``paycheck protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders and many Democrats argue the move would  
effectively eliminate the ability of unions to be political 
players, and call it ``paycheck deception.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been surprised at some of the Republican candidates for  
president who have felt so much pressure from the far right wing 
that they have found it necessary to endorse this idea,'' said 
Gore. ``It was out of the mainstream of the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that voters in California voted on the issue in a  
referendum in the last election, rejecting it soundly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most moderate Republicans have really stayed away from it,''  
said Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore faces opposition only from former New Jersey Sen. Bill  
Bradley in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, and 
most polls show him with an early lead. 
</P>
<P>
	A Boston Globe/WBZ-TV poll found that Bradley and Gore are  
running neck and neck in New Hampshire. Among 400 likely Democratic 
primary voters, Gore led Bradley, the former New Jersey senator, by 
40 percent to 36 percent, the Globe reported Sunday. That amounts 
to a statistical dead heat because it falls within the poll's 
margin of error of 5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been occasional tensions between the White House and  
labor, mainly over trade issues, and Gore has devoted heavy 
attention to court labor and block Bradley from gaining ground with 
that key Democratic group. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sweeping through the state in a two-day swing touching  
areas of the state where labor has a high presence. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, he picked up the endorsement of Secretary of State  
Chet Culver, also with solid labor ties. 
</P>
<P>
	At his stops, Gore hammered hard at labor themes, pledging to  
``close the loopholes'' that have shifted the balance of power 
against the nation's workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore vowed to push for laws preventing striking workers from  
being replaced and demanded another increase in the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always believed we need to close the loopholes that  
have allowed some of the union-busting tactics that began with the 
Reagan-Bush crowd,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	He warned against ``a concentration of power'' that is unhealthy  
for workers and said he'd bring balance to the workplace. As he 
worked to shore up labor backing, Gore also was moving ahead 
organizationally. 
</P>
<P>
	He is returning to the state next weekend to kick off a marathon  
round of organizational meetings in all of Iowa's 99 counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he was looking to head off Bradley, the public rhetoric  
centered around Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The words 'outrage' and ``Republican'' kind of go together  
when you talk about risky tax schemes,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some polls show Gore faring poorly against potential Republican  
opponents, but he said there's a campaign ahead that will allow him 
to make a case that voters will buy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The struggle for the future of this country is a marathon, not  
a sprint,'' Gore said. ``We've always found it within us to make 
the right choices.''

<HEADLINE> Chargers Sign Coveted CB Lewis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Cornerback Darryll Lewis, who was released  
Saturday by the Tennessee Titans, agreed to terms on a two-year 
deal with the San Diego Chargers on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, going into his ninth NFL season, will receive a $600,000  
signing bonus and a $400,000 salary for this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers have until 1 p.m. Tuesday to clear a roster spot  
for Lewis. They are trying to trade cornerback Dwayne Harper to the 
San Francisco 49ers. If a deal doesn't go through, Harper will be 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper, who signed with the Chargers as an unrestricted free  
agent from Seattle in 1994, wasn't at practice Monday and his 
locker was cleaned out. He met with club officials earlier in the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't been officially released,'' Harper said Monday  
evening. ``I know I can still play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beathard said club officials ``thanked him for everything he did  
here. Dwayne's been great for us. He got better each preseason 
game, but we got the chance to get Darryll and we had to go that 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harper has missed a good deal of the last three seasons due to  
injuries, including the final 15 games last year with a neck injury 
that required offseason surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis intercepted an AFC-high 25 passes over the last five  
years. He played under Chargers defensive backs coach Rod Perry 
when he held the same job with the Oilers from 1995-96, and earned 
a Pro Bowl spot in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis was cut by the Titans because he lost his starting job and  
the $2 million he was due to make is too much to pay a nickel back. 
He was beaten out for the starting job by second-year pro Samari 
Rolle.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Tries Hand at Hand Tools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Armed with a cordless electric drill,  
President Clinton pitched in briefly Monday to help with some 
renovation work at the 75-year-old Coleman Place Elementary School 
and was reminded he's now a homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never used one of these,'' the president, wearing a hard hat  
and blue work shirt, remarked as he fastened about eight screws to 
the top of a computer desk. 
</P>
<P>
	Having recently, along with the first lady, purchased a $1.7  
million home in Westchester County, New York, Clinton predicted he 
might need just such a tool. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her now that I'm a homeowner I'd better get one of  
these,'' said Clinton. ``I've never seen one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president and Hillary Rodham Clinton last Thursday bought  
the 110-year-old Georgian colonial in Westchester County outside 
New York City as Mrs. Clinton establishes residency in New York for 
a probable bid for a Senate seat from the state.

<HEADLINE> Faithful Pray for Cardinal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor celebrated Mass at home  
as thousands of well-wishers at St. Patrick's Cathedral prayed for 
his speedy recovery from brain surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's feeling good,'' O'Connor's spokesman Joe Zwilling said  
Sunday, a day after the cardinal was released from Memorial 
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors removed a tumor from the surface of his brain during the  
11 days he was hospitalized, according to the Roman Catholic 
Archdiocese of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Church officials would not say whether the Roman Catholic  
prelate's tumor was malignant. But they said the 79-year-old 
archbishop of New York would soon undergo radiation therapy, which 
is often used to prevent aggressive brain tumors from recurring. 
</P>
<P>
	Zwilling declined to release any other information on the  
cardinal's condition or prognosis. He said O'Connor, who became 
spiritual leader to 2.2 million Catholics in 1984, would spend much 
of the coming week resting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's going to be pretty much recuperating, getting his  
strength back,'' Zwilling said. ``He's at home, he's up, he's 
talking to people, doing some work. ... He's very calm about 
everything, he's in very good and positive spirits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well-wishers crowded St. Patrick's on Sunday to offer prayers  
for O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very saddened,'' said Suzanne Johnson, 59, of Memphis,  
Tenn. ``He's a wonderful leader in the church, one of the good 
ones. ... I'll certainly be praying for him and watching the 
news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many also were optimistic about his health.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's great hope,'' said Dee Leach, of Philadelphia,  
a cancer survivor. ``I've done radiation too, and it's not as bad 
as everyone thinks it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leach said she thought the crowd attending Mass was larger than  
usual because of those who came to pray for the cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's certainly getting a lot of support,'' she said. ``I think  
he'll survive beautifully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Michael Tavuzzi said O'Connor was grateful for the  
public's prayers and support. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cardinal is delighted to be back home and expects to begin  
his regular Mass schedule ... next Sunday,'' Tavuzzi told 
worshippers.

<HEADLINE> Comets Know Championship Formula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Three for 10.  
</P>
<P>
	The numbers said everything about the Houston Comets this  
season. They won their third straight WNBA title and dedicated it 
to Kim Perrot, the point guard who wore jersey No. 10 and died of 
brain cancer last month. 
</P>
<P>
	As the seconds ticked down in Sunday's championship game,  
Cynthia Cooper raised her hands. She showed an index finger with 
her right hand and a fist with the other -- the referee's signal for 
No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Tears welled in the players' eyes and the sellout crowd of  
16,285 began chanting ``three for Kim, three for Kim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This championship was the hard one because of everything going  
on,'' forward Janeth Arcain said. ``It's been a very emotional 
season watching Kim fight her battle. We won this championship for 
her, and we know she was watching us today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper had one of her worst shooting games Saturday. She went  
1-for-10 and watched in disbelief as New York's Teresa Weatherspoon 
hit a 52-foot shot at the buzzer to give the Liberty a 68-67 
victory and force the deciding game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Comets and Cooper came back Sunday even more determined.  
Cooper and Sheryl Swoopes scored 20 of Houston's first 22 points 
and the Comets took a 33-25 halftime lead. Cooper finished with 24 
points, including 13 of 15 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not going to go down 1-for-10, I was going to go down  
fighting for my team to win a third championship,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	When New York drew to 38-31, the Comets took off with a 10-0  
spurt to take control. Tina Thompson had seven of the 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have overcome the obstacles and all the things we were  
faced with all year,'' Thompson said. ``So maybe this one will be a 
little more special because we won it for Kim. All the desire and 
passion and strength and toughness she brought to this team, we 
used it (Sunday).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Comets finished the season with the best record in the  
league (26-6) for the third straight season. They never lost more 
than two straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's victory on Saturday was Houston's first playoff home  
loss ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``These players of ours, they stayed tough, they won it after  
the most heartbreaking loss I've ever been involved in,'' Comets 
coach Van Chancellor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has proven to be one of the great teams in the history of  
sports. And this trophy is for Kim, whose heart and determination 
will never be forgotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper won her third straight regular season scoring title and  
was the championship series most valuable player for the third 
straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an emotional grind all season. Cooper lost her mother to  
cancer. Swoopes started the season after getting a divorce in the 
offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's especially sweet with everything that this team  
has gone through, emotionally, mentally, all the personal things 
that we have all gone through, all the sacrifices we have had to 
make,'' Swoopes said. ``Obviously, Kim not being here, that was 
very emotional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Comets will share their victory with the city of Houston  
during a downtown parade and rally Wednesday afternoon. Houston 
Mayor Lee Brown will be the host. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our Houston Comets have been through so much this season, and  
yet they showed an unwavering will to win,'' Brown said in a 
statement. ``The team has endured a true test of the heart that 
goes far beyond winning another title.''

<HEADLINE> Ottawa, Yashin at Contract Impasse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- The Ottawa Senators threatened to sue  
holdout center Alexei Yashin as their dispute over a contract 
extension continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators general manager Marshall Johnston also rejected the  
latest contract proposal from Yashin and his agent Mark Gandler, 
and announced the suspension of the holdout center on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a prepared statement, Johnston confirmed he met with Gandler  
over the weekend but stood firm on the team's stance that Yashin 
would not get a new deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked on Saturday,'' Johnston said in the release. ``In  
one of our conversations, Mr. Gandler proposed that we enter into a 
new contract for three years, beginning with this year. Salary 
levels would be $3.6 million US for this year, followed by $11 
million and $12 million for the following years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston rejected the demands and wrote a letter to Gandler on  
Sunday, restating the team's earlier position that it would 
negotiate a future contract ``only after substantially all of the 
obligations'' had been performed under the present contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston also formally notified Yashin of his immediate and  
indefinite suspension for not showing up to training camp, but left 
open the door for his return if he chooses to honor his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators also threatened legal action should Yashin skip the  
entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston wrote in a letter to Gandler that ``the club may suffer  
financial damages as a result of (Yashin's) breach of contract and 
will take appropriate measures to recover compensation from Alexei 
for any such damages. The extent of damages may become more clear 
as the season is completed, and action under the contract to 
receive compensation will be commenced at the appropriate time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin, the Senators' leading scorer last season with 44 goals  
and 94 points, said he would not report unless his contract was 
renegotiated. He is in the final year of a five-year, $13.5 million 
contract which would pay him $3.6 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless Alexei's under contract for more than one year, at this  
point I don't think it makes sense for him to report,'' Gandler 
told the Globe and Mail. ``It would be a distraction if he was 
there and things didn't work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston said that holding out for the entire season would not  
solve Yashin's problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Alexei does not deliver a full season of play this year, he  
will be obligated to deliver to our club a full season in the next 
year in which he decides to play in the National Hockey League, 
under the terms and conditions of his contract for this year,'' 
Johnston wrote. ``Restricted free agency would arise only after 
that performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gandler, who made similar comments to the Ottawa Citizen, said  
the latest contract proposal was meant to help the Senators' 
financial plight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a proposal to Marshall to see if we can help them with  
their budget this year in return for some help on our budget next 
year,'' Gandler said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Stock Market at Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Greece's booming stock market soared into  
record territory Monday after Premier Costas Simitis predicted the 
exchange's growth would continue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Athens Stock Exchange's general index jumped to 5621.67  
points, up 213.82 points or 4 percent, with many shares hitting the 
8 percent daily increase limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Simitis, outlining economic policy over the weekend, announced  
sweeping tax cuts and said additional money would be raised by 
doubling taxes on stocks sales. His remarks eased concern that 
share values had peaked. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of thousands of small investors have flocked to the  
high-flying Athens Stock Exchange over the past two years. The 
surge was aided by falling interest rates ahead of Greece's 
anticipated entry into the European Union's single currency group. 
</P>
<P>
	Greece is the only EU country that sought entry into the euro  
zone but failed to qualify for the initial group. Inflation and 
other factors have been brought in line and Greece is expected to 
join the group in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Suspends Two Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama linebackers Darius Gilbert and  
Chris Horne have been suspended for Saturday's game against Houston 
for violating team rules. 
</P>
<P>
	It marks the second straight week Crimson Tide linebackers will  
be sitting out with suspensions. Horne, Miguel Merritt and Canary 
Knight were suspended for last Saturday's 28-17 win at Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike DuBose said Monday the latest suspensions were  
unrelated to academic reasons that kept the three out last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Horne is normally Merritt's backup at outside linebacker.  
Gilbert started in Merritt's absence last week and had seven 
tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	Merritt, who along with Knight was welcomed back to the team  
Monday, is expected to start against Houston, alongside redshirt 
freshman Marvin Constant and freshman Saleem Rasheed. 
</P>
<P>
	Merritt and Knight said Monday their suspensions were for  
failing to complete enough credit hours last fall and both were 
given the option of missing last year's Music City Bowl or this 
year's season opener.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Share Prices Rebound / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices rebounded moderately in thin  
trading today, while the dollar fell against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed up 126.52  
points, or 0.72 percent, to end the day's trade at 17,756.51. On 
Friday, the average closed down 1.26 points, or 0.01 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 109.62 yen late today, down 0.12 yen from late  
Friday in Tokyo and below its late New York level of 110.05 yen on 
Friday. The greenback traded in a narrow range today in Tokyo, 
posting a high of 109.75 yen and hitting a low of 109.34 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign exchange, the dollar slipped marginally in quiet  
trading as market players awaited the release of Japan's April-June 
gross domestic product data on Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on averages of forecasts given by economists surveyed by  
Dow Jones and Nikkei, GDP is expected to have contracted 0.1 
percent from the previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The size of a second supplementary budget to support the economy  
will be determined based on the GDP data, Japanese officials have 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Market watchers say that despite the respite in the dollar's  
recent steady fall against the yen, sentiment for the U.S. currency 
remains weak and that investors are still optimistic about a 
possible economic turnaround developing in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 116.15 yen, down  
from 117.65 late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Tokyo share prices rose following Friday's  
rise of 235.34 points on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial index closed at 11,078.45 on Friday,  
buoyed by slowing U.S. job growth in August, which eased market 
worries about inflationary pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said investors were awaiting a special quotation for the  
settlement of futures and options contracts on Friday as well as 
the release of the gross domestic product data. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a serious shrinkage in GDP, Japan's second  
supplementary budget will expand,'' and that will help stocks, said 
Tsuyosi Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities. He added he 
doesn't expect the data to be very bad. 
</P>
<P>
	As estimated 450 million shares changed hands on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stocks Exchange today, down from 465 million 
shares Friday. Advancers outnumbered decliners 646 to 541, with 149 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed up 15.08 points, or 1.00 percent, to 1,512.08. 
The TOPIX closed up 0.01 points, insignificant in percentage terms, 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 215 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.8000 percent from Friday's finish of 1.8400 percent, 
driving its price up to 100.84 yen from 100.50 yen.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Heirs Buy St. Louis Blues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Fresh from a failure to buy a sports empire in  
Denver, Wal-Mart heirs Bill and Nancy Laurie have purchased the St. 
Louis Blues and Kiel Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale, which coincided with the opening of the Blues'  
training camp, was announced late Monday afternoon in a statement 
released by the team. Terms of the sale were not immediately 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase caps a months-long effort by the Lauries, a  
Columbia, Mo., couple, to enter the world of professional sports 
ownership, and a nearly year-long effort by the partnership that 
owned the Blues to recoup its investment. In March, the Lauries 
were unsuccessful in their attempt to buy the NHL's Colorado 
Avalanche and the NBA's Denver Nuggets and their new home, the 
Pepsi Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nancy and I are looking forward to building on the strong  
Blues hockey tradition in the St. Louis community,'' Bill Laurie 
said in a statement. ``We have been searching for the right sports 
opportunity for several years and, to our delight, we found it 
right down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Laurie planned to meet with the team Tuesday morning, with  
an 11 a.m. (CST) news conference at the Kiel Center to follow. The 
Lauries are the second Columbia entry into the St. Louis sports 
market in recent years; Stan Kroenke is a minority owner of the 
NFL's St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauries were at a movie in Columbia on Monday night, and did  
not immediately return a call to The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauries' Denver deal fell through when shareholders of  
Ascent Entertainment Group, which owned the sports properties, 
filed suit, claiming the $400 million sale price was as much as 
$150 million too low. An out-of-court settlement resulted in an 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Several groups of investors, including one led by former Denver  
Broncos quarterback John Elway, bid on the teams and the arena. The 
winner of that auction, a group headed by Colorado billionaire 
Donald Strum, was then to bid one-on-one against the Lauries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauries declined to take part in the $1 million-per-bid  
second auction, and Strum bought Ascent's sport assests for $461 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiel Partners, a consortium of local businessmen that owns the  
Blues, announced Dec. 30 that it had hired Goldman Sachs, a New 
York investment bank, to explore the team's financial options. They 
included selling the Blues, selling Kiel Center, bringing an NBA 
team to the city, or overhauling Kiel Center's capital structure, 
which includes $96 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months ago, Kiel Parters officially announced that the team  
was for sale. 
</P>

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two 11-year-old children dancing in a parade  
celebrating Caribbean culture were killed Monday when they were hit 
by a float behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, after the parade was over, a 40-year-old man was  
killed by a float along the parade route. Police did not release 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first incident, Joseph Donn and Zacehel David were  
dancing behind a float attached to a truck that stopped suddenly. 
The driver of the next float couldn't stop in time and hit the 
children, police said. 
</P>

	The driver that stopped suddenly was arrested on a charge of  
driving with a suspended license, police said. Four people, 
including two 10-year-old children, were taken to the hospital with

<HEADLINE> Browns Claim Three Off Waivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns claimed three players  
off the waiver wire Monday, including 1997 first-round draft pick 
Jon Harris, a defensive end who played two seasons with 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns also claimed tight end Randy Palmer and defensive  
back Omar Stoutmire. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris was traded by the Eagles to Green Bay on Thursday and the  
Packers waived him on Sunday. The University of Virginia product 
was the 25th overall selection in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7, 300-pound Harris was slowed by an illness in his  
rookie season and lost 36 pounds. He came back last year to start 
four games and make 50 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Harris is a big, lanky guy who does a good job of getting off  
blocks,'' Browns coach Chris Palmer said. ``There are a lot of 
expectations when you're a No. 1 pick. Sometimes a change of 
scenery helps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Palmer, a rookie from Texas A&AMP;M-Kingsville, ``is a guy we  
looked at as a free agent after the draft, but Oakland beat us to 
it,'' the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is very similar to the other tight ends we have (Irv Smith,  
Mark Campbell and Ryan Collins). It will be interesting to watch 
the competition there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stoutmire, a seventh-round draft pick of the Dallas Cowboys in  
1997, started 12 games for them last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a good special teams player,'' Palmer said.  
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said the Browns are heavy at defensive line (with 11  
players) and thin at both running back (four) and offensive line 
(nine), where he expects to add some players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns reduced their roster to 55 by waiving wide receiver  
Jermaine Ross. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need the second-line guys to play special teams, and Ross  
was OK on special teams but not as good as the other guys we 
kept,'' Palmer said.

	Homes Set Afire in E. Timor Capital  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesian troops and pro-Indonesia  
militiamen torched scores of homes -- including that of Nobel Peace 
laureate Bishop Carlos Belo -- and rounded up and deported thousands 
of terrified people from East Timor's capital today. Besieged U.N. 
officials evacuated 300 of the world body's elections workers from 
Dili to Australia. ``The situation in Dili is grim, it borders on 
anarchy with widespread shooting, looting,'' a U.N. spokesman said. 
The mayhem followed a U.N.-sponsored referendum a week ago in which 
78.5 percent of the voters opted to secede from Indonesia.

	Arrests Made in Israel Car Bombings

<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel and the Palestinians expressed hope  
today that two car bombings will not knock the newly revived peace 
process off track. Police said five arrests were made in 
yesterday's bombings in the northern Israeli towns of Haifa and 
Tiberias. Authorities kept the identities of those taken into 
custody secret -- as well as those of the three slain men, 
apparently the bombers. If the men are the bombers, it would mark 
the second time in eight days that Israeli Arabs have been involved 
in terror attacks. Last week, an Israeli Arab stabbed to death an 
Israeli couple, saying he wanted to kill Jews.

<P>
	PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Allen Funt, the television prankster  
whose ``Candid Camera'' thrived on America's willingness to laugh 
at itself and created a trademark phrase, has died. He was 84. Funt 
died yesterday at his home of complications from the 1993 stroke 
that forced him into retirement. ``Candid Camera,'' which aired off 
and on from 1948 to 1990 with Funt as host, secretly filmed people 
confronted with talking mailboxes or trick coffee cups. ``Smile! 
You're on `Candid Camera!' '' was the victim's tipoff.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In the bloodiest incident of the  
three-month peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, Russian soldiers today 
killed three Serbs who fired on them after refusing to stop beating 
two ethnic Albanians wounded in a gunbattle. The Russians ordered 
Serbs to stop beating the two wounded ethnic Albanians. Instead, 
the Serbs shot at the Russians, who returned fire, killing three of 
them, NATO said. There were no Russian casualties. It was the 
deadliest incident so far involving peacekeepers and Kosovo 
civilians.

	KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- Two bombs injured 11 people, mostly  
students, in southern Pakistan in an apparent attack on a Sunni 
Muslim religious school, police said. Minutes after a bomb exploded 
outside the Ashraf-ul-Madaris religious school in Karachi, a second 
bomb ripped through a nearby school bus as teen-age students were 
preparing to board to return home. No one took immediate 
responsibility for the explosions. Police believe the two 
explosions likely targeted the school and its students, who are 
Sunni Muslims.

	Clinton Assails GOP Tax Plan  
</P>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- President Clinton again criticized the  
Republican-passed tax cut plan, saying it would steal money from 
desperately needed school construction programs. About a third of 
American public schools, or 25,000 buildings, need extensive repair 
or replacement, according to the General Accounting Office. The GAO 
also calculated that $112 billion is needed just to repair existing 
schools. The administration claims Republicans' $792 billion tax 
cut program almost ignores school needs in favor of tax breaks for 
the wealthy.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- General Motors Corp. has offered a guarantee of  
lifetime employment to many employees as part of negotiations for a 
new contract with the United Automobile Workers, a newspaper 
reported today. The union's three-year contracts with the major 
automakers are due to expire Sept. 14. Under existing contracts, 
workers effectively have lifetime employment because the terms bar 
automakers from allowing employment to fall by more than 5 percent 
nationally or in any of a dozen regions. Under GM's proposal, the 
lifetime offer would cover current workers with more than 10 years' 
experience, The New York Times reported.

<HEADLINE> 10-Year-Old Begins College </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHLAND, Va. (AP) -- The weight of the textbooks almost knocked  
10-year-old Greg Smith to the floor as he packed his bag. 
Otherwise, the first day of college went off without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years after his parents' dropped him off for the first day  
of second grade, Greg arrived at Randolph-Macon College on Monday 
for a 17-credit honors courseload. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my dream. This is what I want to be happy,'' said  
Greg, who breezed through 10 grades of school in three years and 
graduated third in his high school class of 650 in June. 
</P>
<P>
	On the surface, Greg appears to be a typical kid. He plays  
soccer, likes Bugs Bunny and plays with friends his own age. 
</P>
<P>
	But talk to him further and you learn that he develops  
nonviolent conflict resolution programs. After college, he wants to 
cure cancer and AIDS, colonize space and become president of the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg has already earned attention for his scholastic  
achievements, appearing on the CBS programs ``60 Minutes'' and 
``The Late Show with David Letterman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After classes Monday, Greg climbed on a riser, peered over a  
podium and read to reporters -- from memory -- a prepared statement 
thanking the college, asking the audience to ``walk with me into a 
century of peace and compassion,'' and quoting Eleanor Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg's father, Bob, admitted to being a little nervous, saying  
he thinks he has done the right thing and that ``given how hard he 
has worked, we could not say no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who works in publishing, and his wife, Janet, have moved  
and changed jobs several times to be near Greg during his 
accelerated academic program. 
</P>
<P>
	``To my wife and I, this has never seemed like much of a  
sacrifice,'' Smith said. ``After all, what could be more important 
than a child's education?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg will live with his parents and commute to classes at the  
1,100-student liberal arts college, about 20 miles north of 
Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	After blasting through high school, Greg plans to go through  
Randolph-Macon at more or less a normal pace, finishing in about 
four years. He and his parents looked at other, better known 
schools but chose Randolph-Macon because they liked its small class 
sizes and feared he would be overwhelmed at a larger university. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'm really looking for is a small class environment where  
you can really get to know the professors,'' Greg said. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduation, Greg said he might end up at a larger college  
for one of the three doctorates he wants -- in political science, 
biomedical engineering and aerospace engineering. 
</P>
<P>
	For the time being, he might try out for the school paper. He's  
too young for intercollegiate athletics, and he said he won't join 
a fraternity anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Other students doubted Greg would have a hard time at the  
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be fine,'' 19-year-old Peter Weeks said. ``The girls  
think he's cute.''

<HEADLINE> FALN Prisoners To Discuss Clemency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Sixteen Puerto Ricans jailed on  
sedition and weapons convictions will hold a conference call 
Wednesday to decide whether to accept President Clinton's offer of 
clemency, supporters said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Puerto Rican Pro Human Rights Committee, which has led  
efforts to free the activists, said the prisoners would likely 
announce their decision before the deadline of 5 p.m. on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think very soon we will know what course they will take,''  
said Luis Nieves Falcon, spokesman for the committee, during a news 
conference in San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
	The prisoners are members of the Armed Forces for National  
Liberation and the Macheteros, pro-independence groups that between 
1974 and 1983 staged more than 130 bomb attacks in the United 
States. The attacks killed six people and injured dozens. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the prisoners have been convicted in connection with any  
of the bomb attacks, but the offer has infuriated Congressional 
Republicans and law enforcement agencies, who say the prisoners are 
dangerous terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	They accused Clinton of making the offer in order to win Puerto  
Rican votes for his wife in New York, where she is expected to run 
for Senate. Mrs. Clinton has since disavowed the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Until last week, the Pro Human Rights Committee said that the  
conditions attached to Clinton's clemency were unacceptable. But on 
Monday it softened its stance, saying it would not condemn any 
prisoner who accepted the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a personal decision, and whatever they choose, we will  
respect it,'' Nieves Falcon said. 
</P>
<P>
	To receive clemency, the prisoners would have to renounce  
violence and abide by parole regulations that include avoiding 
people with criminal records. 
</P>
<P>
	The prisoners complain that the latter limits their right to  
meet with fellow activists, since many radical pro-independence 
leaders have criminal records. 
</P>
<P>
	Deadina Ortiz, the mother of prisoner Elizam Escobar, said  
Monday she has a room prepared for him and hopes he accepts the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time that he were home in my house,'' she said. ``I  
respect whatever decision he makes, but my desire is that he come 
home.''

<HEADLINE> Candid Camera Host Allen Funt Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Allen Funt, the television prankster  
whose ``Candid Camera'' thrived on America's willingness to laugh 
at itself and created a trademark phrase, has died. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Funt died Sunday at his home here of complications from the 1993  
stroke that forced him into retirement, the show reported in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Candid Camera,'' which aired off and on from 1948 to 1990 with  
Funt as host, secretly filmed people confronted with talking 
mailboxes or trick coffee cups. ``Smile! You're on `Candid Camera!' 
'' was the victim's tipoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Startled bowlers would see balls returned minus finger holes. A  
car would roll down a hill and stop, and passers-by asked to check 
on the trouble would find it lacked an engine. 
</P>
<P>
	The show was a precursor of reality-genre television shows such  
as ``Cops'' and ``World's Most Dangerous Animals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People toss around the word pioneer all the time but Allen  
Funt was really one of those rare people who was a pioneer. He 
created what has become an entire programming genre,'' said Michael 
Naidus, a spokesman for CBS-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS now airs ``Candid Camera,'' with Funt's son Peter Funt and  
Suzanne Somers as hosts, on Friday evenings. 
</P>
<P>
	Funt himself appeared in many of the gags, along with such  
regulars over the years as Dorothy Collins (in the 1960s) and 
comedian and author Fannie Flagg (``Fried Green Tomatoes'') in the 
1970s. A young Woody Allen appeared in some early shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The TV program was born of Funt's ``Candid Microphone,'' a radio  
show the New York native originated after his Army service in World 
War II. He was working as artist for an ad agency but looking for a 
different job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned the power of radio watching Eleanor Roosevelt do her  
show,'' he recalled in a 1987 interview with The Associated Press. 
``I used to go up to Hyde Park and hold her papers. I was just a 
messenger, but it planted the bug of radio in me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I got my hands on an old wire recorder that was the forerunner  
of tape recorders,'' Funt said. ``That's how it began. In those 
days, we had to lug around these enormous recorders and camera 
equipment and find a place to conceal them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show had its television premiere, still called ``Candid  
Microphone,'' on ABC in 1948. It bounced from one network to 
another in its early years, eventually getting picked up by CBS in 
1960 for a seven-year run. In 1960-61, it was the seventh-best 
rated show in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	A syndicated version ran from 1974-78. In the 1989-90 season,  
CBS aired a number of ``Candid Camera'' specials featuring Funt and 
son Peter as co-hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, Funt produced a new version with comedian Dom DeLuise  
as host. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the years, Funt was never trapped by a hidden camera.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I'd travel, a location station might try it,'' he told  
the AP. ``But it's awfully hard to catch someone who does this for 
a living. ... No, nobody ever really turned the tables on me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Funt was born in New York City and graduated from high school at  
age 15. He later earned a bachelor's degree in fine arts from 
Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	After his stroke, Funt remained an inspiration to his family,  
Peter Funt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He endured many hospitalizations and treatments, yet did so  
with good spirit and a ferocious will to live,'' he said in a 
statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Funt is survived by his five children.

<HEADLINE> Serrano Nixes Mrs. Clinton Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Angered by Hillary Rodham Clinton's statements  
opposing clemency for imprisoned Puerto Rican nationalists, Rep. 
Jose Serrano said he would no longer encourage the first lady to 
run for fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan's U.S. Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm rescinding my encouragement of her candidacy,'' Serrano  
said in today's New York Times. ``Because to me, this is as 
important as Ireland is to the Irish, Israel is to the Jews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who has not yet declared her candidacy for the  
Democratic nomination, said Saturday that President Bill Clinton's 
offer of clemency for 16 FALN members should be withdrawn because 
they have not renounced violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons have come under fire from Republican critics and  
some law enforcement officials who claimed the president's clemency 
offer was aimed at helping his wife garner votes among New York's 
1.3 million Puerto Ricans. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's statements caused reactions of anger and  
amazement among several Puerto Rican leaders here, but none more 
than the Puerto Rican-born Serrano. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an action that will make people go out and make sure  
that she's not our next senator,'' Serrano told the Times. ``Maybe 
it's time to go out and find out who else is interested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serrano's office was closed for the Labor Day holiday on Monday  
and he could not immediately be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other Puerto Rican officials -- State Assemblyman Ruben  
Diaz Jr., City Councilman Jose Rivera and Bronx Borough President 
Fernando Ferrer -- did not go as far as Serrano in threatening to 
pull their support but expressed disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disheartening to see her take this position,'' Diaz said.  
``I hope that they don't think that Puerto Ricans are automatically 
going to come out and vote for her just because she is a Democrat. 
I think there needs to be some dialogue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1970s and 1980s the FALN -- the Spanish initials for  
Armed Forces of National Liberation -- was involved in more than 100 
bombings that killed six and wounded dozens more. 
</P>
<P>
	The imprisoned nationalists were not involved in any deaths.  
They were convicted on charges of seditious conspiracy and 
possession of weapons and explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the nationalists have until 5 p.m. Friday to respond  
in writing to the president's clemency offer.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks Financier's Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- After four months of pursuit,  
international authorities caught up with suspected embezzler Martin 
Frankel at a comfortable waterfront hotel where he had been staying 
for eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The capture Saturday was as undramatic as the disarming, casual  
manner Frankel allegedly used to con millions of dollars from 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a pass key, German and U.S. authorities let themselves  
into Frankel's room. The man who had evaded authorities for months 
didn't resist, saying: ``You got me,'' according to FBI Special 
Agent Michael Wolf in Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, 44, was being held while U.S. officials work on an  
extradition request that could take several months. He faces 
charges of money laundering and wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	He was brought before a judge late Saturday and ordered held on  
the international arrest warrant as well as a German charge of 
using a fake British passport, Hamburg police spokesman Wolfgang 
Ketels said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say Frankel is responsible for a lengthy trail of  
deception -- bilking insurance companies out of millions and 
receiving donations for a bogus foundation set up with the help of 
the Vatican. The Vatican has denied any connection to the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	He showed an impressive biography to hook investors, claiming to  
have a foolproof system for making money off safe government 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for Frankel started May 5 after firefighters  
responding to an alarm at his $3 million mansion in Greenwich found 
a blazing file cabinet and two fireplaces stuffed with burning 
documents. An arrest warrant was issued for Frankel on July 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance company regulators said his unlicensed brokerage had  
siphoned at least $218 million from several insurance companies. A 
lawsuit filed by some of the companies puts the loss at $915 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Also missing is as much as $1.98 billion from the St. Francis of  
Assisi Foundation, which investigators say was established by 
Frankel last August in the British Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel has been described by some investors as the Hugh Hefner  
of high finance, living with women he met through personal ads, 
some of whom also worked in his office. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear why Frankel came to Germany. Police  
said he checked into Hamburg's Prem hotel about eight weeks ago 
using a phony name. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel was believed to have been in Italy earlier this summer.  
He may have been financing his run with more than $10 million in 
diamonds and gold he bought before disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities seized an unspecified sum of cash, diamonds and a  
computer in his hotel room, Wolf said. Hamburg police spokesman 
Hans-Juergen Petersen said Frankel also had ``a number of 
passports'' with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel was accompanied by a woman, identified by the FBI in  
Connecticut as Cynthia Allison, 35. Allison was traveling under the 
alias Susan Kelly, according to the FBI, which did not elaborate on 
her relationship to Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen said the woman was taken into custody but was later  
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Keefe, Frankel's U.S. lawyer, said he has spoken to  
Frankel's German lawyer, who told him that ``under the 
circumstances, Marty seemed to be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keefe also said he had spoken to Allison, who disputes  
authorities' version of the arrest. She said no FBI agent was 
present and that Frankel never said ``You got me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under German law, the United States has 40 days from the time of  
arrest to make an extradition request, but can also get a 20-day 
extension. The case will be heard by the highest state court in 
Hamburg, but extradition is decided by the Justice Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Godzilla Returns to Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Godzilla has returned -- and it's not the slick,  
computer-enhanced creation of Hollywood, but the honest-to-goodness 
original in all its skyscraper stomping, zipper-up-the-back glory. 
</P>
<P>
	Many fans of the legendary lizard felt the U.S. film last year  
strayed too far from the spirit of the original. The Hollywood 
creature, for example, looked nothing like the original and 
slithered around Manhattan skyscrapers rather than flattening 
everything in its path. 
</P>
<P>
	But Japan's quintessential B-movie monster is rediscovering its  
roots in ``Godzilla Millennium,'' now being filmed by Toho Co., the 
studio that gave birth to the world's favorite mutant dinosaur in a 
1954 classic. 
</P>
<P>
	The new episode in the Godzilla saga -- this is Toho's 23rd  
Godzilla movie -- is due out in December, and is aimed at saving the 
raging reptile's reputation after the widespread panning of the 
big-budget Hollywood release. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't feel love for Godzilla in the U.S. version,'' said  
Tsutomu Kitagawa, a 41-year-old actor who wore the 180-pound, 
sweltering rubber Godzilla suit during a recent Tokyo shoot. ``In 
Japan, people treat Godzilla with respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To prepare for the Godzilla role, Kitagawa made a point of  
studying the old Toho movies in search of the monster's unique 
charm and to do justice to its grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the secret, he found, was the Godzilla strut.  
</P>
<P>
	``Godzilla heads straight to his goal, no matter what stands in  
his way. In that sense, he's a lot like me,'' said Kitagawa, who 
stands five-foot-three but plays a 180-foot giant reptile. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting a common opinion here, director Kenji Suzuki said the  
American rendition looked more like a sequel to ``Jurassic Park'' 
than a true Godzilla film. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they were going to call it Godzilla, they should have come  
up with a more Godzilla-like Godzilla,'' Suzuki said during an 
interview at the Toho set. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony's Columbia-TriStar, which made the 1998 ``Godzilla,'' has  
distribution rights in the United States, so the new film will only 
be shown in Japan. But it will eventually be available on video in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	With a budget of $10 million, a fraction of the $100 million  
Hollywood ``Godzilla,'' Toho's version doesn't try to get fancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of miniature models of buildings and telephone poles --  
Godzilla's beloved stomping grounds and the film's main settings -- 
have been carefully crafted with glue and spray paint. Some are 
shattered once and then pasted together to make sure the pieces go 
flying apart just right. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie opens with Godzilla emerging from the ocean in an  
eerie fog. From there, Godzilla treks to a nuclear power plant, 
drawn by the radioactivity that was behind its fateful rebirth, 
caused by nuclear testing in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie does use some computer-graphics technology, including  
a still-secret climactic metamorphosis. But the filmmakers say the 
special effects never become more important than the story -- and 
care is taken so that the miniatures never upstage the monster. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's like a childhood friend,'' said 37-year-old set designer  
Isao Takahashi, who like many Japanese of his generation grew up on 
Godzilla movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seeing the American Godzilla was like meeting a stranger with  
the same name.''

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Goaltender Hextall Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VOORHEES, N.J. (AP) -- Ron Hextall understood all too clearly. He  
is 35 years old, and it was time to leave hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	The player who helped send Philadelphia to the Stanley Cup  
Finals 12 years ago, when he was the league's best goalie, retired 
Monday and will become a scout for the Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a million things in a bowl that I kind of grinded  
together and it all came out pointing to the fact that it was time 
to move on,'' Hextall said during a news conference at the Flyers' 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just told them upstairs that I wanted to play this year. But  
you know with my body aging and all the (other) factors, most 
things pointed to the fact that it was time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hextall said he had been offered a deal to play with Calgary,  
but chose the job with the Flyers. He cited ongoing hip problems 
and family concerns for not wanting to leave Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Hextall was released by the Flyers this summer after playing  
backup all season. He was not claimed in the expansion draft and 
his retirement was expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to be a guy who kind of hung on,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bob Clarke credited Hextall with strong passing  
skills that paved the way for such outstanding goaltenders as 
Colorado's Patrick Roy and New Jersey's Martin Brodeur. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron probably changed the position of goaltending in the  
National Hockey League. He was the first one that came in and 
handled the puck better than most of our defensemen,'' Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team waived Hextall July 1, and since no team claimed him  
the Flyers must buy out the final year of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 10-7-4 with a 2.53 goals-against average last season and  
has a 296-214-69 career record. The Atlanta Thrashers, wanting 
younger and less expensive players, did not select him in the 
expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	A 13-year veteran, Hextall backed up John Vanbiesbrouck last  
year, overtaking Bernie Parent for the team lead with 240 
victories. Hextall also is No. 1 on the Flyers' career lists for 
games, playoff games and playoff victories. He was the starting 
goalie for the Wales Conference in the 1988 All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	Hextall was drafted by the Flyers in 1982, then traded to Quebec  
in the seven-player deal in which the Flyers acquired Eric Lindros 
on June 20, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Hextall was later traded to the New York Islanders, playing one  
season before being dealt back to the Flyers in 1994.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Markets Closed for Holiday / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock markets in the United States are closed  
today for the Labor Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks raced higher Friday after the government's employment  
report calmed fears about rising inflation and prompted a broad 
rally that included the biggest point gain in the history of the 
Nasdaq composite index. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 235.24 to close at  
11,078.45. The Dow ended an extremely volatile week with a loss of 
11.72, or just 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq rose 108.87 to 2,843.11, surpassing the previous high  
for a one-day point gain, 103.16, set on June 16. With Friday's 
gain, the index shot within sight of its record close of 2,864.48, 
set July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks soared after the Labor Department reported that employers  
added 124,000 jobs to their payrolls in August, fewer than most 
economists expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps more significantly, the report showed that average  
hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, rose just 0.2 
percent in August, a 3.5 percent increase compared with a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Both figures helped ease concerns that the economy is  
overheating and that inflation is rising, and they provided good 
news for investors who believe that any inflationary signs could 
prompt the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee to raise 
interest rates for a third time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be the only employment report published before the  
FOMC meeting on Oct. 5, and it does not represent a compelling 
case,'' for a rate increase, said Michael Moran, chief economist at 
Daiwa Securities America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed has raised interest rates twice this summer and hinted  
it won't raise them again if the economy is moderating and 
inflation remains tame. Higher interest rates cut into corporate 
profits by raising the cost of borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices also rose on the employment report, pushing yields  
on 30-year Treasuries down to 6.01 percent from 6.13 percent late 
Thursday. That provided a strong boost to stocks, which tend to 
tumble when bond yields are rising and becoming an attractive 
investment alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has slipped recently as interest rate fears have  
been preying on investors,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice 
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ``But the payroll data eased those 
rate fears and buyers stepped up to the plate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks, the most sensitive to interest rate changes,  
surged higher. J.P. Morgan, up 7 7/8 to 133 13/16, and American 
Express, up 6 1/8 to 142, were the biggest gainers in the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris rose 2 3/8 to 39 1/2 as a Florida appeals court ruled  
that damage claims in a landmark smoking case must be considered 
one smoker at a time, effectively removing the possibility of a 
single multibillion-dollar verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks, which dominate the Nasdaq, also rallied.  
Microsoft rose 4 to 95 13/16, extending its robust gains of the 
past week. Yahoo! soared 13 7/16 to 155, and online auctioneer eBay 
jumped 12 9/16 to 134. 
</P>
<P>
	National Discount Brokers fell 5 1/2 to 25 3/4 after the company said  
earnings in its fiscal first quarter will be well below Wall Street 
estimates. The online brokerage cited higher-than-expected costs 
for advertising and write-offs for old technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest loser in the Dow was Coca-Cola, which fell 2 1/8 to 57 3/8  
after it warned third-quarter earnings will fall short of Wall 
Street forecasts because of weak beverage sales in Asia and South 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 38.13 to 1,357.24, and the  
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 8.55 to 435.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-4 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. Volume of all NYSE-listed shares 
totaled 801.02 million shares, compared with 813.09 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The good economic news prompted many investors to stay in the  
market in what was expected to be a quiet session ahead of the 
three-day holiday weekend. U.S. financial markets will be closed 
Monday in observance of Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.01 percent. The  
rally on Wall Street pulled most European indexes sharply higher, 
however, as Germany's DAX index gained 2.8 percent, Britain's FT-SE 
100 gained 2.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 2.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> States Press HMOs To Pay On Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	After several months of phone calls and letters trying to  
collect thousands of dollars from Horizon Blue Cross and Blue 
Shield of New Jersey, Dr. Anthony Musarra was getting frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
	Late payments from the health maintenance organization were  
forcing the Absecon, N.J., internist to go further into debt to pay 
his office expenses. So he asked state officials for help. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey regulators found they had complaints from more than a  
dozen doctors accusing the HMO of lateness in paying claims. On 
June 15, the state warned Horizon it could be fined up to $10,000 
for appropriate claims not paid within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Within days, Musarra said, checks from Horizon began arriving  
and the HMO apologized for the delay. 
</P>
<P>
	After years watching the escalating feud between HMOs and  
doctors and hospitals, states are becoming more aggressive in 
making sure that plans pay claims. Many states have passed laws to 
specify how quickly HMOs must make payments, and they're issuing 
warnings to plans that don't comply. States including New York, 
Florida, North Carolina and Louisiana have started handing out 
fines. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it goes to the state, the plan gets worried and does  
something about it,'' Musarra said. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators say they're acting to protect patients. They note  
some health providers illegally bill patients when an HMO balks at 
paying. And patients could be hurt if hospitals or doctors curtail 
services because of financial problems resulting from claim 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Murray, of Port Charlotte, Fla., said bill collectors  
sent by doctors and hospitals hounded her late husband as he was 
dying of heart disease. The Murrays expected his HMO, Physician 
Corp. of America (since purchased by Humana), to cover his medical 
bills. The health plan resisted, saying the Murrays had not paid 
their premiums on time, a charge the couple disputed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time I took him to the hospital he asked me to sue  
them, but I never did,'' said Ms. Murray, who eventually paid some 
of the bills herself. J.C. Murray died in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	HMO industry officials, which defend their record in paying  
claims on time, say they're not surprised that more states are 
closely scrutinizing claims payment, because government agencies 
already regulate what services the plans must cover and how much 
they can increase premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``States are getting more into the micromanagement of health  
plans in a lot of areas,'' said Susan Pisano, spokeswoman for the 
American Association of Health Plans. 
</P>
<P>
	HMO officials say doctors and hospitals often make mistakes in  
filling out claims, or send them in late, and that's what often 
delays payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Hillman, spokesman for Horizon Blue Cross and Blue Shield,  
said the company denies New Jersey regulators' allegations about 
late payments. He noted the company pays 30 million claims a year, 
and only a few thousand are in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight states -- Florida, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina,  
Colorado, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Virginia -- have passed laws in 
1999 requiring HMOs to pay bills within a certain time or face 
penalties or fines, according to the National Conference of State 
Legislatures. In all, 28 states now have HMO prompt-payment bills, 
most approved in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
	While hospital executives and doctors are pleased to have the  
states on their side, they say the fines are too small to have much 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting fined $1,000, what's that do to a large corporation?''  
said Sarah Smith, of the Greater New York Hospital Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Clifford Sales, a Westfield, N.J.,surgeon, said he's  
struggled for years to get HMOs to pay on time. He contends HMOs 
purposely withhold money to increase profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``When my wife called the plumber, he doesn't leave without  
getting paid, but with HMOs, we are forced to wait and wait and 
wait,'' said Sales, who this year filed a complaint with New Jersey 
regulators, citing about $52,000 in overdue claims from Oxford 
Health Plans. ``I'm glad the state takes an interest, but I'm not 
sure it will help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oxford, whose claims-paying ability has come under scrutiny in  
New York and New Jersey, acknowledges it had problems paying bills 
on time a year ago, but has resolved them. It said New York and New 
Jersey regulators have pursued the company because Oxford has the 
most members in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of our physicians say they are being paid promptly,''  
said spokeswoman Francesca Trainor. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxford has paid $71,100 in fines this year to the New York  
Insurance Department for lateness in paying claims. Oxford and 
Aetna U.S. Healthcare, which has paid $15,900 in penalties, have 
accounted for the bulk of the violations in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida, meanwhile, fined six HMOs this summer for denying  
payment to hospitals and doctors for treatment of people in 
emergency rooms, or taking too long to pay emergency department 
bills. Wellcare HMO was fined $80,000, the biggest penalty 
assessed.

<HEADLINE> eBay Removes Baby Sale Offers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Less than a week after a kidney was  
offered on the online auction site eBay, at least three listings of 
babies for sale were posted on the Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	All appeared to be hoaxes and were taken down, Steve Westly,  
eBay's marketing vice president, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	One posting, offering a baby boy, drew a high bid of $109,100.  
</P>
<P>
	The seller purported to offer a boy, due to be born later this  
month, who would be the child of two law students at the University 
of Chicago. The posting also offered ``intelligence scores of 
parents ... upon request.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selling children is illegal. The company would not say whether  
law-enforcement officials were investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at eBay said they believe the postings were at least  
partially inspired by the kidney offering, in which a Florida man 
received bids of up to $5.6 million. eBay said that was also 
probably a prank. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, San Jose-based eBay banned the sale of guns  
and ammunition on the site, after people tried selling a missile, a 
bazooka, a rocket launcher and other military weapons.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Tracing Fatal E. coli Bacteria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- High levels of E. coli bacteria found at a  
county fair's water supply could be the link that connects the 
death of a 3-year-old girl and the sickening of 118 fairgoers, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain water runoff from a barn housing hundreds of cattle  
apparently seeped into an aquifer used to supply the Washington 
County Fairgrounds, state Health Department spokeswoman Kristine A. 
Smith said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Water samples taken over the weekend showed high levels of E.  
coli bacteria. Smith said scientists must test the bacteria to 
verify whether it is the potentially deadly strain that sent scores 
of doubled-over patients to area hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	``What could have happened is that the storm event brought  
cattle fecal material to the ground surface, where it leaked into 
the soil and through to the aquifer,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who became ill -- mostly children -- have been treated at  
hospitals in New York, Vermont and Massachusetts since Friday. At 
least 41 remained hospitalized Sunday evening, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	All had visited the Washington County Fair in the town of  
Greenwich, about 35 miles north of Albany, on either Aug. 28 or 29 
-- the final days of the weeklong fair, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rachel Aldrich, 3, of Clifton Park, died Saturday at Albany  
Medical Center Hospital. She had been in critical condition with E. 
coli contamination since Friday, according to hospital spokesman 
Richard Puff. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl died after developing hemolytic uremic syndrome, or  
HUS, as a result of the E. coli contamination, Smith said. HUS 
attacks the blood cells and can result in kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
	By Sunday evening, a 4-year-old boy also had developed HUS and  
was being treated at Albany Medical Center Hospital, Smith said. 
The boy was listed in serious condition today. 
</P>
<P>
	State and county health officials interviewed the steady stream  
of patients over the weekend, but couldn't uncover any common foods 
or activities that could have caused the illness. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of water contamination ``would explain why  
people who had different foods and drinks from different booths got 
sick,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Water went into the booths there, and could have been used for  
things like making lemonade, fruit juice, ice, rinsing lettuce for 
sandwiches and washing people's hands,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 27,000 people attended the fair on its last day, officials  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	E. coli bacteria normally live in the intestines of humans and  
other warm-blooded animals. Most strains are harmless but some, 
including 0157:H7, can be deadly. Symptoms of the infection include 
abdominal cramps, diarrhea and fever. 
</P>
<P>
	E. coli bacteria must be ingested to cause infection. Illness  
can be caused by exposure to an infected person, or by ingesting 
tainted food or liquids.

<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Quarterback Jim Druckenmiller, a first-round bust  
in San Francisco, was traded to the Miami Dolphins on Monday for a 
conditional draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade had been expected since the 49ers kept four  
quarterbacks when they cut their roster on Sunday: Steve Young, 
Jeff Garcia, Steve Stentstrom and Druckenmiller. 
</P>
<P>
	In Miami, Druckenmiller joins coach Jimmy Johnson's cast of  
other unwanteds, some of whom have produced, some of whom haven't 
and some of whom are still waiting, like defensive end Dimitrius 
Underwood, the defensive end who walked out of Minnesota's camp 
after being taken No. 1 and was injured last week in his first 
exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins released No. 3 quarterback Craig Erickson on  
Friday. Damon Huard has been the No. 2 quarterback since the middle 
of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers passed on Jake Plummer, whom many of their scouts  
liked, to take Druckenmiller with the 26th overall pick in the 
first round of the 1997 draft. Plummer has since become one of the 
best young quarterbacks in the NFL with Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	In two seasons with the 49ers, Druckenmiller was active for only  
six games, starting one. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 21-of-52 for 239 yards with one touchdown and four  
interceptions -- all in his rookie year. His quarterback rating was 
a minuscule 29.2. 
</P>
<P>
	His only start came in a 15-12 win in 1997 over St. Louis. He  
was 10-of-28 for 102 yards with one touchdown and three 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller, who will turn 27 on Sept. 19, was a two-year  
starter at Virginia Tech. He was fourth on the Hokies' career list 
with 4,382 passing yards. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, he was acquitted of a rape charge in Blacksburg, Va. He  
still is facing a lawsuit filed by two men who say he assaulted 
them with three other men outside a Blacksburg bar.

<HEADLINE> Life on the Run Prepared Bradley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Room service and television are facts of life  
for professional athletes. To Bill Bradley, they meant opportunity 
wasted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every city we enter is full of crises and problems that never  
reach us in a hotel room,'' he wrote during his days as a New York 
Knick. 
</P>
<P>
	So Bradley used his peripatetic existence to study America. He  
dined with fans, consulted with local politicians, visited 
out-of-the way neighborhoods. ``Under his guidance, we'd visit an 
art museum in Houston, or a spectacular shoreline vista in Oregon, 
or attend a political lecture in Boston,'' recalled former Knick 
Phil Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	But such a lifestyle carried risks: After a night game in  
Chicago, Bradley and two friends were robbed at gunpoint while 
meeting outside the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley titled his basketball memoirs ``Life on the Run.'' These  
days, the former New Jersey senator is back on the run, 
crisscrossing the nation in his campaign for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	To both basketball and politics, Bradley has applied the same  
serious, studious, workaholic attitude. He is a 6-foot-5 
contradiction: independent and introspective, but drawn to public 
pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime supporters say they are drawn to Bradley's integrity  
and intelligence, though his meticulousness can be maddening. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill goes through this minute and detailed and, from my point  
of view, excruciating soul-searching before he comes to a 
decision,'' said Bradley's wife of 25 years, Ernestine. ``That's 
just who Bill is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley turned down a scholarship at basketball powerhouse Duke  
to attend Princeton. When professional basketball beckoned, he left 
for Oxford. Supporters urged him to run for president in 1988 and 
1992, but he declined -- only to enter the 2000 campaign as the 
underdog to Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	If not for his contrary streak, he might be in the other party  
today. Bradley came to Washington in 1964 as a summer intern for 
Pennsylvania Rep. Richard Schweiker, a Republican, and quickly 
moved to the presidential campaign of Republican William Scranton. 
</P>
<P>
	But on his own that summer, he sat in the Senate gallery and  
watched the debate over the Civil Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when I became a Democrat,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is famously frugal despite a wealth now exceeding $5  
million. His rumpled clothing stood out amid the flashy dressers on 
the Knicks. In 1996, his final year as a senator, he was still 
puttering around New Jersey in a 1984 Oldsmobile with 160,000 miles 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
	His biggest vice is cashews. His wife worries that eating too  
many will worsen his double chin. 
</P>
<P>
	William Warren Bradley, an only child, was born July 28, 1943 in  
Crystal City, Mo., a factory town of 3,500 on the Mississippi 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Warren, a Republican, was the quiet, dependable  
president of the local bank, physically limited due to severe 
arthritis. His mother, Susan, was a former teacher who had her son 
take lessons in everything from typing to swimming, the French horn 
to the French language. (Dad drew the line at ballet.) 
</P>
<P>
	Young Bill spent countless hours alone with a basketball, pieces  
of lead in his sneakers to improve his jumping. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen a little boy as focused as Bill was,'' said  
Carol Cunningham, who lived next door. ``This concept that if you 
were going to do anything, then you had to do it the very best you 
can, is from his mother. She had the strongest will I've ever seen 
in any human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a freshman at Princeton, Bradley ``was constantly afraid of  
flunking out,'' said classmate Dan Okimoto. ``He approached studies 
with the same intensity, commitment, determination, discipline that 
he approached basketball. He would go study until 2 a.m. after a 
basketball game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Bradley found time to teach Sunday school at Princeton's  
First Presbyterian Church and to have a social life, including some 
dates with Diane Sawyer, then a student at Wellesley College. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-time All-American at Princeton, Bradley led the U.S.  
basketball team to the gold medal at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	He raised eyebrows outside the sport as well. In 1964, New York  
Post columnist Leonard Shecter wrote, ``In 25 years or so our 
presidents are going to have to be better than ever. It's nice to 
know that Bill Bradley will be available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Knicks offered him a contract in 1965, Bradley declined  
and attended Oxford University on a Rhodes Scholarship. He traveled 
through Europe, played other sports, gained 30 pounds, grappled 
with religious faith. 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball ultimately reclaimed his interest, and in 1967 the  
Knicks signed ``Dollar Bill'' Bradley to a four-year, $500,000 
contract. He joined the team in midseason after five months in the 
Air Force Reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	There were many jokes about Bill Bradley the athlete, including  
this one: on his highest jump, a newspaper could not fit under his 
feet. Bradley laughed his way to 10,439 career points, two 
championships and a place in basketball's Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970, a documentary production company wanted Bradley to  
interview poet Marianne Moore, a sports fan. Company employee 
Ernestine Schlant, who lived in Bradley's building on the 
Manhattan's west side, slipped the proposal underneath his door. 
</P>
<P>
	The project was scrubbed when Moore fell ill. But Bradley and  
Schlant began dating and were married in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Bubbly and talkative next to her low-key husband, the  
German-born Schlant is now a professor of German and comparative 
literature at New Jersey's Montclair State University. Their 
daughter, Theresa Ann, is 22 and a college student. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple fretted that Bradley's New Jersey-Washington commute  
was depriving e their daughter of a full-time dad. When Theresa was 
10, she moved to Washington and enrolled in school. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernestine became the commuting parent; Bill became the  
breakfast-fixing, drive-to-school dad, and took to the task. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe it or not, he makes the best cereal mixtures,''  
marveled his wife. ``You don't just pour one brand of cereal in a 
plate, but you mix the various brands, and you add raisins or you 
add blueberries or you add whatever you bought the night before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ernestine's daughter from a first marriage, Stephanie, has four  
children, who crane their necks to talk to the man they know as 
``Papa Bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley ran for Senate in 1978 from his adopted state of New  
Jersey. At 35, he became the nation's youngest senator. 
</P>
<P>
	His signature achievement, the 1986 tax reform, offered a window  
into his style. First he immersed himself in the tax code. Then he 
wrote a detailed plan, published in 1984 as ``The Fair Tax.'' He 
crossed party lines to work with the Reagan administration. He even 
shot hoops in the House gymnasium with Rep. Marty Russo, D-Ill., 
while lobbying for his support. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley breezed to re-election in 1984 but got the political  
scare of a lifetime in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	While he raised more than $12 million and appeared in playful  
ads shooting baskets, Republican challenger Christie Whitman 
criticized him for refusing to discuss tax increases imposed by 
Democratic Gov. Jim Florio. Whitman came within 50,000 votes of an 
upset. 
</P>
<P>
	The close call prompted Bradley to be more outspoken on issues  
dear to his heart, like race relations. In a 1992 speech, he 
whacked a pencil against the Senate lectern 56 times to dramatize 
the beating of black motorist Rodney King by Los Angeles police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley says he is thankful he declined to run for president in  
1992. His wife was diagnosed with breast cancer later that year, 
and Bradley was by her side as she recovered from surgery and 
chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Declaring politics ``broken,'' Bradley announced in 1995 that he  
would retire from the Senate the following year. Disappointed 
supporters wondered if his days in politics were over. 
</P>
<P>
	But it turns out that Bradley just needed some time to be Bill  
Bradley. He spent two years traveling, consulting, teaching and 
listening, before finally declaring himself ready for the game of 
his life.

<HEADLINE> MIAs Top U.S. Concerns in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Four small wooden boxes holding what are  
believed to be the remains of U.S. soldiers killed during the 
Vietnam War were loaded aboard a Hawaii-bound transport plane for 
the next phase of what Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on 
Tuesday called ``the emotionally brutal'' process of trying to 
identify the war dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright and U.S. Ambassador Pete Peterson were among a small  
group of Vietnamese officials and journalists who attended the 
repatriation ceremony on the tarmac at Hanoi International Airport. 
The suspected remains are being flown to a lab in Hawaii where they 
will be compared with DNA of missing soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The work of recovering remains is emotionally brutal, and  
there is no guarantee of success,'' Albright told the crowd. ``But 
we persevere in this intensive effort because the United States 
will never forget our fallen, and our missing, and the sacrifice of 
their families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright has made it clear during her two-day stopover in  
Vietnam that accounting for American MIAs is the United States' top 
priority in Vietnam. She also spoke about the importance of trade 
and economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, who heads later Tuesday to the Asia Pacific Economic  
Cooperation summit in New Zealand, told a news conference in Hanoi 
that she is grateful for Vietnamese cooperation in tracking down 
and recovering the remains of former U.S. soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains flown out of Vietnam Tuesday were uncovered during  
the most recent of the five joint U.S.-Vietnam digs that are held 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This issue remains paramount to the United States,'' Albright  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooperation on the MIA issue is one of the bright spots in the  
relationship between Washington and Hanoi that has developed since 
normalization of relations began in 1995, 20 years after the end of 
the Vietnam war. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to excavating suspected plane crash or battle sites,  
U.S. officials have been providing their Vietnamese counterparts 
with access to U.S. military records to help track down the remains 
of the estimated 200,000 Vietnamese MIAs. 
</P>
<P>
	Vietnam's assistance has directly led to steady progress in  
other areas, particularly as the poor communist country seeks to 
develop its economy. Caught in the fallout from the Asian financial 
crisis, Vietnam's economic reforms have slowed to a crawl in the 
last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have been moving quickly in recent months to conclude  
a bilateral trade agreement between Vietnam and the United States 
that is expected to mean hundreds of millions of dollars in trade 
and investment in the Southeast Asian country and possibly paving 
the way for its accession to the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The subject came up with every official Albright spoke to  
Monday: Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, Communist Party chief Le Kha 
Phieu and Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam. 
</P>
<P>
	``We spent a great deal of time in all the meetings today on the  
importance of the trade agreement,'' Albright told a news 
conference, adding that she was hopeful of signing a final deal at 
the APEC summit. That would send it to both countries' legislatures 
for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials traveling with Albright said negotiators also  
were on the verge of a number of other agreements, including 
export-import bank assistance, aviation code-sharing, and 
cooperation in science and technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright told Phieu that she has seen many changes since her  
first visit two years ago, but later added that much remained to be 
done to help a country plagued by a debt-ridden financial system, 
conflicting laws and widespread corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pace of economic reform is not as rapid or as steady as we  
would like,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Vietnam was ``denying itself benefits'' that would come  
with improving its international standing by dealing with 
human-rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In turn, Vietnamese reporters grilled Albright about America's  
human-rights record, raising the investigation into the siege of 
the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, U.S. involvement in 
Kosovo and the status of American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vietnamese also raised the issue of Agent Orange -- the toxic  
defoliant that was widely used by U.S. forces during the Vietnam 
war -- and which has been blamed for a number of illnesses and birth 
defects, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	One official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Albright  
thought there should be joint research on Agent Orange before any 
talk of U.S. contributions to funds for reported victims.

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Ron Hextall Retiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VOORHEES, N.J. (AP) -- Ron Hextall is retiring from hockey,  
ending a career in which he led the Philadelphia Flyers to the 
Stanley Cup 12 years ago when he was the league's best goalie. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was to come today at a news conference at the  
Flyers' training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old goalie was released by the Flyers this summer  
after playing backup all season. He was not claimed in the 
expansion draft and his retirement was expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be nice if we could keep him in the organization,''  
general manager Bob Clarke said this summer. ``We like Ron a lot. 
We just feel that it's time for a young goaltender to start 
developing with the Flyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team waived Hextall July 1, and since no team claimed him  
the Flyers must buy out the final year of his contract. It is 
unclear whether he might be offered a job in the front office or as 
an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 10-7-4 with a 2.53 goals-against average last season and  
has a 296-214-69 career record. The Atlanta Thrashers, wanting 
younger and less expensive players, did not select him in the 
expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	A 13-year veteran, Hextall backed up John Vanbiesbrouck last  
year, overtaking Bernie Parent for the team lead with 240 
victories. Hextall also is No. 1 on the Flyers' career lists for 
games, playoff games and playoff victories. He was the starting 
goalie for the Wales Conference in the 1988 All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	Hextall was drafted by the Flyers in 1982, then traded to Quebec  
in the seven-player deal in which the Flyers acquired Eric Lindros 
on June 20, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers traded Hextall, Peter Forsberg, Steve Duchesne, Kerry  
Huffman, Mike Ricci, Chris Simon, a first-round draft pick and $15 
million to the Nordiques for Lindros. 
</P>
<P>
	Hextall was later traded to the New York Islanders, playing one  
season before being dealt back to the Flyers in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Serrano Nixes Mrs. Clinton Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Angered by Hillary Rodham Clinton's statements  
opposing clemency for imprisoned Puerto Rican nationalists, Rep. 
Jose Serrano said he would no longer encourage the first lady to 
run for fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan's U.S. Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm rescinding my encouragement of her candidacy,'' Serrano  
said in today's New York Times. ``Because to me, this is as 
important as Ireland is to the Irish, Israel is to the Jews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who has not yet declared her candidacy for the  
Democratic nomination, said Saturday that President Bill Clinton's 
offer of clemency for 16 FALN members should be withdrawn because 
they have not renounced violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons have come under fire from Republican critics and  
some law enforcement officials who claimed the president's clemency 
offer was aimed at helping his wife garner votes among New York's 
1.3 million Puerto Ricans. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's statements caused reactions of anger and  
amazement among several Puerto Rican leaders here, but none more 
than the Puerto Rican-born Serrano. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an action that will make people go out and make sure  
that she's not our next senator,'' Serrano told the Times. ``Maybe 
it's time to go out and find out who else is interested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serrano's office was closed for the Labor Day holiday on Monday  
and he could not immediately be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other Puerto Rican officials -- State Assemblyman Ruben  
Diaz Jr., City Councilman Jose Rivera and Bronx Borough President 
Fernando Ferrer -- did not go as far as Serrano in threatening to 
pull their support but expressed disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disheartening to see her take this position,'' Diaz said.  
``I hope that they don't think that Puerto Ricans are automatically 
going to come out and vote for her just because she is a Democrat. 
I think there needs to be some dialogue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1970s and 1980s the FALN -- the Spanish initials for  
Armed Forces of National Liberation -- was involved in more than 100 
bombings that killed six and wounded dozens more. 
</P>
<P>
	The imprisoned nationalists were not involved in any deaths.  
They were convicted on charges of seditious conspiracy and 
possession of weapons and explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the nationalists have until 5 p.m. Friday to respond  
in writing to the president's clemency offer.

<HEADLINE> Padres' Nevin Revitalizes Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Phil Nevin has finally replaced Ken Caminiti at  
third base. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, it was supposed to have happened 4 1/2 seasons ago in  
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Nevin's roundabout career, which has included three  
trades and a big attitude adjustment, has been revived at the hot 
corner in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Padres stagger along in their lost season, Nevin, the  
top pick overall in the June 1992 draft, grabbed onto what he knew 
was probably his last chance to be an everyday player. 
</P>
<P>
	When George Arias couldn't handle the job as Caminiti's  
replacement in San Diego's post-World Series retooling, it was 
given to Nevin. He responded with 10 homers and 31 RBIs in August, 
stats that compare to his best previous season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of taken a while, but I guess it's come full  
circle,'' Nevin said at the end of his hot August. ``It's like 
going back home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevin cautions that it's just been a month. But, said general  
manager Kevin Towers, ``I'd have to say we found ourselves a third 
baseman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres think so much of Nevin that on Monday they were  
finalizing a $2.5 million, two-year contract with an option that 
would pay him $2.6 million in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres acquired Nevin from Anaheim in spring training  
because they needed a third catcher. Now Towers envisions Nevin 
bridging the gap at third until acclaimed prospect Sean Burroughs -- 
son of former AL MVP Jeff Burroughs -- comes up. Even after that, 
Nevin can play another position. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevin, who also took over the cleanup spot, is hitting .274 with  
a team-high 72 RBIs. He's second with 22 homers. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a long climb back for Nevin, who just three years ago  
found himself all the way down in Double-A, learning how to catch. 
</P>
<P>
	With the exception of the events surrounding the replacement  
spring training of 1995, Nevin blames no one but himself. In just a 
few years he went from being big man on campus at Cal State 
Fullerton to an angry young man who fumed every time he made an 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevin, 28, knows why he didn't stick in the big leagues earlier.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was too immature to realize the true joy of playing in the  
major leagues. I took it for granted,'' he said. ``I did nothing to 
deserve being a major league player. I'm very glad I went through 
those times, because there's no way I'd be doing what I'm doing now 
if I hadn't gone through that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was spoiled,'' he said. ``To be honest, things came easy.''  
</P>
<P>
	After being drafted by Houston, Nevin saw no reason why he  
couldn't quickly become a superstar. After all, in 1992 he won the 
Golden Spikes Award as the nation's top amateur player, was named 
MVP of the College World Series even though the Titans lost the 
championship game, and started for the U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
	After two years at Triple-A, reality buzzed him like a knockdown  
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Caminiti went to the Padres in a 12-player trade in December  
1994, apparently giving Nevin a shot at the job. With the players' 
strike still under way, the Astros wanted Nevin to play in the 
spring replacement games. He refused and was sent home. 
</P>
<P>
	He started the season back at Triple-A and was still there when  
the strike ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely was punished because I wasn't a replacement  
player,'' Nevin said. ``I still don't understand that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he was called up that June he hit .117 in 18 games.  
</P>
<P>
	By then, Nevin had become well-known as a ``snap artist.'' In  
Triple-A, he needed 18 stitches in one hand after trying to rip a 
water fountain off a wall. Another time, he threw a bat into the 
rack so hard that bounced back out, hitting him in the face. 
</P>
<P>
	Padres teammate Dave Magadan, who was platooning at third for  
the Astros in 1995, remembers Nevin's temper. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he was living and dying with every at-bat instead of  
just getting his feet wet,'' Magadan said. ``If he got a hit he was 
OK, but if he made an out, he'd snap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevin has learned to temper his temper, although he did trash a  
dugout restroom in Philadelphia earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to make outs,'' he said. ``There are right times  
to do it and wrong times to do it and I was doing it constantly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last fit Nevin threw with the Astros was a profanity-laced  
tantrum in front of general manager Bob Watson and manager Terry 
Collins when he was demoted in July 1995. Five weeks later he was 
traded to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevin said the best thing that happened was going down to Class  
AA Jacksonville in 1996 to learn how to catch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that kind of woke me up,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Once with the Padres, Nevin hit it off with manager Bruce Bochy,  
who gave him his share of at-bats even before he became the 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at it like I've got a lot to prove still,'' Nevin said.  
``There's no way I'd ever do anything to let that man down because 
of the chance he's given me that I feel no one else has. ''

<HEADLINE> Profits Rise at Zurich Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Zurich Financial Services, formed  
from the merger of Zurich Insurance Co. with the financial arm of 
British American Tobacco, said Monday its net first half-profit 
rose by 17 percent to $1.687 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's first-half profit was $1.44 billion. Operating  
income also rose 17 percent, to $2.539 billion from $2.168 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Zurich Financial credited its improvement in earnings mainly to  
its insurance operation and noted an ``increasingly positive'' 
effect from the merger. The deal was completed last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The company expects the merger to produce at least $500 million  
in annual cost savings by the end of 2001. Rolf Hueppi, chairman 
and chief executive, said integration has progressed ``more rapidly 
than originally forecast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group covers financial services including insurance, asset  
management and private banking. 
</P>
<P>
	Zurich Financial is 57 percent owned by Zurich Allied AG of  
Switzerland and 43 percent by Allied Zurich PLC of Britain.

<HEADLINE> Thrashers Counting on Goalie Rhodes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Damian Rhodes flicked away one shot with  
his pad. Another deflected off his blocker. Finally, he sprawled to 
the ice to cover a loose puck. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take long -- just a few minutes into his first  
scrimmage of training camp -- for Rhodes to get a glimpse of how 
frantic things will be with the Atlanta Thrashers. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't mind a bit.  
</P>
<P>
	``I like the idea of getting work,'' Rhodes said Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	That's what the Thrashers were hoping when they acquired Rhodes  
from the Ottawa Senators shortly before the NHL expansion draft, 
making him the answer to an inevitable trivia question: Who was the 
first Atlanta player? 
</P>
<P>
	First-year teams never have much scoring, but a stingy goalie  
can transform losses into ties, ties into wins. Just ask the 
Florida Panthers, who reached the Stanley Cup finals in their third 
season on the strength of John Vanbiesbrouck's stellar play. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to have one go-to guy,'' Thrashers coach Curt Fraser  
said. ``A guy like Rhodes can carry the load.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes is pleased to be in Atlanta after going through a  
roller-coaster of emotions in Ottawa, where he shared the job with 
Ron Tugnutt last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators had the second-best record in the Eastern  
Conference but were upset in the first round of the playoffs by 
Buffalo in a four-game sweep. Rhodes and Tugnutt played two games 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we had a real good team,'' Rhodes said. ``But  
something wasn't right. We didn't seem to jell like we were 
supposed to. I'm happy to be out of there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two goalies got along fine, but Rhodes made it clear he  
doesn't miss Ottawa coach Jacques Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were games when Jacques wouldn't tell us who was playing  
until the day of the game,'' Rhodes recalled. ``Every day, we would 
be sitting around wondering what he was going to say. It's nice not 
to have to deal with that anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He got the bulk of the work in Ottawa the two previous seasons,  
playing 50 games each year but leaving plenty of work for Tugnutt. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I began to play more, I got better,'' Rhodes said. ``I got  
a lot more confident with my game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That changed last season, when Rhodes played in 45 games with a  
2.44 goals-against average, while Tugnutt worked in 43 games, made 
the All-Star game and led the league with a 1.79 GAA. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kept each other sane,'' Rhodes said. ``Sometimes, we would  
try to guess who was going to play the next game. No matter who we 
picked, we were always wrong. So we stopped doing that after 20 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes' impatience in Ottawa is easy to understand. A native of  
Minnesota who grew up as a fan of the North Stars, he was a 
sixth-round draft pick of the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending three years at Michigan Tech and three more in  
the American Hockey League, he finally made it to the NHL to stay 
in 1993. Even then, Rhodes was stuck behind Felix Potvin, playing 
only 46 games in 2 1/2 seasons before being traded to Ottawa in 
January 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	One good thing about Toronto: Rhodes met his wife, Lara, who  
lived two floors below him in a high-rise apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
	``She saw me walking through the lobby and asked the security  
guard to set us up,'' he said. ``He wound up speaking at our 
wedding. She'll deny it, but that's the way it happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, an actress, has a role in an upcoming horror movie,  
``Pinata.'' Rhodes accompanied her to California over the summer 
for the filming. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he is moving from one of the league's top teams to one  
that figures to be among the worst, Rhodes believes his long-term 
prospects are better in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers are owned by media giant Time-Warner, while the  
Senators are a small-market Canadian team struggling to compete 
financially despite a new arena and sellout crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottawa lost its general manager two years in a row and is  
embroiled in several contract disputes, most notably with star 
center Alexei Yashin. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got to scratch and claw for everything they get,''  
Rhodes said. ``I knew this would happen. They've been able to get 
all these good players, but now they can't afford them. They're 
kind of like the Montreal Expos of hockey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Rhodes turned 30 in May, he's not old by goaltending  
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Goalies usually mature later than other players,'' Thrashers  
general manager Don Waddell said. ``You see a lot of them begin to 
come into their own in their late 20s or early 30s. Nothing is 
guaranteed, but he wants to be the workhorse.''

<HEADLINE> Former Arkansas Football Star Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Steve Little, who kicked the longest  
field goal in NCAA history for Arkansas in the 1977, died Monday at 
the age of 43. 
</P>
<P>
	Little, who later played for the St. Louis Cardinals in the NFL,  
was paralyzed from the neck down in an automobile accident in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	He died around 6:30 a.m. at his home in Little Rock, according  
to his brother, Gene. The cause of death has not been determined, 
Gene Little said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it could have been related to (the accident),'' he  
said. ``It probably would have helped if he could have moved 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took us all by surprise.''  
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, Little kicked a 67-yard field goal against Texas, tying  
the NCAA record set by Texas' Russell Erlexben two weeks earlier. 
The record was matched by Joe Williams of Wichita State the next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Little came to Arkansas in 1974 from Shawnee Mission South High  
School in Overland Park, Kan., where he had been an all-state 
quarterback and defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
	He was so good coming out of high school that Razorbacks  
football legend Clyde Scott allowed Little to wear his No. 12 -- 
even though it was retired. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was an outstanding athlete,'' recalled Arkansas athletic  
director Frank Broyles, who was coach of the Razorbacks at the 
time. ``He could have played quarterback for us, but he had such 
great speed with that leg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Little played for the Razorbacks from 1974 to 1977, lettering in  
each of his four seasons. He holds the Arkansas record for most 
points in a career with 280. He made 53 of 89 field goals attempts 
during his four years and was 7-of-13 on field goals of 50 yards or 
longer. He also made 121 of 131 extra points. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1976, he played in a 31-10 victory over Georgia 31-10 in the  
Cotton Bowl, and in 1978, he played in a 31-6 victory over Oklahoma 
in the Orange Bowl. He kicked four extra points in each of those 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Little was an All-America in 1976 and 1977 and was named to the  
school's all-century squad. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals made him the 15th overall pick in the first round  
of the NFL draft in 1978. He punted and kicked for the Cardinals in 
1978 and 1979. In his second season he was 10-of-19 on field goal 
attempts, the longest from 51 yards -- the fifth-longest in 
Cardinals history. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing six games in 1980, he was released Oct. 16. The  
same day, he was involved in the automobile accident that left him 
paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	Broyles said Little had been an inspiration to others since his  
accident left him a quadriplegic, displaying a courageous ability 
to cope with adversity. 
</P>
<P>
	Little had moved to Little Rock in 1978, his brother said, after  
being drafted by the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his brother, Little is survived by his father,  
Ron, of Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements are to be announced by Griffin Leggett  
Healey and Roth Funeral Home of Little Rock.

<HEADLINE> Waco Revelations Raise Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Ever since her grandsons were killed in the  
Oklahoma City bombing, Jannie Coverdale has doubted whether the 
government has been entirely truthful about what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Revelations about the FBI's use of flammable tear gas canisters  
at the 1993 Branch Davidian standoff in Waco, Texas -- accusations 
previously denied by the government for six years -- have raised 
even more questions, Ms. Coverdale said. 
</P>
<P>
	``After what I've heard about Waco, I'm beginning to blame the  
federal government for my grandchildren dying,'' said Ms. 
Coverdale, whose grandsons, Aaron and Elijah, were among the 168 
people killed in the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. 
Murrah Federal Building. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't trust the information we've gotten so far about Waco  
or the information we've gotten on the bombing,'' she said. ``I 
can't believe what we've been told.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors of the bombing and relatives of those killed are  
divided over whether the government's new information about its 
role at Waco has any bearing on its investigation of the Oklahoma 
City bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Government prosecutors have said the bombing was in part  
retaliation for the April 19, 1993, fire that killed Branch 
Davidian leader David Koresh and more than 80 of his followers at 
Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these people like to blame the government for  
everything. That is such a shallow interpretation of the real 
evidence,'' said Dr. Paul Heath, a psychologist for the Social 
Security Administration who survived the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``What can you say about conspiracy theorists? They have their  
theories and that's what they are -- theories,'' said Bud Welch, 
whose daughter, Julie, died in the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not mad at my government over that,'' said Dan McKinney,  
whose wife, Linda, a Secret Service agent, was killed. ``It's just 
something else that people are looking to blame the government 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Coverdale's distrust is shared by others.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thrilled to see the truth surfacing. It's sure cleaning  
the slate for the people who have been deemed the right-wing 
nuts,'' said Kathy Wilburn, who also lost two grandsons in the 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Conspiracy theorists contend the government started the fire  
that ended the 51-day siege at Waco. The government says the fires 
were set by the Branch Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's hard not to trust your government,'' said Ms.  
Coverdale, who has demanded a congressional investigation into the 
Oklahoma City bombing. ``Now, I have no trust whatsoever. I just 
can't believe what they are telling us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Wilburn and her late husband, Glenn, spearheaded a campaign  
to convene an Oklahoma County grand jury that investigated the 
bombing for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury adjourned in December after finding no evidence  
of a government cover-up of the bombing or of a wider conspiracy 
beyond convicted bomber Timothy McVeigh and convicted 
co-conspirator Terry Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
	``Truth has a way of surfacing after a while,'' Mrs. Wilburn  
said. ``I'm hoping that the truth also comes out about the Oklahoma 
City bombing. The more truth we get, the more it vindicates my 
husband and I.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Dismissive of NAACP Flag Push </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIMPSONVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Declaring outsiders should ``butt  
out'' out of the issue, George W. Bush was dismissive Monday of an 
NAACP effort to push for a national tourism boycott of South 
Carolina to force down the Confederate flag from its Statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning in the state, Bush said the NAACP's boycott plans  
were initiated by ``some people who don't live in South Carolina, 
evidently'' and he reiterated his position that ``I think the good 
people of South Carolina can'' settle the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if the civil rights group should back off, Bush said,  
``That's up to the NAACP.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate appearance later in the day, Bush said ``my advice  
is for people who don't live in South Carolina to butt out of the 
issue. The people of South Carolina can make that decision.'' That 
prompted cheers from holiday festival-goers in Simpsonville, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't particularly like it when people came in to tell me  
what to do in Texas,'' Bush added. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush should show more concern about the flag dispute, state Rep.  
Leon Howard, a black Columbia Democrat, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an issue that it takes leadership to address,'' Howard  
said. ``And (when you) find people waffling and dancing around and 
not wanting to take the issue head-on, then it's a lack of 
leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's stance shows he ``is wooing the white voters of South  
Carolina to support his candidacy,'' the Rev. H.H. Singleton, 
president of the Conway branch of the NAACP, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and other candidates are courting South Carolinians for the  
Feb. 19 Republican primary, which is considered an important early 
barometer for how candidates will do in the conservative South. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag controversy has embroiled South Carolina for several  
years. The state is the only one in the nation to fly the 
Confederate flag over its Statehouse, although Georgia and 
Mississippi incorporate part of the design into their state flags. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  
says the flag is a symbol of racism. But supporters say the flag 
represents Southern heritage and honors South Carolinians who died 
in the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic candidate Bill Bradley said in April that ``I  
wouldn't fly it. I think that it sometimes offends a large part of 
the population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walking in a Labor Day parade and attending another Labor Day  
festival in Simpsonville, Bush also said ``it's up to the people of 
South Carolina to figure out how best to fund their schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina residents will vote next year about whether they  
want a lottery to fund education improvements. South Carolina's 
schools lag behind others in Scholastic Assessment Test scores.

<HEADLINE> Man Serving Life May Be Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A man who has served 19 years in prison  
for murder might win a new trial because two witnesses who 
identified him at his trial now say they picked the wrong man, the 
Orange County Register reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The development is enough to warrant a new investigation in the  
case of imprisoned Dwayne McKinney, said Orange County District 
Attorney Tony Rackauckas, who prosecuted the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not ready to say, `Oh, my gosh, we've got the wrong guy.'  
But we're going to take a hard look at it,'' Rackauckas said. 
``Something like this isn't going to be taken lightly. We're not in 
the business of trying to keep innocent people in jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Public Defender Carl Holmes said he will file a motion this week  
seeking a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney was convicted of killing 19-year-old Walter Horace Bell  
during a 1980 robbery attempt at a restaurant in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney, 39, has always insisted he is innocent, the newspaper  
reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't done anything and I'm stuck in a box,'' McKinney  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested six days after the shooting when witnesses  
identified him through photos. Four witnesses identified him as the 
gunman at his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orange County Public Defender's Office learned last year  
that convicted robber and rapist Willie Charles Walker said he 
drove the getaway car for the robbery and that McKinney was not 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	In a prison interview, Walker said his partner, Raymond Herman  
Jackett III, committed the murder. 
</P>
<P>
	And two trial witnesses -- restaurant employees Brian March and  
Donald Bulla -- recently viewed photographs of Jackett and now say 
McKinney wasn't the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had seen Jackett's picture 18 years ago, McKinney  
wouldn't be in this situation,'' said Bulla. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackett, who is in prison for another crime, did not respond to  
the allegations, the Register said.

<HEADLINE> Cisneros Trial Finally Set To Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a trial with tapes, money and an  
extramarital affair, former Housing Secretary and one-time rising 
political star Henry Cisneros will try to demolish the 
prosecution's case by attacking the credibility of the key witness 
against him -- his ex-lover. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection begins Tuesday, more than a year and a half after  
Cisneros was charged in an 18-count indictment that contends he 
conspired with one-time paramour Linda Jones -- while under 
consideration for a post in the Clinton Cabinet -- to conceal the 
scope of his more than $250,000 in payments to her. He has pleaded 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones, who herself ran afoul of the independent counsel  
prosecuting Cisneros, is the government's star witness, albeit one 
whose credibility will come under sustained attack from Cisneros' 
high-dollar legal team. She agreed to testify against her ex-lover 
in a bid to gain a reduction in her 3 1/2-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	In a preview of their likely trial tactics, Cisneros' lawyers  
waged an all-out assault on Ms. Jones' credibility during a 
pretrial hearing. They elicited admissions that she lied numerous 
times to the FBI and Internal Revenue Service agents investigating 
Cisneros, as well as to the independent counsel's office, a Texas 
court and even her own lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighty-eight tape recordings that Ms. Jones secretly made of her  
phone conversations with Cisneros as their relationship soured are 
at the heart of Independent Counsel David Barrett's case. Cisneros' 
lawyers labored mightily during a 13-day pretrial hearing in July 
to quash their use, saying many tapes bore signs of heavy editing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tapes, as we all know, are very powerful evidence,'' Cisneros  
lawyer Brendan Sullivan said at the conclusion of the hearing. 
``Tapes that are altered are powerfully misleading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin rejected the defense's  
argument. Of the 26 tapes that prosecutors want to play for jurors, 
Sporkin is allowing 22 in their entirety and portions of four 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros ``has presented no direct evidence that the voice on  
the tapes is not his, nor that the statements attributed to him are 
inaccurate,'' Sporkin said of the tapes, recorded between April 
1990 and December 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	While the recordings' admissibility at trial constituted a  
victory for Barrett's team, a former federal prosecutor cautioned 
that tapes can sometimes backfire on the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time a prosecutor gets evidence that's admissible, it's  
helpful,'' said Washington lawyer Joseph diGenova, himself a former 
independent counsel and one-time U.S. attorney. ``Whether or not 
the jury reads it the same way as the prosecution, that's 
questionable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiGenova cited the case of car manufacturer John DeLorean, who  
was acquitted of all charges by a federal jury in Los Angeles in 
1984 after being caught on videotape discussing cocaine deals with 
government agents posing as drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know how a piece of recorded evidence on a tape,  
either oral or visual is going to work,'' diGenova said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones' recordings, some of which the government acknowledges  
were edited, capture conversations in which she and Cisneros 
discussed their financial dealings. They also reflect Cisneros' 
characterizations of his discussions about the money with the 
Clinton transition team and the FBI agents conducting his Cabinet 
background check. 
</P>
<P>
	During that background check, Cisneros admitted giving Ms. Jones  
financial support after their affair burst into public view in 
1988, costing her marriage and career as a political fund-raiser. 
But prosecutors contend he falsely told the FBI he never paid her 
more than $10,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleges that Cisneros, a former San Antonio mayor  
who is now president of the Spanish-language television network 
Univision, paid her more than $264,000 between 1990 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones testified during the pretrial hearing that she edited  
as many as 10 of the 88 tapes. She said she performed the editing -- 
and destroyed all 88 originals -- because she feared legal 
repercussions if she didn't delete passages in which she threatened 
to reveal their financial arrangement if Cisneros stopped paying 
her. She also said she removed some sexually suggestive passages 
and those dealing with uninvolved parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones, 50, and Cisneros, 52, became romantically involved in  
1987 while he was mayor. The 2 1/2-year affair, which attracted 
extensive news coverage, ended when Cisneros returned to his wife 
and three children. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros, who served as HUD secretary from 1993 through 1996,  
has said he offered financial support because he felt sorry for Ms. 
Jones after their affair became public. 
</P>
<P>
	His legal troubles were triggered when Ms. Jones filed a  
breach-of-contract suit against him in her hometown of Lubbock, 
Texas, in 1994, charging he had reneged on his promise to support 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	A few months later, she took her claims to the tabloid TV show  
``Inside Edition,'' where she accused Cisneros of lying to the FBI. 
Based on that accusation, Attorney General Janet Reno initiated a 
Justice Department inquiry and in 1995 requested the appointment of 
an independent counsel.

<HEADLINE> At Last, Cowboys' Sanders Practices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Deion Sanders worked out in pads and a  
helmet Monday for the first time since undergoing toe surgery in 
April, increasing the chances he'll play for the Dallas Cowboys in 
Sunday's season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders moved at only half-speed during his hour-long workout  
and didn't make any hard cuts that would have forced him to push 
off on his rebuilt left big toe. 
</P>
<P>
	He went through individual drills and 7-on-7 work, then called  
it quits midway through full-squad action. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did work against receivers, so I guess you can call it an  
official return to practice,'' coach Chan Gailey said. ``I had a 
feeling of optimism that he'd be back soon, but this gives me even 
more of that feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After an off day Tuesday, Sanders will test himself further  
Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thursday afternoon is when I'm going to get excited if it's on  
for him to go Sunday,'' team owner Jerry Jones said. ``But it's 
real encouraging to see him out here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final decision of when Sanders returns is solely up to him  
and probably won't be made until just before kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
	If he doesn't play Sunday against the Washington Redskins, he  
could return the following Monday night at home against the Atlanta 
Falcons, one of his former teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really, he's going to be the judge of how much pain he can  
tolerate, how much pain there is and whether he can do further 
damage,'' Gailey said. ``If we can't do further damage, then it's a 
question of whether it's too painful to do the things he needs to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders has a monetary incentive to be back soon: He must play  
70 percent of Dallas' defensive snaps and make the Pro Bowl to get 
a $1.5 million bonus on top of the $3.5 million in bonuses he's 
already made and his $3 million base salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders has said he wants no limitations when he returns,  
meaning he would play cornerback and return punts. He was a Pro 
Bowl selection at both spots last season and played in the February 
game despite the toe problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see how it feels when he catches and turns it up,''  
Gailey said. ``If he can, he can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was injured Nov. 15 and missed five full games and parts  
of two more. He returned for a playoff loss to Arizona, then 
underwent surgery April 28. 
</P>
<P>
	The closest Sanders came to practicing at training camp was  
simulating cornerback moves 40 yards downfield from the action. On 
Monday, he lined up several yards off receivers and moved gingerly 
with them. He intercepted one pass, but didn't run with the ball -- 
a very uncharacteristic decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched him from time to time and it looked like he was  
moving OK to me,'' Gailey said. ``Obviously he wasn't going at full 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he's in game-playing condition, but he's  
probably in good enough condition to play some significant snaps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former two-sport star has proven previously that training  
camp is for other people. He's even played baseball and football on 
the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Gailey was the Steelers' offensive coordinator when  
they opened against the Cowboys. Sanders joined the team that day 
and defended two passes, made four tackles and returned two punts 
for 45 yards in a Dallas victory. He rejoined the Cincinnati Reds 
the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think the guy could not practice a snap then come in  
and play against us in Pittsburgh,'' Gailey said. ``But he played 
pretty good.''

<HEADLINE> Seven Killed in Iowa House Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHLAND, Iowa (AP) -- A house exploded during a party Monday  
afternoon, killing at least seven people and leaving ``just a hole 
in the ground,'' the sheriff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six other people were taken to hospitals in Iowa City, and three  
were in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast destroyed the ranch-style home and cars parked out  
front. Hours after the explosion, light smoke was still coming from 
the charred debris. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just a hole in the ground,'' Keokuk County Sheriff Ron  
George said. ``When I got here, the house was gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George said the dead were found in the basement.  
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the explosion was unknown. A propane tank behind  
the house was still intact, the sheriff said. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple and their two daughters lived in the home, neighbors  
said, and they identified the homeowner as Jerry Usovsky. 
</P>
<P>
	He survived the blast and was in critical condition. The fate of  
the rest of his family was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've known them forever,'' said Maria Reif, who lives in the  
neighborhood. ``They're wonderful people. He built that house 
himself and it was a beautiful home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another neighbor, Marian Dickinson, said she was sitting on her  
couch when she heard the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It jarred our house,'' she said. ``The curtains just  
swished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dickinson said she went outside to see whether her husband,  
who was in the garage, had been injured. As she left the house, ``I 
saw a flash and smoke. It was all-consuming. It was just 
terrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richland is 35 miles southwest of Iowa City.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Seeks Financier's Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- After four months of pursuit,  
international authorities caught up with suspected embezzler Martin 
Frankel at a comfortable waterfront hotel where he had been staying 
for eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The capture Saturday was as undramatic as the disarming, casual  
manner Frankel allegedly used to con millions of dollars from 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a pass key, German and U.S. authorities let themselves  
into Frankel's room. The man who had evaded authorities for months 
didn't resist, saying: ``You got me,'' according to FBI Special 
Agent Michael Wolf in Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, 44, was being held while U.S. officials work on an  
extradition request that could take several months. He faces 
charges of money laundering and wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	He was brought before a judge late Saturday and ordered held on  
the international arrest warrant as well as a German charge of 
using a fake British passport, Hamburg police spokesman Wolfgang 
Ketels said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say Frankel is responsible for a lengthy trail of  
deception -- bilking insurance companies out of millions and 
receiving donations for a bogus foundation set up with the help of 
the Vatican. The Vatican has denied any connection to the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	He showed an impressive biography to hook investors, claiming to  
have a foolproof system for making money off safe government 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for Frankel started May 5 after firefighters  
responding to an alarm at his $3 million mansion in Greenwich found 
a blazing file cabinet and two fireplaces stuffed with burning 
documents. An arrest warrant was issued for Frankel on July 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance company regulators said his unlicensed brokerage had  
siphoned at least $218 million from several insurance companies. A 
lawsuit filed by some of the companies puts the loss at $915 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Also missing is as much as $1.98 billion from the St. Francis of  
Assisi Foundation, which investigators say was established by 
Frankel last August in the British Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel has been described by some investors as the Hugh Hefner  
of high finance, living with women he met through personal ads, 
some of whom also worked in his office. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear why Frankel came to Germany. Police  
said he checked into Hamburg's Prem hotel about eight weeks ago 
using a phony name. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel was believed to have been in Italy earlier this summer.  
He may have been financing his run with more than $10 million in 
diamonds and gold he bought before disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities seized an unspecified sum of cash, diamonds and a  
computer in his hotel room, Wolf said. Hamburg police spokesman 
Hans-Juergen Petersen said Frankel also had ``a number of 
passports'' with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel was accompanied by a woman, identified by the FBI in  
Connecticut as Cynthia Allison, 35. Allison was traveling under the 
alias Susan Kelly, according to the FBI, which did not elaborate on 
her relationship to Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen said the woman was taken into custody but was later  
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Keefe, Frankel's U.S. lawyer, said he has spoken to  
Frankel's German lawyer, who told him that ``under the 
circumstances, Marty seemed to be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keefe also said he had spoken to Allison, who disputes  
authorities' version of the arrest. She said no FBI agent was 
present and that Frankel never said ``You got me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under German law, the United States has 40 days from the time of  
arrest to make an extradition request, but can also get a 20-day 
extension. The case will be heard by the highest state court in 
Hamburg, but extradition is decided by the Justice Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Gore Parades, Basks in Labor Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- With an endorsement from Sen. Tom  
Harkin, Vice President Al Gore paraded through a working class 
neighborhood Monday and basked in warm words from top labor leaders 
with whom he has sometimes disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore strode side-by-side with AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer  
Richard Trumka, who spoke approvingly of Gore's bid for the 
Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud to be with the vice president as he helps us  
celebrate Labor Day,'' said Trumka, who said the labor federation 
is likely to endorse a candidate at its October convention. ``I 
think the heads-on favorite is the vice president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has clashed with labor leaders in pushing for  
free trade proposals that union say amount to exporting jobs, and 
Gore said that tension will continue if he's elected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the same general philosophy on trade,'' said Gore. ``I  
think part of our success in the economy has been to open new 
markets for our products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore shrugged off questions about differences with labor over  
trade issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no secret that has been a matter on which I've differed  
with some in organized labor,'' said Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor leaders argue that proposals like the North American Free  
Trade Agreement give businesses incentives to ship jobs to Third 
World countries with poor labor and environmental standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he will push those issues, while seeking to include  
provisions forcing trading partners to boost labor laws and 
environmental standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no secret that President Clinton and I have worked and  
we've tried to integrate labor and environmental concerns into the 
fabric of trade negotiations,'' said Gore. ``That's where the heart 
and soul of America is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin has close ties to organized labor and is a leading Senate  
liberal, but he handed a warm endorsement to the centrist Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't take this step lightly,'' said Harkin. ``Al Gore is  
right for Iowa, he is right for America and he's right for our 
working families.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Tries Hand at Hand Tools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Armed with a cordless electric drill,  
President Clinton pitched in briefly Monday to help with some 
renovation work at the 75-year-old Coleman Place Elementary School 
and was reminded he's now a homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never used one of these,'' the president, wearing a hard hat  
and blue work shirt, remarked as he fastened about eight screws to 
the top of a computer desk. 
</P>
<P>
	Having recently, along with the first lady, purchased a $1.7  
million home in Westchester County, New York, Clinton predicted he 
might need just such a tool. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her now that I'm a homeowner I'd better get one of  
these,'' said Clinton. ``I've never seen one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president and Hillary Rodham Clinton last Thursday bought  
the 110-year-old Georgian colonial in Westchester County outside 
New York City as Mrs. Clinton establishes residency in New York for 
a probable bid for a Senate seat from the state.

<HEADLINE> States May Get Little From Financier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The states allegedly defrauded by money manager Martin Frankel  
stand to recover less than 40 cents on the dollar unless 
investigators locate a hidden supply of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators already have seized $57.5 million and are  
eyeing $26.5 million in a frozen Swiss bank account linked to the 
Connecticut-based money manager. 
</P>
<P>
	But Frankel is believed to have embezzled at least $218 million  
from several insurance companies, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	At that amount, states would have to cover 61.5 cents for every  
dollar invested in one of the insurance companies Frankel dealt 
with. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Frankel has been arrested in Germany, state officials  
hope he will help them find the missing money, presumably in a bid 
for leniency. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have linked at least three foreign bank accounts  
to Frankel, in Switzerland, Italy and Germany, said Keith Wenzel, 
director of Missouri's Department of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators also hope they'll be able to liquidate homes,  
diamonds and jewels belonging to Frankel, Wenzel said Monday. 
Frankel may have been financing his run with more than $10 million 
in diamonds and gold he bought before fleeing, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some regulators doubt they'll recover much more than they've  
already identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like they're counting on full recovery,'' said  
Marilyn Elam, a spokeswoman for Tennessee's Department of Commerce 
and Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators say Frankel used pseudonyms and partners  
to buy small insurance companies in states with reputations for lax 
insurance regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, regulators said, Frankel's unlicensed brokerage --  
apparently run out of his $3 million Greenwich, Conn., mansion -- 
siphoned money from the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Now regulators in those states -- Mississippi, Arkansas,  
Tennessee, Oklahoma and Missouri -- are banding together to recover 
the lost funds. Tennessee managed to seize $57.5 million, and has 
given $17.5 million of that to other states. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the states, not insurance policy holders, that would lose  
if the insurers remain in the red. 
</P>
<P>
	The states guaranteed the policies and will have to pay any  
amount not recovered from the insolvent insurance companies. Most 
of the policies, including 12,000 in Tennessee, are burial plans 
worth several thousand dollars apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be a long wait before any money changes hands.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping to have it wrapped up within a couple of years,''  
Missouri's Wenzel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel might still spend months in custody in Germany, where he  
was captured by federal and international authorities, even if he 
waived extradition to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance companies can spend a year or longer in receivership  
in a typical case, and ``this one is more complicated than most,'' 
said John Knox Walkup, the former Tennessee attorney general who is 
handling the receivership of the Tennessee insurer, Franklin 
American. 
</P>
<P>
	Auditors are still trying to understand how much money is  
missing. A lawsuit filed by some of the companies puts the loss at 
$915 million, but Wenzel said: ``I don't think any of the 
regulators ever thought it was that high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel also is thought to have allegedly stolen as much as  
$1.98 billion from the St. Francis of Assisi Foundation, which 
investigators say he established last year in the British Virgin 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's unclear whether much -- if any -- of that money ever  
existed or whether Frankel merely claimed it was there. The 
foundation was set up as a charity that bought insurance companies, 
investigators said.

<HEADLINE> Plummer Takes Shot at Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Quarterback Jake Plummer, whose sprained  
right thumb makes him still uncertain for Sunday's season opener at 
Philadelphia, went after the Arizona Cardinals' management Monday 
for its failure to reach a contract agreement with wide receiver 
Rob Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until someone upstairs realizes how important Rob Moore is to  
this whole offense and this season, we're going to have to learn to 
play without him,'' Plummer said. ``Hopefully, they'll realize that 
he's a game-breaker and a guy we have to have out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore has been at odds with the Arizona ownership since he was  
designated the team's franchise player in the off-season. The two 
sides reportedly have agreed to an annual salary of $5 million, but 
Moore wants a four-year deal and the Cardinals want three years. 
Moore also wants a bigger signing bonus than the team is willing to 
give. 
</P>
<P>
	Owner Bill Bidwill said he agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he is important and we're trying to get him,'' Bidwill  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer noted that last fall, when he signed a four-year, $29.7  
million contract extension, he emphasized that he was only part of 
the solution and was counting on the Cardinals to sign other 
important players. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has talked with members of the Cardinals' front  
office about the importance of signing Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team wants him here. We all want him in here,'' Plummer  
said. ``We can't negotiate Rob Moore's deal. If I could, I'd have 
him signed about six months ago. It's a thing I have no control 
over. It's up to the people upstairs that they make the move and 
get that deal done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without Moore, the only experienced wide receiver on the Arizona  
roster is Frank Sanders, who sprained his ankle in last Friday 
night's preseason finale against Oakland. Sanders said the injury 
is not serious and he should be at full speed by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore is one of three Cardinals still holding out in contract  
squabbles. The others are defensive tackle Mark Smith and rookie 
offensive tackle L.J. Shelton, the team's second first-round draft 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer said he has talked with Moore.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's frustrated. He wants to play,'' Plummer said. ``He's not  
the player who's going to mouth off and cuss this guy out. He's 
more a guy who's going to bite his tongue and hope things get taken 
care of. I hope it ends up not hurting him and I hope it ends up 
not hurting the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer took snaps during practice Monday for the first time  
since he sprained the thumb on his throwing hand against Tennessee 
Aug. 20. He was careful not to promise that he would be able to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plan on playing, but I don't want to go out there and force  
it, or reinjure it or not be able to throw the ball effectively,'' 
he said. ``I can hand the ball off all day, but I've got to be able 
to throw that deep ball, the out routes, the comebacks and all that 
sort of thing without losing any velocity on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Vince Tobin said he was encouraged by what Plummer was  
able to do in practice. Tobin said he will have to wait until later 
in the week to see how the thumb feels after the increased 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can play and not increase your chance of reinjuring  
yourself, then I think you play,'' Tobin said. ``If there is a 
chance you're going to set your progress back, then it doesn't make 
sense to play.''

<HEADLINE> Arizona Replaces Four Starters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals claimed two wide  
receivers and two defensive tackles off the waiver wire Monday and 
released four players, including outside linebacker Tony McCombs, 
who started 13 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Also released were offensive lineman Allen Degraffenreid and  
wide receivers Tony Hamler and Chad Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals claimed wide receivers Mar Tay Jenkins, who had  
been cut by Dallas, and Mac Cody, who had been waived by St. Louis. 
They also picked up defensive tackles Corey Sears, who had been 
waived by St. Louis, and Angel Rubio, who was cut by San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenkins was the Cowboys' sixth-round pick this year out of  
Nebraska-Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, coach Vince Tobin announced he had replaced  
three starters for Sunday's season opener against the Philadelphia 
Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Hardy will start at tight end in place of Johnny  
McWilliams, Matt Joyce will start ahead of Anthony Clement at 
offensive left tackle and Zack Walz will be the right outside 
linebacker in place of Patrick Sapp. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Pittman moved ahead of Mario Bates as backup running  
back behind Adrian Murrell. Bates will remain the short-yardage 
running back and will return kickoffs. Pittman beat out rookie 
David Boston as the first-string punt returner. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin also welcomed offensive left guard Chris Dishman and right  
guard Lester Holmes back to practice on Monday. Dishman had been 
out since early in the training camp after undergoing arthroscopic 
surgery on his right elbow. Holmes is recovering from facial 
lacerations sustained in a car accident that crushed the right arm 
of teammate Ernest Dye. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyce, who had been playing guard in Dishman's absence, moves to  
tackle largely because Clement, who missed virtually all of his 
rookie season last year with back surgery, has had trouble doing 
his job with a broken bone in his left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin said he won't decide until after Thursday's practice  
whether Chris Jacke or Joe Nedney will be the kicker in Sunday's 
opener. The team took the unusual step of keeping both of them when 
the final roster cuts were announced Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Dennis Moves to Virginia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELHAVEN, N.C. (AP) -- As coastal residents began to repair the  
storm damage, rainfall from the remnants of Dennis drifted 
northward across Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Flood watches were in effect today for parts of Virginia,  
Maryland and West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle from the storm, by 
now a tropical depression. A flash flood watch for parts of North 
Carolina's northeast Piedmont and coastal plain was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	As of this morning, the Raleigh-Durham area had gotten 7.4  
inches of inches of rain in two days. In southeastern Virginia, a 
tornado struck the town of Hampton during the weekend, causing an 
estimated $7.2 million in damage and slightly injuring a dozen 
people 
</P>
<P>
	With the storm centered over Virginia, the last of the rain was  
expected to be out of North Carolina by tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some very dry areas, some areas in desperate need of  
rain,'' Highway Patrol Sgt. Jeff Winstead of the state's emergency 
response team told The Charlotte Observer in today's editions. 
``Still, I don't think torrential rain is really what people were 
hoping for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis spread about 2 inches of rain over drought-stricken New  
Jersey during the weekend and more showers were forecast today and 
Tuesday. However, reservoirs were still about 10 percent below 
normal and no water restrictions had been lifted, Loretta 
O'Donnell, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental 
Protection, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting into a drought takes a while and leaving a drought  
takes a while, too,'' said Jim Poirier, a meteorologist with the 
National Weather Service in Mount Holly. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Carolina Highway Patrol said five people died in  
accidents on rain-slickened roads over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Pamlico County, several caskets had washed out of private  
cemeteries and propane gas tanks had floated around the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have numerous propane tanks all over the place,'' said Tim  
Harvey, the county's emergency management coordinator. ``If you 
want to barbecue, this is the place to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Formed Aug. 24, Dennis skirted North Carolina's coast Aug. 30,  
went seaward 165 miles, stalled and then backtracked. All week 
long, it assailed North Carolina's coast with 14-foot waves and 
gale-force wind as forecasters tried to guess where it would go 
next. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time that I remember that a hurricane hit us  
directly and then turned around and came back and hit us again,'' 
said Henry ``Farmer'' Styron. ``It was a double whammy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Styron is among the residents of Cedar Island, which was  
sideswiped by Dennis on its way up the coast and clobbered again 
Saturday when its eye passed directly overhead. About 100 homes and 
businesses were flooded on Cedar Island, northeast of Morehead 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatteras Island's main road, N.C. 12, was reopened Sunday after  
thundering surf ripped out some sections of road and buried others 
under drifted beach sand. But only four-wheel-drive vehicles were 
permitted on the southern end of the island, where state highway 
crews spent Sunday laying a new asphalt road. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said tourists would not be allowed back on Hatteras  
Island before Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatteras' neighbor, Ocracoke Island and its 700 residents, also  
suffered through a week with Dennis. Much of the island lay 
underwater Sunday, and the only ferry service was to bring 
emergency workers and supplies from the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	Flooded streets were nothing new in Belhaven, where nearly 6  
feet of water surged from nearby creeks into the community of 2,400 
that lies 6 feet above sea level on the Pungo River. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had five storms in the last four years that have hit  
us,'' Town Manager Tim Johnson said Sunday. ``And we thought we had 
finally missed one. But darned if it didn't come back and get us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Bonnie sent water into Belhaven homes last year.  
Afterward, the federal government announced it would pay to elevate 
379 homes so they wouldn't be out of the flood plain. The project 
hasn't been completed yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been demoralizing to be flooded this often,'' Johnson  
said. ``People here expect to experience hurricanes. But this is a 
bit much for anyone to stomach.''

<P>
	DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) -- Val Royal, the 3-2 favorite, overtook  
Fighting Falcon in the final strides to win Monday's $300,000 Del 
Mar Derby by a half-length. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Corey Nakatani, Val Royal covered 1 1/8 miles on turf in  
1:48 2-5 and paid $5, $3.20 and $2.80. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the fifth in seven lifetime starts for Val Royal and  
was worth $180,000, raising the career earnings of the 3-year-old 
French-bred son of Royal Academy to $315,644. 
</P>
<P>
	Val Royal, owned by television producer David Milch and trained  
by Julio Canani, ran his six previous races in France, the most 
recent on Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting Falcon, ridden by Chris McCarron, crossed the finish  
line 1 1/4 lengths in front of In Frank's Honor and returned $4.60 and 
$3.60. 
</P>
<P>
	In Frank's Honor, ridden by Chris Antley, was 1 1/2 lengths ahead  
of Eagleton at the wire and paid $3.80 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Eagleton across the finish line in the 55th running of  
the race for 3-year-olds were Zanetti, Major Hero, Domination, 
Roundabout, Walk That Walk and Make Your Mark. Each of the 10 
entries carried 121 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Ladies Din won the race last year in 1:48 2-5, and Anet won the  
year before in the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, 4-5 favorite Stormy Jack, who is trained by  
Bob Baffert, won the $106,000 I'm Smokin Stakes for 2-year-olds 
bred in California for his second victory in as many starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Antley and carrying 117 pounds, Stormy Jack covered 5 1/2  
furlongs in 1:03 4-5 in beating Ditka by 3 1/2 lengths, and paid 
$3.60, $2.60 and $2.10. The win was worth $63,600, raising Stormy 
Jack's career earnings to $92,400. 
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar was mixed against major world currencies Monday,  
while stocks in Asia and Europe were mostly higher and gold prices 
rose. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. markets were closed Monday for the Labor Day holiday.  
</P>
<P>
	The dollar slipped to 109.58 Japanese yen in London from 110.22  
late Friday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar finished trading at 
109.62 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, which traded above 124 yen as recently as May, ended  
last week in New York at 110.05 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Market watchers in Japan said sentiment for the dollar remains  
weak and that investors are still optimistic about a possible 
economic turnaround developing in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro, the single currency of 11 European nations, fell to  
$1.0593 in London on Monday from $1.0600 Friday, but the British 
pound was quoted at $1.6047, up from $1.6040. 
</P>
<P>
	Britian's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, gave a strong  
endorsement to the euro in a speech to Japanese business leaders in 
Tokyo. But Cook did not abandon the British government's 
``wait-and-see'' approach to joining the single currency. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the euro has gained acceptance on world bond markets and  
brought new strength to the economies that have adopted the 
currency. Cook also said a decision to join the euro would be 
subject to support by Britons. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, stock market activity around the world got a boost  
from Wall Street's gains on Friday, when a noninflationary 
employment report ignited a powerful rally. The Dow Jones 
industrial average closed up 2.2 percent Friday and the Nasdaq 
composite index rose nearly 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Asian stock markets closed higher.  
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose  
126.52 points, or 0.72 percent, to end Monday's session at 
17,756.51. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was light as U.S. markets were closed and as Japanese  
market players awaited the release Thurday of Japan's April-June 
gross domestic product data. The figures are expected to show GDP 
contracted 0.1 percent from the previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the blue chip Hang Index rose 206.85 points, or  
1.6 percent, closing at 13,385.16. South Korean shares also closed 
sharply higher. The main Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 
32.60 points, or 3.6 percent, to 943.22. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the trend was the Jakarta Stock Exchange, where  
Indonesia's key index slumped more than 4 percent because of 
mounting violence in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index  
was up 43.6 points, or 0.7 percent, at 6,375.7. 
</P>
<P>
	``Markets are looking principally at the strength of demand in  
the States and at prices,'' said Paul Horne, European equity market 
economist at Salomon Smith Barney in London. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Azores Whale Welfare Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADALENA, Azores Islands (AP) -- As tourists flock to marvel at  
the whales and dolphins off these mid-Atlantic islands, an 
environmental dispute is brewing that threatens to match the 
Azores' stormy seas. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecologists and some tour operators say the recent boom in  
whale-watching is endangering the mammals because more and more 
boats are crowding around them. 
</P>
<P>
	The critics say local authorities, who regard whale-watching as  
an easy source of revenue for these largely undeveloped Portuguese 
islands, are handing out too many licenses to new companies looking 
to cash in on the bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nature Protection League, a Portuguese environmental group  
that has monitors in the Azores, says it is deeply concerned about 
reports of some tour boats engaging in ``close-quarter pursuits'' 
of whales and dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``The increase in the number of operators is a real problem  
because competition for business will certainly bring a push for 
even better service, meaning ever-closer observation of the whales, 
mostly by chasing them down,'' says Maria Joao Pereira at the 
environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaime Chu, a partner in a whale-watching company on Pico, one of  
the archipelago's nine islands, fears the worst. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a chaotic turf war the way it's going. One  
day we'll have 50 boats around one whale,'' Chu says gloomily, 
noting there are now over a dozen operators on Pico, a small island 
of about 10,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Chu says his company sticks rigidly to the international  
whale-watching code of conduct. He is angered by what he calls the 
government's scant policing of tour boats, which he claims allows 
some unscrupulous companies to flout the rules while out at sea and 
out of sight of land. He declines to specify the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 25 species of whales and dolphins have been spotted off the  
Azores, traveling along the Gulf Stream. Rich in food, the sea 
provides breeding and calving grounds, making this a prime -- and 
still relatively undiscovered -- spot for whale- and 
dolphin-watching. 
</P>
<P>
	Whales and dolphins have highly sensitive hearing and become  
distressed when speedboats tear around them, gunning their engines. 
</P>
<P>
	Bothering the whales can alter their migration patterns,  
separate groups and interfere in the reproduction activity of the 
protected species, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Whale-watching is becoming big business on Pico, where most  
people live modestly from subsistence farming or fishing and 
average monthly earnings are below 100,000 escudos, or about $540. 
</P>
<P>
	A boat carrying 12 people on a three-hour trip out to sea can  
earn 100,000 escudos. And locals say some owners elicit cash 
payments of $325 to allow a customer to jump in and swim with 
whales -- an exceptionally distressing activity for the mammals. 
</P>
<P>
	For 150 years, up to 1984, whales were hunted with harpoons on  
rowing boats out of Pico. Some 50 whales were slaughtered each 
year, providing the island's main source of income. Then the 
world's nations adopted a moratorium on killing whales that is 
still largely in effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Locals now fear that a hoped-for economic revival based on  
tourists paying to observe the island's former quarry could be 
ruined if the business expands out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to destroy our livelihood,'' says Antonio  
Domingos, a former Pico whale-hunter turned whale-spotter. 
</P>
<P>
	Local tourism officials insist they are reining in the thriving  
whale-watching trade. They point to new rules introduced this year 
that, among other things, require boats to stay at least 50 yards 
from whales. 
</P>
<P>
	Emanuel Verissimo, a local director of Portugal's Institute for  
the Conservation of Nature, says officials have promised to limit 
the number of whale-watching permits. 
</P>

	He also concedes it is hard to enforce the law, mainly because  
of the vastness of the sea.

	``There are some new companies and some of them are adventurers  
who are out to grab a piece of the market and have committed some 
irregularities,'' he says, but he also insists that ``it's not a 
big problem.''

<HEADLINE> `Sixth Sense' Soars at Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Sixth Sense'' remained the top  
box-office draw for the fifth straight weekend with a 
record-breaking take for the four-day Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sixth Sense,'' starring Bruce Willis in the tale of a boy  
who's a magnet for the walking dead, took in $28.5 million, 
according to industry estimates Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's nearly as much as the grosses for the rest of the top  
five films, which took in a combined $30.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never really seen a film at this time of year performing  
so consistently and in such a big way,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, 
president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks the box 
office. ``It's become one of those films like `Titanic' or `Phantom 
Menace' or `Forrest Gump' that just totally capture the imagination 
of movie-goers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disney, the film's distributor, again revised its expectations  
for the film, now up to a minimum final gross of $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's mind-boggling to think how good this picture's playing,''  
said Chuck Viane, head of distribution for Disney. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one new movie, the Skeet Ulrich-Cuba Gooding Jr. thriller  
``Chill Factor,'' cracked the top 10 this weekend, grossing $5.7 
million for sixth place. ``Runaway Bride'' was No. 2 with $8.6 
million, ``The 13th Warrior'' was third with $8.4 million, 
``Bowfinger'' was fourth with $7 million, and ``The Thomas Crown 
Affair'' was fifth with $6.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend's other major opening, ``Outside Providence,'' was  
in 11th place with $3.2 million. The coming-of-age comedy was 
unable to capitalize on the track record of writers Peter and Bobby 
Farrelly, who made ``There's Something About Mary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall box office figures will top $100 million for the  
weekend, breaking the previous Labor Day record of $96 million in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a fitting end to a record summer movie season. The movie  
industry did about $3 billion in business from Memorial Day weekend 
through Labor Day, topping the previous high of $2.6 billion in 
summer 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sixth Sense'' continues to climb the list of Disney's  
highest-grossing movies. The movie will easily pass Disney's No. 2 
picture, ``Aladdin'' with $217 million, and has a shot at beating 
the studio's all-time biggest film, ``The Lion King'' with $312 
million, Viane said. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Monday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
are to be released Tuesday.
