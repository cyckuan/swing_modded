<HEADLINE> `Frostcast' Drives Grain, Soybean / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures advanced Wednesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade after a private forecaster predicted an 
early freeze in the Midwest this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains came on the strength of a late rally after  
Freese/Notis released the early frost forecast, according to 
traders. 
</P>
<P>
	The price rises were modest on a quiet trading day, however.  
Many investors expressed skepticism in the reliability of the 
long-range forecast or said a frost might actually be beneficial by 
drying out a corn crop expected to be early. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 2 cents to $2.86 1/2 per bushel;  
December corn rose 3 1/4 to $2.19 3/4 per bushel; December oats rose 1 1/2 
cents to $1.15 1/4 per bushel; and November soybeans rose 8 1/2 cents to 
$4.75 1/2 per bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while  
pork futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose .55 cent to 65.45 cents per pound;  
October feeder cattle rose .68 cent to 78.55 cents per pound; 
October lean hogs rose .33 cent to 46.20 cents per pound, while 
pork bellies fell 1.50 cents to 59.30 cents per pound.

<HEADLINE> Sean Elliot Released From Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Sean Elliott, who helped lead the San Antonio  
Spurs to their first NBA championship, was released from a hospital 
Wednesday, nine days after having a kidney transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year veteran forward smiled and waved to a few fans who  
gathered as he left Methodist Specialty and Transplant Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``Go Sean, go,'' the onlookers cheered.  
</P>
<P>
	As he departed, Elliott signed autographs for hospital workers.  
On Tuesday, he provided a catered lunch for nurses involved in his 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott said he is ``happy to be going home.''  
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old player had the transplant Aug. 16, receiving a  
kidney from by his brother, Noel, a 32-year-old sales associate in 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Noel, discharged Friday, pushed his famous brother out of the  
hospital in a wheelchair Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean needed the transplant because of a condition known as focal  
segmental glomerular sclerosis. The illness prevents the kidneys 
from properly filtering waste from the blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the transplant, Elliott was weeks away from having to  
undergo kidney dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Another brief surgery was required Saturday to make sure  
Elliott's new kidney was properly connected and working. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Elliott will embark on months of recuperation that probably  
will determine whether he will play again in the NBA.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Says Clinton Vows Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- President Bill Clinton has pledged support  
for Ecuador's efforts to restructure its $13 billion foreign debt 
and negotiate an interim loan agreement with the International 
Monetary Fund, Ecuador's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I praise your efforts to reach agreement with the IMF and I  
encourage you to continue working toward that end,'' Clinton said 
in letter received Friday, according to a Spanish-language news 
release. ``The United States is committed to helping developing 
nations to achieve sustainable economic growth, which includes a 
manageable level of foreign debt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An IMF mission is in Ecuador this week negotiating a $400  
million loan to help tied over this small South American nation 
during its worst economic crisis in 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Obtaining the loan would free up additional economic assistance  
from international lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Ministry of Finance officials hope to restructure $6  
billion of Brady bond debt, as a $98 million interest payment comes 
due Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady bonds, named for former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas  
Brady, allowed 18 countries over the past 10 years to repay their 
debt by repackaging defaulted loans into new bonds traded on the 
international market. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador caused market instability throughout the region last  
week when it hinted it might seek deferral of the $98 million 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Those fears abated this week when Minister of Finance Ana Lucia  
Armijo said that Ecuador would instead propose a ``coordinated 
restructuring'' of it Brady debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador's total foreign debt of $13 billion is expected to total  
117 percent of its gross domestic product by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	This nation, with a population of 12 million people, is  
struggling 55 percent inflation, 16 percent unemployment and a $1.7 
billion budget deficit that has swelled to 7 percent of its gross 
domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Dye's Arm Regains Nerve Function </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) -- Ernest Dye has regained some nerve  
function in his right arm, but the doctors who saved it still don't 
know if the Arizona Cardinals offensive tackle will enjoy full use 
of the limb again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to be hopeful that he will have more function in  
the future,'' vascular surgeon Jerry Mohr said Wednesday. ``The arm 
is viable. Time will be the test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dye's arm was nearly severed on Aug. 16, when a car driven by  
teammate Lester Holmes skidded off Interstate 17 about 25 miles 
south of Flagstaff and rolled over, pinning Dye to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes, a starting offensive guard, gashed his forehead in the  
crash and is not expected to return to action until the regular 
season, and defensive lineman Carl Simpson bruised his hip. 
</P>
<P>
	Both escaped the catastrophic injuries that may have ended the  
career of Dye, a first-round draft choice in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals declined comment on Dye's football future, and  
team spokesman Paul Jensen said that was secondary to his health 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ernest's welfare should remain the sole focus of attention.  
The Cardinals join their fans in offering their prayers for his 
recovery,'' Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Feeling will not return to the arm for months, Mohr told  
reporters at Flagstaff Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very contaminated wound that was cleaned out  
vigorously,'' he said. ``Antibiotics and time along with dressing 
changes (will be critical).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dye underwent a nine-hour operation immediately after the  
accident to repair a bone in his arm and restore blood flow. 
</P>
<P>
	In a seven-hour operation Sunday at the Flagstaff hospital, Mohr  
and orthopedic surgeon Philip Mack performed a second surgery to 
repair the median and ulnar nerves, which control hand and 
lower-arm function. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to do that, the doctors had to graft nerves in Dye's  
lower legs to the damaged nerves in his arm. That enabled them to 
bridge the severed nerves and restore some function in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohr said blood and air seeped into Dye's chest cavity after the  
second surgery. It wasn't known how serious that complication might 
be, but the doctors said his overall health seemed to be improving. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye will be hospitalized in Flagstaff, where the team holds its  
training camp, for at least two more weeks.

<HEADLINE> Ark. Schools Try Uniform Experiment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINE BLUFF, Ark. (AP) -- Keeping track of students in the Watson  
Chapel School District is a snap this term: All their clothes are 
color-coded. 
</P>
<P>
	Elementary students are wearing khaki or blue slacks and white,  
blue or burgundy polo-style shirts. High schoolers wear white, 
hunter green or burgundy shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey Mounts, a 5-year-old kindergartner at Edgewood Elementary,  
wore navy shorts and a baby blue shirt -- blue is her favorite color 
-- when her mom picked her up Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had our doubts at first,'' Christie Mounts said. ``It  
sounded like it was cutting down on individualism. Once they got 
them and tried them on they looked really cute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other schools could follow the district's lead. The Legislature  
has asked all Arkansas public schools to look into whether uniforms 
would suit their needs. Referenda would be put on school election 
ballots next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea behind the law was mainly to get the school boards to  
deal with the issue,'' said Kevin Smith, a state representative 
from Stuttgart. ``It's gotten a lot of attention because of the 
shooting at Columbine and the trenchcoats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two students gunned down 12 schoolmates and a teacher before  
killing themselves April 20 at Columbine High School in Littleton, 
Colo. The gunmen were said to be members of a group that wore dark 
trenchcoats. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3,500-student, five-school Watson Chapel district had hoped  
to reduce school violence by relying on fences, teacher supervision 
and a city-provided police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, many think uniforms also can help: Parents say it's easier  
to dress their kids, children say it eliminates competition and 
administrators hope it leads to a more orderly setting. 
</P>
<P>
	Decked out in wrinkle-free khaki shorts and a tucked-in white  
polo shirt, 10-year-old Michael Dial said he felt comfortable -- and 
anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody almost looks the same and people don't talk about  
you. I could go to church in these,'' he said. Only hats, which are 
still allowed, set some children apart. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arkansas School Boards Association is neutral on the colors.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's an issue of local control. It best works when it's  
thoughtfully planned out by all parties involved -- students, 
teachers, administrators, and parents,'' said spokesman John 
Pennington. 
</P>
<P>
	Troy Lowe, principal of Jacksonville Middle School, said parents  
have been supportive of the new policy, although some complain 
finding clothes in the right color and size has been difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	District Superintendent Danny Knight said he talked with one  
mother who outfitted her two children with three outfits each for a 
total of $200. Local charities also have helped. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it will cut down on any kind of status symbol,'' Lowe  
said, adding that his middle schoolers ``seem to be a little 
quieter and maybe the uniforms have helped.''

<HEADLINE> Battered Braves Keep on Winning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- John Smoltz is starting to feel like it's 1991  
all over again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves no longer have the look of a dominating team.  
Cancer took away their top hitter, while injuries sidelined their 
best reliever and All-Star catcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who remain would have been perfect extras for ``MASH,''  
filling the hospital beds behind Hawkeye and Trapper John. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, despite an epidemic of injuries, the Braves are rolling  
along with the best mark in the major leagues (79-49), intent on 
keeping alive their record streak of playoff appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	In a decade of excellence, this might be their most impressive  
performance since the one that got it all started -- the 
worst-to-first of '91. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just scratching and clawing,'' said Smoltz, who allowed  
only four hits in eight innings Tuesday night as the Braves won 
their sixth in a row, 6-4 over the Cincinnati Reds. ``We don't have 
a team like 1991, but that's the kind of mentality we have. We need 
everybody to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They don't have everybody. The medical report includes Smoltz  
(tender elbow), Greg Maddux (chipped bone in his pitching hand), 
Rudy Seanez (stress fracture in his pitching elbow), Kevin Millwood 
(sore back) and Brian Jordan (aching wrist). 
</P>
<P>
	And those are the lucky ones. Andres Galarraga, Kerry  
Ligtenberg, Javy Lopez and Odalis Perez are done for the year, the 
first two without ever playing a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had our share of injuries, but you can't worry about  
it,'' Bret Boone said. ``Of course, if we had Andres Galarraga, 
Kerry Ligtenberg, Javy Lopez and Odalis Perez, we'd be a better 
team. But you can't control those things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves, 1 1/2 games ahead of the New York Mets in the NL East,  
got an indication of what type of season it would be before it 
began. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, who hit .305 with 44 homers and 121 RBIs last season,  
was diagnosed with cancer in his back just before the start of 
spring training. While expected to make a full recovery, the Big 
Cat had to sit out the year to undergo treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in the early days of spring training, Ligtenberg felt a  
twinge in his right elbow. Doctors discovered a partially torn 
ligament, meaning the Braves would have to replace the pitcher who 
became the first rookie in 12 years to save 30 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving on without their best hitter and top reliever, the Braves  
moved Ryan Klesko to first and 24-year-old John Rocker into the 
closer's role. Klesko was hitting .305 with 18 homers and 68 RBIs, 
while Rocker has 27 saves and seems assured of surpassing 
Ligtenberg's numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	But there would be more holes to fill.  
</P>
<P>
	Lopez, a two-time All-Star catcher who had 34 homers and 106  
RBIs in 1998, hobbled for a couple of weeks on a sore right knee 
before succumbing to season-ending surgery in late July. The Braves 
promptly traded for Greg Myers. 
</P>
<P>
	The same day Lopez's season ended, the Braves learned the  
21-year-old Perez, their fifth starter, would need surgery to 
repair a torn medial collateral ligament in his left elbow. Like 
Ligtenberg, he'll be out at least 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	So, at the July 31 trade deadline, Atlanta acquired left-hander  
Terry Mulholland from the Chicago Cubs. He has been a valuable 
addition both starting and relieving. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz went more than two months without a win -- a streak that  
ended Tuesday night -- and twice went to the DL with lingering 
problems in his right elbow, which has undergone two operations 
since 1994. He is now trying to cope by altering his pitching 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux (16-6) chipped a bone in his right wrist diving for a  
pop-up last Saturday. The four-time Cy Young winner will likely 
miss his next start, at St. Louis on Friday night, but the injury 
is not believed to be serious. 
</P>
<P>
	Batting in the cleanup spot formerly occupied by Galarraga,  
Jordan has 100 RBIs for the first time in his career even though 
he's been plagued with various maladies. At one point, his entire 
right side was hurting. For now, his right wrist aches every time 
he swings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts,'' Jordan said, ``but that's a pain I've got to deal  
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seanez wasn't as fortunate. A valuable middle reliever (56  
games, 6-1, 3.35 ERA, three saves), he felt a strange pain in his 
elbow last week, underwent a bone scan and learned that he has a 
stress fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	Seanez was placed on the DL for the seventh time in his career,  
but he expects to return after resting a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've proven we can win with whoever is on the field,  
whoever is on the mound,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cortes, called up to replace Seanez, had 22 saves at  
Triple-A Richmond, but has been troubled by injuries in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll fit right in with this team.

<HEADLINE> A-10 Bomb Search Renewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Air Force renewed the search Wednesday for the  
four bombs from the suicide crash of an A-10 warplane two years ago 
after a hiker spotted an object wedged between the rocks high in 
the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	The cylindrical object with a tailfin was spotted about eight  
miles south of where Capt. Craig Button's plane went down. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way she described it, it is worth to go up and look at  
it,'' said Capt. Robyn Chumley, a spokeswoman for Langley Air Force 
Base in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The hiker led an Air Force officer, a civilian engineer and a  
forest ranger on the search. 
</P>
<P>
	Button's attack jet, carrying four 500-pound bombs from  
Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Ariz., broke formation 
during a training mission with two other planes on April 2, 1997. 
For three hours, Button flew an erratic 500-mile course that ended 
when he crashed into the 13,000-foot Gold Dust Peak near Eagle, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force investigators concluded he committed suicide. The  
wreckage was found after an 18-day search. But there was no trace 
of the bombs, despite a 72-day search. 
</P>
<P>
	The unidentified hiker discovered the object in the fall, but  
snow and the threat of avalanches prevented officials from heading 
up Whitney Mountain until this week.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Watch Posted in Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A hurricane watch was posted today for the Bahamas  
as forecasters warned that Tropical Storm Dennis could affect the 
southeastern United States by this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was 320 miles east-southeast of Nassau at 5 a.m. EDT and  
moving toward the islands at about 8 mph. Its top winds were nearly 
45 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The central Bahamas were under a tropical storm warning. The  
hurricane watch covered the Turks, Caicos and other Bahama islands 
-- including Bimini, just 55 miles from Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's looking like it's going to be in the central Bahamas by  
Thursday,'' said Trisha Wallace, a meteorologist at the National 
Hurricane Center in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong winds from Dennis extended up to 70 miles from its center  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Residents along the entire southeastern United States coast  
should closely monitor the progress of this system,'' said 
hurricane specialist Jack Beven of the hurricane center. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis is one of three tropical storms the meteorologists were  
watching. 
</P>
<P>
	Emily sprang up in the Caribbean on Tuesday, surprising  
forecasters who hadn't thought it was even a tropical depression. 
Early today, the storm was 455 miles east of the Windward Islands, 
the southern Lesser Antilles. Its top winds also were 45 mph, with 
little change expected before Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm was moving to the northwest at 6 mph.

	Emily may tangle with Tropical Storm Cindy, which was far out in  
the Atlantic.

Friday, if it stays far enough away from Cindy. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 a.m. EDT, Cindy was about 1,100 miles east of the Leeward

</P>
<P>
	Cindy was forecast to swing gradually north and stay over the  
open ocean.

<HEADLINE> Balloon Mortgages: More Attractive? / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With interest rates up, ``balloon'' mortgages  
may be looking more attractive to some home buyers searching for 
ways to bring down expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Rates on balloon notes right now are more than half a percentage  
point below rates on many conventional mortgages, and that could 
translate into hundreds of dollars in annual savings on interest 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a mid-August survey of lenders by HSH Associates, a Butler,  
N.J.-based mortgage-research firm, five- and seven-year balloons 
averaged between just over 7 percent and 7.5 percent. The rate on 
the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 8.3 percent, while the rate on 
the 15-year mortgage was 7.8 percent, and the five-year adjustable 
rate mortgage was 7.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Not a bad comparison, most industry experts will agree. Yet many  
of the experts think most folks should let go of the balloon-loan 
idea because such mortgages may be too risky to handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``A balloon note is a recipe for perpetual debt for most people,  
assuming they're not foreclosed,'' said Peter G. Miller, author of 
several home-buying books and operator of a consumer information 
Web site (www.ourbroker.com). 
</P>
<P>
	With balloon mortgages, payments are based on a 30-year  
repayment schedule, which keeps the monthly payments down. That's 
one advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	But here's the downside: After a short period -- usually just  
five or seven years, depending on the note's maturity -- the entire 
balance is due and payable. Homeowners must then pay off the 
mortgage or get another loan and refinance the debt, which usually 
means additional closing costs. If they can't, they could be forced 
to sell their home or be foreclosed on. 
</P>
<P>
	``If rates rise and your income doesn't, you may not be  
qualified to refinance,'' said Miller. ``And what happens if the 
value of your home declines? Lenders may not give you as much 
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's why balloons haven't exactly been the most popular  
home-financing option in recent years. In July alone they accounted 
for slightly over 1 percent of mortgage applications received by 
mortgage companies, according to the mortgage lender Freddie Mac. 
However, Freddie Mac predicts that if rates continue to climb, as 
they have through the summer, ``a resurgence in balloon-lending 
activity may occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a time, most homeowners in the United States financed their  
homes continuously over short periods. ``People couldn't get 
financing for more than five years, but that changed after the 
Depression,'' said Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	While balloons may carry many risks, they can be useful for some  
home buyers, mainly those who are certain that they will be able to 
pay off the mortgage when it comes due in five to seven years. That 
may include people who expect to sell the house after only a few 
years, or those who anticipate a financial windfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Such home buyers can clearly benefit from the lower rates in the  
meantime, although nearly all their monthly payments will be going 
toward interest rather than principal. 
</P>
<P>
	Balloons also can be beneficial to those individuals who may be  
too busy or simply not inclined to keep track of where interest 
rates are going -- something individuals with ARMs often find 
themselves doing. 
</P>
<P>
	To attract more borrowers, many lenders have added a conversion  
or reset option, which enables a balloon to be converted or 
automatically refinanced for the remainder of the 30-year term near 
the maturity date. 
</P>
<P>
	But here again there's a catch: A conversion usually will only  
be guaranteed if certain criteria are met. In most cases, that may 
mean the borrower would have to make the last 12 to 24 monthly 
mortgage payments on time. 
</P>
<P>
	Such ``unknowns'' only add to the risk factor of balloons,  
experts say. A surprise job loss or illness can lead to a missed 
monthly payment; a company merger can thwart relocation plans; a 
pay cut at work could prevent a family from affording a bigger 
home; interest rates could go north ... 
</P>
<P>
	``You just don't know what's going to happen down the line,''  
said Miller. ``Most households benefit by having conservative 
mortgage options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Gumbinger, a vice president at HSH, agreed that although  
balloons may be financially beneficial to a few, the risks often 
outweigh the benefits. He said home buyers may be better off with a 
hybrid ARM in which rates are fixed for a short period, usually 
anywhere from three to seven years, then adjusted.

<HEADLINE> 3 Students at 1 School Kill Selves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANTIOCH, Calif. (AP) -- A 16-year-old boy became the third  
student in four months from one high school to kill himself with a 
gun, although school officials said there's no reason to think the 
deaths are linked. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're grieving,'' Principal Dee Hopfenspirger said Wednesday.  
``We're very concerned. We're very concerned about our students and 
why they would hurt themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first suicide at Deer Valley High School was in May. The  
second was two weeks ago. The latest death was Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Crisis counselors were at the school this week to help students  
deal with the anguish of losing so many classmates in such a short 
period of time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes with suicide there's what's called a contagion  
effect, where one suicide produces a copycat effect,'' said John 
Bateson, executive director of a crisis center. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's teen suicide rate has tripled in 20 years and is  
the third-leading cause of death for that age group, following 
accidents and homicides, according to the federal Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, an Associated Press review found that more than a third  
of California's 999 school districts had no counselors and no 
psychologists on staff to spot or help troubled children in the 
1997-1998 school year. An additional 70 districts had fewer than 
one full-time counselor or psychologist, the AP reported. 
</P>
<P>
	California schools are far from the only ones dealing with teen  
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	In Monticello, Ga., a 16-year-old Jasper County High School  
sophomore fatally shot herself in the school's parking lot just 
after classes began Wednesday, authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Golf's Best Amateur Says No to Pros  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN (AP) -- The pros can wait for U.S. Amateur champion David  
Gossett. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the desire to play college golf, go to class and spend  
Saturdays watching football games is stronger than the lure of 
endorsement contracts and professional prize money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want another year in school,'' Gossett said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The 20-year-old sophomore business major at the University of  
Texas won the U.S. Amateur last week with a dominating 9-and-8 
final round victory over Korean high school junior Sung Yoon Kim. 
</P>
<P>
	Gossett said he now has goals of winning the NCAA team and  
individual titles. He also wants to see how he'll play in three 
professional majors next season. 
</P>
<P>
	As U.S. Amateur champion, Gossett can play in the Masters, U.S.  
Open and British Open next year if he remains an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to take it one year at a time,'' Gossett said.  
``Playing well as the U.S. Amateur has given me a lot of 
confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gossett said he'll reevaluate his career next summer.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to enjoy my second year at Texas,'' he said. ``I  
just love the enthusiasm here with the football game Saturday, 
there's just so many positive people here at Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gossett has received congratulations and well wishes from  
several former UT golfers, including Justin Leonard, the 1992 U.S. 
Amateur champion, Ryder Cup captain Ben Crenshaw and Tom Kite, with 
whom he has played practice rounds in Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	Gossett said he thought of Kite during his semifinal round at  
the U.S. Amateur against Ben Curtis of Ohio. Sitting on a 
three-hole lead on No. 15, Gossett had to punch back onto the 
fairway after his drive found the rough. Curtis then chipped onto 
the green within 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to get up and down from 65 yards. I was thinking how we  
had practiced wedge shots. I said, 'OK Tom, here we go,' and got it 
to within three feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's that kind of cool on the course that prompts questions of  
how long he'll remain an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
	The college all-American tasted the pressures of the  
professional tour when he shot a first-round 66 in the 1998 FedEx 
St. Jude Classic. He played there again this year but missed the 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has friends in the professional ranks, including Spanish  
teenage sensation Sergio Garcia. The two played junior golf 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Gossett's few mistakes was dropping the lid of the  
winner's trophy after winning the U.S. Amateur. 
</P>
<P>
	``How about that? In front of the world,'' Gossett said. ``I  
just called it a bogey and laughed at it. Oh well, nice problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas golf coach John Fields likes the fact his star player is  
sticking around. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a lot of opportunities that he's going to have to  
look at over the course of the next few years. I know sitting here 
at the University of Texas, I sure wouldn't want him anywhere else 
right now,'' said Fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Gossett will play next month in the Walker Cup in Scotland  
against amateurs from Great Britain and Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	And then it's back to the books instead of the potential big  
money on the pro tours. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's another year to mature and another year to work on my  
golf game,'' Gossett said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's also another year of education and maybe a better  
vocabulary when I answer these questions.''

<HEADLINE> Feedback Sought on New Web Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- An Internet standards body is seeking  
final comment for a new programming language for designing Web 
sites that would make it easier for Web pages to be displayed on 
handheld information devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Wide Web Consortium on Tuesday said it is asking for  
feedback on the use of XHTML, or Extensible Hypertext Markup 
Language, to help make Web pages readable on handheld computers, 
cell phones and other outlets besides desktop browsers. 
</P>
<P>
	XHTML incorporates elements of HTML, the current programming  
language used for displaying documents on the Web and XML, or 
Extensible Markup Language, a newer language that gives Web 
designers more flexibility in designing, sorting and delivering 
information products. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Wide Web Consortium, founded in 1994, develops common  
standards for Web architecture and technology. It is jointly hosted 
by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Institut National 
de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique based in France and 
Keio University in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The consortium is accepting comments about XHTML until Sept. 22  
and will decide afterward whether to adopt it as a recommendation.

<HEADLINE> Mail Carrier Honored for Saving Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Massachusetts mail carrier who rescued an  
elderly man being attacked by two dogs was named Hero of the Year 
by the National Association of Letter Carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	The award, announced Wednesday, will be presented to Donna  
Cutler of Sudbury on Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Nov. 25, Cutler turned a corner in her mail truck and saw  
two dogs atop Joseph Klein, who had suffered a dozen bites to his 
head, arms and legs, the union reported. Cutler used a mail tray to 
push the dogs away and free Klein, who was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	The union also announced three regional heroes:  
</P>
<P>
	--Brenda Waldon of Dallas, Ga., who used a broomstick to rescue a  
toddler from an attacking dog in Smyrna, Ga., last October. 
</P>
<P>
	--Patrick Kowalczyk of Waterloo, Ill., who grabbed a 5-year-old  
boy from the path of a driverless runaway car in St. Louis on Jan. 
27. 
</P>
<P>
	--Paul Romero of Amarillo, Texas, who ran to the scene of a  
highway accident April 12 and pulled an injured motorcyclist from 
beneath his bike just before it was engulfed in flames.

<HEADLINE> Coach Robinson Returns to UNLV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Around this time of year, John Robinson's  
thoughts usually turn to packed stadiums, great rivalries and the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	This year he's worrying about more mundane matters, like whether  
there will be grass on the field when his UNLV football team plays 
its home opener. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not always easy starting over again. But Robinson had an  
idea what he was in for when he signed to take over a team that 
hasn't won in its last 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, they roll that grass out now in big 10-foot rolls,  
so I think it will be there and ready to play on,'' Robinson said. 
``If not, we'll be ready to play anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson has confidence the sod -- part of a stadium remodeling  
job -- will be installed by the team's Sept. 18 home opener against 
Iowa State. He's almost as confident that he can turn UNLV's 
struggling football program around over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	He's been around football too long, though, to promise it will  
be right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may not have a successful season,'' Robinson said. ``But  
eventually we will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What is probably the last coaching job of Robinson's career may  
also be his most ambitious -- remaking a Rebel football team that 
has languished for years in the shadow of the school's basketball 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	He's getting major college money to do it -- $350,000 a year for  
three years -- but getting ready to open on the road Sept. 2 against 
North Texas isn't exactly like grooming USC to play Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, at USC he never had a team challenging Hawaii for  
the longest current losing streak (18 games) in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, you'd love to play before 100,000 people in big games  
all the time, but that isn't the biggest deal,'' the 64-year-old 
Robinson said this week between final two-a-day practices. ``I 
don't care about the surroundings as much as I care about being in 
the action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting back into the action was Robinson's big hope after being  
fired by USC after the 1997 season. He heard about his firing on 
the radio but got the official word on a message left on his home 
answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Rose Bowl wins and a career record of 104-35-4 with USC and  
the Los Angeles Rams wasn't enough after the Trojans went 12-11 
over his final two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a long time coming,'' Robinson said of his firing after  
a second stint with USC. ``It just wasn't a good mix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson faces no such problem at UNLV, where he was courted by  
school officials who thought a big-name coach might be just what 
the school needed to turn around a program that drew only a few 
thousand fans to home games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the western part of the United States, there's not a soul  
who doesn't know about John Robinson and the success he had,'' UNLV 
athletic director Charles Cavagnaro said. ``It was, as far as I was 
concerned, a no-brainer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who won the national championship at USC in 1978 and  
coached the Rams to two NFC championship games, said the more he 
looked at the UNLV job, the more he liked it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every kid who grows up in the United States knows about Las  
Vegas. That's a built-in advantage for recruiting,'' he said. ``And 
my wife and I are West Coast people who like dining out and 
entertainment. It doesn't get any better for those kind of things 
than in this city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson wasted no time in trying to fill some big holes at  
UNLV, recruiting a class that includes seven junior college 
transfers who will start for the Rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	He thinks he has a decent quarterback in transfer Jason Vaughan,  
and a group of starters who can help UNLV hold its own in the new 
Mountain West Conference. But the team has little depth, and if the 
injuries start to mount, so will the losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to make any promises, because those kind of  
things never work,'' Robinson said. ``We realize we're starting 
from scratch. What we have to do is make the team believe in 
itself. We're not 0-16. That was another club. We're 0-0.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Robinson has had to make the team believe it can win, he  
also had to make some doubters believe he didn't take the job to 
lounge around for three years, collect some money and eat at some 
fine restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	He helped accomplish that with a strong recruiting effort and a  
spring camp where he had a hand in everything. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important everything we do, both good and bad, has my  
stamp on it,' Robinson said. ``I'm not a workaholic and I enjoy 
life, but I'm working very, very hard here. And I'm having a 
ball.''

<HEADLINE>  Japan: Job Pressure Caused Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Job pressure drove a Japanese baseball scout to  
commit suicide after he failed to sign a star pitcher, making his 
family eligible for government compensation, the Labor Ministry 
ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government pays a pension of about $17,000 a year to the  
family of a worker who dies from a job-related injury or illness. 
The number of applications for government compensation in cases of 
suicide by overwork has risen dramatically as Japan's economy 
stagnates. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazutoshi Miwata's job as a scout for the Orix BlueWave pro  
baseball club was so stressful that he lost the ability to make 
sound judgments, leading him to jump from the 11th floor of a 
building in Okinawa in October, said Labor Ministry official 
Masayuki Takeda. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would often have to hold meetings at 6:30 a.m.,'' said  
Takeda. ``But unlike many other cases, the real reason for his 
suicide wasn't long hours, but the pressure of his job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Takeda refused to say how much Miwata's family will receive.  
</P>
<P>
	The BlueWave had ordered Miwata to sign high school pitching  
sensation Nagisa Arakaki, the team's top pick in last year's draft, 
and he felt burdened by guilt when negotiations broke down, the 
ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miwata showed classic symptoms of extreme stress -- loss of  
appetite, sleep disorders, memory loss and concentration problems, 
the ministry said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Suicide from overwork -- or ``karojisatsu'' -- is increasingly  
common in Japan, a country famous for its assiduous work force. 
Earlier this year, a Japanese court ordered the government to 
compensate a machine-shop employee who killed himself after working 
80-hour weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the baseball suicide, Orix won exclusive negotiating rights  
to Arakaki in an amateur draft, but the 18-year-old player had 
already said he wanted to play for the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks -- making 
Miwata's task nearly impossible.

<HEADLINE> Loving a Brown Lawn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- The loves of summer feature few  
surprises, but this year in this village we've been given a new 
object of affection. The town fathers urged us to ``love a brown 
lawn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Be a good neighbor,'' their leaflet said, ``and please do not  
water your lawns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's in the interest of preserving our wells and trying to save  
our landscape should this neighborhood face record-breaking drought 
conditions plaguing areas of the East. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, in half a century of gardening here, I've become  
wait-and-see-ish, if not skeptical, of drought warnings. 
Groundwater resources have always seemed good enough and rains have 
had a way of arriving toward the end of the summer. The scare then 
vanishes from the news. In fact, as I write this on a mid-August 
day, we've had showers in the night and more are forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, lawns always get brown in the middle of summer. It's their  
natural cycle of dormancy. They rejuvenate themselves in the fall. 
But this summer's lawns display extensive seared areas so 
dead-looking they scare even a skeptic. 
</P>
<P>
	The town government leaflet notes ``some meteorologists have  
determined that we need the precipitation carried by as many as 
three hurricanes to offset the dryness of the past 12 months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So were asked to refrain from watering lawns, although newly  
planted trees, shrubs and perennials may have water as needed. 
What's at stake by now is not so much this year's garden as next 
year's. Will perennials survive to do their thing in 2000? 
</P>
<P>
	To keep the situation in perspective, I checked with the town  
and was told no one had as yet reported any well going dry in Pound 
Ridge, situated in southern New York about 50 miles north of 
Manhattan. That may mean volunteer conservation efforts are working 
or that our groundwater resources were in good shape to begin with, 
or both. 
</P>
<P>
	I'm talking about gardening, and my own garden in particular,  
and not farms in various Northeastern and Middle Atlantic states 
which have suffered badly and are looking to disaster relief. 
</P>
<P>
	In my vegetable garden, the corn patch has suffered somewhat.  
Ears of Silver Queen, normally plentiful, are scarce and some are 
dwarfish. But, so far, one of them did reach full size and a few 
others seem on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier crops -- asparagus, peas, lettuce, arugula, broccoli,  
cauliflower -- all did OK. And the broccoli are putting out florets 
as usual, following the cutting of the main heads. Tomatoes have 
been maturing on schedule, although perhaps there are fewer fruit. 
The peppers definitely seem to have fewer fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	All this with very little watering on my part except when the  
plants were very young. 
</P>
<P>
	My raspberry patch, in a site difficult to reach with a hose,  
was wiped out as far as a crop this year is concerned. My 
everbearing strawberries, in a raised bed inside my vegetable 
garden, produced magnificently in June, but have been skimpy since. 
I probably should have watered them deeply every day. 
</P>
<P>
	In ornamentals, the showy trees and bushes of spring -- the  
forsythias, magnolias, lilacs, dogwoods, crabapples, redbuds -- all 
were fine. But their blooming season occurred before the dry June, 
July and early August set in. The question, as indicated, is how 
they will do next year if the dryness should persist. The same with 
vines like roses and clematis and my trumpet creeper. 
</P>
<P>
	My son, who has a large ornamental garden on the same acreage we  
share, says he has lost several new plantings by forgetting to 
water them religiously. He reports fewer flowers on his established 
summer-blooming perennials and having to make many more trips with 
water buckets to areas he can't reach with a hose. 
</P>
<P>
	Hereabouts, day laborers who hire themselves out for garden  
chores are getting fewer jobs. And people who would ordinarily be 
buying perennials at nurseries are waiting for the rains to come 
rather than putting new plants at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	An hour's drive to the north, wildlife authorities are reporting  
bears and rattlesnakes coming down from the mountains in search of 
food and water because of withered berry bushes and dried-up 
streams. 
</P>
<P>
	One aspect, however, has been a plus for humans -- the scarcity  
of little puddles and pools has meant few mosquito eggs hatching. 
And so, few mosquito bites. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Airline Workers Held in Drug Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Dozens of American Airlines employees and contract  
workers were arrested today in a federal investigation into a drug 
ring that authorities said used the airline's planes to smuggle 
drugs into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Undercover agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  
Firearms also approached suspects about shipping guns and 
military-style explosives in the sting. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they had was a very elaborate scheme for aiding in the  
distribution of narcotics and weapons,'' said AFT spokesman Ed 
Halley. ``For a price these individuals would bypass security and 
deliver anything that was paid for to a person that was paying for 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation began two years ago after law enforcement  
officials became aware that ``multiple contraband'' was being taken 
into secure areas of Miami International Airport, U.S. Attorney 
Thomas Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people did these acts intentionally knowing there were  
narcotics and that they were paid for,'' Scott said today. ``There 
is no issue of entrapment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-eight people were named in multiple indictments resulting  
from Operation Sky Chef and Operation Ramp Rat, including 30 
American employees, Scott said. Also charged were employees of 
LSG/Sky Chefs, a food service contractor owned by Lufthansa 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges included conspiracy, importation and distribution of  
drugs, and weapons offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	By early afternoon, at least 48 people had been arrested at  
their homes and a few caught at the airport. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Airline Workers Held in Drug Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Dozens of American Airlines employees and contract  
workers were arrested today in a federal investigation into a drug 
ring that authorities said used the airline's planes to smuggle 
drugs into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Undercover agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  
Firearms also approached suspects about shipping guns and 
military-style explosives in the sting. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they had was a very elaborate scheme for aiding in the  
distribution of narcotics and weapons,'' said AFT spokesman Ed 
Halley. ``For a price these individuals would bypass security and 
deliver anything that was paid for to a person that was paying for 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation began two years ago after law enforcement  
officials became aware that ``multiple contraband'' was being taken 
into secure areas of Miami International Airport, U.S. Attorney 
Thomas Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people did these acts intentionally knowing there were  
narcotics and that they were paid for,'' Scott said today. ``There 
is no issue of entrapment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-eight people were named in multiple indictments resulting  
from Operation Sky Chef and Operation Ramp Rat, including 30 
American employees, Scott said. Also charged were employees of 
LSG/Sky Chefs, a food service contractor owned by Lufthansa 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges included conspiracy, importation and distribution of  
drugs, and weapons offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	By early afternoon, at least 48 people had been arrested at  
their homes and a few caught at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The drugs, which included bogus cocaine and marijuana supplied  
by agents, were smuggled to points including Philadelphia and San 
Juan, Puerto Rico, in airline food carts, garbage bags and 
backpacks by uniformed workers who eluded metal detectors and 
airport X-rays.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the  
United States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 23  
</P>
<P>
	The State, Columbia, S.C., on presidential candidate John  
McCain: 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential candidate John McCain, a U.S. senator from Arizona,  
wasn't even in the Iowa straw poll ... but as far as we're 
concerned, he emerged stronger than anyone who was. 
</P>
<P>
	First, McCain won points for character for speaking the truth  
about Iowa's role in the presidential contest. He refused to 
participate in the nonbinding vote, which represents only a small, 
self-selected and unrepresentative group of Iowa Republicans. He 
correctly called it a ``sham and a joke'' because the tiny group of 
participants could be easily targeted and influenced by candidates 
with the most money -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Forbes magazine 
publisher Steve Forbes. ... 
</P>
<P>
	One thing is certain: The Republicans this year have no shortage  
of good candidates. Not only are McCain, Bush and Forbes credible, 
but former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole and conservative 
Gary Bauer help ensure a multiplicity of viewpoints. If candidates 
stick to issues, this could be the most worthwhile contest for the 
Republican presidential nomination in years. 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 24  
</P>
<P>
	NewsPress, Stillwater, Okla., on Iowa straw poll:  
</P>
<P>
	Say what you will of the Iowa straw poll, there is a lesson to  
be learned from it for Oklahoma: do not follow the recommendation 
of Lance Ward, secretary of the state Election Board. Ward 
recommends abolishing the state's presidential primary and 
replacing it with the caucus system. Bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
	It's true, the Iowa straw poll was a non-binding political event  
(the caucuses won't be held until early next year). That, however, 
didn't keep it from almost immediately ending the presidential 
ambitions of Lamar Alexander and sending others (like Dan Quayle) 
into a nose dive. While the ``real'' elections will come later, the 
straw poll demonstrated why presidential primaries are better than 
the caucus system. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Do we want the presidential winnowing process decided by who can  
afford to bus the most people to an event, pay them to vote, hire 
celebrities to entertain them, and provide them with the most 
comfortable surroundings? ... 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 24  
</P>
<P>
	St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times, on Texas Gov. George W. Bush:  
</P>
<P>
	In the absence of a shred of evidence that Texas Gov. George W.  
Bush ever used cocaine, Bush would have had every right to stick to 
his original pledge not to answer questions on the subject. ... 
</P>
<P>
	However, character is a relevant issue in presidential campaigns  
-- and the debris of the Clinton presidency will make questions of 
character more important than usual in 2000. ... 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, the public generally is more realistic, and less  
hypocritical, than politicians or the press about such issues. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Voters and reporters might have reasonable questions about how  
Gov. Bush's personal history jibes with his support for tough drug 
laws in Texas. ... 
</P>
<P>
	They might also wonder how the candidate with the best staff  
money can buy could stumble so badly over simple questions about 
cocaine. The stumbles raise larger questions about whether Gov. 
Bush has the maturity, judgment and temperament to be president. 
Voters will make that decision based on what is in his heart and 
between his ears -- not what might have gone up his nose long ago. 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 19  
</P>
<P>
	The Monitor, McAllen, Texas, on a Hillary Clinton visit:  
</P>
<P>
	She came. She saw. She took the money and ran.  
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton breezed into McAllen Wednesday morning,  
to share breakfast with Rio Grande Valley supporters and to pass a 
plate of her own -- a collection plate. Only supporters willing to 
pay $1,000 per plate were invited to the breakfast. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's visit here and other Texas cities was strictly to  
raise money for a Senate race she hasn't entered officially. She 
had no time for the public, much of which has stood behind her for 
nearly a decade, throughout her and her husband's various personal, 
political and legal peccadilloes. No comments as she stepped off 
the plane, no waves from the motorcade, no words of thanks as she 
left. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The everyday people who have defended her all these years, in  
the Valley and elsewhere, deserve more than a fleeting glimpse from 
afar. Clinton could have -- and should have -- taken a couple of 
minutes to make a public statement. The fact that she did not deem 
the people worthy of such attention makes one wonder if she would 
use a seat in Congress to serve the people, or only to serve 
herself.

<P>
	The New York Times, on Federal Reserve:  
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve Board is acting cautiously in trying to slow  
the American economy and head off a resurgence of inflation. 
Investors appear to be confident that such a gradual approach will 
have a minimal impact on the economy. In the near term, they are 
probably right. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed is acting responsibly in trying to slow the economy  
gradually. President Clinton and Congress should cooperate by 
pursuing a lean fiscal policy. In particular, as Mr. Greenspan has 
asked, they should avoid tax cuts that would unnecessarily 
stimulate the economy and increase the chances that the Fed will 
have to raise interest rates again. 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 22  
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio Express-News, on children's health bill:  
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is sending auditors to every state to  
investigate whether they have improperly excluded people 
particularly children from health care, either from Medicaid, the 
health-care program for the poor, or from the federal Children's 
Health Insurance Program, created by Congress in 1997 to cover 
other uninsured children. 
</P>
<P>
	While CHIP won't start in Texas until next spring, the state has  
1.4 million children without health insurance. Experts told The 
Dallas Morning News that nearly 600,000 poor Texas children 
eligible for Medicaid are not enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
	... Physicians in Bexar County, where there are 104,000  
Medicaid-eligible children, long have complained that the 
application for Medicaid is so complicated that many families do 
not fill it out. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Architects of Texas CHIP are promising an application form that  
is simpler than that for the Medicaid plan. ... 
</P>
<P>
	No child, no matter his or her circumstances, should be denied  
adequate health care. The Medicaid audit is necessary nit-picking. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Texas should design a user-friendly CHIP to cover the  
rest of its uninsured future taxpayers. 

</P>

<P>
	Star Tribune of Minneapolis, on mystery object in sky:  
</P>
<P>
	... It is the nature of science ... to solve mysteries, and the  
nature of technological advance to build our capacity for 
classifying the universe, bit by bit, into increasingly neater 
piles. 
</P>
<P>
	But now and then comes a reminder that we haven't got it all  
mapped and sorted yet. ... One of these arrived last week in news 
accounts of an odd little light in the northern constellation 
Serpens, which some of the world's best astronomers have been 
squinting at for three years now. Despite their best efforts, its 
identity remains uncertain; it may be a completely new type of 
celestial body. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysis of its light has more or less established that it is  
neither star nor galaxy. Some scientists think these readings kind 
of, sort of, resemble those of quasars -- those odd energy centers 
that inhabit black holes -- but others disagree. ... 
</P>
<P>
	(The mystery object) doesn't fade or grow brighter. It doesn't  
collapse or explode. It sits still ... complicating the efforts of 
astronomers to reckon even whether it is in our galactic 
neighborhood or far, far away. 
</P>
<P>
	On its own, the object is an intriguing puzzle. In the context  
of advancing astronomical technology, it is the likely harbinger of 
many more mysteries to come as our instruments grow more powerful 
and our techniques more sophisticated. As the century nears an end, 
we humans seem poised not so much on the verge of explaining all we 
can behold, but of beholding a universe whose diversity well 
exceeds our current understanding. ...

	The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer, on fugitive investor:  
</P>
<P>
	One would think that Martin R. Frankel, the fugitive U.S.  
investor who fled to Europe after allegedly stealing up to $300 
million from insurance companies, would be cowering in a hotel, 
afraid that room service might come courtesy of the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	But thanks to creaking intercontinental bureaucracies, Frankel  
has been handed a fugitive's greatest gift -- time. 
</P>
<P>
	He has spent it moving through France, Spain and Italy, staying  
well ahead of la policia even though his poster has been faxed to 
170 countries belonging to Interpol, the international police 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	No doubt about it, a little international cooperation among law  
enforcement could have cut Frankel's Roman holiday short and 
brought him back to face a U.S. judge.

	Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on earthquake in Turkey:  
</P>
<P>
	It is said that the probability of rescuing anyone alive in such  
circumstances suddenly drops 72 hours after disaster has struck. 
Relief work requires promptness more than anything else. The relief 
team (from Japan) achieved success partly because it promptly left 
Japan as soon as it learned of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	However, promptness alone does not assure success in relief  
work. Other indispensable measures after initial emergency work 
include medium-term assistance for the treatment of injured 
persons, prevention of epidemics and assistance to citizens so they 
can get on with their daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
	... As shown by the Great Hanshin Earthquake, there is no quick  
fix to rebuilding devastated areas and getting survivors back on 
their feet. The Turkish economy is faltering because of the 
economic crisis in Russia, a key trading partner. The earthquake 
just adds to the country's woes. The survivors will find it very 
hard to rebuild their lives. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 24  
</P>
<P>
	Le Matin, Lausanne, Switzerland, on earthquake in Turkey:  
</P>
<P>
	Turkey is part of the developing world. It isn't rich enough to  
face alone the massive destruction of the Izmit region, the 
country's industrial heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Without massive aid, it will be unable to rebuild not just its  
factories, but also its infrastructure -- roads, bridges, water and 
electricity systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The wounds that World War II inflicted on Europe and Japan were  
healed thanks to that American balm, the Marshall Plan. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Ankara also would like to turn disaster into victory. It is  
counting on the wave of solidarity that followed the earthquake 
when even traditional enemies, such as Greece and Iraq, rushed to 
its bedside. 
</P>
<P>
	But the gap between this spontaneous help and Turkey's needs is  
enormous. 
</P>
<P>
	Sums are needed that Western countries can't even give, because  
Ankara is not alone in seeking money. 
</P>
<P>
	The countries hit by last year's Hurricane Mitch or by the Asian  
and Russian financial crises, to name but a few, are all waiting 
for these funds which will allow them to move forward. 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 24  
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Telegraph, London, on Slobodan Milosevic:  
</P>
<P>
	Since Slobodan Milosevic turned himself from Communist  
apparatchik into nationalist leader 12 years ago, he has ruthlessly 
exploited the Serbs' exaggerated sense of victimhood. The desire to 
get their own back on their supposed tormenters has led to the 
horror of ethnic cleansing in Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and 
Kosovo. But the strategy that lay behind it, the creation of a 
Greater Serbia, has dismally failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Far from strengthening their presence, the Serbs have fled  
Croatia en masse and are doing the same in Kosovo. Their status as 
perennial victims confirmed, they are now demanding the 
establishment of exclusively Serbian cantons in the province as the 
only way to protect them from Albanian revenge. They should be 
firmly rebuffed. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the principles for which NATO intervened in Bosnia and  
Kosovo was to re-establish a multi-ethnic polity whose members 
could move freely without fear of intimidation. That this ideal has 
yet to be realised points not to its invalidity, but to a lack of 
will in its implementation. In Bosnia, the alliance has been 
notoriously hesitant in enforcing the provisions of Dayton 
regarding resettlement. In Kosovo, it is manifestly unable, without 
police assistance, to guard the Serbs against Albanian attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer in the second case is not to set up cantons, which  
would be a significant step towards partition, but rapidly to build 
up a domestic police force. The sooner local representatives assume 
responsibility for law and order, the better. 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 21  
</P>
<P>
	The Nation, Bangkok, Thailand, on China and Taiwan:  
</P>
<P>
	It is not surprising at all that Taiwanese President Lee  
Teng-hui has supported the island's participation in a missile 
defense umbrella called Theater Missile Defense (TMD). ... The way 
Beijing chose to respond to its renegade province's growing 
assertiveness has not been constructive at best. When China talks 
about using force, together with leaks of military exercises, the 
whole region shivers. And that is not good for China. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly the talk of war by China and its controlled media have  
helped fan the fire of Taiwanese patriotism and toughen its defense 
posture. Increased arms acquisition will come in the near future. 
Lee is a shrewd politician who knows exactly what the Kuomintang 
Party needs to win the next presidential election and how to keep 
China at bay. ... 
</P>
<P>
	China's growing frustration with Taiwan and continued  
intimidation only plays into the hands of TMD supporters both on 
the island and Japan, especially among conservative groups. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 24  
</P>
<P>
	La Repubblica, Rome, on Russian politics:  
</P>
<P>
	The alliance between Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and ex-premier  
Yevgeny Primakov is one of the most interesting developments in 
Russia's politics. The alliance seems very strong ... and it 
appears likely to get a majority in the Duma and (to elect) one of 
its candidates to the presidency of the federation. 
</P>
<P>
	It is certain, however, that in the upcoming months the  
confrontation between this party and President Boris Yeltsin's 
allies will be violent, and it will be filled with low blows from 
both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	The main actors on the political scene are what they are: but  
nobody has so far spoken out against democracy, and hopefully a new 
generation of politicians will come out after the year 2000 to 
clean up the worst aspects of Russian politics. ... 

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	The Straits Times, Singapore, on Kashmir:  
</P>
<P>
	After last month's clashes over Kashmir that left 1,000 dead,  
there were hopes that India and Pakistan would have been 
sufficiently worn out not to have stomach for another call to 
action stations. Dream on. Five days before their common 52nd 
anniversary of independence two Sundays ago, a Pakistani 
reconnaissance plane was shot down with the loss of 16 lives. ... 
In the circumstances, it would take only the intervention of the 
United States to get the two sides to talk terms. The U.S., which 
effectively stopped the latest Kashmir skirmish, has said it would 
not mediate unless requested to by both countries. This is being 
unusually coy.

<HEADLINE> Nebraska's QB Hopeful Fields Punts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Nebraska quarterback Bobby Newcombe,  
hampered last season by a knee injury, is so sure he's healthy 
he'll go as far as returning punts to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcombe, battling Eric Crouch for the Cornhuskers' quarterback  
job, fielded three punts during a two-hour workout Wednesday. He 
said it wouldn't be a surprise if he returns kick during the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a lot of fun,'' Newcombe said after the practice, not  
worried about being leveled by a special-teams players who has 40 
yards to build up steam. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always a risk involved. But there's a bigger risk  
playing quarterback than punt returner. Standing back in the pocket 
or throwing the ball on an option play, you get hit every play,'' 
Newcombe said. ``But standing back on a punt return, you're either 
giving a shot or running with the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newcombe wouldn't be the first quarterback to do double-duty as  
a punt returner. John Hadl, a former NFL great in the 1960s, 
routinely returned kicks when he played at Kansas. But it is 
unusual for a quarterback to pull such double duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcombe returned punts two years ago when the Cornhuskers, who  
had Scott Frost starting at quarterback, were desperate to get the 
speedy freshman into the game. His 244 yards on 12 punt returns 
(20.3 yards per return) led the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Newcombe replaced Frost at quarterback, but tore a  
knee ligament and played only six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska coach Frank Solich said he won't rule out letting  
Newcombe return punts again, but he's stopping short of naming the 
6-foot junior as his top returner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't get too excited about anything at this point on  
that end of it,'' Solich said. ``There's a lot of things to 
consider before we go forward with that kind of decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd consider it,'' Solich said. ``If he did return maybe two  
or so punts I don't think you're putting him at that much risk.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock closed mixed Wednesday, with some  
markets depressed by the overnight U.S. interest rate hike and 
Japanese shares falling on its currency's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 240.25 points,  
or 1.33 percent, to 17,855.16. On Tuesday, the average had fallen 
0.76 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar initially rose against the Japanese yen after a  
top finance official indicated the government is ready to curb the 
yen's rise. But traders soon realized that the Bank of Japan hadn't 
intervened, and the dollar fell back. 
</P>
<P>
	In late trading, the dollar bought 111.32 yen, down 0.90 yen  
from late Tuesday but above its late New York level of 110.80 yen 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen hurts exporters' competitiveness and slows economic  
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, shares fell as the U.S. interest rate increase  
stirred fears that Hong Kong banks will follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 1.1 percent, or 154.74  
points, to 13,479.13. The Hang Seng had gained 0.5 percent Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's de facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary  
Authority, raised the discount rate by a quarter point, but it 
won't be clear whether the banks will go along until they meet 
after the market closes Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rises in U.S. interest rates often are followed by similar moves  
in Hong Kong because the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. 
currency, but experts warn this time that higher rates could harm 
the territory's efforts to climb out of recession. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bangkok, prices rallied on huge foreign speculative buying in  
banking stocks, which had fallen sharply lately, and on news that 
Thailand would keep interest rates low. 
</P>
<P>
	The SET index jumped 4.9 percent, or 22.15 points, to 468.70.  
</P>
<P>
	Thailand will continue to reduce interest rates to boost the  
economy despite the U.S. rate hike, said the central bank's 
assistant governor for monetary policy, Kiettisak Meecharoen. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares fell, despite widespread market  
expectations of strong economic growth. The Composite Index closed 
at 768.43, down 6.75 points, or 0.87 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares fell slightly after the World Bank  
threatened to halt aid if the investigation into irregularities in 
fund transfers at Bank Bali isn't concluded satisfactorily. The JSX 
Composite Index fell 0.979 point, or 0.2 percent, at 585.257. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares rose on strong demand for blue chips.  
The PSE index rose 11.21 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,260.14. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: South Korean shares rallied on hopes that the troubled  
Daewoo Group can repay its debts soon. The Kospi rose 30.59 points, 
or 3.3 percent, to 963.00. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Singapore shares rose, led by heavyweight property  
developer City Developments Ltd. The Straits Times Index rose 16.34 
points, or 0.78 percent, to 2,136.36. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares fell on poor corporate earnings and  
the U.S. interest rate hike. The All Ordinaries index fell 19.1 
points, or 0.6 percent, to 3,033.3. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Taiwan shares rallied as investors bought heavily in  
semiconductor-related stocks. The Weighted Price Index rose 142.70 
points, or 1.8 percent, at 8,127.09. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand stocks fell for a fifth consecutive  
session in listless trading. The NZSE-40 capital index fell 2.18

<HEADLINE> Figure Skating Championship Moved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The international figure skating  
federation has moved next year's world championship from Brisbane, 
Australia, to the French city of Nice, an official confirmed today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can confirm that, for technical and organizational reasons,  
the ISU council has decided to move the championships from 
Australia to Nice,'' said Aline Bussat, spokeswoman for the 
International Skating Union. 
</P>
<P>
	She declined to give details of those reasons or to say when the  
decision was made. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Brisbane championship officials headed to Lausanne  
today for talks reportedly aimed at stopping the ISU from moving 
the March world championships to Nice because it would offer better 
television revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Local officials said such a switch would be a financial disaster  
for Australia's Ice Skating federation. After winning the bid in 
June 1997, the Australian federation is heavily committed to 
hosting the championships at Brisbane's 12,000-seat Convention 
Center from March 18-25. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they would consider legal action if the event is  
shifted.

<HEADLINE> Paterno, Lions Ready for Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Penn State had plenty of reasons to  
turn down the offer to play in the Pigskin Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	The third-ranked Nittany Lions already face one tough  
non-conference opponent, No. 12 Miami in the Orange Bowl. Their Big 
Ten schedule, meanwhile, is geared for a title run: They meet both 
No. 8 Michigan and No. 9 Ohio State in Beaver Stadium, and they 
don't face No. 10 Wisconsin at all. 
</P>
<P>
	So why risk it? Why sign up for a game against No. 4 Arizona?  
</P>
<P>
	Simple. This Penn State team can win this game -- and a lot more  
this year -- and denials aside, Joe Paterno knows it. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State's coach insists that he didn't want to play it, that  
his team voted for the early test. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's been known to test his teams in these made-for-TV  
openers. The Lions were underdog winners over No. 7 Southern Cal in 
1997, and they beat Georgia Tech in 1991, the year after the Yellow 
Jackets finished No. 2. They once even took on a No. 1, Nebraska, 
although they were routed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In most cases, you feel like you've got a pretty good football  
team,'' Paterno said Tuesday. ``This particular year, I think we're 
a good football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, dispelling any notion that he has abandoned his tradition  
of bad-mouthing his new team before the season, he added, ``Whether 
we're as good as people think we are, I doubt it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Practice hasn't changed the quarterback situation, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year's starter, Kevin Thompson, will get the nod Saturday.  
Rashard Casey -- the speedy backup recruited by Arizona a few years 
ago -- might play a little, but don't expect him to split time 
evenly with Thompson, as Arizona's Ortege Jenkins and Keith Smith 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere on offense, training camp took its toll. Cordell  
Mitchell, the probable starting tailback, pulled a hamstring and 
missed five days of drills. He started seven games in 1998 before 
being sidelined by a nerve problem in his shoulder. As he did late 
last season, Eric McCoo might start in his place Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Making matters worse in the backfield, Aaron Harris' bad luck  
continued. The fullback needed a good August workout after 
struggling in 1998 with knee trouble, but he pulled a groin muscle 
and missed a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been bumped up quite a bit,'' Paterno said.  
</P>
<P>
	But if the past is any measure, he won't regret the decision to  
play Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really, there are very few negatives,'' he said. ``When you  
have a chance to prepare for a team as good as Arizona, you 
probably get a little more out of summer conditioning and preseason 
practice. Win or lose, you are probably a better football team when 
you start the next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, he has seen it torpedo a team's confidence. After  
Nebraska thrashed Penn State -- the defending national champ -- in 
1983, the Lions lost the next three and finished 8-4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We overestimated ourselves in '83,'' Paterno admits. ``We  
weren't even in the same league. We were not ready to take on a 
team that was on a mission like that Nebraska team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would be shocked to see that happen in 1999. Both teams  
expect standout seasons. But while some consider a tough preseason 
game a step toward a national title for a Top 10 team, Paterno has 
let his team know that it usually doesn't work that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a great first opponent,'' McCoo said earlier this  
month, ``but it doesn't predict what's going to happen down the 
road.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-NFL Player Gets Life for Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- Raphel Cherry, a former NFL player with  
Washington and Detroit, was sentenced to life in prison Wednesday 
for the murder of his estranged wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherry, 37, who set 22 passing records at Hawaii before moving  
into the NFL in 1985, showed no emotion as Circuit Judge Marion 
Humphrey read the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	It took 15 minutes for the jury of nine women and three men to  
decide Cherry's sentence. He was convicted previously of felonies 
involving forgery and the fraudulent use of a credit card. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, the prosecution portrayed the victim, Jerri  
Cherry, as a woman afraid to leave her Jacksonville, Fla., home for 
fear her husband would find her. She had been staying with 
relatives at least two weeks before the Dec. 22, 1998 murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The day she died, her divorce lawyer served Cherry with a  
subpoena demanding financial information related to his NFL salary 
and pension. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad the jury saw through all the smoke screens,'' deputy  
prosecuting attorney John Hout said. ``But even after all this, it 
still doesn't take away what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Cherry nor his lawyer, Dale Adams, commented after he  
was led from the courtroom. Cherry has 30 days to appeal.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Defends Missile Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senior Pentagon official who wants more  
tests of an Army anti-missile system before further development is 
done said Wednesday he supports the Defense Department's decision 
to skip further tests on the old design of the interceptor. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Philip Coyle, the department's director of operational  
test and evaluation, said a ``next generation'' of the anti-missile 
missile should receive more testing before further development or 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	``I recommend a strong ground-testing program, as well as  
long-range flight-testing,'' Coyle wrote in a memo released by the 
Pentagon. He suggested his position had been misinterpreted as 
criticism of the Pentagon decision to move to the next phase in the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon announced last week that it would skip another test  
of an experimental anti-missile missile and to move to the next 
stage in the interceptor's development. 
</P>
<P>
	After six initial failures were followed by two recent  
successes, the Pentagon said it was satisfied little would be 
accomplished by additional tests of the experimental version of its 
Theater High Altitude Area Defense system, known as THAAD. 
</P>
<P>
	Coyle, commenting in the current issue of Defense Week, a trade  
publication, had said the two successful tests, carried out at the 
Army's White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, differed from 
conditions of a real attack. He said they had been ``shaped and 
closely scripted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He recommended more tests at a different, larger test range,  
specifically the Kwajalein Missile Range in the Marshall Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Coyle said in his memo to his Pentagon supervisors, released  
Wednesday by his office, that he did not mean to register 
opposition to the decision to stop testing the particular missile, 
or to criticize the tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``The THAAD tests to date at White Sands Missile Range have been  
conducted carefully and professionally. These tests were important, 
necessary, and valuable, and were not `cooked' or `rigged.' The 
test limitations were unavoidable given range safety considerations 
and the maturity of the THAAD program,'' Coyle wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he stuck to his recommendation that tests on a next  
generation of the missile, to be built by Lockheed Martin Corp., be 
conducted at the Kwajalein site before the Pentagon commits to 
further development of the missile or production.

<HEADLINE> Medication Mixups Cause Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Trying to avoid medication errors and the need  
to change the names of its hottest selling drug, Monsanto Co. and 
Pfizer Inc. have launched a campaign to make sure doctors and 
pharmacists don't mix up Celebrex with similar-sounding drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex, the hot-selling new arthritis pill, sounds a lot like  
Celexa, a depression treatment, and Cerebyx, an anti-seizure drug. 
And it's not just patients who are confused. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Celebrex was launched in January, federal regulators have  
received 95 reports of errors by doctors and pharmacists in 
dispensing Celebrex -- problems blamed on health professionals 
confusing the painkiller with similarly named drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the cases involve serious injury or death. But the two  
companies that jointly sell Celebrex -- Monsanto and Pfizer -- have 
recently started trying to clear up the confusion with an 
educational campaign aimed at doctors and pharmacists. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an accident waiting to happen,'' said Hedy Cohen, vice  
president of nursing at the Institute for Safe Medication 
Practices, a Huntington Valley, Pa., nonprofit group that tracks 
medication errors. ``It's a matter of time until a person that is 
already sick gets the wrong drug and the chance for a serious 
injury can occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, Celebrex became the fastest-selling new drug ever,  
with about 9.3 prescriptions written so far. It is on track to have 
more than $1 billion in sales this year, and upwards of $4 billion 
by 2002, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 95 medication mixups reported to the Food and Drug  
Administration, only 22 cases involved a patient actually taking 
the wrong drug. With the rest, someone caught the error in time. 
</P>
<P>
	At the urging of the FDA, Monsanto and Pfizer have paid for  
advertisements in major medical journals to make sure doctors and 
pharmacists understand the difference between the sound-alike drugs 
and the need to verify they are giving out the right pill. The 
companies' marketing representatives are reinforcing the message 
during visits to doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	If the problem does not improve, the FDA could make the  
companies change the drug's name, which analysts say could threaten 
sales. Monsanto has already changed the drug's name once, from 
Celebra, after federal regulators said it sounded too much like 
other medications. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still concerned about the problem,'' said Jerry  
Phillips, an FDA official who assesses the risk of drugs that 
already have reached the market. ``This is a significant number of 
errors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Medical experts say reports to the FDA generally represent a  
small proportion of the errors that occur because the reporting 
system is voluntary. But Monsanto officials said more mixups occur 
with Celebrex because the drug is so popular, and they stressed the 
number of actual medication errors is a very small percentage of 
the prescriptions written. 
</P>
<P>
	Celexa is made by Forest Laboratories, and Cerebyx by  
Warner-Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto spokeswoman Sally Benjamin Young would not reveal how  
much the company is spending on the education campaign, which 
started last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies are advising pharmacists to ask patients about the  
drug they are receiving to avoid any errors. The mixups largely 
occur because pharmacists cannot read the doctor's handwriting, 
pharmacists say.

<HEADLINE> Cash-for-Guns Program Gets Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- District of Columbia police more than doubled  
their budget for getting illegal guns off the streets by buying 
them and still spent nearly all of it the second day of the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said 1,058 guns were turned in Tuesday at police stations  
throughout the city, including handguns, sawed-off shotguns and 
assault rifles, all of them illegal in the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the guns turned in on Monday and Tuesday did not come  
from criminals, police said, and 57 of them were not paid for 
because they are legal under the district's law. 
</P>
<P>
	Catherine Gilbert of Silver Spring, Md., was among several  
elderly women who participated in the program. ``I inherited the 
gun. I've got no need for it. I don't want it in my house,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many who turned in guns were from suburban Maryland and  
Virginia. They included one collector who handed over more than two 
dozen guns. Police put no geographical limits on the program, 
saying guns from other areas can easily be used in the district. 
</P>
<P>
	Police are paying for the $225,000 program with money and assets  
collected from drug dealers. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer 
said the department collects about $800,000 in such funds annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Police originally allotted $100,000 for the program but decided  
to add more money to it Monday, when they collected 1,164 guns.

<HEADLINE>  Bosnia Commander Arrested in Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Austrian police arrested the top  
Bosnian Serb military commander today on U.N. charges of 
persecuting Bosnian Croats and Muslims in a bloody 1992 ethnic 
purge, the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Momir Talic, chief of staff of the Bosnian Serb army, was  
charged in a sealed indictment with crimes against humanity, 
``namely persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds,'' 
tribunal chief prosecutor Louise Arbour told reporters in The 
Hague. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment, which also charges former Bosnian Serb deputy  
prime minister Radislav Brdjanin, accuses the two of ordering, 
implementing and assisting ``a plan designed to expel the Bosnian 
Muslim, Bosnian Croat and other non-Serb populations.'' Brdjanin 
was arrested July 6 and is in the tribunal's custody. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men are charged with leading a campaign aimed at driving  
100,000 non-Serbs from the Prijedor and Sanski Most regions of 
northwest Bosnia. Tribunal prosecutors allege that Serb forces 
under the command of Talic and Brdjanin terrorized Muslims and 
Croats into fleeing those areas, and that those who didn't leave 
were driven out by force. Hundreds were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Talic, who was appointed military chief-of-staff in February  
1998, was a leading military commander during the Bosnian conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian authorities made the arrest this morning after being  
tipped off by the tribunal that Talic was attending a conference at 
the Austrian defense academy on how to merge Bosnian Serb forces 
and forces from the Muslim-Croat federation into a national army. 
</P>
<P>
	Talic's indictment had been kept secret to give authorities a  
chance to arrest him, the tribunal said. It said it would unseal 
the indictment and make details public later today or Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Talic was expected to be extradited to The Hague later today,  
Austrian Interior Minister Karl Schloegl said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Austrian National Defense Academy told the  
Austria Press Agency that Talic had flown to Vienna on Tuesday 
aboard a plane of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe and entered the country unhindered. The spokesman said that 
Talic had been picked by the OSCE for participation in the military 
seminar. 
</P>
<P>
	A high-ranking official in the Bosnian Serb parliament, Dragutin  
Ilic, denounced the arrest as ``completely immoral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have said many times we have nothing against public  
indictments -- they give people a chance to turn themselves in 
voluntarily to The Hague tribunal in order to prove their 
innocence,'' Ilic said. But, he added: ``The manner in which a 
high-ranking official was arrested today is completely immoral and 
inappropriate. It shames the host country, Austria, which invited 
him on an official visit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talic would be the highest-ranking Serb military official tried  
by the tribunal, spokesman Jim Landale said. If convicted, he would 
face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the greatest ethnic cleansings were committed in  
Bosnia directly under Talic's command,'' Amor Masovic, head of the 
Muslim Commission for Missing Persons, told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Masovic said his commission discovered the largest number of  
Bosnia's mass graves in Krajina in northwest Bosnia, an area 
controlled by Talic during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	The graves contained the remains of more than 1,500 Muslims.  
Another 188 bodies were found in a mass grave in one of Talic's 
wartime barracks in the village of Laniste, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Masovic said the area had some of the most infamous  
concentration camps commanded by the Bosnian Serb troops.

prime minister Radislav Brdjanin, accuses the two of ordering, 
implementing and assisting ``a plan designed to expel the Bosnian 
Muslim, Bosnian Croat and other non-Serb populations.'' Brdjanin 
was arrested July 6 and is in the tribunal's custody. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men are charged with leading a campaign aimed at driving  
100,000 non-Serbs from the Prijedor and Sanski Most regions of 
northwest Bosnia. Tribunal prosecutors allege that Serb forces 
under the command of Talic and Brdjanin terrorized Muslims and 
Croats into fleeing those areas, and that those who didn't leave 
were driven out by force. Hundreds were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Talic, who was appointed military chief-of-staff in February  
1998, was a leading military commander during the Bosnian conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian authorities made the arrest this morning after being  
tipped off by the tribunal that Talic was attending a conference at 
the Austrian defense academy on how to merge Bosnian Serb forces 
and forces from the Muslim-Croat federation into a national army. 
</P>
<P>
	Talic's indictment had been kept secret to give authorities a  
chance to arrest him, the tribunal said. It said it would unseal 
the indictment and make details public later today or Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Talic was expected to be extradited to The Hague later today,  
Austrian Interior Minister Karl Schloegl said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Austrian National Defense Academy told the  
Austria Press Agency that Talic had flown to Vienna on Tuesday 
aboard a plane of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe and entered the country unhindered. The spokesman said that 
Talic had been picked by the OSCE for participation in the military 
seminar. 
</P>
<P>
	A high-ranking official in the Bosnian Serb parliament, Dragutin  
Ilic, denounced the arrest as ``completely immoral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have said many times we have nothing against public  
indictments -- they give people a chance to turn themselves in 
voluntarily to The Hague tribunal in order to prove their 
innocence,'' Ilic said. But, he added: ``The manner in which a 
high-ranking official was arrested today is completely immoral and 
inappropriate. It shames the host country, Austria, which invited 
him on an official visit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talic would be the highest-ranking Serb military official tried  
by the tribunal, spokesman Jim Landale said. If convicted, he would 
face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the greatest ethnic cleansings were committed in  
Bosnia directly under Talic's command,'' Amor Masovic, head of the 
Muslim Commission for Missing Persons, told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Masovic said his commission discovered the largest number of  
Bosnia's mass graves in Krajina in northwest Bosnia, an area 
controlled by Talic during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	The graves contained the remains of more than 1,500 Muslims.  
Another 188 bodies were found in a mass grave in one of Talic's 
wartime barracks in the village of Laniste, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Masovic said the area had some of the most infamous  
concentration camps commanded by the Bosnian Serb troops.

<HEADLINE> Rising Yen Spurs Growing Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A mighty yen seems less scary to Japan than it did  
just two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, a rising currency was seen as the biggest threat  
to the sluggish Japanese economy because of the toll it could take 
on exporters' earnings. Any surge in the yen sent financial 
authorities scrambling to rein it in. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the yen appreciated against the dollar this week to its  
highest level in seven months, officials have mostly just stood by. 
</P>
<P>
	What's changed? It's finally starting to look like the economy's  
really back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	Big investors are lining up to get into Japan's stock market.  
And the jump in demand for stocks has generated demand for yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa summed up the shift on  
a morning talk show Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japan's economy is getting better, leading to the purchase of  
Japanese stocks, and the yen is needed to buy stocks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the U.S. dollar rebounded somewhat today, winding up at  
111.32 yen in Tokyo from a low of 110.40 yen earlier in the day, 
the yen is still up more than 10 percent against the dollar over 
the last three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's economy emerged from its longest postwar recession in  
the first quarter of this year, shooting ahead a surprising 1.9 
percent after a year and a half in the doldrums. Many economists 
initially said the report overstated the strength of the economy, 
but more encouraging indicators since then have led the analysts to 
raise their forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are getting more positive surprises than negative ones and  
it's leading people to believe that this is a real recovery,'' said 
Kenneth Landon, senior currency strategist at Deutsche Bank in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors, it seems, were never worried. Their optimism has fed  
a powerful stock market rally, driving the Nikkei 225 Stock Average 
up 26.1 percent in the last six months. 
</P>
<P>
	But a surging yen still takes a bite out of exporters' profits,  
forcing them to either accept less when their overseas earnings are 
converted into yen. The higher yen also means their goods cost more 
in other countries, making it harder for them to be price 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony Corp., for example, reported last month that net profits  
dropped 55 percent in the April-to-June quarter mostly because of 
the yen's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	But exports account for only about 12 percent of the economy and  
economists say other industries are now improving too. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, the rising yen ``would have been devastating,  
but now we are just at the cusp of a big turn-up for the economy,'' 
Landon said. ``As long as the overall economy is strong, that will 
more than offset the negative impact of the strong yen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And while financial authorities say there has been no change in  
policy, their actions, or lack thereof, show they too are less 
concerned. After intervening aggressively in currency markets early 
this summer to contain the yen's advance, Japanese officials 
stepped aside in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, most analysts doubt the yen can rise much farther without  
provoking Japanese authorities into action. Economists estimate the 
point at which most exporters turn from profit to loss is probably 
around 107 yen to 110 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point someone is going to start screaming 'uncle' and  
politicians are going to get involved,'' said Ron Bevacqua, an 
economist with Commerz Securities.

<HEADLINE> Walking May Deter Heart Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Women can cut their risk of heart disease by more than a third  
with the right type of exercise -- and it doesn't have to be a big, 
sweaty workout, researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Either three hours of brisk walking per week or half that time  
spent working up a sweat at jogging, aerobic dance or other 
vigorous exercise reduced the risk of heart disease 35 percent to 
40 percent in a study of 72,488 women. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also suggests it's never too late to start: Women who  
were couch potatoes when the eight-year study began reduced their 
risk of heart trouble by about the same amount as those who were 
active from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many people, recommendations to do strenuous exercise may  
have served as a barrier to becoming physically active. These 
results are encouraging,'' said Dr. JoAnn Manson, a professor at 
Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston who 
oversaw the research, which was part of the long-running Nurses 
Health Study. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order to walk all you need is good pair of walking shoes.  
It's simple, convenient, safe and accessible. Almost anyone can do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study was published in today's New England Journal of  
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Most studies of exercise and the heart have looked at men; this  
analysis of questionnaires from women ages 40 to 65 is the first 
large study to look at women and walking, according to the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Strolling won't do it, no matter how long you walk, Manson said.  
You have to stride out at 3 mph or more, or 20 minutes or less per 
mile. 
</P>
<P>
	But three hours of brisk walking and 1 1/2 hours of vigorous  
exercise use the same amount of energy, and that's the key. Walking 
briskly for five hours a week cut the risk of heart attacks 50 
percent, Manson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even one to 2.9 hours of brisk walking a week brought a 30  
percent reduction in heart attacks and deaths from other coronary 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel it's a very important study that once again points out  
the value of moderate amounts of physical activity in maintaining 
heart health,'' said Dr. Teri Manolio of the National Heart, Blood 
and Lung Institute, which paid for the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Gerald Fletcher, a spokesman for the American Heart  
Association, said the study backs up the association's call for 
regular exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	People seem to think that ``exercise'' means ``go for it,''  
Fletcher said. ``Walking, particularly briskly, is just as good as 
a rough game of soccer or hiking mountains, or going to a health 
club and lifting weights.''

<HEADLINE> Fired Coach May Have Misused Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDINBURG, Texas (AP) -- Delray Brooks, fired after two seasons as  
basketball coach at Texas-Pan American, is the subject of a police 
investigation into possible misuse of university money. 
</P>
<P>
	The university's police department has been investigating  
possible fraud involving athletic funds for about two months and 
Brooks is part of the investigation, campus Police Chief Howard 
Miller said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks' firing and that of assistants George Morgan and Patrick  
Harrington was announced Tuesday by the school. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials found ``improprieties'' with men's basketball  
program funds and told police, Miller said. He declined to give 
details about the investigation except to describe it as ``white 
collar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't necessarily ... have a smoking gun,'' Miller said.  
``You can only depend on paper trails and things of that sort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Sharpe, the UT System's vice chancellor for academic affairs,  
confirmed the school found improprieties while reconciling 
accounts. He said officials then contacted auditors and the police. 
</P>
<P>
	Although school administrators fired the coaches after  
conducting their own investigation, Miller said he's holding off on 
drawing any conclusions until the investigation is complete and 
probably handed over to a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're being very objective,'' Miller said. ``We haven't  
concluded anything. We are continuing to do a very thorough and 
in-depth investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brooks investigation is only the latest scandal to plague  
the Broncs' basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	In July 1996, the school lost its NCAA certification over  
charges that two assistant men's basketball coaches improperly 
helped potential recruits with correspondence coursework. 
</P>
<P>
	The school received conditional certification in August 1997 and  
had its certification fully restored in May 1998. By then, the Sun 
Belt Conference had dropped the school, which remains independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks, who did not return a phone call from The Associated  
Press on Wednesday, played at Indiana and Providence, helping Rick 
Pitino's Friars reach the NCAA tournament Final Four in 1987. He 
enjoyed a fleeting pro career in the World Basketball League and 
Continental Basketball Association before joining Pitino's coaching 
staff at Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks was there five years and went to three more Final Fours,  
winning the national championship in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Pan Am hired Brooks in 1997 with hopes he would restore the  
basketball program to its glory days. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Sam Williams, the coach from 1958 through 1973, the Broncs  
won the 1963 NAIA championship. Lucious Jackson, the star of that 
team, won an Olympic gold medal in 1964 and played for the 
Philadelphia 76ers team that won the NBA title in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks was 8-46 in two seasons at Pan American.

<HEADLINE> FCC To Appeal Privacy Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A court ruling overturning federal protection  
of telephone customer records puts the interests of phone companies 
over the rights of consumers, a top federal regulator says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission plans to appeal the  
decision by the three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals, which could enable phone companies to use information 
about customers for marketing purposes without obtaining their 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said the court's decision to reject  
the commission's rules remove important protections to consumer 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a sad day when the First Amendment rights of  
telephone companies to solicit business outweighs the rights of 
consumers to protect their privacy,'' Kennard said in an interview 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Information such as calls made to a doctor or to a help-group --  
and the frequency of such calls -- could become fodder for marketers 
to target their goods, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When people make calls or pages, the companies providing them  
service end up with personal information including who, when and 
for how long the call lasted. They can also tell how much their 
customers spent for service. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC rules adopted in 1998 had required telecommunications  
companies to obtain permission -- either written, oral or electronic 
-- before using or sharing customers' records, calling patterns and 
other personal information to market new services to them. A 1996 
telecommunications law had mandated such approval without 
specifying how it had to be given. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 2-1 ruling published last week, the panel vacated the FCC  
restrictions, saying they wrongly interfered with the phone 
companies' First Amendment right to free speech. The court said the 
government failed to show any specific harm to customers from the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case is a harbinger of difficulties encountered in this  
age of exploding information, when rights bestowed by the United 
States Constitution must be guarded as vigilantly as in the days of 
handbills on public sidewalks,'' the ruling said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for customers' privacy, ``Although we may feel uncomfortable  
knowing that our personal information is circulating in the world, 
we live in an open society where information may pass freely,'' the 
ruling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard expressed concern that the ruling would give rise to an  
``opt out'' approach, with companies assuming they had permission 
to use customers' personal information unless customers told them 
they did not. Customers might then inadvertently forfeit their 
right to privacy by missing a notice from the company informing 
them of the policy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other FCC officials warned that the decision could open a wide  
door for releasing information, such as phone companies selling 
information about a customer's toll-free catalog shopping habits to 
a rival retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver-based U S West, which brought the case, said it does not  
intend to share customers' personal information with other 
companies -- only with its divisions. The company also says that the 
ruling might spare consumers some sales calls by letting companies 
target customer's perceived needs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kennard said he was not convinced that all companies would  
abide by the same standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them will find it just too tempting not to go ahead  
and sell this information to the highest bidder,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC plans to ask for a rehearing by the full 10th Circuit.  
</P>
<P>
	Privacy groups have also expressed concern that the decision  
could set a precedent for privacy protections in other areas, such 
as the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really does cast doubt on the government's ability to  
protect citizens' privacy,'' said John Morris, counsel at the 
Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington-based privacy 
advocacy group. The court's analysis ``may make it much more 
difficult to enact privacy legislation in other areas.''

<HEADLINE> Giants' DE Has Fun Playing Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- While many people are making a big deal out  
of the annual Giants-Jets preseason game for the so-called bragging 
rights of New York, two-time Pro Bowler Michael Strahan isn't. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants' defensive end just hopes to improve his game a  
little on Saturday night at Giants Stadium, and laugh a lot, 
especially at Jets receiver Wayne Chrebet. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are close friends, and this is one of those games where  
there is going to be some good-natured trash talking. There might 
even be a hit or two. 
</P>
<P>
	Strahan and Chrebet reminisced about last year's big hit in a  
telephone call they had Tuesday, Strahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrebet, who is 5-foot-10 and 185 pounds, tried to crack-block  
Strahan. Instead, the 6-5, 275 pounder threw him to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought you were my friend. I'm a little disappointed in  
you,'' Strahan said in recalling the conversion. ``He said his 
stomach hurt because I did that to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said my stomach hurt, too, 'cause I was laughing so hard  
when you went down like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The kidding doesn't stop on the telephone. Chrebet was quoted in  
one of the New York tabloids as saying he was going to be looking 
for Strahan to see if he got soft after his recent signing of a 
four-year, $32 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going after him to see if he's as soft as `Chrebet Crunch'  
after sitting in milk for a half-hour,'' Strahan said, referring to 
a cereal named after the Jets' receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Jets and Giants scheduled to play a regular-season game  
on Dec. 5, Strahan said neither team is going to show much in the 
preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what the regular-season game would be like if it was  
important to both teams, Strahan's eyes seemed to light up. After a 
couple of seconds, he made a sound that was a little like a short 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be the most trash talking I have ever heard on a  
football field in seven years,'' Strahan said. ``I would be lying 
if I didn't say I would be talking some of it myself. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be one of the best things for the city, for the  
organization and I know one of the best things for the players to 
have a meaningful game against the Jets in December. That's pretty 
much like a dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until that happens, this weekend's meeting will just be another  
Jets-Giants game, a learning experience for the players and a 
chance to make a big deal out of nothing for the fans and media. 
</P>
<P>
	For Chrebet and Strahan, it offers each a chance to yap back and  
forth after each play. 
</P>
<P>
	And it also offers them a chance to embarrass the other before  
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Strahan could not resist talking about Chrebet's golf game on  
Wednesday. The two played before training camp opened with David 
Bryan, the keyboard player for Bon Jovi. Strahan remembered one of 
Chrebet's shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were down at the Shore and we thought he hit the siding on  
the house,'' Strahan said. ``Then we walked over, this woman opened 
her door and handed him his ball back. He put it right through the 
kitchen window.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The story doesn't end there.  
</P>
<P>
	Strahan said Bryan telephoned Chrebet the next week.  
</P>
<P>
	``He had his wife yelling in the background like she was the  
woman, yelling: `You broke my window. I want my money.' It was 
funny. I tell you what: he is such a nice classy good guy, you 
can't help but love him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And when Chrebet comes near him Saturday?  
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to try to get one little shot in,'' Strahan said.

<HEADLINE> Candidate Faces Perjury Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- A former Republican gubernatorial  
candidate who won the primary last year with a lavish campaign 
funded largely by his wife has been charged with perjury and 22 
violations of campaign laws. 
</P>
<P>
	John Lindauer was accused of providing false information in  
campaign disclosure statements, soliciting illegal contributions 
and failing to report illegal campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindauer was accused of perjury -- the only felony charge among  
the 23 counts -- for claiming to have received an Alaska Permanent 
Fund dividend in 1997, a year in which he did not apply for a 
dividend. 
</P>
<P>
	Eligibility for the dividend carries strict residency  
requirements, and Lindauer's failure to apply in 1996 or 1997 was 
raised during last year's campaign as evidence that he had returned 
to Alaska from Chicago only to seek the governor's mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindauer's lawyer, Michael Rovell, said he had not seen the  
court documents as of Tuesday. But he called the perjury charge 
```beyond ridiculous'' and characterized the dividend statement as 
an innocent mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other charges, Rovell said, ``I don't know how  
constitutionally you can put limits on what spouses can do for each 
other. That's not what campaign finance laws are for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Taylor, who lost to Lindauer in the GOP primary,  
criticized the Alaska Public Offices Commission. It began 
investigating Lindauer during the campaign, but did not block his 
candidacy and instead referred the case to the attorney general in 
April for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole thing is just such a sad, sad commentary on the  
current state of politics in Alaska,'' Ms. Taylor said. ``Whoever 
can get the biggest pile of money goes out and buys the election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Lindauer could be jailed for 10 years for perjury,  
one year for each of 19 campaign finance violations, and six months 
for each of three counts of violating conflict of interest laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindauer spent more than $1.7 million, claiming at one point  
that he raised the money through consulting fees, real estate deals 
and selling art and his radio stations. His campaign fell apart 
after he admitted that nearly all the money came from his second 
wife, Dorothy Oremus, a Chicago attorney and heiress. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican Party of Alaska withdrew its support, and he  
received only 17 percent of the vote as incumbent Democrat Tony 
Knowles easily won a second term. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his loss Lindauer has put his Anchorage house on the  
market and Rovell said he is living in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Before announcing his run for governor in November 1997,  
Lindauer obtained a $700,000 loan guaranteed by Oremus and her 
brother, prosecutors said. Oremus guaranteed another $300,000 loan 
for him on Dec. 30, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska law considers such loans campaign contributions, and they  
violated the $500 limit on individual contributions as well as a 
limit on contributions from outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the loans, Lindauer received five direct payments  
totaling $527,498 from Oremus in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The state also accused Lindauer of disguising campaign  
contributions as consulting fees.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen Thursday morning,  
while Tokyo share prices rose slightly following another record 
close on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 111.06 yen at late morning, down 0.26 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
111.14 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 33.09  
points, or 0.19 percent, to 17,888.25 at the end of the morning 
session. On Wednesday, the average closed down 240.25 points, or 
1.33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar initially was slightly higher  
from its New York level after a rally in U.S. Treasury bonds and 
the robust showing Wednesday on Wall Street attracted investor 
interest in the greenback. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar edged lower as enthusiasm among overseas  
investment funds for Japanese stocks emerged, thus curbing the 
dollar's rise. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 115.86 yen, down  
from 116.84 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices posted slight gains on buying  
of some high technology issues, including Sony and Fujitsu. 
</P>
<P>
	High-tech issues led the market in early morning trading  
following strong gains by similar issues on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average  
finished at a record high 11,326.04 points, up 42.74, or 0.4 
percent. U.S. stocks shot up as investors expressed confidence that 
the American economy can continue to grow without high inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 0.92 points, or 0.06 percent, to 1,495.72. The 
TOPIX closed down 12.27 points, or 0.81 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.9550 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.9950 percent, 
driving its price up to 99.53 yen from 99.20 yen.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Fear Nuke Secrets Slipping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To shine light on America's secret past,  
government record keepers have worked the past three years to 
declassify 600 million pages of documents -- some as thin as onion 
skin, others yellow with age. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, because Washington fears that nuclear weapons information  
has slipped inadvertently from the government's attic, the 
bleary-eyed declassifiers might have to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation headed for approval in Congress would require all  
these documents to be re-examined to make sure they don't contain 
sensitive details about the U.S. nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I support efforts to release government information to the  
public, but in doing so we have to be careful not to continue to 
accidentally release sensitive nuclear weapons design data that 
countries like Iran and Iraq could use to advance their own nuclear 
weapons programs,'' said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Aftergood, who directs the Project on Government Secrecy  
at the Federation of American Scientists, said Congress is 
overreacting. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all part of the frenzy about Chinese espionage that is  
driving Washington crazy,'' Aftergood said. ``The idea that they're 
going to reread material that's already been declassified is 
preposterous. It will basically cripple the declassification 
program by driving it in circles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Present efforts to lift the veil of government secrecy are  
driven by an executive order President Clinton signed in 1995. The 
order instructs federal agencies to open by next April classified 
records that contain historical material and are more than 25 years 
old. Exceptions are narrowly defined. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past three years, more than 600 million pages have been  
declassified. 
</P>
<P>
	Subjects range from the Cold War to Vietnam, POWs to UFOs.  
Researchers are rewriting history with new information about the 
U.S.-Soviet arms race, the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, a 
1973 coup in Chile, covert action around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	The public already can access 400 million pages that have been  
unsealed. An additional 200 million pages are declassified, but are 
not yet on public shelves. Nearly 1 billion more pages still must 
be reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	Declassification was moving at a fast clip until last year when  
some lawmakers worried that nuclear secrets still classified under 
the Atomic Energy Act weren't being properly protected. Sens. Kyl; 
Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Intelligence 
Committee; and Bob Smith, I-N.H., wrote to National Security 
Adviser Sandy Berger saying that ``in a frenzied attempt'' to meet 
the April 2000 deadline, documents containing sensitive nuclear 
weapons information may have been released or were in danger of 
being released. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect prompted Congress to pass a law last year that  
required declassifiers to come up with a plan to scan documents, 
page-by-page, looking for nuclear material -- unless the records 
were ``highly unlikely'' to contain such information. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, after a government scientist suspected of giving  
nuclear secrets to China was fired in March for alleged security 
violations at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, 
lawmakers sought even tougher scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Buried in the defense authorization act for fiscal 2000 is a  
provision that would make last year's law retroactive. It would 
require record keepers to reinspect documents declassified since 
the executive order took effect about three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a recent 140-page study of improperly released nuclear  
weapons data, the administration detailed numerous examples of key 
design information that was not intended to be released, but, in 
fact, was released,'' Kyl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Already approved by a House-Senate conference committee,  
Congress is to vote on the bill after its summer recess. 
</P>
<P>
	National Security Council spokesman David Leavy would not  
disclose the administration's reaction to the provision, except to 
say: ``We have to be reasonable while balancing national security 
concerns.'' He also would not speculate on whether Clinton would 
sign the bill.

<HEADLINE> Court Orders Late-Term Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A judge has ordered state child welfare officials  
to take a 14-year-old girl who is 23 weeks pregnant out of the 
state for an abortion banned in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The abortion order was issued this month by Judge William  
Sargeant of Maricopa County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Sargeant told The Tribune, a newspaper serving suburban Phoenix,  
he wouldn't confirm the abortion order or discuss the girl's case. 
</P>
<P>
	The abortion must be performed outside Arizona because a new  
state law has essentially eliminated abortions in most cases after 
20 weeks of pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Gov. Jane Hull, Francie Noyes, said taking the  
teen out of state for the abortion is legal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court is acting in the role of the parents,'' Noyes told  
The Arizona Republic. ``The people that are working in the girl's 
best interests believe this is the best interests. The court agreed 
and did issue the order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teen, who has been in the state child welfare system since  
she was 5, became a ward of the court after repeatedly running away 
from foster parents and group homes, the Republic newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion opponents were incensed, contending the court-ordered  
action would violate state law barring use of state money for 
abortions unless needed to save the mother's life. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the Arizona Department of Economic Security,  
which oversees foster care, said federal law permits abortion in 
rape cases and statutory rape laws say any sexual activity for a 
14-year-old can be considered rape. 
</P>
<P>
	Sally Ordini, the DES spokeswoman, declined to comment on the  
specific case but said medical and transportation costs in such 
cases would be covered by federal Medicaid funds.

<HEADLINE> Eureka, Calif. Say No to Wal-Mart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUREKA, Calif. (AP) -- Many see the old polluted train yard as  
this fading timber town's final chance to stay true to its seaport 
roots and build a commercial port that could breathe life into its 
struggling economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart sees it as abandoned property ideal for a discount  
store. 
</P>
<P>
	The retail giant has spent tens of thousands of dollars on  
feel-good advertising and phone calls to sell its plan to 
residents, but the voters of Eureka this week said no. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the town's economy, built on timber and fishing  
industries, has stagnated in recent years, and Wal-Mart would bring 
much-needed jobs and tax revenue, the train yard remains the last 
undeveloped waterfront area that would let the city build a 
deep-water, commercial port, said Patty Berg, a Eureka resident who 
led the fight against Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what our community said is we can't be bought and we  
control our future,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a special election Tuesday, they voted 4,015 to 2,605 to  
reject Wal-Mart's plan to rezone the 32-acre plot. 
</P>
<P>
	The site has sat idle for nearly 20 years since Union Pacific  
Railroad shut down its engine turnaround area. The ground was badly 
polluted by an engine repair shop. Any buyer would be obligated to 
clean it up. The city can't afford to. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart spokeswoman Daphne Davis said the company will step  
back and evaluate its options. 
</P>
<P>
	It could ask the government to rezone the land -- the special  
election had bypassed the usual channels. The city planning 
commission would need to approve the change, then the City Council 
and finally the California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	After the vote, however, Davis spoke in the past tense.  
</P>
<P>
	``(The tract's) been sitting there for 20 years and it's in need  
of major cleanup and we were willing to do it. We were ready to get 
started right away. It would've been a good thing,'' she said. 
``We're obviously disappointed.''

<HEADLINE> Jones' Injured in 200 Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Marion Jones' bid for a sprint double  
ended in agony today when she pulled up with a back injury during 
the semifinals of the 200 meters at the World Champioships. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who won the 100 meters on Sunday, clutched her lower back  
about 50 meters from the finish and fell to the track. She was 
carried off on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The sprinter's husband, shot put champion C.J. Hunter, rushed  
down from the stands and walked beside the stretcher as it was 
wheeled to the medical station inside the stadium, where she was 
being attended to by two doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's her back,'' said Jones' agent, Charlie Wells.  
</P>
<P>
	Jones was trailing badly as the runners headed into the  
straight. Grimacing in pain, she slowed down, grasped her back and 
eased to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The American was the heavy favorite in the event in her bid for  
a 100-200 double. She was also due to run in one of the relays. Her 
bid for an unprecedented four gold medals evaporated Monday when 
she settled for the bronze in the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones has said she will attempt to win five gold medals at next  
year's Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice Greene, the men's 100 champion bidding for the sprint  
double, won his semifinal heat in the 200 in 20.10 seconds. He ran 
a controlled race, easing up slightly in the final five meters. 
</P>
<P>
	But the big surprise came in the second semifinal, where  
Nigeria's Francis Obikwelu clocked a sparkling 19.84 seconds, the 
fastest time in the world this year. Obikwelu held his head in 
disbelief when he saw the time on the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankie Fredericks of Namibia, the former 200 champion and one  
of the favorites, finished only fourth in his semifinal in 20.10 
seconds but still qualified for Friday's final. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 200, American Inger Miller -- silver medalist in  
the 100 -- comfortably won her semifinal in 22.17 seconds. With 
Jones out, she will now be the favorite for the 200 gold. 
</P>
<P>
	The other semifinal was won by Jamaica's Merlene Frazer in 22.18  
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Sweden's Ludmila Engquist, competing in between  
chemotherapy treatments for breast cancer, had the fastest time in 
the first-round heats of the women's 100-meter hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old Engquist, the defending world champion and 1996  
Olympic gold medalist, skimmed over the hurdles in 12.62 seconds 
and advanced to Thursday's quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a bit of a bad start and not good technique,'' Engquist  
said. ``But the time is OK. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very realistic. I will try, but I don't think I can win.  
I would like to be on the podium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was diagnosed with cancer in late March and had surgery to  
remove her right breast on her birthday, April 21. Since then, she 
has made a stunning and inspiring comeback. Her long-term goal is 
to repeat as Olympic champion next year. 
</P>
<P>
	She has continued to train through four chemotherapy sessions  
and has two more remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	The courageous Engquist returned to competition July 30 and ran  
a remarkable 12.68. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how I got this far. I have been training a lot,''  
Engquist said. ``Like my doctor said, `You must lead your normal 
life.' Normal life for me is to train and compete and I did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Gail Devers, the 1993 and 1995 champion, also zipped  
through her first-round heat, winning in 12.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomas Dvorak of the Czech Republic fell farther off his world  
record pace in the decathlon while holding his overall lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The defending champion and Olympic bronze medalist began the day  
64 points behind the record after the first five events and 36 
points in front of runner-up Dean Macey of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Dvorak opened the second five-event session by running the  
fastest time in the 110-meter hurdles, 13.75, and throwing the 
discus 151 feet, 9 inches, and clearing 15-1 in the pole vault. 
</P>
<P>
	That gave him a eight-event total of 7,172 points, 24 points  
ahead of American Chris Huffins, but 199 points off world record 
pace. After eight events during his record performance in July, 
Dvorak had 7,371 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more events -- the javelin and 1,500 meters -- remained in the  
grueling two-day decathlon competition in sweltering heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other finals were on the schedule tonight: men's triple  
jump and 110-meter hurdles, and women's shot put and 400 hurdles.

companies said today. Disney's Buena Vista internet group will own 
have an estimated 60 percent stake in the Waltham, Mass.-based 
toysmart.com. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but analysts 
said the deal includes $20 million in cash for toysmart.com and $25 
million worth of free marketing with Disney. The ads would appear

publishing unit that includes Women's Wear Daily, W and Jane 
magazines. The sale price was not disclosed Tuesday, but previous 
reports put the value of the deal at about $650 million. The 
companies said they expect the deal to close by the end of the 
year. With its earnings and stock price slumping, Disney has been

	Interest Rates Hikes: Two Is Enough?  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- By nudging up interest rates for the second  
time this summer, the Federal Reserve signaled that it may stay on 
the sidelines if there are no new signs of inflation or an 
overheated economy. But some economists wonder: Is the Fed through 
with just two? The answer lies with what new economic data tells 
central bankers about the pace of economic growth, which has been 
brisk, and the prospects for inflation down the road, economists 
said. Yesterday, the Fed boosted two rates by a quarter point, 
saying its actions ``should markedly diminish the risk of rising 
inflation going forward.''

225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 240.25 points, or 1.33 percent, 
to 17,855.16. In Hong Kong, shares fell as the U.S. interest rate 
increase stirred fears that Hong Kong banks will follow suit. The 
blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 1.1 percent, or 154.74 points, to 
13,479.13. In Bangkok, prices rallied on huge foreign speculative 
buying in banking stocks, which had fallen sharply lately, and on

blue-chips fell back slightly. The Dow Jones industrial average 
fell 16.46 to close at 11,283.30. The Fed's announcement of a 
quarter percentage point increase sparked a volatile afternoon on 
Wall Street, as the index jumped more than 65 points from Monday's 
record high close, then tumbled as much as 105.43 before regaining 
ground. Broader stock indicators ended higher. The Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 rose 3.28 to 1,363.50. The Nasdaq composite index,

test and evaluation, said he still stands by his recommendation for 
more testing before the Pentagon commits itself to a specific 
missile model in its $15 billion Theater High Altitude Area Defense 
program, or THAAD. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon announced last week that, with two successful tests  
under its belt after six failures, it was skipping a planned third 
test and moving to the next stage in development. 
</P>
<P>
	Coyle, the Pentagon's top testing official, was quoted in  
Defense Week, a trade publication, as listing shortcomings of the 
tests at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, in a memo released by the Pentagon, Coyle wrote  
that he didn't want his position to be misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
	``The THAAD tests to date at White Sands Missile Range have been  
conducted carefully and professionally,'' he wrote. ``These tests 
were important, necessary, and valuable, and were not 'cooked' or 
'rigged.' The test limitations were unavoidable given range safety 
considerations and the maturity of the THAAD program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	THAAD is the centerpiece of the Defense Department's effort to  
provide missile protection abroad for U.S. and allied troops and 
their staging areas. 
</P>
<P>
	With a range of 800 miles, it is expected to complement the  
shorter-range Patriot 3 missile, the latest version of the missile 
used against Iraqi Scud missiles in the 1991 Persian Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Penn State Says Offense Is Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Every Tuesday and Thursday night this  
summer on Penn State's outdoor practice turf, Drill 6 was serious 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	So serious that just about every player showed up for a  
voluntary passing drill they had skipped in summers past. So 
serious that players reported no-shows to Joe Paterno. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been here four years, and this is the best summer by  
far,'' said senior Derek Fox. ``We had some summers, we'd cancel 
it, say `We don't have enough guys, we don't have enough wideouts.' 
'' 
</P>
<P>
	That kind of intensity is to be expected the year after your  
offense scores all of 12 points in three losses to Top-25 teams, 
after you score a meager six passing touchdowns all season long -- 
and when your first opponent is No. 4 Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's Pigskin Classic, the No. 3 Nittany Lions find out  
whether all the work pays off against a team returning nine 
starters from a defense that was the Pac-10's best. 
</P>
<P>
	Paterno said his offense had a good training camp.  
</P>
<P>
	``But I think it remains to be seen how much they've improved,''  
he said. ``They're playing a team that takes away the run and dares 
you to pass the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All offseason, he's talked about how he wants his offense to be  
more aggressive. Not even his players are exactly sure what that 
means in the staid Penn State offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of things we could do,'' the coach said with a  
sidewise glance earlier this month. ``Maybe we'll throw on first 
down -- you never know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not likely. Neither should Arizona expect to see balls ``flying  
all over the field,'' a scenario flanker Chafie Fields sees in his 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	What Paterno is really looking for is a couple of tough,  
fight-for-the-ball receivers to go along with the Lions' typically 
fine stable of running backs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tailback Eric McCoo led the Lions with 822 yards last season  
after Cordell Mitchell hurt his shoulder. Both are back. Larry 
Johnson will give chase at tailback, Mike Cerimele is a solid 
fullback and experienced Aaron Harris will see plenty of carries if 
he can shake off injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	They will run behind an experienced -- if slightly shuffled --  
offensive line. John Blick, Eric Cole and Kareem McKenzie are the 
returning starters. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, all Penn State needs is even the threat of a passing game  
to keep defenses honest. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've done all summer is work against our defense to be  
more consistent, more consistent, and even more consistent,'' said 
quarterback Kevin Thompson. ``We worked on going out there and when 
one play is called, running it the right way every time, not 
running it five different ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He knows they will be tested by Arizona's defense, which uses  
some formations unfamiliar to Big Ten teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``They like to jump around a lot,'' he said. ``They like to move  
around and confuse the offense as much as possible. And they blitz 
a lot in certain situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If it takes a mature quarterback to handle that, Thompson thinks  
he's the one. He loyally logged his three years on the bench, then 
calmly took the abuse in his first year as starter. The radio 
callers were vicious, the e-mail even worse, and he got booed a lot 
-- once at a Penn State basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
	This season will be different, he promises.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've got 12 games under my belt,'' Thompson said. ``Last year,  
I was in different situations on every down. I'll know how to face 
different things, whether we're second-and-5, third-and-2 or 
first-and-15.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's also had all offseason to work with his receivers. Senior  
wideout Corey Jones, tight end Tony Stewart, junior college 
transfer Rod Perry and freshman Bryant Johnson worked out on campus 
this summer. Fields spent several weeks at school and more at a 
Boca Raton, Fla., speed camp with the likes of Desmond Howard. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to get better,'' Cole said. ``They're going to  
be more fluid together. That just comes with time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If not, Thompson knows the Penn State faithful would happily  
welcome his backup.	   The bookstore is already prepared: Alongside linebacker and 
co-captain Brandon Short's No. 43 jersey in the display cases hangs 
not Thompson's No. 16, but a No. 12 uniform -- that of backup 
Rashard Casey.

<HEADLINE> Okla. School Bus Crash Kills One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IDABEL, Okla. (AP) -- A bus carrying 22 children to school  
collided with a logging truck Wednesday, leaving a 13-year-old boy 
dead and 21 others injured in the rural logging country of 
Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus pulled into the path of the truck west of Idabel -- in  
far southeast Oklahoma -- during its morning pickups, said state 
Highway Patrol Lt. Stewart Meyer. The students ranged in age from 5 
to 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus headed to the Forest Grove School had almost made it  
across the highway when it was struck. It had pulled onto the road 
from a stop sign, Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He tried to miss him and hit the bus in the back end. If he  
hadn't tried to miss him, ain't no telling how many would've been 
killed,'' said James Westbrook, the brother of truck driver Gary 
Westbrook. 
</P>
<P>
	Westbrook wasn't seriously injured. School Superintendent Wes  
Watson, who was driving the bus, was also injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Killed was Johnny Valdez. None of the injuries was considered  
life threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, who usually drives the morning route, had completed half  
to three-quarters of his student pickups, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the crash, the bus lay on its side, its back right side  
crushed in and the rear suspension ripped away from the frame. A 
few streaks of blood were visible inside. The logging truck, with 
its load intact, sat in the middle of the road, its front end 
damaged and a portion of a fender a few yards away.

<HEADLINE> Disney Sorry for Radio Promotion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Walt Disney Co. has apologized for a  
promotion at one of its radio stations that distributed plastic 
gardening tools called ``Black Hoes'' as gag prizes to listeners 
and advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney issued the apology Tuesday after black groups in Los  
Angeles called for a boycott against the entertainment giant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The promotion could be viewed as offensive and derogatory,''  
Steven Bornstein, president of Disney's ABC division, said in a 
statement. ``We sincerely apologize to our employees and anyone 
else for any offense that has been taken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The promotion was run last year by Disney's KLOS-FM radio  
station and aired nationwide on its syndicated ``Mark &AMP; Brian'' 
show. A black employee at the station sued her employers, saying 
she was harassed by managers and co-workers after she complained 
about the promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	In the lawsuit, she complained that ``ho'' is a derogatory term  
for prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congress of Racial Equality said it would press on with a  
national boycott of Disney despite the apology. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is much too little and too late,'' said Sandra Moore, the  
group's vice chairwoman.

<HEADLINE> Van de Velde Wants New Caddie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- The caddie who refused to talk Jean Van de  
Velde out of hitting a 2-iron on the 72nd hole of the British Open 
-- a shot that ultimately led to a spectacular collapse -- is out of 
a job. 
</P>
<P>
	Van de Velde says he wants a more experienced caddie for  
important tournaments on the horizon, such as the Ryder Cup, and 
doesn't believe Christophe Angiolini fits the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is nothing to do with the Open,'' Van de Velde said.  
``That should not come into anyone's mind. I've got some tough 
weeks coming up, and I need a more experienced caddie. Christophe 
does not speak a word of English. 
</P>
<P>
	``Also, he does not know the courses in American and can't offer  
me the advice that someone who has caddied over here can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van de Velde is replacing him with Graham Heindrich of  
Australia, who has worked for Mark McNulty and Nick Faldo. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows the courses and will be able to tell me where to go  
and where not to go,'' Van de Velde said. 
</P>
<P>
	He might have even talked him out of a 2-iron with a  
three-stroke lead on the final hole at Carnoustie.

<HEADLINE> Fly Halts Calif. Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLTON, Calif. (AP) -- Some people in this Southern California  
community wish the problem would just buzz off: An endangered 
species of fly is holding up construction projects worth hundreds 
of millions. 
</P>
<P>
	Communities around the country have squared off against  
environmentalists over owls, foxes, fish and trees. But here, the 
fly has a number of foes: county officials, developers, bond 
holders and residents. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government has all but halted development across the  
sand dunes in the desert east of Los Angeles to protect the tiny 
Delhi Sands flower-loving fly -- the only fly ever to make the 
Endangered Species List. 
</P>
<P>
	``People feel like their community is being run by a fly. Where  
it can develop, when it can develop -- all dictated by a fly,'' said 
Ray Bragg, a development official in Fontana, one of several small 
cities whose plans have been thwarted by the orange-brown insect 
the size of a straight pin. 
</P>
<P>
	The flies' only known breeding grounds are the Delhi Sands dunes  
stretching from San Bernardino to Riverside to Ontario, about 60 
miles from Los Angeles. The fine dunes were created by Santa Ana 
winds carrying grit from the mountains and dropping it in the 
desert valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delhi Sands are the largest remaining sand dune system in  
the Los Angeles basin. But the few dunes that remain are surrounded 
by freeways and encroaching development. Most are privately owned. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the fly's habitat is disappearing, its numbers are down  
to just several thousand. In 1993 it was designated by the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service as an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time there's a listed species that's warm and fuzzy and  
endearing, it's easier for people to rally around it and work 
together toward a common goal. But this is about more than just 
God's creatures great and small,'' said Jeff Newman of the Fish and 
Wildlife Service. ``This is a unique system with unique species.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the El Segundo fly, which disappeared when its breeding  
grounds were paved over for a tarmac at the Los Angeles 
International Airport. For now, the Fish and Wildlife Service is 
trying to determine how many Delhi Sands flies there are and how 
best to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
	In Fontana, hopes for a $500 million project of single-family  
homes, shopping centers and strip malls have been dashed. Rancho 
Cucamonga, Ontario, Rialto and Hemet have had to delay housing 
projects, critical in a region absorbing residential overflow from 
Los Angeles. Colton had hoped to build a manufacturing plant. 
</P>
<P>
	About $42 million in bonds will go into default in October  
because Fontana owners unable to develop their land are unable to 
pay taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Colton has $11 million in debt tied up in an idle electrical  
substation that was built to supply power to the proposed 
commercial developments. And the town is in danger of losing $300 
million to $500 million in commercial projects because developers 
are looking elsewhere, town manager Henry Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in 1995, the discovery of eight flies near the Arrowhead  
Regional Medical Center in Colton cost San Bernardino County $4 
million to move the then-proposed hospital several hundred feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The government and the communities that want to build are trying  
to agree on property that could be designated a protected habitat. 
The cities and county have proposed several sites, including 280 
acres in Colton. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildlife officials said the process could take up to two years.  
But county and city officials are desperate to complete it by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want 20 years from now for my children to ask me where  
all the animals and insects went,'' Garcia said. ``But I don't want 
to have to tell the residents that their city lost millions because 
of a fly. There has to be a middle ground.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Commends Russian Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States commended Russian  
peacekeeping forces Wednesday for their attempts to enter a town in 
Kosovo blockaded by ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that they are taking a very measured and  
professional approach to the problem and are determined to resolve 
the situation by negotiation,'' said State Department deputy 
spokesman James B. Foley. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the deeply divided town of Orahovac, appeals from the  
United States and others failed to persuade ethnic Albanians to 
abandon their makeshift roadblocks and allow Russian peacekeepers 
to enter the town. 
</P>
<P>
	``The standoff continues,'' Foley said.  
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``we are confident that at the end of the day the  
Russian troops will be able to fulfill their mandate and that they 
will perform professionally and even-handedly, as they have 
elsewhere.''

	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- World chess champion Anatoly Karpov has filed a  
breach of contract suit against an international chess federation, 
seeking more than $1 million in compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Karpov, angry over the championship tournament now under way at  
Caesars Palace hotel-casino, filed his petition on Aug. 19 in the 
Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland, his 
spokesman Shiloh Quinn said.

	Quinn said reigning champion Karpov was not given a fair  
opportunity to defend his championship. 
</P>
<P>
	He said officials from Federation Internationale de Echecs never  
consulted with Karpov about the dates of the tournament and his 
role in the event. The suit asks that the court require the winner 
of the tournament to play Karpov in a championship match. 
</P>
<P>
	Karpov won the world title in January 1998 for a period that he

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies Await Word From Francis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Stu Jackson doesn't know what  
announcement brooding draft pick Steve Francis has to make on 
Friday, nor does the Vancouver Grizzlies general manager really 
care. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to wait, but I'm not going to wait with baited  
breath,'' Jackson said Wednesday. ``I don't know what he's going to 
announce. But I'll tell you this, any announcement that he has 
isn't going to lever us one way or the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to do what's in the best interest of our club when  
we feel we have to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation of Francis' uncertain future with the Grizzlies took  
another turn this week when the New York-based Edelman Public 
Relations firm said Francis scheduled a press conference for noon 
Friday in his hometown of Takoma Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Edelman representative Peter Land would only say that the  
subject of the press conference was ``basketball-related.'' Francis 
and his agent, Jeff Fried, have been unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis, selected second in the NBA draft, has made clear his  
reservations about playing for the Grizzlies. On draft night, 
Francis made no attempt to hide his displeasure at being picked by 
Vancouver. He later explained his initial reluctance was because he 
didn't want to move so far away from his home and his grandmother 
who has raised him since the death of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson acknowledged that there were personal issues raised by  
Francis during contract talks. And, Jackson admitted that he has 
made numerous attempts to deal Francis to another team. 
</P>
<P>
	Failing a trade, however, Jackson doesn't know what else he can  
do to convince Francis to play for the Grizzlies this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he would allow Francis to sit out the year and re-enter  
the draft, Jackson said, ``That's an option of ours. ... I can't 
say that I would do that. I just don't know. We're not at that 
point right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the rookie salary cap, Francis is due a three-year  
contract worth about $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have done everything we possibly can,'' Jackson said.  
``It's not just myself, it's the entire organization that has bent 
over backwards to try to address every issue that Steve has. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we're trying to do is hand him over $9 million and make  
him a very well-known basketball player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although not at the point of exasperation, Jackson said he never  
expected to have this much trouble signing the player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone could expect the amount of issues that  
we've dealt with here internally at this point,'' he said. ``I just 
don't think anybody could have expected that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis is the only one of the top six draft choices not to sign  
a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Pernell, director of the Takoma Park Recreation Center and  
friend of Francis, said he was ``in the dark'' about what Francis 
was going to announce Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pernell added that Francis has been working out daily and intent  
on playing in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve's a ballplayer and he wants to play ball,'' Pernell  
said. ``As for his feelings, as far as I'm aware, he doesn't mind 
playing in Canada. ... He's focused on getting his mind ready to be 
that far away from home.''

<HEADLINE> Dye May Not Have Full Use of Arm </HEADLINE>

	FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) -- Arizona Cardinals offensive guard Ernest  
Dye has regained some nerve function in his right arm that was 
mangled in a rollover accident, doctors said today. 
</P>
<P>
	However, physicians were unsure whether Dye will ever regain  
full use of his arm because of the extreme nature of the injury, 
which likely has ended his NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye's arm was nearly severed in the Aug. 16 crash about 25 miles  
south of Flagstaff, where the Cardinals hold training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	A teammate was driving Dye's luxury car during a rainstorm as  
they returned to camp and it veered off an interstate. Dye was 
thrown from the vehicle with his right arm pinned under it. 
</P>
<P>
	He underwent a nine-hour operation immediately after the  
accident to repair a bone in his arm and restore blood flow. 
</P>
<P>
	In a seven-hour operation Sunday at Flagstaff Medical Center,  
vascular surgeon Jerry Mohr and orthopedic surgeon Philip Mack 
performed a second surgery on Dye to repair the median and ulnar 
nerves, which control hand and lower-arm function. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to do that, the doctors had to graft nerves in Dye's  
lower legs to the damaged nerves in his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	By doing so, the doctors were able to build a bridge between the  
severed nerves and restore some degree of function in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to be hopeful that he will have more function (in  
the arm) in the future,'' said Mohr, adding that Dye will not have 
feeling in his arm for several months. ``The arm is viable. Time 
will be the test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mohr said that there was blood and air found in Dye's chest  
cavity as a result of a complication from the second surgery. The 
seriousness of that is not known. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors added that Dye continues to improve daily in terms of  
his overall health. 
</P>
<P>
	But they say the most important part of his recovery will center  
around tending to the broken arm and the wound he suffered in the 
Aug. 23 crash about 25 miles south of Flagstaff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very contaminated wound that was cleaned out  
vigorously,'' said Mohr of the condition of Dye's arm following the 
accident. ``Antibiotics and time along with dressing changes (will 
be critical).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dye will remain at Flagstaff Medical Center for up to two more  
weeks so that his injury can continue to be supervised by the 
medical team.

<HEADLINE> Rides Closed at Amusement Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- With the busy Labor Day weekend approaching,  
Paramount has closed seven rides at its five amusement parks 
because of concerns about fatal accidents this week on two of the 
rides. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won't reopen them unless we're confident they can be safely  
operated,'' spokeswoman Susan Lomax of Paramount Parks, operator of 
the five parks, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The closings are in response to an accident Sunday that killed a  
12-year-old boy on the Drop Zone, a free-fall ride, at Paramount's 
Great America park in Santa Clara, Calif., and a standup roller 
coaster accident Monday at Paramount's Kings Dominion park near 
Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The rides will remain closed indefinitely until Paramount Parks  
officials get full reports on how the accidents occurred, Ms. Lomax 
said Wednesday from the company's headquarters in Charlotte, N.C. 
She said she had no idea how long that will take. 
</P>
<P>
	The other closed rides are the Drop Zone free-fall rides at  
Paramount's Carowinds in Charlotte, N.C., Paramount's Kings Island 
near Cincinnati and Paramount Canada's Wonderland in Toronto. The 
closed standup roller coasters are King Cobra at Kings Island and 
Skyrider at Paramount Canada's Wonderland. 
</P>
<P>
	Ensuring safety on amusement park rides is difficult, though,  
because inspection procedures aren't standardized for rides and 
there are no reliable statistics for ride accidents that result in 
injuries or deaths, said Richard McClary of Memphis, Tenn., a 
former federal workplace safety inspector who now is a safety 
consultant to amusement park operators. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, McCLary said Wednesday, some states have no ride  
inspection programs, other states have good inspection programs and 
some states have none. 
</P>
<P>
	``The accidents are happening in the states that have very good  
inspection programs, as well as those that have no inspection 
programs,'' said McClary, executive director of the Memphis Area 
Safety Council. 
</P>
<P>
	McClary and other ride safety consultants are trying to get  
amusement industry officials to standardize inspection and accident 
reporting procedures. He said the federal Consumer Product Safety 
Commission investigates ride accidents, but only after fatalities 
or multiple injuries have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Many injuries go unreported because victims are treated at  
first-aid stations on site and then go to private doctors, McClary 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's really no concrete, hard evidence on what the problem  
is, and this is a big problem. There's no central reporting 
agency,'' McClary said. 
</P>
<P>
	Park operators are reviewing their safety procedures to avoid  
further accidents, said Paul Ruben, North American editor for Park 
World, a British-published magazine that covers the outdoor 
amusement industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Park employees, insurers and state inspectors need to determine  
what caused the accidents and what preventive steps can be taken, 
Ruben said from his office in Penfield, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until those steps are taken, that's the reason you're seeing  
similar rides closed in other parks,'' Ruben said. ``Sometimes, 
it's just rider horseplay, and you can't do anything to stop people 
from misbehaving themselves.''

<HEADLINE> Sosa Hits 52nd Homer, Leads McGwire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa hit his 52nd homer Wednesday night,  
breaking a tie with Mark McGwire for the major league lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa sent a 2-1 pitch from San Francisco's Kirk Rueter high and  
far over the left-field fence in the sixth inning of the second 
game of a doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	Giants left fielder Barry Bonds, who had three homers in the  
doubleheader, hardly moved. He just turned his head and watched the 
flight of the ball as it went through an 8 mph wind and landed on 
Waveland Ave., an estimated 480 feet from the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's 52nd homer came in the Cubs' 125th game and kept him well  
ahead of his pace last year. Sosa hit his 52nd in Chicago's 133rd 
game last season and finished with 66, four short of McGwire's 
record.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 10-ton, 40-foot abstract sculpture made of  
steel construction beams painted industrial orange went up 
Wednesday on the Mall between the Capitol and the Washington 
Monument. 
</P>
<P>
	The sculpture consists of two beams that were welded together in  
the shape of a V and suspended to swivel in the breeze.

1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Di Suvero's style dates back to ``constructivists'' in the early  
years of the Soviet revolution, who were impressed by both Pablo 
Picasso and the stark strength of modern building materials.

<HEADLINE> Study To Compare Two Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Doctors looking for the best way to prevent  
a stroke in people who recently suffered a minor one due to a 
clogged neck artery are starting a large study comparing a highly 
effective operation with a new, less invasive method. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey Medical School in Newark, part of the University of  
Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, will run the five-year 
international study, funded by a $22.3 million grant from the 
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the biggest grant the university has ever received, and one  
of the bigger projects ever undertaken by the institute, one of the 
National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many strokes, there is a significant amount of recovery  
after two to three months (but patients) do have a very significant 
increased risk of another stroke, and second strokes can be more 
severe,'' said Dr. John R. Marler, the institute's associate 
director for clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
	``So it certainly is worthwhile in the hundreds of thousands of  
patients who have a stroke with good recovery to do everything 
possible to prevent another stroke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The institute notes that older people have a higher risk of  
stroke than the general population, and that risk increases with 
age. For every decade after 55, the risk of stroke doubles. 
Two-thirds of all strokes occur in people over 65. 
</P>
<P>
	During a stroke, brain tissue dies from lack of oxygen when  
blood flow to the brain is insufficient -- due to a clot blocking a 
blood vessel or a vessel bursting. Some scientists call strokes 
``brain attacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on the amount and location of brain tissue killed, a  
stroke can cause permanent paralysis on one side, vision and 
hearing problems, difficulty speaking or thinking, and other 
symptoms. Each year, strokes kill about 150,000 Americans and 
disable half of the other 500,000 people who suffer one. Stroke is 
the most common cause of adult disability. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``ministroke'' can cause similar symptoms and disrupt brain  
function temporarily, but patients are usually virtually normal 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most common causes of stroke is plaque in the neck  
artery,'' where fatty deposits tend to build up in the turbulent 
area where the artery splits into two branches, said the study's 
principal investigator, Dr. Robert W. Hobson II, director of the 
New Jersey medical school's division of vascular surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Hobson said the study will include about 2,500 patients aged 40  
or older who, within the previous six months, suffered a ministroke 
associated with plaque deposits narrowing the carotid, or neck, 
arteries. Those arteries feed oxygenated blood to the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the patients will undergo the ``gold standard'' surgery for  
preventing another stroke: carotid endarterectomy. A surgeon cuts 
into the neck, clamps off the artery around the plaque, then 
scrapes out the fat with tiny surgical spatulas and stitches the 
artery and neck incision shut. 
</P>
<P>
	The other patients will get a recently developed procedure  
called carotid angioplasty with stenting. A special catheter with a 
balloon is threaded from the groin up into the neck and, with 
guidance from X-rays, pushed into the clogged section. The balloon 
is inflated, flattening the plaque; after the balloon is removed, 
another catheter carrying a small, metal tube called a stent is 
pushed into that spot to keep the artery open. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of patients are asking for the less invasive procedure  
because they don't want the anesthesia, they don't want an incision 
in their neck,'' required for endarterectomy, Hobson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The older operation is considered extremely safe and effective  
and patients often recover in a day. An earlier study by the 
institute found endarterectomy cut the risk of having a second 
stroke or dying within a year to 9 percent, from the 27 percent for 
patients who received ``best medical care'' for the condition, 
Hobson said. 
</P>
<P>
	A selection committee at the medical school will pick 50 to 60  
sites around the country and will eventually add some sites in 
Canada and Europe. Patient recruitment is expected to begin by 
spring, Hobson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The benefit (of this trial) may well be a better  
recommendation to the individual patient as to how their plaque 
should best be treated,'' with endarterectomy or angioplasty, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marler said that if the newer procedure proves more effective  
than endarterectomy, ``It could certainly prevent thousands, 
perhaps tens of thousands of strokes per year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted the study is one of a half-dozen funded by the  
institute investigating ways to prevent both second strokes and 
initial ones. They include trials giving people special vitamin 
supplements, comparing use of aspirin with the blood-thinner 
Coumadin, giving women estrogen supplements to prevent second 
strokes and one comparing aspirin's effect on African-Americans 
with that of another blood-thinner called ticlopidine found to be 
especially effective for that group.

<HEADLINE> Hatch Apologizes for Comparisons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Sen. Orrin Hatch said Wednesday he had  
been ``inarticulate'' and apologized to NAACP officials for a 
statement in which he contrasted homosexual rights and black 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah Republican and GOP presidential candidate was widely  
criticized earlier this month for saying, ``People of color can't 
do anything about their color.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch then continued: ``I do believe gay people have a choice to  
live within the legal rules or not. That's why we have civil-rights 
laws to protect African-Americans from discrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeanetta Williams, president of the Salt Lake branch of the  
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, called 
Hatch's remark ``a poor articulation of what he was trying to 
say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heather Barney, a Hatch spokeswoman, said Hatch ``apologized for  
being inarticulate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He did note that he was coming from a strictly legal  
perspective, that there is judicial precedent that the courts have 
treated race as distinct from sexual orientation, which is the 
point he was making,'' Barney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Darin Hobbs of the Gay and Lesbian Political Action Committee in  
Salt Lake City said Hatch did the right thing by apologizing to the 
NAACP. He said Hatch also should apologize to Utah's gay community. 
</P>
<P>
	``The senator is unable to recognize the commonalities between  
homophobia and racism,'' Hobbs said. ``Both are bigotries rooted in 
fear and ignorance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and Edward J. Lewis, president of the NAACP tri-state  
conference for Utah, Nevada and Idaho, said they felt Hatch's 
apology was sincere after meeting with him for 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and Lewis said Hatch and his wife, Elaine, are lifelong  
NAACP members. Hatch co-sponsored a bill to award civil-rights 
pioneer Rosa Parks the Congressional Gold Medal, which is Congress' 
highest honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Barney said Hatch has enjoyed a good relationship with the  
NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
	``His door has always been open to Jeanetta and the NAACP,'' she  
said. ``They meet regularly and he is proud of some of the things 
he has been able to accomplish which benefit minority communities 
in Utah.''

<HEADLINE> Four Jailed in Soccer Blackout Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Four men were jailed Wednesday for plotting to  
cause a blackout during a Premier League soccer game as part of a 
betting scheme devised by gambling syndicates in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were convicted of conspiracy to cause public nuisance by  
attempting to knock out floodlights during a match between Charlton 
Athletic and Liverpool at the Valley stadium in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysians Chee Kew Ong and Eng Hwa Lim were each sentenced to  
four years at Middlesex Crown Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Firth, a security guard at Charlton's field, was sentenced  
to 18 months after he admitted accepting a bribe to let the men 
into the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Wai Yuen Liu who was born in Hong Kong but lives in London, was  
sentenced to 30 months. He was the only one to plead innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	When Liu, Ong and Lim were arrested Feb. 10 at the Valley  
stadium, they were in possession of an electrical device designed 
to make the floodlights fail during the match scheduled for Feb. 
13. 
</P>
<P>
	Ong had boasted that the group caused blackouts which forced two  
Premier League games to be cut short in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The men wanted to black out the games while the score was in  
their favor. A man sitting in the stands was able to trigger a 
short circuit using a simple remote control device and the cuts had 
to be cut short. 
</P>
<P>
	The first match was at Upton Park in November 1997 where West  
Ham hosted Crystal Palace. The lights went out 20 minutes into the 
second half just after West Ham had drawn level. 
</P>
<P>
	The second was a month later at Selhurst Park where Wimbledon  
played at home to Arsenal and again the lights went out shortly 
after half time when the scores were tied. 
</P>
<P>
	Betting syndicates stood to make a lot of money if a game was  
cut short when scores were favorable.

<HEADLINE> Profits Fall at Swissair Parent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Swissair parent SAirGroup said  
Wednesday its net profit for the first half of this year fell 31.5 
percent as competition kept fares low and the war in Kosovo 
affected flight schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which also owns the regional airline Crossair, said  
it earned the equivalent of $58 million, down from from $84.7 
million in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, chief executive Philippe Bruggisser said 1999 as  
a whole will be difficult and that SAir won't be able to match its 
full-year results for last year, when it posted a net profit of 
$247 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Downward pressure on fares and restrictions and delays resulting  
from the Kosovo conflict were among the factors behind the profit 
drop, SAirGroup said. 
</P>
<P>
	It estimated that delays resulting from European airspace  
restrictions cost the group's airline operations between 
$3.3million and $4 million per month so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's cargo division also had a difficult first half,  
``facing both substantial yield declines and a steep falloff in 
traffic from the United States and on Europe-to-Asia routes.''

<HEADLINE> Mir's Demise Caps Soviet Space Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Alexander Sperin left his father's birthday party  
early to help monitor the blastoff of the Soviets' biggest space 
station, just before midnight Moscow time on Feb. 19, 1986. They 
called it Mir, or ``peace,'' in a bit of Cold War irony. 
</P>
<P>
	Some dubbed it the beginning of a city in space. But Sperin, now  
a deputy flight controller at Russian Mission Control, remembers 
wondering: Can this thing really last three years in orbit, as its 
designers claim? 
</P>
<P>
	It could, and then some. On Saturday, after 13 1/2 years, more than  
77,000 loops around the Earth and 1,600 breakdowns, the Mir is 
scheduled to bid farewell to its final full-time crew. 
</P>
<P>
	It will then embark on a sad trajectory, a gradual descent that  
will see much of it sizzle in the Earth's atmosphere and the rest -- 
ideally -- splash into the Pacific Ocean early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The sad thing isn't the end of the Mir itself. With age it's  
become a 130-ton junk heap, a few salvageable scientific 
experiments lodged in a mass of corroding aluminum and outdated 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The sense of loss, for Russians, is that this lemon of a space  
station is the last major brainchild of the Soviet space program, 
and its demise caps decades of often unrivaled cosmic navigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Humbled by the collapse of their economy, military and global  
clout, Russians have clung to the Mir, blemishes and all. They're 
terrified of seeing their space accomplishments fade into history, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	After Mir, Russia will concentrate its scarce space funds on the  
international space station, which is borrowing much from Mir's 
experience but is unquestionably under U.S. command -- and is 
already far behind schedule because of financing delays on the 
Russian-made modules. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians also hope to capitalize on their skill in making  
reliable, inexpensive rockets to send up foreign commercial 
satellites to sustain their space industry. 
</P>
<P>
	But nothing can replace Mir.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we will devote ourselves as much to other  
projects, from the financial or the emotional point of view,'' 
Sperin said. 
</P>
<P>
	James Oberg, a Houston-based independent consultant and author  
of books on the Russian space program, agreed: ``They poured the 
Russian soul into the Mir, that capacity for incredible suffering 
and endurance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mir lifted off from one of space travel's holiest grounds:  
the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakstan, then a Soviet republic. 
</P>
<P>
	From Baikonur the Soviets sent up the world's first satellite,  
the first man in space, the first woman in space. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mir was born just three weeks after the U.S. shuttle  
Challenger exploded, killing all seven passengers. The Mir's first 
cosmonauts carried pictures of the Challenger crew into orbit 
because they ``wanted those seven brave astronauts to go to outer 
space.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later that year, Jane's Spaceflight Directory wrote that the  
Soviet Union had taken an ``almost frightening'' 10-year lead over 
the United States in the space race. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mir was indeed untouchable for its first few years. Then the  
country that conceived it started to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortages plagued the Soviet economy, and many citizens  
questioned generous space funding. 
</P>
<P>
	The station showed signs of wear. Insulation was peeling off in  
chunks. Electrical systems were spotty and its computers were 
capricious. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve days before cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev was to come home  
from a four-month stint on Mir, Soviet hard-liners staged an 
unsuccessful coup in August 1991 that precipitated the union's 
collapse. Krikalev was left in orbit an extra six months amid the 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	When he returned in March 1992, his country no longer existed.  
His hometown of Leningrad had become St. Petersburg. His 
once-enviable salary left him below the poverty line. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were those who said I should have stayed on the Mir,  
things were better up there,'' said Krikalev, who was the first 
Russian to fly on a NASA shuttle and is to be on the first crew of 
the international station. 
</P>
<P>
	Like just about every Russian, Krikalev is sad to see the Mir  
go. 
</P>
<P>
	``It represents a lot for us. But we must start a new era,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Mir's ailments, no other space program has come  
close to matching its duration, and its crews' experience with 
long-term effects of weightlessness has been crucial in preparing 
the international station. 
</P>
<P>
	Endurance has been the Mir's main -- some say its only -- major  
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	Though it has been a laboratory for hundreds of scientific  
experiments, they have failed to bring the Russian people much 
benefit. U.S. missions have been much more efficient at translating 
space research to commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
	Russians who work with the Mir smile sardonically when asked  
about its name, which Soviet officials said emphasized the peaceful 
nature of their space program. In fact, Russian and foreign 
observers now say the Soviets hoped -- and the Americans feared -- 
the Mir would have significant military uses. 
</P>
<P>
	But Oberg said that after some initial developments, such as  
advanced sensors and ground observation, those plans largely 
fizzled. 
</P>
<P>
	Politics, combined with the humiliating failure of other recent  
Russian space projects, helped keep the Mir aloft. No Russian 
leader wanted to be associated with the end of the Mir. 
</P>
<P>
	The momentum for bringing it down mounted in 1997, a year that  
saw a fire rage on the Mir in February and a near-fatal collision 
with a cargo ship in June that punctured the station -- the 
worst-ever space wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	Since NASA completed a program that put seven astronauts aboard  
the Mir, the United States has been pressing Russia to abandon it 
in favor of the international station. 
</P>
<P>
	The new station's first two pieces are in orbit and a crucial  
Russian-built segment that will house the crew is scheduled for 
liftoff in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Mir specialists -- who earn about 5,000 rubles a month, or  
$200 -- will move to a backup control room for the international 
station. Others will be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the Mir isn't dead yet. And some Russian space officials are  
still hoping for a new injection of cash to send another crew. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sperin, a 30-year veteran of the space program, warns that  
once the Mir starts lowering its orbit toward the Earth after the 
current crew leaves, it would be fruitless and possibly dangerous 
to try to reverse the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to say goodbye.''

<HEADLINE> Disney Buys Into Online Toy Retailer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. has bought a majority  
interest in toysmart.com, an online educational toy seller, the 
companies said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney's Buena Vista internet group will own an estimated 60  
percent stake in the Waltham, Mass.-based toysmart.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but analysts said the deal  
includes $20 million in cash for toysmart.com and $25 million worth 
of free marketing with Disney. The ads would appear on the Go 
Network, which includes ESPN.com and ABCNews.com and on other 
outlets, such as the Disney Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Toysmart.com and BVIG believe that high-quality, educational  
toys represent and exciting business opportunity in a fast-growing 
market segment,'' said Chuck Davis, president of electronic 
commerce for the Buena Vista Internet Group. ``Our investment in 
toysmart.com strengthens our commitment to serving the online 
commerce needs of families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disney will integrate privately-held toysmart.com with its own  
Family.com Web site, which attracts the kind of parents that the 
toy seller targets, Davis said. Family.com, which has articles and 
advice on parenthood and draws about 3 million visitors a month, 
will recommend toysmart.com merchandise in its editorial areas, 
Davis said. Toysmart will use Family.com's editorial content on its 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney will control three of the company's five board seats, but  
the companies said toysmart.com would retain control over the site, 
including decisions on which toys will be offered to consumers. 
Analysts said that plan should improve the site's chances for 
success since Disney could take away from toysmart.com's value if 
it promoted its own toys, which are not all educational. 
</P>
<P>
	Educational toys -- which the online toy company defines as  
products that are developmental, high-quality, fun and spark 
creativity -- make up about 38 percent of the $23 billion toy 
market, according to David Lord, toysmart.com's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospects for online sales of educational toys are  
promising, analysts said, because the toys are highly profitable 
with margins of about 40 percent versus 20 percent to 30 percent 
for mass-market toys sold online. Educational toys appeal to 
educated, wealthy parents who have access to computers and are 
willing to pay more for expensive toys. 
</P>
<P>
	The market for the kind of educational toys toysmart.com sells  
is worth between $5 billion and $8 billion, said Ken Cassar, an 
analyst with Jupiter Communications in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Toysmart launched in January under the leadership of Lord,  
former chief executive of Holt Educational Outlets. The company 
began its first ad campaign last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Toysmart currently sells about 20,000 items, though Lord said he  
wants to offer 75,000 products by November. The company plans to 
broaden its inventory to include children's furniture and baby 
products, Lord said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said Disney will not compete directly with Santa  
Monica-based eToys, which has an inventory of more than 100,000 
items. Disney also decided not to seek a partnership with eToys, 
which is headed by Disney's former vice president of strategic 
planning, Toby Lenk.

<HEADLINE> Guns To Be Linked to Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) --More than 2,900 guns turned over to police  
during a buyback program in the nation's capital will be traced and 
test-fired to find out whether they were involved in crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Using ballistics tests, ``we'll know if it's a crime gun right  
away,'' Special Agent Patrick Hynes of the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms said Wednesday. Gun barrels leave unique 
markings on bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	Police paid $100 each for the guns. A random sampling of 10 guns  
showed one was stolen from a Prince George's County, Md., home, 
Hynes said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Maryland man turned in more than 40 guns. ATF may be able to  
tell whether he was selling guns illegally or simply collecting 
them, Hynes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we trace all 40 firearms and they come back to the same  
store, that would be suspicious,'' he said. ``It might be 
indicative of straw purchasing,'' which he described as illegal 
firearms trafficking. ``It's definitely something we would look 
at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People who turned in weapons were given amnesty from the city's  
handgun ban, but they could be prosecuted for violating other laws, 
Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program has come under criticism from some officers who say  
that violent criminals weren't among those turning in guns and that 
Maryland and Virginia residents shouldn't have been allowed to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think our responsibility is greater than the borders of the  
District of Columbia,'' Gainer said, noting that several 
assault-style weapons and sawed-off shotguns were among the guns 
collected. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Anthony Williams said he would seek additional money for  
the program, which was funded by assets confiscated from drug 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a victory,'' said Williams. ``But it's not time for a  
victory lap yet.''

<HEADLINE> Screenwriter Wexler Dies at 73 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Screenwriter and playwright Norman Wexler,  
whose work included ``Saturday Night Fever'' and ``Serpico,'' has 
died at 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Wexler died after suffering a heart attack at his home here. He  
died Monday, according to the membership office of the Writers 
Guild of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harvard College graduate wrote movies and plays that exposed  
life's grit. In 1970, he earned his first Oscar nomination for the 
movie ``Joe,'' starring Susan Sarandon and Peter Boyle, about a 
racist factory worker and his search for a businessman's hippie 
daughter. That movie also brought him a grant from the National 
Endowment of the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	Wexler earned more praise for ``Serpico'' in 1973, a screenplay  
based on the true story of a New York cop's battles against 
corruption in the police department. He then wrote ``Drum'' and 
``Mandingo'' before garnering more awards for the blockbuster 
``Saturday Night Fever.'' The Oscar-nominated script explored the 
life of a store clerk, played by John Travolta, who submerged 
himself in the world of disco. 
</P>
<P>
	In his later career, Wexler tallied a few flops, including  
``Stayin' Alive,'' the sequel to ``Saturday Night Fever,'' and 
``Raw Deal,'' starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
	Wexler, who suffered from manic depression, was arrested by the  
FBI in 1972 after he said he planned to shoot President Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in New Bedford, Mass., Wexler was raised in Detroit and  
spent most of his adult life in Greenwich, Conn. before moving to 
Washington two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by daughters Erica and Merin of New York and a  
sister, Janet Rosen, of Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Durable Goods Orders Up 3.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket  
manufactured goods surged in July, rising 3.3 percent, with gains 
posted for everything from industrial machinery and electronics to 
transportation equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported today that orders for durable  
goods -- items expected to last at least three years -- rose last 
month to a seasonally adjusted $204 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3.3 percent increase was the biggest gain since December  
1998, when orders rose 3.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The inflation-sensitive bond market gained ground after the  
figures were released, pushing down yields on 30-year Treasury 
bonds to 5.91 percent in early trading from 5.93 percent late 
Tuesday. In morning trading, the Dow Jones was down more than 50 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the National Association of Realtors said  
today that sales of existing single-family homes fell an expected 
3.9 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.41 
million units, following a record high posted the month before. 
Rising mortgage rates contributed to the drop, the association 
said. Many analysts had expected a bigger decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, existing home sales remained brisk and were running well  
ahead of last July's level. Sales were down in all parts of the 
country except for the South, where sales rose slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in July's durable-goods orders followed a 0.5  
percent gain in June, better than what the government previously 
estimated, and a 1 percent gain in May. 
</P>
<P>
	July's performance was much better than many analysts had  
expected. They were forecasting a rise of 0.8 percent in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong report comes one day after the Federal Reserve bumped  
up interest rates for the second time this year in an effort to 
cool the economy and prevent an outbreak of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for industrial machinery, the category that includes  
computers and machine tools, had the strongest showing in July, 
rising a hefty 8.4 percent, the largest increase since January 
1995. That followed sharp declines of 4.5 percent and 3.9 percent 
in May and June respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	And, orders for electronic and other electrical equipment, which  
includes everything from semiconductors, circuit boards and 
telecommunications equipment to home appliances, posted a strong 
5.9 percent gain in July, following a 3.5 percent increase in June 
and a 0.9 percent drop in May. July's showing for this category was 
the biggest gain since December 1998, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for transportation equipment also rose 2 percent in July,  
following gains of 1.1 percent in June and 9.9 percent in May. The 
transportation sector is often volatile from month to month because 
it includes such big-ticket purchases as airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said an increase in orders for airplane  
and aircraft parts more than offset a decline in orders for 
automobile and car parts. The summer is traditionally a slow period 
for the automobile industry as manufacturers retool assembly lines 
to prepare for new models. Still, the auto industry expects record 
sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding transportation, overall orders for durable goods would  
have risen 3.7 percent, the largest increase since February 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	American manufacturers have been battered by a global financial  
crisis, which has cut sharply into their overseas sales and also 
opened them up to stiffer competition from cheaper imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the overall economy has continued to do exceptionally  
well, powered by strong consumer demand. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the U.S. industries that has suffered the most from the  
global turmoil has been steel. But today's report indicated that 
the industry may have put the worse behind it. 
</P>
<P>
	Primary metals, the category that includes steel, saw orders  
grow by a solid 2.4 percent in July, following gains of 2.7 percent 
in June and 0.3 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	And, shipments of big-ticket durable goods, a good sign of  
current demand, rose a solid 0.7 percent in July.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Teen To Plead Guilty in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- An American teen-ager who angered U.S.  
lawmakers when he fled to Israel after Maryland authorities linked 
him to a dismemberment murder has agreed to plead guilty next week 
in a Tel Aviv court. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two years after he left this Washington suburb and  
launched an international extradition battle, Samuel Sheinbein will 
accept a 24-year jail sentence to be recommended by his attorneys 
and Israeli prosecutors. He is scheduled to enter his plea on Sept. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old Sheinbein, who claims Israeli citizenship  
through his Israeli-born father, will serve his sentence in Israel. 
He pleaded innocent in the case last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein could be paroled after 16 years, or after serving  
two-thirds of his sentence, under terms of the plea agreement 
announced Tuesday by Douglas Gansler, the Montgomery County state's 
attorney. He also could leave prison on weekend furloughs in four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler, who said his prosecutors were not consulted before the  
agreement was reached, said he was pleased about the conviction but 
``the bottom line remains unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our view it is an insult to justice, and Mr. Sheinbein  
will be free to walk the streets of Israel under the most likely 
scenario when he is 33 years of age,'' said Gansler, who learned 
about the plea agreement only Monday night in a fax sent by Israeli 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should have been our case,'' he said. ``Mr. Sheinbein  
should have been returned here, and we would have asked that they 
consult us before entering into this plea agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department was not told about the agreement either,  
department spokesman James Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stated we would have preferred to see this trial take place  
in the United States. But since it was the view of the Israeli 
courts that it should take place there, we wanted to see justice 
done,'' Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ido Baum, spokesman for Israel's Justice Ministry, confirmed the  
agreement but said he had requested the Americans withhold 
disclosure until Sheinbein entered his plea in court. Gansler said 
Israeli prosecutors authorized him to release the information. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein accused Gansler of  
``a breach of professional faith. ... We treated this as a vicious 
murder by accepting a plea that is in the very upper levels of 
cases for minors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eitan Maoz, an attorney for Sheinbein, refused to comment other  
than to say that any developments in the case would be heard at the 
court appearance next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein fled to Israel after he was suspected of killing  
Alfredo Tello Jr., also 19. Tello's burned and dismembered body was 
found in an empty garage near Sheinbein's home in Aspen Hill, Md., 
on Sept. 18, 1997. Sheinbein went to Israel several days later. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing, and Sheinbein's flight to Israel, raised a furor  
among Maryland's Hispanic organizations and Latino community, which 
accused prosecutors of negligence in allowing Sheinbein to escape. 
In Congress, several lawmakers threatened to cut off American aid 
to Israel unless the teen-ager was returned here to face charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Tello's parents declined to attend Gansler's news conference  
Tuesday but had him release a statement that said: ``The Tello 
family feels that justice has not been achieved in this case, that 
Mr. Sheinbein and his family have continually manipulated the 
judicial systems of both Israel and the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein's attorney has challenged Maryland attorneys to prove  
that Sheinbein took an active part in the killing with his friend, 
Aaron Needle. Needle committed suicide in a county jail the day 
before his trial was to start. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was actually what has been called a 'thrill kill.'''  
Gansler said. ``They killed Alfredo Tello for the mere pleasure of 
it. They actually planned on killing another friend of Mr. 
Sheinbein and Mr. Needle down the road, and this was basically a 
practice murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler said authorities collected DNA, fingerprints and other  
evidence, including a handwritten, notarized confession signed by 
Sheinbein and Needle. Officials also have a ``recipe for murder'' 
Sheinbein wrote that listed tools needed to kill, such as the saw 
he allegedly used to dismember Tello, goggles, disinfectant, 
garbage bags and a tarpaulin. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Sheinbein is freed, he could still be arrested and charged  
with first-degree murder if he tried to enter the United States or 
any country that belongs to the international police organization 
Interpol, Gansler said. ``There's no double jeopardy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein's father, Sol, living in Israel, faces obstruction of  
justice and hindering investigation charges in Montgomery County, 
Gansler said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Films Hurt US Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the import-battered U.S. steel industry  
was forced to lay off 10,000 workers last year, the government 
responded with a $1.5 billion loan program, a White House ``action 
plan'' and the threat of punitive tariffs against foreign steel 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the U.S. film industry saw 20,000 jobs leave the  
country, primarily because film and television producers were 
seeking lower-cost locations, no one in Congress or the 
administration rushed to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Folks may look at this and say, 'That's just a Hollywood  
issue.' But it's not,'' says Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill., who is 
taking the lead on Capitol Hill to help persuade American producers 
to stay home. ``It affects working people all over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, overseas productions made up 14 percent of all U.S.  
film and TV projects. But by 1998, they comprised 27 percent, 
according to a study last month commissioned by two major Hollywood 
unions, the Directors Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild. 
</P>
<P>
	That has meant a fivefold increase in lost wages, spending and  
taxes from those runaway productions to more than $10 billion in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	And the study said that for grips, best boys, extras, caterers,  
sound technicians and other movie-related workers, the picture is 
only getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of the business is going to Canada, which  
offers tax credits to studios for wage costs, a very favorable 
currency exchange rate and much-improved quality in its crews and 
locations. All that combines for a 25 percent reduction in cost by 
choosing to film in Canada, the study concluded -- a sometimes 
irresistible lure for film producers trying to find ways to hold 
down expenses on multimillion-dollar productions. 
</P>
<P>
	The California legislature is among state governments that have  
taken notice of the film flight, passing two bills that would 
provide tax credits for certain productions that use California 
labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Runaway productions also are a concern for states such as Texas,  
North Carolina, Washington and Illinois, which often get 
smaller-budget projects that are more likely to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Ver Kuilen, managing director of the Illinois Film Office,  
estimates the list of all the projects written with Illinois 
locations that were filmed elsewhere added up to $52 million in 
lost direct spending last year. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those was ``Blues Brothers 2000,'' the sequel to the  
original film that put Chicago and its south suburbs on the 
moviemaking map. Adding insult to injury, after crews shot only a 
few location scenes in the Windy City, officials from the Toronto 
film office called their counterparts there for advice on how to 
make their city appear more Chicago-like. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may not have gotten most of them anyway,'' Ver Kuilen said  
of that and other films. ``But 20 years ago, nobody even thought of 
going to Canada. Now, it's their first thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Weller and the coalition of the unions and state film  
offices are faced with several obstacles as they try to lure the 
studios back home by making the United States a more attractive 
location. 
</P>
<P>
	First, there still is little awareness in Congress and in the  
Clinton administration that a significant problem exists that 
affects more than just California. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, there is no consensus yet among those working on the issue  
on what to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Weller began by proposing, along with Reps. Mark Foley, R-Fla.,  
and Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., an amendment to the Republicans' 
recently passed tax bill that would have provided a 20 percent tax 
credit for film-related wages, tax-free film production bonds and 
low-interest loans. As planned, he promptly withdrew the probably 
overgenerous measure, only meaning to raise the issue's profile. 
</P>
<P>
	Weller also is urging the administration to put the issue on the  
table at the next World Trade Organization talks, set for Seattle 
in November. He would like to see the U.S. trade representative 
address with Canada its requirement that up to 60 percent of the 
content shown on its stations be Canadian. 
</P>
<P>
	Weller says that although the policy is meant to protect  
Canadian culture, it instead is being used as an economic tool to 
give an unfair advantage to Canadian markets over American ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want it to go the way of the TVs and other electronics  
products, then so be it. We will be a minority participant in the 
making of this product too,'' Ver Kuilen said. ``The trend is 
ominous for what has always been a U.S. industry.''

<HEADLINE> Cancer Patient Wins Hurdles Heat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Among those most surprised by the success  
of hurdler Ludmila Engquist is the world and Olympic champion 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how I got this far,'' the 35-year-old cancer  
patient said Wednesday after winning one of six heats at the World 
Championships and posting the best time of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Russian-born Swede thinks a demanding schedule of  
four races in five days and the searing Andalusian heat will take a 
toll on her. The quarterfinals are Thursday, with the semifinals 
Friday and the final Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very realistic. I will try, but I don't think I can  
win,'' Engquist said of her prospects for a gold medal. ``I would 
just like to be on the podium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Competing between chemotherapy treatments for breast cancer, the  
two-time world champion and 1996 Olympic gold medalist had the 
fastest time in heats for the 100-meter hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
	That sounds amazing, and while Engquist sometimes wonders how  
she succeeds, part of her prescription is following orders -- and 
that's not so difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like my doctor said, `You must lead your normal life,' '' she  
said. ``Normal life for me is to train and compete, and I did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cancer was diagnosed in late March, and Engquist had surgery  
to remove her right breast on her birthday, April 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said it would be about six weeks before she could start  
exercising. But Engquist couldn't wait to return to her sanctuary -- 
the track. 
</P>
<P>
	She continued to train through four chemotherapy sessions, and  
has two remaining -- including one slated for next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Engquist made her return July 30, before a loudly supportive  
crowd in Stockholm. Racing for the first time in more than a year, 
she won with a fast time of 12.68 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, against a tougher field, she was strong between  
the hurdles and smooth over them, holding off a late-charging 
Svetla Dimitrova down the stretch to post a winning time of 12.62. 
</P>
<P>
	Engquist pumped both fists as she crossed the line, then waved  
both hands at a group of Swedes in the stands at Olympic Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a bit of a bad start and not good technique,'' she said.  
``But the time is OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It certainly was good enough to beat Bulgaria's Dimitrova, the  
1997 world silver medalist, and faster than 1993 and 1995 world 
champion Gail Devers of the United States, who won her heat in 
12.80.

<HEADLINE> Jones' Bid for Three Golds Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Sprinter Marion Jones, bidding for three  
gold medals at the World Championships, pulled up with an injury 
during the semifinals of the 200 meters today and was carried away 
on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who won the 100 meters on Sunday, clutched her lower back  
about halfway through the race and fell to the track in agony. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' husband, shot put champion C.J. Hunter, rushed down from  
the stands and walked beside the stretcher as it was wheeled to the 
medical station inside the stadium, where she was being attended to 
by two doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's her back,'' said Jones' agent, Charlie Wells.  
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Tilden, spokeswoman for USA Track and Field, said Jones  
suffered back spasms and cramps coming out of the curve and was 
undergoing treatment. She gave no more details. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was trailing badly as the runners headed into the  
homestretch. Grimacing in pain, she slowed down, grasped her back 
and eased to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice Greene, who won his 200 semifinal heat today, said, ``I  
wish her the best. I believe she'll come back just as strong as she 
was before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green's agent, Emmanuel Hudson, said Jones may have been  
overextended. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just figured she was just beat from being on the track all  
the time. She's been in the heat for five days,'' Hudson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Quarrie, the 1976 Olympic 200 champion from Jamaica, said  
he though Jones was having problems early in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could tell she was in trouble before she got it, based on  
what I saw on the screen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was the heavy favorite in the event in her try for a  
100-200 double. She was also due to run in one of the relays. Her 
bid for an unprecedented four gold medals evaporated Monday when 
she settled for the bronze in the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones has said she will attempt to win five gold medals at next  
year's Sydney Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mostly Lower on Fed News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against most major currencies on  
Wednesday, fueled by expectations that investors will buy dollars 
to purchase U.S. bonds and stocks now that many believe the Federal 
Reserve is done raising interest rates this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0425, down  
from $1.0529 late Tuesday. The dollar also was quoted at 111.14 
Japanese yen, up from 110.80. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Fed raised short-term interest rates for the  
second time this summer in an effort to cool the economy by making 
it more difficult for Americans to borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors expect that the Fed will not raise rates again  
this year. That boosted bonds and stocks -- the Dow Jones industrial 
average set another record high --on Wednesday, and helped lift the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates make returns more attractive on investments  
denominated in dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed's message has been interpreted that no further rate  
hikes will be needed for the rest of the year,'' said Kevin Harris, 
international economist at MCM Currencywatch in New York. ``It is 
now seen as safe to buy back into U.S. assets'' and investors will 
use dollars to fund their purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains on Wall Street helped pull the dollar from its lows  
against the yen in overnight trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar moved as high as 112.40 yen soon after Haruhiko  
Kuroda, Japan's vice finance minister for international affairs, 
said the ministry is ready to take action against rapid moves in 
foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	But once traders realized that the Bank of Japan hadn't stepped  
in to buy dollars and sell the strong yen, the U.S. currency 
slumped. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5366 Swiss francs, up from  
1.5201, and 1.4940 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4925. The British 
pound fell to $1.5853 from $1.5941. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8762 German 
marks, up from 1.8575; 6.2922 French francs, up from 6.2297; and 
1,857 Italian lire, up from 1,839.

<HEADLINE> Phasing Out of Gas Additive Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A report by environmental officials from eight  
Northeast states called Wednesday for a controversial 
methanol-based gasoline additive to be largely phased out within 
three years because it pollutes waterways. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report also cautioned that replacing MTBE as an additive  
could become tricky and pose still other health risks by increasing 
the amount of toxic chemicals going into the air from motor 
vehicles. The additive has been key to reducing air pollution but 
poses other environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	This ``tension between public health and environmental resource  
protection'' poses unique challenges to state and federal 
regulators, said the study to be released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy was obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, the study agreed with a blue-ribbon federal panel's  
findings last month that MTBE raises enough environmental concerns 
about water pollution that its use should be severely limited. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use  
Management was expected to add to pressure in Congress and at the 
federal Environmental Protection Agency to curtail use of the 
additive. 
</P>
<P>
	If federal action curtailing MTBE is not taken, ``a regional  
solution will be pursued in the Northeast'' to reduce the amount of 
it used in the eight states -- Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, 
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont -- the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northeast governors requested the study last November, but  
it gained new significance after the federal blue-ribbon commission 
issued its conclusions last month. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA Administrator Carol Browner has said she now wants to reduce  
MTBE use as quickly as possible as long as substitutes do not 
sacrifice air quality gains already made. 
</P>
<P>
	The methanol-based additive -- methyl tertiary butyl ether -- is  
in about one-third of the gasoline sold nationwide and in about 
three-fourths of the gasoline sold in the Northeast. It 
significantly reduces air pollution from automobiles, especially 
toxic tailpipe emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	But the federal panel said it also contaminates groundwater,  
lakes and streams due to spillage and leaks from underground 
storage tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northeast governors will use the NESCAUM report to develop a  
regional strategy for dealing with MTBE, said Jason Grumet, the 
organization's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	The report recommended that the Northeast governors press  
Washington officials to give states increased authority to regulate 
MTBE and for Congress to eliminate the requirement that gasoline 
contain a certain level of oxygenate. MTBE is an oxygenate that 
allows gasoline to burn cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
	The regional study made no recommendation how MTBE could best be  
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	One substitute would be another additive, corn-based ethanol,  
which is used in the Midwest. The study said 800 million gallons of 
ethanol would be required to replace all the MTBE now in use in the 
Northeast region. Wide use of ethanol would be complicated by 
supply, distribution and cost problems, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The most economic near-term substitute for MTBE in the  
Northeast, the study said, may be to have refiners increase the 
levels of aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene and xylene in 
gasoline. But the report cautioned that these compounds are toxic, 
add to air pollution and ``adversely affect public health.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-NFL Player Gets Life for Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- Raphel Cherry, a former NFL player with  
Washington and Detroit, was sentenced to life in prison Wednesday 
for the murder of his estranged wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherry, 37, who set 22 passing records at Hawaii before moving  
into the NFL in 1985, showed no emotion as Circuit Judge Marion 
Humphrey read the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	It took 15 minutes for the jury of nine women and three men to  
decide Cherry's sentence. He was convicted previously of felonies 
involving forgery and the fraudulent use of a credit card. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, the prosecution portrayed the victim, Jerri  
Cherry, as a woman afraid to leave her Jacksonville, Fla., home for 
fear her husband would find her. She had been staying with 
relatives at least two weeks before the Dec. 22, 1998 murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The day she died, her divorce lawyer served Cherry with a  
subpoena demanding financial information related to his NFL salary 
and pension. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad the jury saw through all the smoke screens,'' deputy  
prosecuting attorney John Hout said. ``But even after all this, it 
still doesn't take away what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Cherry nor his lawyer, Dale Adams, commented after he  
was led from the courtroom. Cherry has 30 days to appeal.

<HEADLINE> Moroccan Jet Carrying 88 Hijacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- A Moroccan airliner with 88 people  
aboard was hijacked late Wednesday while en route to Tunisia, 
officials said. The plane landed in Barcelona and hijackers were 
demanding to fly to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The aircraft was immediately surrounded by security forces, and  
Spanish authorities began negotiations with the hijackers in 
French, said Spanish Interior Ministry spokesman Eduardo Planells. 
</P>
<P>
	There appeared to be three hijackers, said Luisa Pena, a  
ministry spokeswoman. They demanded that the plane be refueled and 
flown to Frankfurt, Germany. However, another ministry official 
said later that there might be just one hijacker. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word on the condition of the hostages or  
on the identities of the hijackers or about any other demands. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royal Air Maroc 737-400 was carrying 79 passengers and a  
crew of nine, Pena said. It was en route from Casablanca, Morocco, 
to Tunis, Tunisia, when the hijacking occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	It landed at Barcelona's El Prat airport at about 11 p.m. and  
taxied to an isolated area of the airport, Planells said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja was in contact with  
the Moroccan authorities, Pena said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish airports or planes have been involved in 14 hijackings  
or attempted hijackings since 1969, according to the news agency 
Efe. 
</P>
<P>
	The last was in June 1998 when a 43-year-old Spanish man seized  
an Iberia plane with 130 people aboard while flying from Seville, 
Spain, to Barcelona. The hijacker forced the plane to land in 
Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
	A handheld device he had said was an explosive turned out to be  
television remote control, and he surrendered a few hours after 
talking with his psychiatrist on the telephone.

<HEADLINE> Stricter Building Vowed in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's prime minister has promised  
stricter building rules to prevent any more of the shoddy 
construction blamed for the thousands of deaths from last week's 
massive earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, eight days after the powerful 7.4-magnitude temblor  
reduced a wide swath of western Turkey to rubble, searchers said 
they still held out hopes -- though slim -- that more people could be 
found alive. The government on Tuesday said the death toll rose to 
17,997, but revised that figure down to 12,514 early today. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cinarcik, a suburb of the resort town of Yalova, rescuers  
rushed to the site of a collapsed building after residents reported 
hearing sounds from under the crushed concrete. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Numan Arslanyer, head of the crisis center in Yalova,  
said four brothers were believed buried in the building, and that 
Turkish, Bulgarian and German rescuers were working intensively to 
dig them out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not lost hope to find people alive, and we will not  
lose hope,'' he said today. The last live rescue was Monday, when a 
4-year-old boy was saved. 
</P>
<P>
	A new tremor 200 miles away sent residents running into the  
streets in panic Tuesday night. The 4.7-magnitude quake was 
centered near Haymana, 40 miles south of the capital, Ankara. A 
4.2-magnitude aftershock followed. Haymana residents spent the 
night in parks and their cars, fearing more tremors. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more than a week after the quake, counting the dead was  
proving a difficult task. An official at the government's crisis 
center in Ankara, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a 
mistake had been made while entering data into a computer, 
resulting in the erroneous report that nearly 18,000 people had 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days of rain have deepened the misery of the estimated  
200,000 people left homeless by the quake, many of whom have 
complained bitterly that the government has been slow in responding 
to the crisis. Turkey's leaders defended their actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course the people have the right to be nervous, have the  
right to complain, but this is a natural disaster,'' Prime Minister 
Bulent Ecevit said in an interview with CNN on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the buildings that collapsed like houses of cards in the  
quake were built with concrete that had been mixed with ordinary 
sea sand. Rescuers say they have even seen seashells in the 
crumbled concrete. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mistakes have been made in the past with regard to the  
unofficial control of constructions ... and we are determined as a 
government to take the necessary steps,'' said the prime minister, 
without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anatolia news agency today quoted one major building  
contractor as acknowledging he used sea sand in his concrete. He 
said he hadn't understood the dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a contractor's license -- I am not a builder,''  
the report quoted contractor Veli Gocer as saying. He said nearly 
one-sixth of the 3,000 apartment units he built had collapsed in 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Veli spoke to Anatolia from in hiding, but told the agency he  
would surrender to police when passions calmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Overwhelmed by the crisis, Turkey has appealed for aid,  
including disinfectants, tetanus vaccines, bungalows, tents, 
flashlights, blankets, heavy machinery for clearing rubble and 
garbage trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	A Dutch group said it would send 30,000 prefabricated shelters  
designed to withstand quakes and winter cold. The United States 
plans to send 3,500 all-weather tents, reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	International efforts to assess the damage were gathering speed,  
with a European Community delegation arriving today and due to 
visit the quake zone Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarja Halonen, the foreign minister of Finland, was accompanied  
by the EU's external relations commissioner, Hans van den Broek. 
Finland holds the rotating EU presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite rescue efforts like the one today in Cinarcik, the  
search for survivors was winding down. But there was a strong 
reluctance to officially declare that there was no longer hope for 
pulling anyone from the rubble alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Out in hard-hit cities like Golcuk and Izmit, heavy earthmoving  
equipment was at work at many sites, marking an effective end to 
the delicate rescue efforts of previous days. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, relief workers were turning their attention to the  
quake's devastating psychological effects. A French group said it 
was beginning counseling for 500 children in quake-damaged Izmit, 
and Turkey's Psychological Association said it would send 50 
therapists to the quake zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The association was also distributing leaflets meant to help  
people mentally cope with the losses they had suffered.

<HEADLINE>  Thousands Rally for East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Up to 10,000 jubilant supporters of  
independence for East Timor defied threats and choked the streets 
of the normally sleepy provincial capital Wednesday, convinced they 
will win a historic U.N.-supervised referendum by a landslide next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people rode on trucks, buses and motorcycles in a  
noisy and smoky parade along Dili's palm-lined, ramshackle streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is a golden day for us, ahead is freedom and  
independence,'' said Zoana Victor, a 38-year-old resistance 
supporter who was jailed by Indonesia in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Many waved the blue, green, and white independence flags that  
were banned until recently. Others carried portraits of imprisoned 
independence leader Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the most impressive display of the separatist movement's  
popular strength to date, far outmatching earlier and more subdued 
rallies by anti-independence campaigners. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, Gusmao unveiled a wide-ranging program designed  
to ensure national reconciliation and economic growth following the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regardless of past positions, all citizens are called upon to  
embrace the need for harmony, and to show forgiveness and tolerance 
toward their brothers for the sake of our national interests,'' he 
said in a statement released in Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	Gusmao, who is under house arrest in the Indonesian capital, has  
frequently predicted an overwhelming victory by the 
pro-independence side in the U.N.-sponsored referendum on Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975, and  
ruled with an iron hand until the ouster last year of the longtime 
dictator Suharto. Like many Indonesians, Suharto uses only one 
name. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the government reversed Suharto's policy of  
forcibly integrating the half-island territory into Indonesia. 
Instead, it said, the East Timorese would be allowed to decide 
their fate through the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote will give East Timorese the choice between remaining  
part of Indonesia as a self-governing province and breaking away 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
	The transitional government would offer to integrate  
anti-independence supporters and other East Timorese citizens who 
worked for the Indonesian authorities into the new administration 
and police force, Gusmao's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gusmao's optimism regarding the outcome of the plebiscite was  
echoed in Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are sure 90 percent of East Timor's people will vote for  
independence,'' said Manuel Carrascalao, a longtime 
pro-independence politician. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's crowd turned out despite what activists say is a  
campaign of violence and intimidation against civilians and U.N. 
staff by militia groups accused of trying to derail the ballot so 
they can stay part of Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Riot police broke up a brief clash between pro- and  
anti-independence groups after both sides threw rocks. One man was 
injured before officers closed off a street adjacent to a militia 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	The celebration was also marred by a traffic accident in which  
three people died. Three others were injured in the collision 
between a truck and a car in the motorcade. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Indonesia's armed forces, accused for decades of  
human rights abuses in their quest to crush separatist guerrillas, 
watched passively as the raucous procession moved slowly by their 
barracks. A police helicopter hovered overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, thousands rallied outside the seafront headquarters of  
the Council for Timorese National Resistance. They sang and danced, 
and chanted ``Long live East Timor,'' and ``Long live Xanana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his statement, Gusmao proclaimed a general amnesty ``for all  
political crimes committed until now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have fought against an oppressive system that has  
antagonized us,'' he said. ``At no point have we fought against the 
people of Indonesia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gusmao said the transitional government would maintain close  
ties with ``a democratic and multi-party Indonesia'' and would keep 
in use its currency, the rupiah. 
</P>
<P>
	He said East Timor would develop a market economy free of the  
endemic corruption that characterized Indonesia's administration. 
He also pledged to promote foreign investment and protect property 
rights.

<HEADLINE>  Thousands Rally for East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Up to 10,000 jubilant supporters of  
independence for East Timor defied threats and choked the streets 
of the normally sleepy provincial capital Wednesday, convinced they 
will win a historic U.N.-supervised referendum by a landslide next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people rode on trucks, buses and motorcycles in a  
noisy and smoky parade along Dili's palm-lined, ramshackle streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is a golden day for us, ahead is freedom and  
independence,'' said Zoana Victor, a 38-year-old resistance 
supporter who was jailed by Indonesia in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Many waved the blue, green, and white independence flags that

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes at Record 11,326.04 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher Wednesday, carrying the Dow  
Jones industrial average to a new closing high, as investors grew 
more confident that the latest interest rate increase will enable 
the economy to grow without runaway inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow rose 42.74 points to close at 11,326.04, topping its  
previous record close of 11,299.76, set Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also closed higher. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 rose 18.29 to 1,381.79, and the Nasdaq composite index 
rose 53.23 to 2,805.60. The Nasdaq, which lists many of the 
nation's leading technology companies, notched its fourth straight 
increase and is edging back toward its July 16 record close of 
2,864.48. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices, which rose following the Federal Reserve's decision  
to raise interest rates, propelled stocks higher Wednesday. The 
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.86 percent, its lowest 
level in almost three months. Bond prices and yields move in the 
opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
	As the market fretted in the weeks leading up to the Fed's  
Tuesday meeting, bond yields soared as high as 6.24 percent, a 
level not seen since October 1997. That drew investors away from 
stocks as they sought more lucrative, guaranteed returns from 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tuesday's quarter-point rate increase -- and the Fed's  
suggestion that inflation may be successfully contained in the 
coming months -- sent investors back to stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were looking for an excuse to buy, and the Fed provided  
it,'' said Richard A. Dickson, a technical analyst at Scott &AMP; 
Stringfellow Inc. in Richmond, Va. ``It's onward and upward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks rose most sharply as investors made bets that  
those companies will continue to grow in a stable interest rate 
climate. Microsoft extended a string of recent gains, rising 3 1/8 to 
95 5/16. Amazon.com rose 12 13/16 to 132 7/8, and America Online 
gained 4 1/2 to 103 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those shares faltered earlier this summer amid the  
threat of rising interest rates. Investors buy those stocks on the 
promise of strong future earnings, and high rates can hurt profits 
by making it more expensive to borrow in order to finance growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, investors are now looking for good values in the Internet  
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``At their current levels, they look like bargains to some  
people,'' Dickson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank stocks, which should benefit from good news on interest  
rates, dropped after Bank One warned 1999 profits will fall well 
short of Wall Street's expectations, due largely to slower growth 
in its credit card business. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago-based bank's stock plunged 12 5/8 to 43, and dragged  
other financial-services stocks with it. Chase Manhattan fell 1 
1/16 to 85 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	But a wide range of Dow components gained ground. AT&AMP;T rose 2 5/8  
to 49 1/4, General Electric rose 2 11/16 to 119 5/16, and Johnson &AMP; 
Johnson gained 2 9/16 to 105 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	While many analysts said the Fed's announcement enabled stocks  
to make further gains, Gail Dudack, chief equity strategist at 
Warburg Dillon Read, said investors are likely to continue their 
watch for signs of inflation that could prompt the Fed to raise 
rates again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Soon the markets will refocus on economic announcements for  
direction,'' she said, noting that the next employment report, 
expected Sept. 2, will offer the latest indications of whether 
labor costs are escalating sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	``If labor markets still appear tight, the debate on Fed policy  
is likely to begin anew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled 1.04 billion 
shares, compared with 891.93 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.74 to 437.86.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.3 percent.  
European indexes rose sharply; Germany's DAX index gained 1.4 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 
rose 1.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Sculptor Creates Legacy in Butter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- With a 5-pound glob of butter in one  
hand and the thumb of Jesus in the other, Norma Lyon laments over 
how the main figure in her Last Supper keeps getting in the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've knocked three fingers off of him today,'' Lyon said, her  
graying head swaying from side to side as she reattached the thumb. 
``Maybe we should have saved him for last, but we thought he was 
too important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norma Lyon, 70, is called ``Duffy'' by her friends but is known  
to most Iowans as ``the butter lady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She has been sculpting a life-sized, 600-pound, butter cow at  
the Iowa State Fair each year since 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	She hasn't missed a year. She carved her first cow when she was  
pregnant with her seventh child and she carved two other cows as 
she was either pregnant or recovering from giving birth to her 
eighth and ninth children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I live for it all year long,'' Lyon said as she snuggled in a  
pumpkin-colored jacket to warm up after hours in a 40-degree 
refrigerated showcase. It smells like a Waffle House without the 
waffles. 
</P>
<P>
	Each day of the fair, from dawn to dusk, scores of people line  
up to see the display in the Agriculture Building, stamping Lyon's 
work as a crowd favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	This year was no exception.  
</P>
<P>
	``My gosh, there are lines 20 feet deep. People are clamoring to  
see the Last Supper out of butter,'' said Kathy Swift, fair 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors this year included Vice President Al Gore, a bevy of  
Republican presidential candidates who had their photos taken with 
Lyons and her work, and an observer from Yale University's art 
library, viewing Lyon's sculpture as an example of folk art. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated attendance totals for the Aug. 12-22 fair ranged from  
60,000 on opening day to 120,000 a day over the final weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the most popular things at the fair,'' Swift said.  
``You wouldn't want to do away with the butter cow, ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carving a butter cow was not Lyon's idea. The state fair has  
featured one every year since 1911 as a promotion for dairy 
products, Swift said. Before Lyon, there was J.E. Wallace, who died 
in 1956. Earl Dutt, the sculptor who took over for Wallace, didn't 
impress Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a picture and thought I could do better than that,''  
said Lyon, a self-described housewife. ``So my husband said, `go 
ahead.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyon, who has been drawing horses since she was 8 and whose  
first sculpture was a horse made out of snow, took a sculpting 
class while working on her veterinary science degree at Iowa State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wallace had a good decent cow, with good ribs, muscles and  
horns,'' she said, pointing to her ribs and hooking her forefingers 
over her head to simulate horns. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Wallace's successor, Lyon said his sculpture was adequate.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good farm cow, but it wasn't a show cow,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	So Lyon talked to the Iowa American Dairy Association, which  
sponsored and provided butter for the cow in the 1950s. After 
helping carve the butter cow in 1957 and 1958, Lyon took it over in 
1959. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like it has a good udder,'' said Cal Heisner, a dairy  
farmer from Beecher, Ill., one of the hundreds of people filing 
past the cow at the Agriculture Building. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, butter is Lyon's preferred medium, although she has created  
other sculptures, including a life-size bronze cow and calf 
displayed at the intersection of U.S. Highways 30 and 63 in Toledo, 
her hometown, 60 miles west of Cedar Rapids. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyon started carving companion pieces to the cow in 1984,  
starting with a horse and foal. Grant Woods' famous painting, 
``American Gothic,'' featuring a pitchfork and two stern-faced 
figures in front of a farm house, Garth Brooks and even Smokey Bear 
have been carved in butter. 
</P>
<P>
	After suffering a stroke in May 1997, Lyon made her comeback  
with the traditional butter cow -- and an Elvis -- that had people 
lined up around the Agriculture Building. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll do it as long as my health holds up,'' Lyon said. ``One  
doesn't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, as a celebration of her 40th anniversary at the fair,  
she decided to take on her most ambitious butter-sculpting project 
to date -- a 1,700-pound butter sculpture of the Last Supper. 
</P>
<P>
	Having read the biblical accounts in the books of Matthew, Mark  
and Luke, her Last Supper features disciples around a table leaning 
back on what appear to be lounge chairs while Jesus stands at the 
head of the table with his arms stretched out, looking toward the 
heavens. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole thing is out of our head,'' Lyon said.  
</P>
<P>
	At least three assistants helped Lyon this year, including Darel  
Nixt, 19, who worked on Judas, the third disciple from Jesus on the 
back row. Lyon and her assistants scooped butter from 50-pound, 
plastic-lined boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The faces are fictitious, although assistant Ruth Nixt, Darel's  
mother, said the disciple in the back row looks a little like her 
brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if some might find her Last Supper butter sculpture  
offensive, Lyon, cleaning the butter off her hands with paper 
napkins, replies like a true artist. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a statue and that's my medium,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Two Students Arrested in Fla. Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALATKA, Fla. (AP) -- Two boys at a school for troubled children  
were arrested on charges they were plotting a return to their 
former high school to kill students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	William Tyler Black, 17, and Jeffrey Burton Carter, 16, were  
charged as juveniles with conspiracy to commit second-degree 
murder, Capt. Dick Schauland of the Putnam County Sheriff's Office 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	History teacher David Nye discovered a drawing Monday that  
Carter had made of a student with a bloody knife, a shotgun and an 
assault weapon at Palatka High School, Schauland said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Nye asked Carter about the drawing, Carter and Black told  
him they had a plan to do a better job of killing than was done at 
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, two Columbine students killed 12 classmates and a  
teacher there before committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Black and Carter told Nye they were outcasts at Palatka because  
they worshipped Satan, Schauland said. Both were arrested Tuesday 
night at their homes and placed in a juvenile detention center. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a detailed plan, whether or not they were intending  
to do something, we don't know,'' Schauland said. ``To us, this was 
a warning sign.''

<HEADLINE> Justice Attorneys Seek Overtime Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawyers who work for the Justice Department  
are seeking more than $500 million in a class-action lawsuit that 
accuses the law-enforcement agency of illegally failing to provide 
overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose is to ensure that the nation's chief law  
enforcement agency abides by the law itself,'' the attorneys' 
lawyer, Robert A. Van Kirk, said Wednesday. ``The department has 
made a deliberate policy decision to ignore the law'' that requires 
overtime pay for employees who work more than 40 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit says the department keeps two sets of records: one  
set for pay purposes, which shows a 40-hour work week, and another 
set reflecting actual hours worked, which is used for budget 
requests to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of a meeting Tuesday between lawyers and U.S. Court  
of Federal Claims Judge Robert H. Hodges Jr., more than 12,000 
current and former Justice Department lawyers will be formally 
notified of the lawsuit early next month and asked whether they 
want to join as plaintiffs. About 180 lawyers have joined so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokeswoman Chris Watney declined comment on  
the lawsuit filed last November. 
</P>
<P>
	The department said in court papers early this year, ``There is  
little overtime policy that is DOJ-wide'' and that the department 
had no ``policy of denying overtime pay to attorneys who are 
officially ordered or approved to work overtime.'' Those who sued 
must show that any overtime work was officially approved, the 
department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers seek damages of more than $500 million to provide  
back overtime pay as well as contributions to an employee savings 
plan and retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said department records show that many Justice  
lawyers work well over 40 hours a week and that ``DOJ management 
expects that its attorneys will work overtime, has knowledge that 
its attorneys are working overtime, relies on the time records they 
submit, and approves of the hours expended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Indeed, the department has adopted a formal policy of refusing  
to pay overtime even while admitting that its attorneys must work 
overtime to perform their jobs competently,'' the lawsuit asserted. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those who have joined the lawsuit, attorney Nancy Hill,  
now in private practice in Charleston, W.Va., estimates that she 
often worked 60 and sometimes 80 hours a week during her 13 years 
as an assistant U.S. attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our understanding was that there was no entitlement to be paid  
for overtime and we were expected to work the hours the job 
required,'' she said Wednesday. ``No one left at 5 o'clock, ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed on behalf of lawyers who have worked for  
the Justice Department in Washington and in U.S. attorneys' offices 
across the country since Nov. 25, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Employees Pay Act of 1945 requires federal employees  
to be given overtime pay or compensatory time off for work in 
excess of an eight-hour day and 40-hour week. The law does not 
create an exception for lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, an agency can pay workers a flat annual overtime  
premium instead of calculating the exact number of overtime hours 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1998 Justice Department manual states that ``assistant U.S.  
attorneys are professionals and should expect to work in excess of 
regular hours without overtime pay,'' according to a copy provided 
by Van Kirk's office. 
</P>
<P>
	His office also released a copy of a 1980 opinion by the  
department's Office of Legal Counsel that concluded Justice lawyers 
were entitled to overtime pay or compensatory time off. The opinion 
said a court likely would conclude that much of the overtime worked 
by Justice lawyers was ``induced'' even though the department had a 
policy of not ordering overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1998 internal memo by Justice Department lawyer Fran M.  
Allegra said, ``If the department continues to ignore this problem, 
sooner or later, an intrepid attorney will develop a class action 
on this issue and major problems will result.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Houston Astros outfielder Richard Hidalgo, on  
the disabled list since Aug. 9, needs surgery on his left knee and 
will miss the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hidalgo, one of 13 Astros on the disabled list this season, has  
inflammation resulting from loose cartilage. The Astros said it was 
caused by a congenital condition that caused the kneecap not to 
properly join together. 
</P>
<P>
	He will have the operation Thursday in Houston.  
</P>
<P>
	Hidalgo, 24, hit .227 this season with 15 homers and 56 RBIs. He  
also has 15 outfield assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Astros outfielders Derek Bell (left groin) and Moises Alou (left  
knee surgery) also are on the disabled list, and Alou may not play 
at all this season as a result of a treadmill accident prior to 
spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	First baseman Jeff Bagwell and second baseman Craig Biggio are  
the only players from the Astros' opening-day lineup not to go on 
the disabled list this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Astros infielder Bill Spiers returned to Houston and will have a  
cortisone injection in his back today. Spiers, who also had a 
cortisone injection during spring training, is expected to be 
sidelined until Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Advance To Dominate Fashion Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Advance Publications will dominate the  
fashion press with its planned purchase of a Walt Disney Co. 
publishing unit that includes Women's Wear Daily, W and Jane 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale price was not disclosed Tuesday, but previous reports  
put the value of the deal at about $650 million. The companies said 
they expect the deal to close by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	With its earnings and stock price slumping, Disney has been  
trying to refocus on its movie studio and theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite Fairchild's strengths, Disney is focused on the  
long-term growth of our core brands and entertainment assets,'' 
said Michael Eisner, Disney chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Disney will sell its Fairchild Publications unit  
to Advance, the parent company of Conde Nast, but will be allowed 
to publish some material online from W, Jane and Women's Wear 
Daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Conde Nast's publications include: Vogue, Glamour, Mademoiselle,  
GQ and The New Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney acquired Fairchild in 1995 in its purchase of Capital  
Cities-ABC, but wanted to sell it two years ago as it sold other 
publications, including the Kansas City Star and Fort Worth 
Star-Telegram and the trade publisher Chilton. 
</P>
<P>
	S.I. Newhouse Jr., chairman of Advance, reportedly had been in a  
bidding war with rival Hearst Magazines for Fairchild. The deal 
merges two of the fashion world's most powerful publishers, 
potentially allowing Advance to offer advertisers package rates for 
buying space in several magazines at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Disney announced today that it has bought a majority  
interest in toysmart.com, an online educational toy seller. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney's Buena Vista Internet Group will own an estimated 60  
percent stake in the Waltham, Mass.-based toy retailer, said Chuck 
Davis, president of electronic commerce for Disney's Internet 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but analysts said the deal  
includes $20 million in cash and $25 million worth of free 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney will integrate privately-held toysmart.com with its  
Family.com Web site, Davis said. Family.com has articles and advice 
on parenthood and draws about 3 million visitors a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Educational toys make up about 38 percent of the $23 billion toy  
market, said David Lord, toysmart.com's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The market for the educational toys sold by toysmart.com is  
worth between $5 billion and $8 billion, said Ken Cassar, an 
analyst with Jupiter Communications in New York.

<HEADLINE> Phelps Dodge Must Up Merger Ante </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Asarco Inc. and Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. have set  
a stiff price if Phelps Dodge Corp. wants to persist with plans for 
a three-way merger. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Asarco and Englewood, Colo.-based Cyprus Amax,  
two of the world's leading copper and metals producers, have 
already agreed to merge to form the nation's largest copper 
company. Last week, they rebuffed a $2.7 billion all-stock offer 
from Phelps Dodge to aquire both in a three-way combination. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a joint letter sent to Phelps Dodge on Wednesday, the two  
issued the terms under which they would be receptive to a Phelps 
Dodge takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Asarco chairman Francis R. McAllister and Cyprus Amax Chairman  
Milton H. Ward said they would require Phelps Dodge to sweeten the 
deal by $600 million, or 22 percent, by increasing the exchange 
ratio. They also said Phelps Dodge would have to underwrite ``the 
risk of antitrust problems,'' such as divestitures, before they 
will discuss the deal further. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix-based Phelps Dodge released a statement calling those  
terms ``totally unreasonable.'' However, the company said it would 
review the proposal and that it remains committed to a three-way 
combination ``that is beneficial to shareholders of all three 
companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If Asarco and Cyprus Amax are truly interested in a negotiated  
transaction and not just posturing, we would be more than willing 
to start real discussions,'' said Phelps Dodge Chairman Douglas C. 
Yearley. ``Neither company has attempted to sit down with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge recently slashed its production by closing mines,  
smelters and refineries throughout the Southwest, laying off 
approximately 1,650 workers in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. The 
industry has suffered in the wake of falling copper prices and 
lower copper sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward called Phelps Dodge's offer ``an opportunistic and somewhat  
desperate proposal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal put forth Wednesday, Asarco shareholders  
would get .53 of a Phelps Dodge share for each Asarco share held, 
compared with the Phelps Dodge offer of .4098 a share. Cyprus Amax 
shareholders demand .4055 of a Phelps Dodge share, up from the 
offered 0.4055 share. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Wednesday's closing stock price of $57.62 1/2, that would  
value Asarco at $30.54 a share, or $1.2 billion, and Cyprus at 
$23.37 a share, or $2.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge's offer values Asarco at $23.61 a share, or $937  
million and Cyprus at $18.07 a share, or $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	McAllister said a combined Asarco Cyprus will produce 2 billion  
pounds of copper annually, compared with Phelps Dodge's production 
of 1.7 billion pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge has said neither offer was contingent on the  
success of the other, but McAllister said Cyprus and Asarco ``have 
an agreement that we're together on this deal.''

<HEADLINE> Browns Get Jamie Martin as 2nd QB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Cleveland Browns coach Chris Palmer has found  
a backup quarterback who won't take long to learn his offensive 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Martin was the reserve quarterback last season for the  
Jacksonville Jaguars, filling in for starter Mark Brunell in a 
victory against Detroit last December. In Martin's only NFL start, 
the next week against Tennessee, he tore a knee ligament, ending 
his season. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer was the offensive coordinator for Jacksonville last  
season. With Martin's knee sufficiently healed after surgery, 
Palmer wanted him on the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, a free agent, signed a one-year contract Wednesday.  
Terms weren't disclosed, but his agent, Jack Mills, had said 
earlier that the Browns were offering a one-year minimum contract 
of $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's close to being ready,'' Palmer said. ``His familiarity is  
a factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said Martin could provide the Browns a reserve with  
experience. The starter is expected to be veteran Ty Detmer, with 
rookies Tim Couch and Mike Cook the backups. With the addition of 
Martin, Cook would probably be added to the practice squad.

<HEADLINE> 3 Suicides in 8 Days at NJ Casino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- A German tourist jumped to his death  
off a 10-story casino parking garage Wednesday in the third such 
suicide in Atlantic City in eight days. 
</P>
<P>
	The man, whose name was not immediately released, resisted the  
pleas of a security guard who tried to talk him down from the ledge 
of the Resorts Atlantic City garage. He plummeted about 100 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 17, a gambler who had lost $87,000 jumped to his death  
off a Trump Plaza roof. On Monday, a dealer at Caesars Atlantic 
City Hotel Casino committed suicide by leaping off the casino's 
parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear if the most recent victim had been gambling. He  
left no suicide note. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts blame casino gambling for higher suicide rates.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, a University of California-San Diego sociology  
professor issued a report linking gambling to suicides. But the 
pro-casino American Gaming Association responded with a study 
asserting that suicides in Atlantic City, Las Vegas and other 
gambling resorts ``are about average compared to non-gaming 
areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Looney, executive director of the New Jersey Council on  
Compulsive Gambling, said problem gamblers sometimes see suicide as 
the only way out. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's two things that happen to a compulsive gambler in the  
desperation stage,'' he said. ``One is illegal activity, or 
stealing to get money or writing bad checks. Once they go through 
that money and can't gamble anymore, suicide becomes an 
alternative.''

<HEADLINE> Disney Grabs Online Toy Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Disney has gained a better foothold in the  
online toy business with its purchase of a majority stake in 
Toysmart.com, a deal analysts said Wednesday will position the 
companies as leaders in educational toys. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies would not disclose the purchase price, but an  
analyst said Disney paid $20 million for its 60 percent interest in 
the toy company and agreed to provide $25 million in Web and other 
media marketing for Toysmart on Disney properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Toysmart specializes in what company President David Lord calls  
``good toys'' intended to teach and inspire children. Its products 
include games and puzzles, painting kits and a solar-powered 
windmill model. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the general toy business dominated by well-known  
retailers such as Toys ``R'' Us, Wal-Mart and the Internet company 
eToys, the market for educational toys is fragmented among smaller 
outfits. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Cassar, an analyst with Jupiter Communications in New York,  
estimates the educational toys market is worth between $5 billion 
and $8 billion -- or roughly about a quarter to a third of the $23 
billion overall toy market. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney's clout and reach will help Toysmart, which is just  
beginning a big national marketing push, to ``bring the message to 
consumers that we're a credible alternative to other competitors in 
the online toy market,'' Lord said. ``We're going to champion good 
toys, and we're going to shout it from the top of every mountain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal gives Disney a new, ready-made Internet toy presence  
beyond its online Disney store, where consumers can buy such items 
as Mickey Mouse tool kits and Cinderella play sets. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing bad in it for Disney,'' said Carrie Ardito, a  
research associate at Forrester Research. ``It's relatively cheap 
and only extends their reach to more people. It's even better for 
Toysmart. It's a relatively unknown retailer catapulted into one of 
the most dominant marketers online.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies' Web sites will share links, with Disney's  
Family.com site promoting Toysmart products and Toysmart's site 
gaining access to editorial content from Disney. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney will control three of the five seats on Toysmart's board  
of directors, but Toysmart will retain control of its site and what 
products are sold there, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Davis, president of electronic commerce for Disney's Buena  
Vista Internet Group, said Disney wants to keep a ``little 
church-and-state separation'' so Toysmart will be free to pick the 
toys it wants. 
</P>
<P>
	Toysmart already sells some Disney toys and probably will add  
more as it expands its catalog from about 20,000 items to 75,000 by 
this November, Lord said. New items will include baby toys and 
children's furniture, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said Disney toys likely would account for no more than 1  
percent of Toysmart's items.

<HEADLINE> Prehistoric Man May Not Be Very Old </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists say the frozen remains of a prehistoric man in a  
Canadian glacier is a rare and intriguing discovery, but may not be 
old enough to help resolve the intensifying debate over how people 
arrived in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Three teachers were hunting for sheep in a remote corner of  
northwestern British Columbia when they found the well-preserved 
body Aug. 14 in a rapidly melting glacier in Tatshenshini Park, 
just south of the Yukon-British Columbia border. The man's flesh 
was still intact. 
</P>
<P>
	The receding ice also revealed his simple possessions: a fur  
cloak, a broad-brimmed hat, a walking stick, a spear and a leather 
pouch filled with fish and edible leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal leaders and archeologists for British Columbia announced  
the find Tuesday, saying that the body is in cold storage in 
Whitehorse, the provincial capital of Canada's Yukon Territory. 
Tests to precisely determine its age have not been completed. 
Scientists who initially examined the remains say it is comparable 
to 5,300-year old frozen hunter found in the Alps in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	That's considerably more recent than other prehistoric mummies  
and skeletons found recently in the United States, including the 
controversial Kennewick Man skeleton believed to be more than 9,000 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Several competing theories of how North America was settled  
suggest humans migrated here at least 15,000 years ago. Less 
conservative estimates push the date back 40,000 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Discoveries of bones, tools and other artifacts shows that the  
west coast of Canada was a popular migration route from Asia. But 
people were moving around the continent from other directions as 
well, and perhaps far earlier than the Canadian iceman. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthropologists said radiocarbon dating is the necessary first  
step in the investigation. A variety of other tests, including 
analyzing his ancient DNA and X-rays of his skeleton, can reveal 
the man's health and diet, as well as his culture, way of life and 
the environment in which he lived. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably there were multiple human migration episodes in the  
Americas,'' said Robson Bonnichsen, director of the Center for the 
Study of the First Americans at Oregon State University. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to have somebody from this far north,'' Bonnichsen  
said of the Canadian discovery that was announced Tuesday. ``We 
just don't know where he fits into the picture. Getting an accurate 
date is essential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To determine the body's age, scientists must obtain permission  
from native tribes in the area to take small samples of hair, flesh 
or bone from the body. The Champagne and Aishuhik First Nations in 
west Canada have claimed the ancient man as their ancestor. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, tribal elders said they would support research  
efforts on the remains, in contrast to tribal opposition that has 
blocked research on the Kennewick discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Radiocarbon testing is accurate to within 50 years on an  
artifact that is 10,000 years old. Separate tests on ice samples 
from the glacier also would help to establish his age. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said Wednesday that the test could yields surprising  
results on the Canadian iceman. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago, radiocarbon dating of a Nevada mummy revealed it  
was 9,400 years old - the oldest mummy in North America. 
Previously, it had been thought to be no more than 2,000 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have something very dry or very frozen you can't  
estimate its timeframe based on the state of preservation,'' said 
Amy Dansie of the Nevada State Museum in Carson City. ``The age of 
the body is the critical issue. If it's only 5,000 years old, 
that's pretty late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several other tests, including DNA sampling and skull  
measurements, could shed light on the frozen man's cultural 
background, and whether he is distantly related to any modern 
groups or tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Microscopic pollen on his clothing, as well as the edible leaves  
in his bag, could help researchers reconstruct the ancient 
environment. Fur clothing and the size of the glacier demonstrates 
that portions of the region were cold, especially at high 
elevations. 
</P>
<P>
	As early as 14,000 years ago, coastal regions that now are  
underwater were treeless plains similar to today's Yukon, said 
paleoecologist Rolf W. Mathewes of Simon Fraser University in 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	Contamination is another concern. Frozen mummies decompose  
rapidly if allowed to thaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe's famous Ice Man, the oldest and best-preserved frozen  
mummy, now resides in a below-zero chamber in an Italian museum. 
</P>
<P>
	In Argentina, three pre-Columbian mummies found high in the  
Andes are kept in freezers. They still have blood in their hearts 
and lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	Other 500-year old Inca mummies, such as the Ice Maiden, are  
kept in air-tight displays. But the Ice Maiden was freeze-dried in 
the arid climate, and lacks internal fluids. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said the Canadian remains probably contain  
prehistoric pathogens that would offer insights into disease among 
ancient peoples. Investigators must maintain cold sterile 
conditions for their own safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pathogens survive very well in these mummies,'' Dansie said.  
``There's good reason to be very cautious.''

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Roar in Nevada, Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STEAD, Nev. (AP) -- Firefighters struggled through the night to  
slow a wildfire that forced the evacuation of 60 ranch homes and 
singed the whiskers of exotic animals at a shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	The evacuation of the Antelope Valley about 10 miles north of  
Reno remained in effect this morning, but residents were to be 
allowed to return during the day, said firefighters' spokeswoman 
Anna Payne. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze was 40 percent contained today after burning through  
about 4,500 acres of dry sagebrush and juniper, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also burned to within a few miles of a housing division in  
neighboring Lemmon Valley late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no injuries and no immediate word of any structure  
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze, visible from U.S. Highway 395, was sparked by a  
vehicle fire near the Animal Ark Shelter northwest of Stead and 
burned through the shelter. The shelter's occupants, including a 
tiger, a bobcat and a coyote, were evacuated safely. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some burnt whiskers and singed noses but amazingly  
all the animals survived,'' said Washoe County spokesman Bob 
Harmon. 
</P>
<P>
	In northeastern California, firefighters continued to battle  
over 100 lightning-ignited fires that have charred 30,000 acres. 
More than 1,000 firefighters were battling the blazes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're dealing with some of the roughest country we have in  
Butte County, a lot of rock bluffs which makes it difficult to 
build a fire line,'' said John Hawkins, a California Department of 
Forestry spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman was found burned to death in a vehicle Tuesday off a  
dirt road near Lake Oroville, said Mary Huggins, a CDF spokeswoman. 
Authorities were investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Another fire sparked by lightning two days ago continued to burn  
near Doyle, Calif. Smoke spread into Nevada, combining with the 
Stead blaze to form a plume of smoke visible for more than 20 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 600 firefighters also were working to halt a stubborn  
fire in some 1,700 acres of brush and timber in California's 
Stanislaus National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze began Monday in steep, brushy terrain near Highway  
120, about eight miles west of Yosemite National Park and 120 miles 
east of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters were mainly focused on keeping the flames away from  
the wooded area around the main fork of the Tuolumne River, a 
designated wild and scenic river, said Richard Wisehart, the 
forest's main spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire closed the highway about four miles east of Groveland,  
effectively shutting down that entrance to Yosemite. The cause of 
the blaze was under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Records Song </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- President Joseph Estrada has recorded  
a song he wrote 30 years ago and plans to sing it live with a 
72-piece orchestra to raise funds for the poor, a record company 
official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Estrada's ballad, titled ``Endure I Will,'' is part of a compact  
disc of compositions of the late Ernani Cuenco, one of the 
country's foremost musicians and a close friend of the Philippine 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Estrada's song is a slow, sentimental piece he wrote in 1968  
while despondent over his apparent loss in a mayoral election in 
the small Manila suburb of San Juan, said Tito Ty, executive vice 
president of BMG Records Pilipinas Inc., which produced the album. 
</P>
<P>
	After writing the song, which was set to music by Cuenco,  
Estrada protested the election result and was proclaimed winner the 
following year. 
</P>
<P>
	Estrada began a movie career when he was 24. He acted in dozens  
of low-budget action movies, usually playing tough downtrodden 
characters who stood up for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Estrada, 62, plans to sing the song live at a $255 per plate  
fund-raising dinner at the prestigious Manila Hotel on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The CD, which has a cream-colored cover embossed with a gold

<HEADLINE> Wealthy Immigrants Sue INS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Affluent immigrants who hoped to attain  
permanent residency in the United States through investments sued 
the Immigration and Nationalization Service Tuesday claiming its 
rules were secretly and illegally changed. 
</P>
<P>
	INS officials said the dispute is about proving each immigrant  
invested $500,000 in a U.S. company as required. They said the 208 
immigrants in the lawsuit, about one-third living in California, 
have a quarrel with their investment company, not the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The 143-page suit filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco  
is the latest and largest of six similar cases involving the United 
States' immigrant investor program. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress created the program in 1990 to attract foreign  
investment. Through it, immigrants can get a two-year conditional 
visa in exchange for investing a minimum $500,000 in U.S. companies 
to create at least 10 jobs each. If the financial obligation is met 
during the temporary stay, the immigrant obtains permanent 
residency. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involves immigrants who funneled their investments  
through AIS, a company based in Greenbelt, Md., which bundled more 
than $100 million from immigrants for investments in companies 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Although AIS is not directly involved in the lawsuit, the case  
revolves around the financial arrangements the immigrants made with 
AIS. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigrants typically contributed a fraction of the amount  
required in cash, perhaps $125,000, and committed through a 
promissory note to pay the rest by the end of their two-year visa. 
</P>
<P>
	But as INS reviewed the mushrooming number of deals in late  
1997, outside experts and the agency's lawyers concluded that the 
immigrants associated with AIS and similar companies never paid as 
much as required. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, what they were trying to do was create some voodoo  
economics to give the appearance of making the investments when 
those investments were not being made,'' said Russ Bergeron, an INS 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	AIS was criticized by both the INS and the immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
	William Cook, who was general counsel to the INS when the  
program was adopted and is now a lawyer representing AIS, defended 
the financial arrangements as acceptable in thousands of earlier 
immigration cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (INS officials) simply made the changes in secret and  
started to apply them retroactively,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The immigrants contend the extra INS scrutiny and requests for  
documentation effectively changed the rules secretly because they 
were not published in the Federal Register. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if new rules are approved to prevent deals that AIS  
arranged, the changes can't be applied retroactively to people who 
already invested their money and are living in the country, the 
suit contends. 
</P>
<P>
	``This lawsuit is our attempt to rein in a lawless agency,''  
said Ira Kurzban, a Miami lawyer who filed the case with Marc Van 
Der Hout of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS granted conditional visas to immigrants after examining  
their financial plans, which included promissory notes. But the 
immigrants claim not all applicants were treated equally. 
</P>
<P>
	Yi Yuan Chiang of San Francisco is one of 26 partners in C&AMP;W  
Hotel Ltd. Partnership, a Maryland group that assisted the 
expansion of K-Bob Steakhouse restaurants in Texas and New Mexico. 
Although 21 of the partners are already permanent residents, he is 
not because of the dispute about the $1 million investment he says 
he made. 
</P>
<P>
	INS officials declined comment on specifics of the lawsuit. But  
they criticized the arrangements of AIS and similar investment 
firms for failing to document that the money went to the companies 
intended.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Gov., Tribes Discuss Casinos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis met with  
representatives of 25 California tribes Wednesday to discuss a 
possible interim agreement that would keep tribal casinos open 
until voters weigh in on the subject again. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting came two days after the state Supreme Court struck  
down a voter-approved initiative that sought to expand legalized 
gambling at tribal casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribes have until early October to reach an agreement with  
Davis to avoid having thousands of video slot machines shut down by 
federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday the justices ruled that Proposition 5 is invalid  
because it would let tribes operate video slot machines and other 
Nevada-style games banned by the state constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' discussions Wednesday included the possibility of an  
agreement that would give legal standing to tribes now operating 
casinos until a constitutional amendment that would permit the 
gambling goes to voters, Davis spokesman Michael Bustamante said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis and tribal officials also discussed proposed language for  
a constitutional amendment that would be more restrictive than 
Proposition 5, Bustamante said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Proposition 5 allowed for a significant expansion of gaming,''  
Bustamante said. ``Perhaps a modest expansion of gaming might be in 
order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An initiative tribes are now circulating for the March ballot  
proposes an amendment less restrictive than the one Davis discussed 
Wednesday. It would establish the same liberal rules allowing 
Nevada-style gambling at Indian-run casinos that Proposition 5 
would have created. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Macarro, chairman for the Pechanga Indian Reservation in  
Temecula, south of Riverside in Southern California, said his tribe 
will consider both proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any option that preserves our ability to continue on a  
status-quo basis has to be considered,'' Macarro said. ``We need to 
preserve the level of employment we have now and the level of 
tribal services we have right now.''

<HEADLINE> Campbell Soup Revamping Labels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Campbell Soup Co. is tampering with an  
American icon: the red-and-white soup label made famous by pop 
artist Andy Warhol. 
</P>
<P>
	The company says it's the most significant change in its history  
and will include 70 varieties in its condensed soup line. The new 
label has a photograph of a bowl of soup at the center, a recipe on 
the back and a colored banner to distinguish the soup category. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1898, Campbell has only made 14 minor changes to the  
red-and-white label. The last change was made for select varieties 
in 1994 to mark the company's 125th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	``The design is much loved and very familiar to Americans, but  
we felt there was a wonderful opportunity to update it and refresh 
it,'' said Lisa Zakrajsek, vice president of the company's U.S. 
Soup division. 
</P>
<P>
	The Camden-based food maker will formally unveil the redesigned  
label Thursday in Pittsburgh, where a symbolic replica of the last 
can of condensed tomato soup bearing the old label will be inducted 
into the Andy Warhol Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Warhol made the Campbell cans famous with more than 100  
portraits and paintings showing the red-and-white label. Warhol, 
who died in 1987, began painting the soup cans in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	The familiar traditional red-and-white soup labels that have  
lined supermarket shelves for more than a century will begin 
disappearing by mid-September. The average consumer, however, may 
not notice the seemingly subtle changes to the world famous cans. 
</P>
<P>
	The new label resembles changes Campbell made in 1994, but back  
then the company excluded its three biggest sellers from the new 
look: Tomato, Chicken Noodle and Cream of mushroom. This time, the 
change will include the entire classic red-and-white soup line. 
</P>
<P>
	The red-and-white Campbell label made its debut in 1898, a year  
after the company began producing condensed soups in Camden. In 
1900, the company added a graphic touting its Gold Medallion award 
for excellence. Slight changes in lettering were also made in 1905 
and 1993 
</P>
<P>
	Zakrajsek admits it may be risky for Campbell to alter its world  
famous label. The company believes the new label, however, will 
make it easier for consumers to find their favorite variety on 
store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	Cans bearing the new look on some varieties of soup are already  
appearing on supermarket shelves. The banners identify categories 
such as Fun Favorites and 98% Fat Free. 
</P>
<P>
	``Campbell Soup has been around a very long time,'' Zakrajsek  
said in an interview last week. ``We want to stay fresh and 
contemporary. Our intent was not to tamper with, but rather enhance 
the very powerful label that it is today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Campbell name is smaller on the new label and a gold  
medallion that had been in the center of the can is higher. While 
still red-and-white, the label now has a slightly brighter shade of 
red. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still Campbell Soup,'' Zakrajsek said.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, Campbell has tried various marketing strategies.  
Once it put its ``M'm M'm Good'' advertising slogan on the back 
burner to use a less catchy campaign theme, ``Never Underestimate 
the Power of Soup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell ranks sixth among U.S. food companies and controls 80  
percent of the U.S. market for condensed soups. Campbell also sells 
food under its Prego, V-8 juices, Godiva chocolate, Pace and 
Pepperidge Farms brands.

<HEADLINE> Few Use Deal Cash to Combat Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Federal health officials say few states have  
committed money from settlements with big tobacco companies to fund 
anti-smoking programs, even though research shows these measures 
help cut smoking rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Only six states have used major amounts of tobacco settlement  
money for anti-tobacco measures, said Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, director 
of the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sad fact remains that most states have not earmarked  
significant settlement funds for tobacco control, and no state is 
currently implementing all of the recommended program components 
fully,'' he said. ``Let me be clear, this is a decision to be made 
by state policymakers, but I urge you to give them the best 
education possible about measures proven effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koplan spoke Tuesday while presenting a CDC report on smoking at  
the National Conference on Tobacco and Health in Kissimmee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC recommends that each state spend $31 million to $83  
million a year on health and anti-smoking programs from tobacco 
settlements, which include last year's 46-state settlement that 
totaled $206 billion. Four other states settled separately for a 
combined $46 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are saying is that from what we've found in our own  
experience and in the shared experience, here is what works,'' 
Koplan said. ``And we're saying here's the amount that will pay for 
it. It's the same approach we take with immunization against 
disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	States that have funded tobacco control measures are Hawaii,  
Maryland, Minnesota, Vermont, New Jersey and Washington, according 
to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. Funding ranges from $18.9 
million in Vermont to $100 million in Washington, the anti-smoking 
group said. Minnesota settled on its own in 1998 for $6.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC backs its recommendations with numbers from states such  
as California, which had the country's second lowest adult smoking 
rate in 1997 at 18.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC attributed the drop to the nation's oldest anti-smoking  
initiative, which began in 1989 and raised tobacco taxes to fund 
health and environmental programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a very varied and multiethnic population ... but they  
had the foresight to provide the resources for an aggressive 
tobacco control campaign, and it worked,'' Koplan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon's cigarette consumption rate decreased 11.3 percent from  
1996 to 1998. Voters there approved an anti-smoking campaign 
similar to California's in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	And Massachusetts voters approved higher tobacco taxes and an  
aggressive anti-smoking media campaign in 1993. The state's 
consumption rate dropped 20 percent from 1992 to 1996, the CDC 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah, with its large Mormon population, had the lowest smoking  
rate among adults, 13.7 percent, in 1997. The state has had the 
lowest rate in each of the last three reports issued by the CDC. It 
also had the lowest youth smoking rate in 1997 at 16.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco-producing Kentucky had the highest adult rate at 30.8  
percent, up from 27.8 percent in 1995. Kentucky's youth smoking 
rate also is the highest in the country, with 47 percent of 
students in grades 9-12 saying they had smoked in the previous 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Barkley, project manager for the tobacco-control coalition  
Kentucky Action, said the state has provided no funding for tobacco 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of Kentucky farms grow tobacco, making it the  
nation's most tobacco-dependent state, according to the Federal 
Reserve Bank. In 1996, the state produced 27 percent of the 
country's tobacco, second only to North Carolina at 38 percent. 
That state's adult smoking rate was 25.8 percent, down from 26.0 in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers are willing to fight youth smoking, but won't stand for  
state funding to combat adult smoking, said Danny McKinney, head of 
the Kentucky Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative.

<HEADLINE> Centenarian Celebrates Activism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Born just before the start of the 20th century,  
Georgianna Turner is as fabulously feisty as ever on the eve of the 
21st. 
</P>
<P>
	In between came a journey by ship north from her home in Jamaica  
and four decades of fighting to improve the once-dangerous corner 
of Brooklyn where she made her home. 
</P>
<P>
	Elegant in a long purple dress, her bobbed gray hair  
meticulously coiffed, Mrs. Turner recently celebrated a well-lived 
century with memories, music and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``My secret to long life? Love,'' she said softly. ``Love  
everybody. Try to help the less fortunate. ... Try to help the 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a century, Mrs. Turner has lived by those words. Friends and  
neighbors on her block in the Fort Greene neighborhood cherish her 
stubborn devotion to the neighborhood, her strong spirit and her 
habit of looking out for those who need a hand. 
</P>
<P>
	She spent decades to make life in Fort Greene a little better  
and ignored those who thought the neighborhood wasn't worth 
fighting for. 
</P>
<P>
	For hours every night, she would sit at the window of her old  
brownstone home watching the street, calling police to report drug 
dealers and others who menaced passersby. Vandals knocked in her 
door and windows, but she kept on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to make it into a decent community, with decent  
people and a clean community,'' she recalled. ``I think everybody 
respects me in the neighborhood, because I worked very hard, put my 
life in danger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before ``quality of life'' became a political catch phrase, Mrs.  
Turner made countless phone calls to city agencies and lawmakers 
and spent hours at block meetings working to keep trucks out of the 
neighborhood, loiterers off the street and police officers walking 
their beats. 
</P>
<P>
	She visited neighbors who appeared to be in trouble, offering to  
help however she could. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole neighborhood was awful,'' she said. ``The garbage  
wasn't picked up, the police were lazy. I got them working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her efforts paid off. Fort Greene is now cleaner and safer than  
ever. Property values are up and people are moving in. 
</P>
<P>
	About 75 friends gathered Aug. 18 to honor Mrs. Turner and share  
memories of her impressive life. She leaned on a cane as she 
walked, but she stood straight and appeared strong despite breaking 
a hip last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Georgianna Turner gives old age new meaning,'' said her  
grand-niece, Michelle Hodges, 49. ``Turning 100 is a marvel, but to 
still have an able mind and body, a sense of humor and a 
willingness to learn new things, as Aunt Georgie does, is truly 
remarkable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Turner, who worked as a dressmaker and a beautician until  
retiring in 1961, outlived three husbands and never had children. 
But there was no shortage of well-wishers to celebrate at her new 
home in an assisted-living center. 
</P>
<P>
	She was overcome with emotion and dabbed at her eyes with a  
handkerchief, but happily accepted kisses and birthday wishes from 
dozens of friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Hairstylist Sylvia Williams recalled the first time the  
well-turned-out Mrs. Turner walked into her salon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `So this is the famous Mrs. Turner,''' she remembered.  
``To see somebody at her age doing those kinds of things, it makes 
you embarrassed that you're not doing more things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others remembered Mrs. Turner's devotion to her Catholic church,  
her penchant for wide-brimmed hats and her always-elegant 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``She always looked so beautiful, with her pretty, big hats,  
we'd always chat on our way in or out of church,'' Margaret Vincent 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Turner, born in 1899, the youngest and now only surviving  
of 16 children, left her native Jamaica with a sister and a niece 
in 1915 for a five-day ship journey to Ellis Island. In 1958, she 
moved into her brownstone on South Oxford Street in Fort Greene. 
</P>
<P>
	She left her home recently, only because it had become too  
difficult to get around on her own. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes Mrs. Turner proudest in a century of living?  
</P>
<P>
	After all these years, she sighed, ``Just lasting.''

<HEADLINE>  United 3, Fusion 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jaime Moreno assisted on three first-half  
goals as D.C. United overcame a wet field to beat the Miami Fusion 
3-1 Wednesday night for its sixth straight Major League Soccer 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Olsen, John Maessner and Geoff Aunger scored for D.C., which  
swept the four-game season series from Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	United increased its lead over second-place Columbus in the  
Eastern Conference to nine points and prevented the Fusion from 
moving past idle Tampa Bay into third place. 
</P>
<P>
	Welton scored for the Fusion, which has dropped two in a row.  
Henry Gutierrez had his 13th assist, a Miami season record. 
</P>
<P>
	Four players were ejected when the team's played last Saturday  
and were suspended for Wednesday night's game. Miami was without 
defenders Leo Cullen and Jay Heaps and midfielder Nelson Vargas and 
D.C. played without striker Roy Lassiter, whose 16 goals and 40 
points are tied for the league lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami, which had allowed only eight goals in 10 games and only  
five all season in the opening 10 minutes, surrendered two before 
the game was nine minutes old. 
</P>
<P>
	Olsen tucked a header beneath the crossbar in the third minute,  
and six minutes later Maessner banged in a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	Welton snuck past two United defenders to cut the lead to 2-1 in  
the 23rd minute, but Aunger's long right-footed shot restored the 
two-goal advantage about three minutes before halftime.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jaime Moreno assisted on three first-half  
goals as D.C. United overcame a wet field to beat the Miami Fusion 
3-1 Wednesday night for its sixth straight Major League Soccer 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Olsen, John Maessner and Geoff Aunger scored for D.C., which  
swept the four-game season series from Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	United increased its lead over second-place Columbus in the  
Eastern Conference to nine points and prevented the Fusion from 
moving past idle Tampa Bay into third place. 
</P>
<P>
	Welton scored for the Fusion, which has dropped two in a row.  
Henry Gutierrez had his 13th assist, a Miami season record. 
</P>
<P>
	Four players were ejected when the team's played last Saturday  
and were suspended for Wednesday night's game. Miami was without 
defenders Leo Cullen and Jay Heaps and midfielder Nelson Vargas and 
D.C. played without striker Roy Lassiter, whose 16 goals and 40 
points are tied for the league lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami, which had allowed only eight goals in 10 games and only  
five all season in the opening 10 minutes, surrendered two before 
the game was nine minutes old. 
</P>
<P>
	Olsen tucked a header beneath the crossbar in the third minute,  
and six minutes later Maessner banged in a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	Welton snuck past two United defenders to cut the lead to 2-1 in  
the 23rd minute, but Aunger's long right-footed shot restored the 
two-goal advantage about three minutes before halftime.

	Airline Workers Held in Drug Probe  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Dozens of American Airlines employees and contract  
workers were arrested and charged today in a drug ring that 
investigators said smuggled cocaine and marijuana into the United 
States by hiding the stuff in food carts, garbage bags and carry-on 
luggage. Fifty-eight people were named in multiple indictments 
resulting from Operation Sky Chef and Operation Ramp Rat, including 
30 American employees. By early afternoon, at least 48 people had 
been arrested at their homes and a few caught at the airport. The 
people indicted were mainly ramp workers and baggage handlers.

	White House Renews Tax Cut Attack  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Renewing its attack on the Republican tax cut  
plan, the White House contended today the proposal would result in 
nearly $100 billion in cuts to essential federal programs over the 
next five years, with Medicare and farm programs among the hardest 
hit. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill, and Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott, wrote to Clinton last week that the estimated 
budget surplus is more than enough to cut taxes, save Social 
Security and Medicare and ensure adequate levels of government 
spending.

	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Stung by criticism of his government's  
response to last week's earthquake, Turkey's Prime Minister Bulent 
Ecevit lashed out at ``demoralizing'' media coverage today and 
called for national unity in the face of the catastrophe. The 
government also blamed fluctuations in the death toll on local 
officials in the town of Izmit, saying they had inflated their body 
count to get more quake aid. The mayor of Izmit said it was simple 
human error with no ulterior motive. The death toll jumped 
yesterday to more than 18,000, but the government today changed it 
back to 12,514.

	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Acting on a tip from the U.N. war  
crimes tribunal, Austrian police arrested the top Bosnian Serb 
military commander today as he visited Vienna -- unaware that he had 
been secretly indicted for crimes against humanity. The arrest of 
Gen. Momir Talic, the Bosnian Serbs' military chief of staff, 
sparked an immediate outcry from Serbs. U.S. diplomats warned 
American citizens to avoid traveling in the Serb-held part of 
Bosnia for fear of retribution.

hurricane watch covers the Turks, Caicos and other Bahama islands -- 
including Bimini, just 55 miles from Florida. ``Residents along the 
entire southeastern United States coast should closely monitor the 
progress of this system,'' said hurricane specialist Jack Beven of 
the hurricane center.

	Mozart-Smart Theory Challenged  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Mozart sonata may lift the soul, but it won't  
make listeners any smarter, according to two studies that challenge 
previous research about the effect of music on intelligence. The 
latest results call into question 1993 research that showed college 
students temporarily gained up to nine IQ points after listening to 
Mozart. ``Listening to classical music is probably good for kids -- 
good for reasons other than it's going to make them smarter,'' said 
Harvard Medical School researcher Christopher Chabris, who analyzed 
16 previous studies and published his findings in tomorrow's issue 
of the journal Nature.

	Durable Goods Orders Up 3.3 Percent

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods  
vaulted ahead in July, and sales of existing homes, though pinched 
by rising mortgage rates, still managed to post the third best 
month ever. Economists said the two reports, released today, 
reflect a still-booming economy. The Commerce Department reported 
that orders for durable goods rose 3.3 percent last month to a 
seasonally adjusted $204 billion. The National Association of 
Realtors reported that sales of existing single-family homes 
declined 3.9 percent in July.

	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Sprinter Marion Jones, bidding for three  
gold medals at the World Championships, pulled up with an injury 
during the semifinals of the 200 meters today and was carried off 
on a stretcher. Jones, who won the 100 meters on Sunday, clutched 
her lower back about halfway through the race and fell to the track 
in agony. Jones was the heavy favorite in the event in her try for 
a 100-200 double. Jones has said she will attempt to win five gold 
medals at next year's Sydney Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Bankrupt Pager Company Pulls Plug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Greenville-based Conxus Communications has  
sent a message to more than 80,000 paging customers they didn't 
want to get: Your service is being cut off. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, in bankruptcy since May, told customers that as of  
5 p.m. EDT Friday their cutting edge, voice-mail pagers will go 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pocketalk service was available in Dallas, Fort Worth,  
Texas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Philadelphia, New York, 
Washington, Atlanta, Houston, Chicago and parts of south Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	No other companies have voice paging services that work with the  
Motorola system Conxus used, Motorola spokesman Ken Countess said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phones at Conxus' headquarters were answered Wednesday by an  
automated system with no opportunity to leave a message. Callers to 
Conxus' customer-service line got only the message, ``Conxus 
Communications, the network provider for Pocketalk and Pocketext, 
will cease operations effective Friday, Aug. 27, at 5 p.m. We 
regret this outcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Customers were told to seek help from the retailers where they  
bought the pagers that generally cost less than $50, with six-month 
service contracts from $9.95 to $19.95 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Pocketalk stumbled from the start, said Kevin Condon, an  
industry analyst at Warburg Dillon Read in New York. ``We never 
thought there would be much of a market for voice paging. ... The 
guy sitting next to you can hear what the message is,'' Condon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also too many other competing technologies, said  
analyst Bruce Kasrel at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the kind of stuff that fails all the time,'' Kasrel  
said. ``People will put in the drawer with the Newton'' handheld 
computer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conxus was founded by Cecil Duffie and Bill deKay, former  
executives of Greenville-based Dial Page Inc. Duffie is the Conxus' 
vice chairman and chief executive and deKay its president. 
</P>
<P>
	DeKay also was a board member of the American Mobile  
Telecommunications Association in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a fly-by-night group that tried to take advantage  
of any situation,'' association President Alan Shark said. DeKay 
``worked 18 hours a day trying to keep that company going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's little solace to people like Dennis Daily, one of the  
company's Los Angeles customers. The recently laid-off longtime UPI 
radio employee told the Los Angeles Times he sent out more than 200 
resumes listing his Pocketalk phone number for potential employers 
to call. 
</P>
<P>
	``I labored over that resume, and now I have no idea what my 888  
number is going to say come the end of Friday,'' he said. ``Is it 
going to make me look like I can't pay my bills?''

<HEADLINE> Campbell Soup Revamping Labels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- At Campbell Soup Co., what goes on a can is  
almost as important as the soup inside, so the food maker has spent 
two years revamping its red-and-white label. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1898, Campbell has made only 14 minor changes to the  
red-and-white label on its condensed soup line. The last change was 
made for select varieties in 1994 to mark the company's 125th 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the company is making what it says is the most significant  
change in its history to the label popularized by pop artist Andy 
Warhol in the 60s. It will include all 70 varieties in Campbell's 
core business of condensed soups. 
</P>
<P>
	The Camden-based food maker will formally unveil the redesigned  
label today in Pittsburgh, where a symbolic replica of the last can 
of condensed tomato soup bearing the old label will be inducted 
into the Andy Warhol Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``The design is much loved and very familiar to Americans, but  
we felt there was a wonderful opportunity to update it and refresh 
it,'' said Lisa Zakrajsek, vice president of the company's U.S. 
Soup division. 
</P>
<P>
	The new label has a photograph of a bowl of soup at the center,  
a recipe on the back and a colored banner to distinguish the soup 
category. The Campbell name is smaller on the new label and a gold 
medallion that had been in the center of the can is higher. While 
still red-and-white, the label now has a slightly brighter shade of 
red. 
</P>
<P>
	Zakrajsek said a team of designers and managers began working  
two years ago ``Project Renaissance.'' They presented about 20 to 
30 different labels to consumer focus groups before making a final 
selection and fine-tuning it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's a beautiful label,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The red-and-white Campbell label made its debut in 1898, a year  
after the company began producing condensed soups in Camden. In 
1900, the company added a graphic touting its Gold Medallion award 
for excellence. Slight changes in lettering were also made in 1905 
and 1993 
</P>
<P>
	Warhol made the Campbell cans world famous with more than 100  
portraits and paintings showing the red-and-white label. Warhol, 
who died in 1987, began painting the soup cans in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomas Sokolowski, director of the Warhol museum, said the artist  
likely would have approved of the attempt by Campbell to update the 
soup label. The Tomato Soup label has not been altered since 1942. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing that Warhol understood was that change was  
necessary and his art changed immensely,'' Sokolowski said 
Wednesday. ``Who knows? May be this label will last for a hundred 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zakrajsek admits it may be risky for Campbell to alter its world  
famous label. The company believes the new label, however, will 
make it easier for consumers to find their favorite variety on 
store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	Cans bearing the new look on some varieties of soup are already  
appearing on supermarket shelves. The banners identify categories 
such as Fun Favorites and 98 percent Fat Free. 
</P>
<P>
	The familiar traditional red-and-white soup labels that have  
lined supermarket shelves for more than a century will begin 
disappearing by mid-September. The average consumer, however, may 
not notice the seemingly subtle changes to the world famous cans. 
</P>
<P>
	The new label resembles changes Campbell made in 1994, but back  
then the company excluded its three biggest sellers from the new 
look: Tomato, Chicken Noodle and Cream of mushroom. This time, the 
change will include the entire classic red-and-white soup line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still Campbell Soup,'' Zakrajsek said.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, Campbell has tried various marketing strategies.  
Once it put its ``M'm M'm Good'' advertising slogan on the back 
burner to use a less catchy campaign theme, ``Never Underestimate 
the Power of Soup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell ranks sixth among U.S. food companies and controls 80  
percent of the U.S. market for condensed soups. Campbell also sells 
food under its Prego, V-8 juices, Godiva chocolate, Pace and 
Pepperidge Farms brands.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Explodes Near Taliban HQ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- A powerful truck bomb exploded near  
the home of the leader of Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement, 
killing seven people, including three bodyguards, Taliban officials 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion, shortly after 10 p.m. Tuesday in southern  
Kandahar, slightly damaged Mullah Mohammed Omar's compound, but he 
had left earlier in the evening and was unharmed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast shattered windows and doors and sent frightened  
residents scurrying for cover. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck was parked three houses away from Omar's home, said  
Taliban spokesman Abdul Hai Muttmain, who was contacted on 
satellite telephone in Kandahar. 
</P>
<P>
	Omar -- who has two wives, several children and a missing eye he  
lost while fighting invading Russian soldiers in the 1980s -- leads 
the Taliban with an iron hand. He belongs to Afghanistan's majority 
ethnic group, the Pathans, and follows one of the strictest forms 
of Islamic law in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Omar's home in Kandahar is a walled compound, the front door  
flanked by two green minaret-styled pillars. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no way to independently confirm Omar's whereabouts. He  
had not been seen publicly since the blast, but he is reclusive and 
rarely makes public appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	No one took responsibility for the explosion.  
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban religious army, which rules 90 percent of  
Afghanistan, is fighting an opposition alliance that has been 
restricted to northern Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's truck bomb was the first attack on the Taliban in  
their stronghold of Kandahar, hundreds of miles from the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Muttmain said the Taliban, who have been under pressure from the  
United States to hand over accused terrorist Osama bin Laden, 
suspect the United States was involved in the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the United States fired Tomahawk cruise missiles on  
eastern Afghanistan, where Washington believed bin Laden was 
running training camps for his terrorist network. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has accused bin Laden of masterminding the  
devastating bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa on Aug. 
7, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban have refused to hand over bin Laden, saying he is a  
guest in Afghanistan, which does not have an extradition treaty 
with the United States. The Taliban also are demanding proof of his 
involvement in terrorist activity. 
</P>
<P>
	That a truck bomb was able to breach Taliban's defenses was not  
a concern, said Muttmain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our security is good ... but we have enemies, and anywhere  
these things can happen,'' he said. It wasn't clear whether 
additional security was being arranged. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of an Islamic militant group in neighboring Pakistan,  
Harakat-ul-Mujahedeen, also blamed the bombing on Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bombing was the worst kind of terrorism and the United  
States was responsible,'' the independent News Network 
International quoted Harakat leader Fazl-e-Rehman Khalil as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Another militant group in Pakistan, Lashkar-e-Tayyaba, condemned  
the bombing, saying ``such incidents are not going to suppress or 
curb Islamic movements.''

<HEADLINE> Why Did Fed Raise Interest Rates? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a  
quarter percentage point for the second time in two months in a bid 
to slow the economy and contain inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are some questions and answers about the Fed's action on  
Tuesday and what impact it might have on the economy and consumers: 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What did the Fed do?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The policy-making arm of the nation's central bank, led by  
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, raised the suggested ``federal funds'' 
rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans from 5 
percent to 5.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed officials also raised the ``discount rate'' it charges on  
direct loans to banks from 4.5 percent to 4.75 percent, the first 
increase in that rate since Feb. 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The boost in rates, which was widely expected, followed a  
quarter percentage point increase in the fed funds rate on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: How much and how soon will higher interest rates affect  
consumers? 
</P>
<P>
	A: The impact of a Fed rate hike is usually immediate, but not  
that drastic since they come in small quarter-point increments. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks, paying more to borrow from the Fed and other banks, will  
quickly make up for their increased expenses by charging businesses 
and consumers more to borrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The interest charged on many types of consumer borrowing --  
including variable-rate mortgages, auto loans and credit card debt 
-- are tied to the prime rate or directly to the federal funds rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime rate was raised to 8.25 percent from 8 percent,  
effective today, by major banks nationwide. The prime is the base 
upon which banks compute loans to business customers. The best 
customers may pay less than the prime rate. Riskier ventures will 
pay a higher rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Savers may benefit from higher rates because banks and other  
financial institutions will pay more interest on deposits in 
various types of accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Weren't interest rates already rising?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Yes. Mortgage rates climbed above 8 percent earlier this  
summer, a two-year high, in part because of expectations that the 
Fed would tighten credit further. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, however, higher mortgage rates haven't dampened home  
sales or housing construction that much. In fact, many consumers 
may be house hunting now out of concerns that mortgage rates will 
push even higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Home sales are a key economic force, driving demand for building  
supplies, appliances and home furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Why the sudden push to raise interest rates?  
</P>
<P>
	The two rate hikes, the first in more than two years, are  
designed to ripple through the economy, slowing the pace of 
borrowing and spending among banks, businesses and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	While everyone likes a strong economy, there is a potential  
downside: 
</P>
<P>
	If consumer confidence is too high, it may become hard for  
factories and service providers to keep up with demand. And if jobs 
are plentiful, workers bargain for better wages. Companies faced by 
product shortages or lost sales may boost prices so they can hire 
more workers and pay higher wages. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Is that's what's happening now?  
</P>
<P>
	A: So far, inflation has remained surprisingly tame, with  
consumer prices rising just 0.3 percent in July and at a 2.4 
percent rate for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	But inflationary pressures persist with unemployment near a  
three-decade low and the economy growing at a brisk 4 percent pace 
for the year. Hoping to keep those pressures from boiling over, the 
Fed boosted rates in June and again on Tuesday as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: How will higher rates slow the economy?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Increased borrowing costs may discourage some businesses from  
investing in expansion, buying new equipment or hiring workers. 
Consumers, worried about higher lending rates and a weaker job 
market, may slow their spending on clothes and travel or postpone 
major purchases like cars, homes and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What if higher interest rates smother the economy, causing a  
recession? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Fed policy is a work in progress. Last fall, the central bank  
cut rates three times to reinvigorate the economy, bolstering 
confidence among lenders and borrowers fearful of a global 
financial crisis. If the economy slows too much, the Fed could 
switch course and start cutting rates again. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What's next?  
</P>
<P>
	A: In announcing Tuesday's action, the Fed maintained a neutral  
stance on future interest rate decisions, expressing confidence in 
the economic outlook. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the Fed said that its actions on Tuesday and  
June 30 should ``markedly diminish the risk of rising inflation 
going forward.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Wants More Picketing Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presidential hopeful Bill Bradley endorsed  
stronger picketing rights for construction unions and other 
labor-friendly proposals Wednesday in an attempt to siphon blocs of 
Democrats from Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator earned several standing ovations  
from a crowd of 900 and chants of ``Brad-lee'' as he left the 
convention of the International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied 
Trades. 
</P>
<P>
	The painters union planned a straw poll on presidential  
candidates and several members predicted Bradley will top Gore, who 
is on vacation and declined an invitation to speak at the 
convention. But Bradley still has much work ahead of him in 
chipping away at Gore's labor support for the Democratic 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the straw poll will be forwarded to the AFL-CIO,  
which will weigh an endorsement in October and is widely expected 
to back Gore. Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said Bradley won a 
small victory in beating back plans for an early AFL-CIO 
endorsement of Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign released a list of 19 unions and union locals  
that have endorsed the vice president. The painters union, with 
130,000 members, is one of 72 unions within the 13-million-member 
AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Trumka, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO, told  
reporters that Gore has done ``a tremendous job on worker issues.'' 
But he said Bradley's was one of the best speeches he has heard, 
and that Gore made a mistake by not showing up. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley pleased the crowd by agreeing restrictions should be  
loosened on picketing at multiple-employer construction job sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Under rules established by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1951, union  
members picketing a construction site can assemble only at a 
designated entrance for their members, leaving a ``neutral'' 
entrance for use by members of other unions. 
</P>
<P>
	Building trades unions have long sought to change the law, which  
restricts their ability to act against a specific employer at a job 
site, said Fred Kotler, associate director of the construction 
industry program at Cornell University. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress revisited the issue in the 1970s, but the rules were  
left unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley also endorsed withholding government contracts from  
companies that violate labor laws and increasing damages against 
companies that fire an employee illegally for organizing a union. 
He also backed a higher minimum wage without being specific. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was asked whether, as president, he would seek  
legislation loosening the picketing rules, he was ready with a 
one-word response. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' he said, and the members rose to give him an ovation.

<HEADLINE> Krivokrasov Agrees To Counseling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Nashville Predators all-star forward  
Sergei Krivokrasov must undergo counseling as part of an agreement 
for dismissal of a domestic violence charge brought by his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge stemmed from disagreement Aug. 8 at the couple's home  
in New Buffalo, Mich. In a police report, Natalia Krivokrasov said 
that following an argument her husband kicked and slapped her, 
pulled out a handful of her hair and pushed her down three steps. 
</P>
<P>
	Krivokrasov, 25, pleaded innocent and was scheduled for trial  
Thursday at Berrien County Trial Court in Michigan. He faced a 
93-day jail sentence if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was reached Tuesday at a pretrial hearing, Berrien  
County prosecutor James Cherry said. The case will be reviewed in 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he gets counseling, has no further incidents and everything  
seems to be on the up and up ... then the matter will be 
dismissed,'' Cherry said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Krivokrasov's agent, Mike Gillis, said his client will submit to  
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	``He and his wife regret the events of that evening and are  
actively working at reconciling their differences,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Predators general manager David Poile said that in compliance  
with NHL policy, Krivokrasov will meet with league officials to 
assess his counseling needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Poile said the team does not plan any disciplinary action  
against Krivokrasov, the Predators' leading goal-scorer last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We obviously don't condone the activity, but we do support the  
Krivokrasovs and we do hope and pray that their problems can be 
worked out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Krivokrasov had 25 goals and 23 assists during Nashville's  
inaugural season. His 48 points were third-best on the squad and 
earned him a one-year contract worth $850,000, which he signed last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-10, 185-pound Krivokrasov led the team with six  
game-winning goals and 10 power-play goals, and was the only 
Predator selected for the NHL All-Star game.

<HEADLINE> Fed Boosts Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- By nudging up interest rates for the second  
time this summer, the Federal Reserve signaled that it may stay on 
the sidelines if there are no new signs of inflation or an 
overheated economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But some economists wonder: Is the Fed through with just two?  
</P>
<P>
	The answer lies with what new economic data tells central  
bankers about the pace of economic growth, which has been brisk, 
and the prospects for inflation down the road, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Fed boosted two rates by a quarter point, saying  
its actions ``should markedly diminish the risk of rising inflation 
going forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors hoped that language means the Fed will stop with just  
two rate hikes. Some analysts said it reduces the odds of another 
increase this fall. But others believe a third rate hike could be 
in the offing this year, possibly as early as the Fed's next 
meeting on Oct. 5, if signs of inflation crop up. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed could easily pull the trigger again,'' said Paul  
Kasriel, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Sinai, chief economist at Primark Global Economics, also  
thinks there could be a third rate hike, possibly in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the economy will continue to do quite well and higher  
inflation on average will appear and push the Fed into one more 
dose of tightening this year, but it is a close call,'' said Sinai. 
</P>
<P>
	High on Fed chairman Alan Greenspan's radar screen is whether  
the tight labor market could eventually spark inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	With the nation's unemployment rate down to its lowest level in  
three decades, employers foraging for workers are wooing them with 
higher wages and benefits. While that's good news for workers, it's 
worrisome to the Fed because those increased costs could drive up 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, even though the economy has slowed in recent months,  
it is still expected to grow almost 4 percent this year, a robust 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts suggested that central bankers will wait to see  
whether the economy slows on its own. ``I think they will move to 
the sidelines'' and evaluate whether their actions are sufficient 
to cool off growth, said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. 
Lanston &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Fed increased its target for the federal funds  
rate, the interest that banks charge on overnight loans, by a 
quarter point to 5.25 percent. The rate had been boosted -- by the 
same amount -- for the first time in two years on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	That triggered a quick quarter-point increase to 8.25 percent by  
commercial banks in their prime lending rate, the benchmark rate 
for millions of consumer and business loans, ranging from home 
equity loans to some credit card debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's goal is to raise rates that it directly controls and  
thus influence those set by financial markets, such as 30-year 
mortgage rates, to slow economic activity in such 
interest-sensitive sectors of the economy as auto and home sales. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the Fed raised its largely symbolic discount  
rate, the interest it charges on direct loans to banks, by a 
quarter point to 4.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank left its policy directive, intended to signal  
future moves, at neutral. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said this doesn't mean much because the Fed had also  
moved to a neutral stance after its last meeting on June 30, a 
change that did not stop the central bank from raising rates this 
time around. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed critics said they were unhappy that the central bank felt  
the need to raise interest rates at all, given that consumer-level 
inflation is low, having risen at a moderate annual rate of 2.4 
percent in the first seven months this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Federal Reserve continues to allow their inordinate fear  
of inflation to put America's strong economy in jeopardy,'' said 
Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.

<HEADLINE> MetLife Said Near Deal With Insurer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. reportedly is  
close to announcing a deal to acquire troubled General American 
Life Insurance Co., in a deal that could be worth $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	MetLife's board already has approved a preliminary plan for the  
deal, Dow Jones News reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Larance, a spokesman for St. Louis-based General American  
said he could not comment on the report. But he said General 
American's board of directors was meeting Wednesday night to 
consider offers and proposals and that an announcement could come 
as early as Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to say who was interested, how many offers had been  
made or possible financial terms. He also declined to say if 
MetLife was among the suitors. 
</P>
<P>
	A half-dozen companies have expressed an interest in buying  
General American since the company announced it was seeking a 
partner several weeks ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no secret we have been negotiating with several  
companies,'' Larance added. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach MetLife officials after business hours were  
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale could include General American's majority stakes in  
publicly traded Reinsurance Group of America, a provider of 
reinsurance, and Conning Corp., an asset manager, Dow Jones 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	General American earlier this month turned to regulators to help  
it pay back $6.8 billion in customers' deposits. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, it has been under administrative supervision of  
Missouri insurance regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would require the approval of regulators in both New  
York and Missouri.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the yen early Thursday,  
while Japanese stocks rose moderately following another record 
close on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 111.18 yen, down 0.14 yen from late Wednesday  
in Tokyo but higher than its late New York level of 111.14 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 46.08  
points, or 0.26 percent, to 17,901.24 in the first 30 minutes of 
trading. On Wednesday, the average closed down 240.25 points, or 
1.33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar was slightly higher from its  
New York level after a rally in U.S. Treasury bonds and the robust 
showing Wednesday on Wall Street attracted investor interest in the 
greenback. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the dollar may remain in a tight range the rest of  
Thursday trading as enthusiasm among overseas investments funds for 
Japanese stocks will continue, thus curbing the dollar's rise. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 115.90 yen, down  
from 116.84 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices rose after posting steep falls in  
the past two sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	High-tech issues were leading the market in early morning  
trading following strong gains by technology issues on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average  
finished at a record high 11,326.04 points, up 42.74, or 0.4 
percent. U.S. stocks shot up as investors expressed confidence that 
the American economy can continue to grow without runaway 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 1.74 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,496.54. The 
TOPIX closed down 12.27 points, or 0.81 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 2.0400 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.9950 percent, 
driving its price down to 98.83 yen from 99.20 yen.

<HEADLINE> Alternative Stock Exchanges Are In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Forget the image of the pinstriped Wall Street  
broker hustling across the crowded floor of the New York Stock 
Exchange. Replace it with an image of rows of quietly humming 
computers in the basement offices of Island ECN Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to the future of stock trading.  
</P>
<P>
	Island operates one of about a dozen so-called electronic  
communications networks, or ECNs, vying to replace the NYSE and the 
Nasdaq Stock Market as the primary U.S. arena for buying and 
selling stock. 
</P>
<P>
	ECNs are revolutionizing the way stocks are traded in America by  
allowing investors to process their trades electronically with 
minimal interference from middlemen, such as Nasdaq market makers 
or Big Board brokers and specialists, whose commissions drive up 
investors' trading fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Professional investors have used alternative exchanges for years  
to bypass the traditional markets' costly and often cumbersome 
trading methods. But the recent explosion in Internet investing has 
led ECNs to broaden their scope in search of the growing number of 
individual investors who trade online. 
</P>
<P>
	One way ECNs are competing for the small investor market is by  
allowing them to trade in the after-hours sessions formerly 
reserved for professionals. Already, small investors who trade 
through brokerage firms hooked up to Island can trade outside the 
regular market hours of 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. And Instinet, which 
operates the oldest and most widely used ECN, recently teamed with 
online brokerage firm ETrade Group to allow ETrade's retail clients 
access to Instinet's after-hours market. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact is already being seen on Wall Street; the NYSE, the  
Nasdaq and the regional Chicago Stock Exchange have all announced 
plans to introduce after-hours trading sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The masses out there obviously want this, and you can see it  
by the popularity of the ECNs,'' said Tony Kafeiti, online 
supervisor at Castle Online, a Freeport, N.Y., discount brokerage 
firm that processes most of its customers' trades on ECNs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafeiti said ECNs are popular because they allow small investors  
to take a hands-on approach to trading, and because the networks 
don't discriminate against small investors in favor of large 
professional traders, an accusation frequently made against the 
established exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've leveled the playing field,'' Kafeiti said.  
</P>
<P>
	Investors who trade using ECNs do so by sending their buy and  
sell orders to an online brokerage firm over the Internet. The 
brokerage firm then completes the trade almost immediately by 
processing it on an ECN. The entire process can be completed in 
seconds and cost around $20 -- far quicker and cheaper than using a 
traditional full service broker who trades on the NYSE or the 
Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	That said, questions have emerged as to how ECNs will regulate  
trading activity on the electronic frontier. And critics of ECNs 
argue that because the networks operate independently of one 
another they have fragmented the market to such a degree that 
investors can never really be sure they're getting the best price 
for their stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Junius Peake, a former vice chairman of the board of governors  
of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which governs 
the Nasdaq Stock Market, argues that investors who trade via ECNs 
are limited to whatever prices are being offered on the specific 
ECN on which their trade is completed. In other words, a better 
price may exist on another ECN or on a traditional exchange, but 
the investor has no access to it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the difference between listing your house with a single  
realtor or using a multiple listing,'' Peake said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, since emerging as legitimate competition in the  
last three years, the networks have siphoned away about 30 percent 
of the trading volume in Nasdaq listed stocks, and experts expect 
that figure to rise. Moreover, their growing visibility has put 
pressure on the established exchanges to either change their ways 
or risk being left in the dust. 
</P>
<P>
	Several ECNs, including Island and Archipelago Holdings, are  
mulling plans to become full-fledged exchanges, similar in legal 
stature to the NYSE and the Nasdaq. And in a sign of their growing 
credibility, virtually every big name Wall Street investment bank 
has either invested in an ECN or is in the process of building one. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to stave off the competition, both the Big Board  
and the Nasdaq recently moved forward with plans to sell stakes in 
their markets through initial public offerings. Both exchanges are 
expected to use the stock created through an IPO to either buy or 
team-up with an ECN. 
</P>
<P>
	ECNs are also having a psychological affect on Wall Street. Many  
longtime market observers believe the proliferation of alternative 
exchanges has marked a turning point in what amounts to a true 
democratization of the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're giving individual investors the tools and the timing  
that were formerly accessible only to professionals,'' said Alan 
Ackerman, senior vice president and market strategist at Fahnestock 
&AMP; Co., a New York brokerage firm.

<HEADLINE> Lords Miffed Over Essay Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- In 75 words or less, why would you like to be in  
the House of Lords? 
</P>
<P>
	That's the question for hereditary members of the Lords before  
an election later this year to select the lucky few who will keep 
their seats. 
</P>
<P>
	To some, it smacks of a cereal-box competition. ``I should  
remain a lord because ...'' read Wednesday's headline in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole thing is ludicrous,'' says Lord Mancroft, a  
Conservative peer. ``What do I include -- my inside leg 
measurement?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brief essays did not win Lord Mancroft his seat in the Lords,  
the upper house of Parliament. He's there because his grandfather, 
Arthur Michael Samuel Mancroft, was given a hereditary peerage in 
1937 after long service in the House of Commons. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Tony Blair, who leads the Labor Party, is  
determined to eliminate all the 633 bluebloods from the House of 
Lords. 
</P>
<P>
	There are hardly any Labor supporters among the sundry dukes,  
marquesses, earls, countesses, viscounts, barons and baronesses. 
The 471 Conservatives in the Lords include 299 hereditary peers, 
compared to 176 Labor members, of whom just 18 inherited their 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
	As an interim step, the government will allow 92 hereditary  
peers, elected by their colleagues, to keep their seats for a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates will not be allowed to print posters, bombard their  
fellow lords with leaflets or otherwise campaign to keep their 
seats. They may submit only their 75 words by Oct. 21, to be 
published in the Lords Library. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the 75-word limit naturally inspired some mirth.  
Columnist Giles Coren, writing in The Times, offered a model essay: 
</P>
<P>
	``Am proactive self-starter with good working knowledge of  
estate management, horsemanship, dithering, dribbling and claret 
drinking ... Have experience in the intricacies of the tax system -- 
specifically in relation to inheritance tax loopholes -- and 
seller's knowledge of the art market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Earl Ferrers, 13th in a line going back to 1711, even 75  
words was a bit much. 
</P>
<P>
	``People ought to know the peers for whom they wish to vote

</P>
<P>
	Indeed, some of their noble lords are exceedingly reticent. The  
diary column of The Guardian newspaper recently has been 
highlighting some of the 168 lords who have yet to speak in the 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	They include the Duke of Leinster, silent for 27 years; the Earl  
of Normanton, who took his seat 32 years ago, and two peers who 
have been in the house for 45 years -- the Earl of Coventry and the 
Marquess of Abergavenny. 
</P>
<P>
	Lord Onslow, 7th in a line going back to 1801, accepted the  
75-word limit as a challenge.

<HEADLINE> CR Renegade Is Yonkers Favorite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) -- CR Renegade, who has rebounded from a  
ninth-place finish in the Hamletonian with two straight victories, 
is the favorite in Saturday's $273,891 Yonkers Trot. 
</P>
<P>
	Self Possessed, who set a record in the Hambletonian, is  
skipping the Yonkers Trot, the second leg of the triple crown for 
3-year-olds, in order to compete in the American National on 
Saturday in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	CR Renegade is an 8-5 favorite at Yonkers Raceway while  
Raffaello Ambrosio, who finished fourth in the Hambo, is the second 
choice at 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Americanese and JW Dutch Treat follow at 6-1.  
</P>
<P>
	CR Renegade, which drew the six spot in the eight-horse field,  
won the Zweig Memorial and the Yonkers Trot elimination after a 
disappointing display in the Hambletonian. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forget about the Hambo,'' said Rod Allen, the driver-trainer  
of CR Renegade. ``That was just a bad trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy with the draw because we are inside the key horse.  
That gives us the option of getting off quickly or staying behind 
and make a strong finish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rafaello Ambrosio, driven by Jack Moiseyev and winner of the  
second elimination, is outside Renegade in post position seven. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's too far out,'' trainer Ron Gurfein said. ``However,  
there's nothing I can do about it. CR Renegade will probably go 
first over and we'll find out how good a trotter we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CR Renegade has seven victories, three seconds and a third this  
year, with earnings of $415,814. 
</P>
<P>
	The final leg of the triple crown, the Little Brown Jug, is  
Sept. 23 in Delaware, Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Drops, Tokyo Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar dropped against the yen today after  
traders realized that rumors about intervention from Japan's 
central bank were unfounded. Fears about an overly strong yen sent 
Tokyo share prices falling. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was trading at 111.32 yen by late afternoon, down  
0.90 yen from late Tuesday but above its late New York level of 
110.80 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 240.25 points,  
or 1.33 percent, to close at 17,855.16. On Tuesday, the average 
closed down 138.14 points, or 0.76 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar gyrated as rumors spread on the foreign exchange  
market that the Bank of Japan was buying up the greenback to stem 
its decline. During the day, it ranged from 110.40 yen to 112.40 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar moved as high as 112.40 yen soon after Haruhiko  
Kuroda, Japan's vice finance minister for international affairs, 
said the ministry is ready to take action against rapid moves in 
foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders soon realized that the Bank of Japan hadn't  
intervened. The U.S. currency fell back below 111.00 yen, as 
traders who had bought the U.S. currency turned around and dumped 
their holdings, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the BOJ had really intervened, the dollar wouldn't have  
fallen back down so easily,'' said Ryohei Muramatsu, treasury 
manager at Commerzbank. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers said the dollar was not expected to reverse course  
against the yen because of the view that the Japanese economy was 
starting to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 116.84 yen, down  
from 117.28 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the yen's rise added to overall gloom as  
market players stayed on the sidelines, worried about the direction 
of the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen hurts exporters because it tends to make Japanese  
goods more expensive overseas and lowers the value of their dollar 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 649.99 million shares, down from 940.74 million shares 
Tuesday. Retreating issues outnumbered advancers 714 to 480, while 
129 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 12.27 points, or 0.81 percent, to finish at 
1,494.80. The TOPIX closed down 11.65 points, or 0.77 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 2.0000 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.9950 
percent, pushing its price down to 98.33 yen from 98.37 yen.

<HEADLINE> 'Witch' Town Site Gets 500,000 Hits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURKITTSVILLE, Md. (AP) -- The Internet Website devoted to this  
small town of just over 200 people has drawn half a million visits 
in one day. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of the town in western Maryland prepared the site to  
respond to the flood of tourist and media inquiries that followed 
the release of ``The Blair Witch Project,'' a pseudo-documentary 
horror film that has earned millions of dollars at the box office 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Website, residents are providing facts about the town,  
which has just 75 old brick and Victorian homes, one post office 
and one church. 
</P>
<P>
	The page includes the answers to frequently asked questions  
about the town's connection to the movie. Though the Website, 
hosted by a Severna Park-based company called ToadNet, is 
attracting visitors, the Web page says residents are not making 
money from the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The town of Burkittsville does not have a public restroom, any  
stores, restaurants, or even a payphone. Besides the occasional 
lemonade stand, we are not profiting in any way,'' residents have 
written on the page.

<HEADLINE> New ABC Game Show Has Record Winner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michael Shutterly has only one definite plan for  
the $500,000 he won on ABC's new hit game show. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids want to go to Disney World,'' said the 46-year-old  
lawyer and father of three boys from Richmond, Va., who won the 
money Wednesday on ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC claimed it was the biggest cash award ever given to a  
game-show contestant in television history. 
</P>
<P>
	Shutterly, who won $49,000 a decade ago as a contestant on  
``Jeopardy,'' passed up a chance to double his winnings when he 
wasn't sure about a music trivia question. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just hasn't quite registered yet,'' he said. ``It will take  
a couple of days until it settles in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shutterly answered a series of questions to build up his  
winnings, earning $500,000 because he correctly identified Pope 
John Paul I as Albino Luciani. 
</P>
<P>
	He was offered one last question and a chance to win a million.  
But if he got it wrong, Shutterly's winnings would be sliced to 
$32,000. 
</P>
<P>
	For the final query, Shutterly had to identify the initial hard  
rock Grammy Award winner when the music awards show established the 
category in 1989. The winner, Jethro Tull, was controversial 
because it doesn't really play hard rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Presented with four choices, Shutterly said he felt certain of  
only one thing: that the winner wasn't Jethro Tull. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisely, he chose to pass on the question and leave with  
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' has been a surprise summer hit  
for ABC during its run of 13 shows in 14 nights. Its audience has 
been increasing throughout the run, and Tuesday night's count of 
just under 16 million viewers was its highest yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Hungry for a success, ABC has already promised producers that  
the game show will be back. 
</P>
<P>
	An international version of the game show has been aired in four  
other countries since last year. None of the overseas versions have 
ever awarded as much as $500,000, ABC said.

<HEADLINE> Man Said To Admit Creating Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) -- The man charged with creating the Melissa  
computer virus that clogged e-mail systems around the world 
admitted he created the bug, a prosecutor alleges in court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	David L. Smith, a former computer programmer, was arrested in  
April. 
</P>
<P>
	A brief filed in state Superior Court by Supervising Deputy  
Attorney General Christopher G. Bubb says Smith waived his Miranda 
rights and spoke to investigators when police arrived at his 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smith admitted, among other things, to writing the `Melissa'  
macro virus, illegally accessing America Online for the purpose of 
posting the virus onto cyberspace, and destroying the personal 
computers he used to post `Melissa,' '' Bubb wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Edward P. Borden Jr. told the Asbury Park Press  
of Neptune that he disputes Bubb's assertions. He refused to 
comment further, the newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Melissa virus was disguised as an e-mail marked ``important  
message'' from a friend or colleague of each recipient. It caused 
affected computers to create and send 50 additional infected 
messages. The volume of messages generated slowed some systems to a 
crawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the virus was named after a topless dancer in  
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Bubb's brief was filed in response to a defense motion seeking  
additional prosecution documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Borden says he needs the prosecution documents to file a motion  
to suppress evidence seized during the search of Smith's apartment. 
A hearing on his motion was to be held this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is charged with interruption of public communications,  
conspiracy and theft of computer service. The maximum penalty for 
the offense is 40 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	He remains free on $100,000 bail.

<HEADLINE> Husband Kills Wife, Then Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A man shot and killed his wife as their children  
slept, called his mother to tell her, then went to a boathouse and 
shot himself, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Haynes, 39, shot his wife Debra Haynes, 44, numerous times  
Tuesday night at the couple's Queens Village home. He then phoned 
his mother in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told her he had killed his wife and asked her to take care  
of the kids,'' said a police source, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Haynes then drove to his mother's home, threw his house keys on  
her front steps and drove away, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spotted Haynes' unoccupied car parked near a park  
Wednesday morning. Soon after they heard a gunshot and found Haynes 
dead with a single gunshot wound to his head. 
</P>
<P>
	The children, an 8-year-old girl and 5-year-old boy, were taken  
to a hospital for evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	Haynes had been a letter carrier for 11 years when he retired in  
1997 for personal reasons, U.S. Postal Service spokesman Tom Gaynor 
said.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Man Beaten, Dragged in S.D. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTIN, S.D. (AP) -- A man beaten and left for dead was found  
with a rope around his neck and his ears missing in what 
authorities described as a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Young, 21, of Martin was in critical condition early today  
at Rapid City Regional Hospital. He was found early Saturday, about 
seven hours after the alleged beating, amid tall weeds on the Pine 
Ridge Indian Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Three suspects were in custody.  
</P>
<P>
	Bennett County Sheriff Russel Waterbury said Young was kicked in  
the face by people wearing steel-toe boots. He said it was nearly 
impossible to identify Young, who also had severe cuts and rope 
burns on his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff said the suspects -- Louis Means and Byron  
Bissonette, both 18, and a juvenile -- had been partying with Young 
the night of the alleged beating and Young had bought them alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	Waterbury called the incident a hate crime -- Young is white, the  
suspects are American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Young was pulled around by the rope tied around his  
neck. 
</P>
<P>
	``They dragged him all over that field and left him to die,''  
said Lila York, Young's cousin. ``It's out of hateness. Why else 
would anybody do that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	County Commissioner James Slattery disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't hear it was racial,'' he said. ``I heard it was  
alcohol and dope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI is investigating because the incident happened on an  
Indian reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1998, a black man was chained to a pickup truck and  
dragged to death along a road in Jasper, Texas. Three white men 
were charged with killing James Byrd Jr.

<P>
	MARTIN, S.D. (AP) -- A white man beaten and left for dead with a  
rope around his neck was found on an Indian reservation in what the 
sheriff described as a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI was investigating but stopped short of labeling the  
attack a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Young, 21, of Martin was in critical condition early today  
at Rapid City Regional Hospital. He was found early Saturday, about 
seven hours after he was beaten, near Allen on the Pine Ridge 
Indian Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett County Sheriff Russel Waterbury said Young's attackers  
were American Indians and the crime was racially motivated. He 
identified the suspects as Louis Means and Byron Bissonette, both 
18, and a juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Young had been pulled about a field by the rope around  
his neck, and was severely cut and barely recognizable because he 
had been kicked in the face by people wearing steel-toe boots. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Vargo, an assistant U.S. attorney in Rapid City, said the  
adults -- both members of the Oglala Sioux tribe -- were to be 
arraigned this afternoon on federal charges of assault resulting in 
serious bodily injury, said 
</P>
<P>
	He said the charge doesn't indicate the attack is a hate crime  
because the investigation is incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
	An affidavit from one suspect said Young was beaten, physically  
dragged across a field, thrown under a house crawl space, removed, 
kicked in the head and then abandoned, according to Coleen Rowley, 
an FBI special agent in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff said the three suspects had been partying with Young  
the night of the attack and Young had bought them alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	Young's mother, Carol Bucholz of Lexington, Neb., said her son's  
left ear was almost torn off and his right ear was badly damaged, 
but a plastic surgeon said both can be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
	``They dragged him all over that field and left him to die,''  
said Lila York, Young's cousin. ``It's out of hateness. Why else 
would anybody do that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bucholz said she didn't believe her son knew the suspects, ``so  
why he was with them we're not sure at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	County Commissioner James Slattery disagreed with the hate crime  
theory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't hear it was racial,'' he said. ``I heard it was

<HEADLINE> Kosovars Refuse To Lift Blockade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Leaders of the ethnic Albanians who  
are blocking Russian peacekeepers from entering their town refused 
to end their blockade today, but they agreed to ask their followers 
whether they are willing to back down. 
</P>
<P>
	``The generals wanted to make us accept a compromise but we are  
not in the market to trade,'' local Kosovo Liberation Army 
commander Ismet Tara told reporters after meeting for a second day 
with German, Russian and Dutch officers. ``We don't have any 
mandate from the people to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tara said protest leaders would talk to the townspeople of  
Orahovac but ``if the will of the people is not respected, the 
situation will become very tense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no sign, however, that the local ethnic Albanians were  
prepared to give up the standoff, despite the fierce heat and 
strong international pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians have been blocking the roads with trucks,  
tractors, cars and buses since Monday, when Russian troops tried to 
enter Orahovac to take over positions from Dutch peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	Local ethnic Albanians objected, saying Russian mercenaries  
fought alongside Serbs during the 18-month crackdown that ended 
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accepting a Kosovo peace 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will stay here until the Russians grow tired of insisting  
and give up,'' said Ismet Bugari, 53, one of several thousand 
townspeople manning the barricades Tuesday in 95 degree heat. 
``Anything is better than having the criminals in our town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Gen. Vadim Andreev appeared to confirm the allegations  
of Russian mercenaries. But, he said, ``we are a professional army. 
They were bandits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That distinction meant little to the ethnic Albanians.  
</P>
<P>
	``People cannot tell the difference between mercenaries and  
soldiers because they all wore the same uniform, had the same 
weapons, spoke the same language and came from the same place,'' 
said a protest leader, Agim Hasku. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians around Kosovo trust NATO more than Russians to  
keep the peace. But Kosovo's dwindling Serb population trusts 
Russians -- their fellow Slavs -- more than NATO to protect them from 
ethnic Albanians seeking revenge for atrocities committed under 
Milosevic's crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
	German Gen. Wolfgang Sauer said the Russians will not try to  
force their way into town unless they get word from the Germans to 
do so. Orahovac is located in the German sector of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department said he  
was confident the situation would be resolved with the Russians 
operating in Orahovac. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is that we believe that Russian troops will act  
evenhandedly, they will fulfill their mandate in Orahovac, just as 
they have done elsewhere in Kosovo,'' deputy spokesman James B. 
Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pristina, meanwhile, a joint Serb-ethnic Albanian council  
formed to advise the U.N. mission held another meeting -- and for 
the first time both Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist leader, and his 
rival, Kosovo Liberation Army leader Hashim Thaci, were present. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Thaci and Rugova claim leadership of Kosovo's majority  
ethnic Albanian community. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbs on the council proposed the creation of five separate Serb  
enclaves in Kosovo where Serbs could be better protected against 
ethnic Albanian militants. Most of the 200,000 prewar Serb 
population has already left the province. 
</P>
<P>
	However, ethnic Albanians on the council refused to consider  
they idea, which they view as the first step toward ethnic 
partition of the province.

<HEADLINE> Dvorak Retains Decathlon Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- The sweltering southern Spanish summer was  
too much even for Tomas Dvorak. 
</P>
<P>
	Dvorak retained the decathlon world title Wednesday night, but  
fell well short of his world record even though he had been only 10 
points off the pace after three events Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two days in this stadium was just too much,'' Dvorak said. ``I  
an happy with the gold but I was hoping to get more points,'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Czech ended the grueling, two-day event with 8,744 points,  
far ahead of Britain's Dean Macey, who earned the silver medal in 
his first major decathlon with 8,556 points. Chris Huffins of the 
United States took the bronze with 8,547. 
</P>
<P>
	Dvorak, 27, should have thrived in the conditions. He won the  
world title at Athens, Greece, two years ago, when the temperature 
was in the 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	When he set the world record of 8,994 points at Prague July 3-4,  
the temperature also was in the 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Prague, it was 10 degrees lower than here and a lot less  
humid,'' Dvorak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it just felt that way.  
</P>
<P>
	The official readings here, in fact, also were in the 90s, but  
the humidity climbed over 50 percent during the two days of the 
decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The record and the 9,000 points were beyond me here. It will  
have to wait. I just couldn't do it,'' said Dvorak, who led after 
the first day but kept slipping off the world record pace.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Heads Toward U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A hurricane watch was posted today for the Bahamas  
because of Tropical Storm Dennis and forecasters warned that the 
storm could affect the southeastern United States this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis, one of three storm systems in the Atlantic, was 335  
miles east-southeast of Nassau, Bahamas, at 11 a.m. EDT with top 
wind of nearly 45 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	It was nearly stalled but was expected to resume a  
west-northwesterly track at about 8 mph some time today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The currents, the flow of air that would move it around have  
slacked off and nothing's pushing it yet,'' said hurricane 
specialist Stephen Baig. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was expected to strengthen and the central Bahamas were  
under a tropical storm warning. The hurricane watch covered the 
Turks, Caicos and other Bahama islands -- including Bimini, just 55 
miles from Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's looking like it's going to be in the central Bahamas by  
Thursday,'' said Trisha Wallace, a meteorologist at the National 
Hurricane Center in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Tropical storm force wind of at least 39 mph extended up to 70  
miles from its center today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Residents along the entire southeastern United States coast  
should closely monitor the progress of this system,'' said 
hurricane specialist Jack Beven of the hurricane center. 
</P>
<P>
	Emily sprang up in the Caribbean on Tuesday, surprising  
forecasters who hadn't thought it was even a tropical depression. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. EDT, Emily was 305 miles east of the Windward  
Islands, the southern Lesser Antilles, and was moving northwesterly 
at about 6 mph. It also had top wind of 45 mph, with little change 
expected before Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm was moving to the northwest at 6 mph and could tangle  
with Tropical Storm Cindy, which was farther out in the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Emily could dissipate and essentially be sucked up into  
Cindy,'' Wallace said. ``It could also be the other way around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said a combined storm would not necessarily be twice as  
powerful. Beven said Emily could reach hurricane strength by 
Friday, if it stays far enough away from Cindy. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. EDT, Cindy was about 1,130 miles east of the Leeward  
Islands. It was traveling west-northwest at 15 mph with top wind of 
65 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy was forecast to swing gradually north and stay over the  
open ocean.

<HEADLINE> Life-Changing Battery Turns 40 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- It seems almost a footnote to the technological  
revolution. But like fiber-optic cable and the microchip, the world 
would be a much different place without the alkaline battery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian Institution recognized the 40th anniversary of  
the commercially viable alkaline battery today in accepting the 
first prototypes for its National Museum of American History. 
</P>
<P>
	Those first batteries were made in 1959 by the Eveready Battery  
division of Union Carbide. The battery was rebranded under the 
Energizer name in 1980, and the division was sold to St. 
Louis-based Ralston Purina in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Batteries have been around since before the turn of the century.  
But until the alkaline, commercial batteries could barely provide 
enough power for a dimly-lit flashlight, and then for only short 
periods of time. 
</P>
<P>
	Eveready's alkaline battery opened the door to laptop computers  
and camcorders, pagers and cell phones, the Gameboy and the 
Walkman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really sped up the technical revolution,'' sociologist  
Geoffrey Godbey of Pennsylvania State University said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1950s were a time of increasing household convenience --  
televisions, refrigerators, washers and dryers were becoming 
commonplace. But the advances were limited to items you could plug 
into the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1955, Eveready moved researcher Lew Urry from an office in  
Toronto to its Cleveland plant and told him to come up with a 
better battery. 
</P>
<P>
	Every battery has a positive electrode (a cathode) and a  
negative electrode (an anode). Both are placed in material (an 
electrolyte) that passes electrons between them. As electrons pass 
from the anode to the cathode, the battery generates electricity. 
But as the electrons pass from the negative electrode to the 
positive, the capacity is decreased and the cell eventually dies. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the state of the art was the carbon zinc battery.  
Urry began looking at past failed experiments with alkaline, in 
which electrons pass from an anode made of zinc to a cathode made 
of manganese dioxide and carbon while immersed in an alkaline 
electrolyte. 
</P>
<P>
	Urry experimented with different combinations of materials. He  
struck paydirt when he used zinc in a loosely packed powder form. 
He also discarded the button-shape of the earlier alkaline 
batteries, going instead with a cylinder shape of commercial 
batteries already on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	By the late '50s he'd honed what he thought was a pretty good  
alkaline battery, and was ready to try and persuade the company to 
put the battery on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a mockup battery from an empty flashlight shaft, Urry put  
his prototype into a toy car, and a carbon zinc battery into an 
identical toy. He grabbed Eveready vice president of technology 
R.L. Glover and headed for the cafeteria at the Cleveland plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our car went several lengths of this long cafeteria,'' Urry,  
now 72, said. ``The other car barely moved. Everybody was coming 
out of their labs to watch. They were all oohing and ahhing and 
cheering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the early '60s, the alkaline was changing the way we lived.  
If you wanted to listen to the radio, you could go for a walk with 
your transistor, rather than gathering with family around the 
living-room console. 
</P>
<P>
	``It provided a reliable source of portable energy,'' Godbey  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The alkaline battery continues to improve. Energizer officials  
say today's battery lasts 40 times longer than the 1959 prototype. 
</P>
<P>
	Each improvement creates enough power for new devices to come to  
the market, or allows for improvements to existing devices -- 
compare today's laptop to the versions of five years ago, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
	``These things are available because the technology of the  
battery is improving,'' said Mark Larsen, senior brand manager at 
Energizer. 
</P>
<P>
	So battery sales keep rising, even though today's batteries last  
longer. Larsen said the typical U.S. household includes 18 devices 
that use batteries. Americans used an estimated four billion 
batteries in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Double-A is the most popular cell -- nearly half of all batteries  
sold, but the trend is toward smaller batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Urry now mentors researchers who are developing smaller and  
still more powerful batteries. In the next few years, Energizer 
researchers predict, batteries the size of those found in watches 
will be used to power cell phones and radios we wear attached to 
our wrists. 
</P>
<P>
	For the more distant future, the company is exploring the use of  
micro-batteries that could be implanted under the skin to monitor 
body functions such as blood sugar levels and body temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can still go a lot further,'' Urry said.

<HEADLINE> $19.2M Verdict Upheld vs. Chrysler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The state's highest court this morning upheld a  
ruling that Chrysler Corp. should pay $19.2 million to a man who 
blamed a faulty brake system for a crash that killed his wife and 
three children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Judicial Court affirmed a 1996 Suffolk Superior  
Court jury verdict in the case of Paul J. Santos of Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Santos was driving a 1986 Plymouth Voyager minivan on a  
New Hampshire parkway when he braked to avoid rear-ending another 
car. Santos said a design defect caused the rear brakes to lock, 
sending his van out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrysler blamed the accident on driver error in winter weather.  
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for DaimlerChrysler AG, the company that resulted  
from last year's acquisition of Chrysler Corp. by Germany's 
Daimler-Benz AG, insisted this morning that the company's brake 
system was not at fault. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing ever wrong with the braking system in this  
vehicle,'' said spokesman Jay Cooney. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Black, an attorney for Santos, said, ``That's not what the  
jury said and that's not what the SJC said.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Admits Tear Gas Use in Siege </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taking back previous disavowals, the FBI now  
admits that federal agents fired one or more incendiary tear gas 
canisters during the 1993 standoff with Branch Davidian cult 
members in Texas, a federal law enforcement official says. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency, however, still maintains it did not start the fire  
that consumed the Davidians' compound with leader David Koresh and 
more than 80 followers inside. The April 19, 1993, inferno ended a 
51-day siege by federal agents trying to serve a warrant for 
Koresh's arrest on firearms and explosive charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line here continues to be that the Davidians set  
that fire and that law enforcement did not set that fire,'' said 
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Incendiary devices -- believed to be two military tear gas  
canisters -- were fired not at buildings in the Branch Davidian 
compound, but at a bunker nearby, the official said, adding that 
they bounced off the bunker's concrete roof and did not enter any 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
	The canisters were fired early in the morning, around 6 a.m.,  
the official added. The fire that destroyed the compound started 
around noon after federal agents used a tank to punch holes in the 
compound before pumping in tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Other tear gas canisters used by federal agents throughout the  
day were not flammable or potentially explosive, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, the FBI had maintained it used only nonflammable  
canisters to get tear gas into the compound because of fears that 
pyrotechnic grenades might spark a fire in the wooden structure. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal official said that circumstances under which the two  
canisters were fired may explain why they were not mentioned 
before. ``Maybe this didn't come up because it was 6 in the morning 
-- six hours before the compound burned, and maybe it didn't come up 
because they were fired away from the wooden main building which 
later burned,'' the official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the FBI reconsidered its past assertions this week  
after Danny Coulson, a former deputy director of the agency, told 
The Dallas Morning News that potentially flammable tear gas 
grenades were fired into an underground structure that led to 
tunnels opening into the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	But Coulson, who also was founding commander of the FBI's  
hostage rescue team, told the newspaper the incendiary canisters 
were fired hours before the blaze began and played no role in 
starting it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're aware of the reports and we're trying to get to the  
bottom of it as quickly as we can,'' Justice Department spokesman 
Myron Marlin said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials, including Attorney General Janet  
Reno, in the past have forcefully denied allegations that flammable 
devices were used by the FBI during the final standoff at Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	Marlin called such allegations ``nonsense'' when they were  
raised by a documentary filmmaker in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know of no evidence to support that any incendiary device  
was fired into the compound on April 19, 1993,'' Marlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of whether the FBI used pyrotechnic devices has been a  
major focus of an ongoing inquiry by the Texas Rangers and a key 
allegation in a pending wrongful-death lawsuit against the 
government by surviving Davidians and families of those who died. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government consistently has disputed accusations  
that the FBI started the fire. Independent investigators concluded 
the fire began simultaneously in three separate places. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI bugs recorded Davidians discussing spreading fuel and  
planning a fire hours before the compound burned. Arson 
investigators also found evidence that gasoline, charcoal lighter 
fluid and camp stove fuel had been poured inside the compound.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Wants Bank Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress will investigate a huge  
money-laundering scheme allegedly involving the Russian mob and 
will try to determine whether the Bank of New York was duped or 
willingly aided the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, chairman of the House Banking Committee,  
said Wednesday the panel will hold hearings next month on the 
alleged illegal activities at the Bank of New York that are under 
investigation by federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, Russia's finance minister denied his government was  
linked to the multibillion-dollar scheme at the 15th-largest U.S. 
bank, which has been described as potentially one of the biggest 
money-laundering operations ever uncovered in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no information indicating that Russia has anything to  
do with this problem, so there is no need for the government to 
interfere in this situation,'' Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov 
told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement authorities in the United States, Britain and  
Russia reportedly are investigating the activities of Konstantin 
Kagalovsky, who was Russia's representative to the International 
Monetary Fund from 1992 to 1995 and later worked as a senior 
executive at Russia's Menatep bank. He now is vice president of 
Russia's oil giant Yukos. 
</P>
<P>
	Kagalovsky is married to Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, a senior  
vice president of Bank of New York who supervised its East European 
division out of New York City. She is one of two Russian-born 
senior officers suspended by the bank last week as news of the 
federal investigation surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators believe as much as $10 billion was  
laundered through the bank in an operation run by Russian organized 
crime. Some $4.2 billion passed through a single account in more 
than 10,000 transactions between October and March, The New York 
Times reported last week, citing unidentified investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	In money laundering, illicit profits from drug trafficking and  
other criminal activities often are moved through a series of bank 
accounts to make them appear to be legitimate business proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``With regard to the Bank of New York, the question is whether  
they were unwittingly duped or were willing facilitators in what 
may be the greatest example of kleptocratic governance in modern 
history,'' Leach said in a statement from Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank said last week that it has been cooperating with the  
office of the U.S. attorney in Manhattan ``in the confidential 
investigation of the use of bank facilities to transfer funds from 
Russia to other countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the bank, Mrs. Kagalovsky nor Lucy Edwards, a bank vice  
president in London who also was suspended, have been charged with 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards' husband, Peter Berlin, who like Konstantin  
Kagalovsky is a Russian businessman, reportedly had authority over 
one of the accounts in question. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today, quoting officials in Russia's prosecutor general's  
office and Britain's National Criminal Intelligence Service in 
today's editions, said four former aides to Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin and one of his daughters were being investigated for 
possible roles in the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper identified them as Tatyana Dyachenko, Yeltsin's  
daughter and adviser; Anatoly Chubais, former chief of staff and 
finance minister; former Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, 
former Finance Minister Alexander Livshits; and Vladimir Potanin, 
former deputy chairman of the Russian Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra reported Wednesday  
that Swiss and Russian prosecutors investigating the Russian mob 
uncovered payments of more than $1 million to Yeltsin and his 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	A Kremlin spokesman, who declined to give his name, denied the  
report.

<HEADLINE> Crude and Gas Futures Plummet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil and gasoline futures nose-dived Wednesday on the New  
York Mercantile Exchange after weekly inventory figures showed 
unexpectedly weak gasoline consumption as the peak season winds 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, pork bellies fell sharply, while grain and  
soybean futures advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	After pushing over the $22-a-barrel mark recently, the price of  
crude oil for October delivery tumbled more than 4 percent. 
September gasoline was down 3.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude and its products were hurt after the American Petroleum  
Institute reported gasoline inventories fell a meager 197,000 
barrels. Market participants were betting on a decline of nearly 3 
million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, inventories of heating oil and other distillates rose  
a sharp 3 million barrels, putting supplies in a comfortable 
position going into that peak period. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil futures prices have been on a tear since late winter --  
spurred most recently by Hurricane Bret and an anticipated heavy 
impact on the industry which turned out to be less than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the huge runup in prices since February, this is causing  
some profit-taking or causing people to rethink the overall 
supply-and-demand picture,'' said William Byers, an analyst for 
Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also are trying to anticipate the outcome of a meeting  
in Venezuela this week among three big producers -- Venezuela, Saudi 
Arabia and Mexico. The meeting has pressured prices amid fears oil 
producers may no longer cooperate at keeping supplies off the 
market as they enjoy the highest prices per barrel in nearly two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	October crude fell 89 cents to $20.58 a barrel; September  
heating oil fell 2.25 cents to 54.75 cents a gallon; September 
unleaded gas was down 2.21 cents to 63.01 cents a gallon; September 
natural gas fell 29 cents to $3.030 per 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in  
October plummeted 77 cents to $19.38 a barrel at the International 
Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork belly futures prices tumbled 2 percent on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange as investors took profits following an extended 
price rise. The decline came after a weekly warehouse report showed 
supplies of frozen meat had fallen far less than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	February pork bellies fell 1.50 cents to 59.30 cents per pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures advanced on the strength of a late-day  
rally that came after the private firm Freese/Notis forecast an 
early freeze in the Midwest this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Some investors voiced skepticism about the long-range forecast,  
however, saying the gains reflected instead an inevitable end to 
the recent price drop responding to rains improved the picture for 
this year's crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've really pressed this market pretty hard, and the soybean  
crop is really largely unknown,'' said Eric Stacy, an analyst for 
the Price Futures Group in Chicago. ``The estimates we're getting 
are spotty at best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	December wheat rose 2 cents to $2.86 1/2 per bushel; December corn  
rose 3 1/4 to $2.19 3/4 per bushel; December oats rose 1 1/2 cents to $1.15 1/4 
per bushel; and November soybeans rose 8 1/2 cents to $4.75 1/2 per 
bushel.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Breaks From the Past </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's Congress and the Supreme  
Court are in their death throes. The constitution is headed for 
history's trash bin. Traditional political parties have retreated 
into oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
	Such is the fate of victims of President Hugo Chavez's ``social  
revolution'' in Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	With little or no resistance, Chavez, a former coup leader who  
swept to power with promises to lift the poor and crush the 
corrupt, is achieving what long eluded revolutionaries from Mexico 
to Argentina: a wholesale, spectacular break from the past. 
</P>
<P>
	It's probably still too early to tell if Chavez's exploits will  
be good or bad for Venezuela. But life here will definitely never 
be the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, a former paratrooper who staged a failed coup attempt in  
1992, says a major shake-up of Venezuela's institutions is 
necessary to root out some of the world's worst political 
corruption. Well over half the country's 23 million people live in 
poverty even though the country sits on more petroleum than any 
nation outside the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics say Chavez's moves concentrate power in his own  
hands, eliminate democratic checks and balances and work against 
his goal of reducing corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez has raised Venezuelans' hopes like few leaders before  
him, despite an acute economic recession and the loss of some 
500,000 jobs since he took office in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has been criticized for giving the army a bigger  
role in society, appointing fellow coup plotters to top government 
posts. But his use of soldiers to fix roads, build schools and tend 
to the sick has been well received, and his approval rating is over 
70 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone are the days when two traditional parties -- the  
center-right Copei and the center-left Democratic Action -- 
controlled everything from horse racing to TV broadcasting to 
hiring at the government steel company. 
</P>
<P>
	And many pillars of Venezuela's old political world do not wish  
to retire quietly into the night. ``We are not museum pieces,'' 
protested former President Luis Herrera Campins of Copei. 
</P>
<P>
	But it appears they have little choice.  
</P>
<P>
	A constitutional assembly -- conceived by Chavez and dominated by  
his supporters -- is usurping the functions of both Congress and the 
courts, neither of which appear willing or able to do much about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Cecilia Sosa, the president of the Supreme Court, resigned  
Tuesday to protest a court ruling supporting the assembly's 
decision to give itself vast new powers to fire judges and overhaul 
the judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court simply committed suicide to avoid being  
assassinated. But the result is the same. It is dead,'' Sosa 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the assembly -- whose original purpose was to draft  
a new constitution, Venezuela's 26th -- discussed its next assault 
on Venezuela's establishment: a takeover of most of Congress's 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
	The assembly voted overwhelmingly to declare a legislative  
emergency, taking away Congress's right to pass laws and limiting 
its functions to a narrow range of activities, such as budget 
oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition, which won more than  
90 percent of the assembly's 131 seats in elections last month, has 
touted its decision not to dissolve Congress and the courts as an 
example of its magnanimity. 
</P>
<P>
	The truth is, there was little need to dissolve them formally  
because they are already largely defunct. Bowing to Chavez forces, 
the opposition-controlled legislature recessed last month, though 
its leaders announced Wednesday they will meet Friday to discuss 
the threats to Congress's existence. 
</P>
<P>
	Henrique Capriles Radonsky, the 27-year-old president of the  
lower house of Congress, said he has been keeping a ``low profile'' 
to avoid ``heating up the spirits'' of the powerful constitutional 
assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	A new Congress and Supreme Court are expected to emerge from the  
constitutional assembly, probably some time early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	But some worry Chavez will find ways to stack the institutions  
with his followers, and that there will be little room for 
opposition voices in the new Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a voice in the desert,'' said Jorge Olavarria, one of  
only six opposition delegates to the constitutional assembly.

<HEADLINE> Lemieux, Penguins Formalize Lease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux cleared the last hurdle in his  
purchase of the Pittsburgh Penguins, finalizing a Civic Arena lease 
two months after the deal was first announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement with SMG was reached late Tuesday night and  
apparently was the final piece of the puzzle in Lemieux's $95 
million takeover of the team he led to Stanley Cup championships in 
1991 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux has already begun closing on the sale, a complicated  
process that requires the numerous parties involved to sign more 
than 100 documents -- many of them related to the arena lease. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone worked hard to bring this to resolution,'' John  
Brabender, Lemieux's spokesman, said Wednesday. ``This is the final 
piece of information that had to be negotiated so that Mario 
Lemieux's efforts to save the Penguins would truly happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Campbell, Lemieux's lawyer, told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  
Bernard Markovitz on Tuesday that the closing should be completed 
by Thursday, when the judge is expected to sign off on the arena 
lease. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL must then approve the sale, but that is considered a  
formality since the league has already endorsed his takeover. Once 
that is done, Lemieux should gain control of the team early next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Just in time, too. The Penguins report to training camp at their  
Southpointe practice rink a week from Saturday, or just a few days 
after Lemieux's name should officially go on the Penguins' 
stationery. 
</P>
<P>
	The arena lease accounted for much of the delay in Lemieux's  
takeover, which Markovitz initially approved June 24. A day later, 
Mayor Tom Murphy announced that Lemieux's group and SMG had agreed 
to an arena lease. 
</P>
<P>
	But reaching an oral agreement on the lease was one thing;  
putting it on paper proved time-consuming and difficult, as did 
completing the paperwork with investors who will contribute more 
than $50 million to the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz asked fellow U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge M. Bruce  
McCullough to mediate a lease agreement, with McCullough holding 
the last of his sessions Tuesday with SMG and the Lemieux group. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the lease, SMG will continue to control the 38-year-old  
Civic Arena until 2004, when it will revert to Lemieux, with SMG as 
the arena manager. SMG also will contribute $5 million to the 
Lemieux group. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux himself will be the largest investor at $25 million: $20  
million in equity and $5 million in cash from former co-owner Roger 
Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a possibility that, by 2004, the Penguins will control  
an arena they no longer play in. Although Lemieux initially 
negotiated a promise from city and county officials for a new arena 
by 2002, that agreement was struck from the final deal to satisfy 
Allegheny County Commissioner Bob Cranmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Cranmer said such a deal would not be binding since the county  
will convert next year from a three-commissioner ruling body to a 
single county executive.

<HEADLINE> Medication Mixups Cause Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Celebrex, the hot-selling new arthritis pill,  
sounds a lot like Celexa, a depression treatment, and Cerebyx, an 
anti-seizure drug. And it's not just patients who are confused. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Celebrex was launched in January, federal regulators have  
received 95 reports of errors by doctors and pharmacists in 
dispensing Celebrex -- problems blamed on health professionals 
confusing the painkiller with similarly named drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the cases involve serious injury or death. But the two  
companies that jointly sell Celebrex -- Monsanto Co. and Pfizer Inc. 
-- have recently started trying to clear up the confusion with an 
educational campaign aimed at doctors and pharmacists. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an accident waiting to happen,'' said Hedy Cohen, vice  
president of nursing at the Institute for Safe Medication 
Practices, a Huntington Valley, Pa., nonprofit group that tracks 
medication errors. ``It's a matter of time until a person that is 
already sick gets the wrong drug and the chance for a serious 
injury can occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, Celebrex became the fastest-selling new drug ever,  
with about 9.3 million prescriptions written so far. It is on track 
to have more than $1 billion in sales this year, and upwards of $4 
billion by 2002, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 95 medication mixups reported to the Food and Drug  
Administration, only 22 cases involved a patient actually taking 
the wrong drug. With the rest, someone caught the error in time. 
</P>
<P>
	At the urging of the FDA, Monsanto and Pfizer have paid for  
advertisements in major medical journals to make sure doctors and 
pharmacists understand the difference between the sound-alike drugs 
and the need to verify they are giving out the right pill. The 
companies' marketing representatives are reinforcing the message 
during visits to doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	If the problem does not improve, the FDA could make the  
companies change the drug's name, which analysts say could threaten 
sales. Monsanto has already changed the drug's name once, from 
Celebra, after federal regulators said it sounded too much like 
other medications. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still concerned about the problem,'' said Jerry  
Phillips, an FDA official who assesses the risk of drugs that 
already have reached the market. ``This is a significant number of 
errors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Medical experts say reports to the FDA generally represent a  
small proportion of the errors that occur because the reporting 
system is voluntary. But Monsanto officials said more mixups occur 
with Celebrex because the drug is so popular, and they stressed the 
number of actual medication errors is a very small percentage of 
the prescriptions written. 
</P>
<P>
	Celexa is made by Forest Laboratories, and Cerebyx by  
Warner-Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto spokeswoman Sally Benjamin Young would not reveal how  
much the company is spending on the education campaign, which 
started last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies are advising pharmacists to ask patients about the  
drug they are receiving to avoid any errors. The mixups largely 
occur because pharmacists cannot read the doctor's handwriting, 
pharmacists say.

<HEADLINE> Durable Goods Orders Up 3.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods  
vaulted ahead in July, and sales of existing homes, though pinched 
by rising mortgage rates, still managed to post the third best 
month ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The two reports, released Wednesday, reflected a still-booming  
economy, powered by strong consumer spending and low unemployment, 
economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	The orders report came one day after the Federal Reserve bumped  
up interest rates for the second time this summer in an effort to 
cool the economy and prevent an outbreak of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Fed signaled that that increase could be the last  
for the year, some economists aren't so sure. But after being mixed 
for most of the morning, stocks finished higher as investors 
expressed confidence that the economy can continue to grow without 
runaway inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 42.74 to 11,326.04,  
topping Monday's previous record. Broader stock indicators were 
also higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods --  
items expected to last at least three years -- rose 3.3 percent last 
month to a seasonally adjusted $204 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	That bigger-than-expected increase was the best showing since  
December 1998 when orders went up by 3.4 percent. The new increase 
followed a 0.5 percent gain in June, larger than the government had 
first reported. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union's chief economist David Orr said the durable goods  
report confirmed the continued rebound for American manufacturers, 
who have been battered by a global financial crisis that has cut 
sharply into their overseas sales and also opened them up to 
stiffer competition from cheaper imports. 
</P>
<P>
	``The third quarter is starting out on a very positive note for  
manufacturers,'' said National Association of Manufacturers 
economist Dave Huether. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors reported that  
sales of existing single-family homes declined 3.9 percent in July 
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.41 million units 
following a record high the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the decrease, July was the third highest sales level  
ever, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall conditions are still excellent for homebuyers, but the  
recent upswing in interest rates may have discouraged some from 
buying,'' said James Smith, the association's chief economist. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the monthly average interest rate on a 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgage was 7.63 percent, compared to 7.55 percent in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	In the durable goods report, orders for industrial machinery,  
the category that includes computers and machine tools, had the 
strongest showing in July, rising a hefty 8.4 percent in the 
largest increase since January 1995. That followed declines of 4.5 
percent and 3.9 percent in May and June respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	And, orders for electronic and other electrical equipment, which  
ranges from semiconductors, circuit boards and telecommunications 
equipment to home appliances, posted a 5.9 percent gain in July, 
the biggest increase since December. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation equipment orders rose 2 percent in July after  
having increased 9.9 percent in May and 1.1 percent in June. The 
transportation sector is often volatile from month to month because 
it includes such big purchases as airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	An increase in orders for airplane and aircraft parts more than  
offset a decline in orders for automobile and car parts, the 
department said. The summer is traditionally a slow period for the 
auto industry as manufacturers retool assembly lines to prepare for 
new models. Still, the industry expects record sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding transportation, durable goods orders would have risen  
3.7 percent, the largest increase by that way of figuring since 
February 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the U.S. industries that has suffered the most from the  
global turmoil has been steel. Yet, primary metals, the category 
that includes steel, saw orders grow a solid 2.4 percent in July, 
the fourth increase in a row.	   Actual shipments of big-ticket durable goods, a good sign of 
current demand, rose a solid 0.7 percent in July.

<HEADLINE> Bush Leads GOP Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush is running even  
with Vice President Al Gore in California, a state the Democrats 
must win, and has built a commanding lead over his rivals for the 
GOP nomination, a new poll indicates. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Warren Beatty barely registered a blip in the California  
Field Poll as a potential contender for the Democratic nomination. 
He fared somewhat better as a possible third-party candidate, 
drawing 8 percent in the survey released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Republicans who said they were likely to vote in  
California's winner-take-all March 7 primary, Bush got support from 
49 percent. That's more than the combined total of eight other 
Republican candidates, with 16 percent of those surveyed saying 
they were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	In a survey matchup of the two parties' front-runners, Bush had  
48 percent to Gore's 46 percent, a statistical dead heat that is 
unchanged from March. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to the rest of the country, California is more likely  
to lean Democratic, a trend seen throughout the 1990s,'' said Mark 
DiCamillo, director of the Field Poll. ``But the Bush-Gore matchup 
has been very even throughout the entire year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore advisers are concerned that the California race remains so  
close, but hope Gore will gain ground when the Republican's 
conservative stands on gun control, abortion and other major issues 
become better known in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore led former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley by a nearly 3-1  
margin among likely California Democratic Party voters -- 51-18 -- a 
margin steady since March. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is widening his lead over his GOP rivals in California from  
five months ago when he topped Elizabeth Dole by 18 points, 37-19. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Republicans, Steve Forbes, Mrs. Dole and Sen. John McCain  
of Arizona each drew 8 percent in the new poll. Former Vice 
President Dan Quayle, conservative activist Gary Bauer and 
commentator Pat Buchanan were at 3 percent, Sen. Orrin Hatch of 
Utah at 2 percent and conservative radio host Alan Keyes under 1 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Beatty, who has been considering the idea of running as a  
Democrat against Gore and Bradley, drew only 1 percent from likely 
Democratic voters in California. 
</P>
<P>
	But he drew 8 percent when presented to California Democrats as  
a potential third-party candidate -- with Bush and Gore still in a 
dead heat far ahead. Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura drew 15 percent 
as a possible third-party candidate, taking support about equally 
from Bush and Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll's error margin for its 501 likely voters was plus or  
minus 5 percentage points, larger for subgroups such as likely 
Democratic voters or likely Republican voters. It was taken Aug. 
16-22. 
</P>
<P>
	Other possible candidates in a three-way general election were  
in single digits, including Ross Perot, Donald Trump, former 
Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker and Buchanan, should he bolt the 
GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Bradley trailed Gore by a large margin in the  
Democratic race, he fared better going against Bush. In that 
scenario, Bush led Bradley 49-42, a far closer margin than Bush's 
19-point edge over Bradley five months ago.

<HEADLINE> Navy Bookkeeping Found To Be Lax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy erroneously billed Greece and Japan  
for services it provided to Canada, and lost track of a $54 million 
payment by Kuwait for three fighter jets, according to a 
congressional audit. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, which says it will next look at  
Army and Air Force accounts, said the Navy's bookkeeping in the 
government's Foreign Military Sales program included inaccurate 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	In some instances, the Navy did not collect for military  
services and sales to allies, other times it did not credit the 
right account and still other times it billed the wrong nations, 
said the GAO, an investigatory arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The bookkeeping was so lax that it made ``it difficult for Navy  
managers to accurately account for and report on the (program),'' 
the GAO said in the report issued Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was requested by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who  
has long pursued waste in the Pentagon budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy records showed that, as of October 1998, some $582 million  
in delivered goods and services had not been charged to the 
appropriate foreign customers, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
	It urged the Navy to correct errors in its accounting system and  
work with the Defense Department's comptroller to review the 
overall program. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson Toye, deputy chief financial officer for the Pentagon,  
said in a letter included in the report that the Defense Department 
``generally concurs with the findings and the recommendations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As one example of faulty bookkeeping, the GAO said the Navy in  
1996 had provided $1.1 million in support services for the Canadian 
Navy's shipboard command and launch system. 
</P>
<P>
	But instead of charging Canada's account for the $1.1 million,  
the Navy charged Canada only $18,507. Some $450,882 was erroneously 
charged to Greece and Japan and another $636,123 to a Pentagon 
account, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Navy officials ... told us they plan to correct the erroneous  
charges to Greece and Japan'' and make sure Canada is fully billed, 
the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another time, the Pentagon's books showed Kuwait had not been  
billed for three F-18 aircraft it received in 1993. In fact, Kuwait 
had been billed and paid the full $54 million, the audit found.

<HEADLINE> Okla. Bomb Survivors Seen Suffering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Martin Cash has flashbacks about the day he  
lost his left eye in the Oklahoma City bombing. He says he 
sometimes has survivor's guilt and can somehow still smell the 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash has post-traumatic stress disorder, and he retired from the  
Veterans Administration a year after the attack on April 19, 1995, 
that killed 168 people and injured nearly 700 others. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a study in today's Journal of the American Medical  
Association, almost half the survivors of the deadliest bombing on 
U.S. soil suffer from some sort of psychiatric illness, from 
chronic depression to alcohol and drug use disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	The study -- intended to improve mental health care following a  
disaster -- showed that 34 percent of the bombing survivors surveyed 
had post-traumatic stress disorder. Its symptoms include 
flashbacks, angry outbursts and sleep and concentration problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was based on interviews with 182 survivors conducted  
an average of six months after the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 45 percent developed some type of psychiatric disorder.  
And the researchers said almost everyone else in the study showed 
some symptoms of PTSD but did not have the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody was untouched by this disaster, but different people  
were touched differently,'' said Dr. Carol North of Washington 
University in St. Louis, one of the report's authors. ``Human 
distress is understandable after horrendous events such as this. We 
should not necessarily equate that with mental illness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. North said those with more serious injuries were more prone  
to develop a disorder, as were those who had a family member 
seriously injured or killed. Most at risk of developing a disorder 
were survivors who refused to think about the event and had 
feelings of isolation and a loss of interest in their surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
	Recognizing such symptoms immediately after a disaster could  
help identify those who need the most help, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwen Allen, director of Project Heartland, which was created  
with a federal grant to provide counseling for those affected by 
the bombing, said that getting help as quickly as possible was 
critical. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who got the work early on, who got into counseling, have  
done better. The key is that early intervention,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bombing survivors like Cash have described nightmares and  
flashbacks triggered by loud noises. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Urbach, who was in the Journal Record building across the  
street from the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, said she remains 
easily startled, but quit having nightmares about a year after the 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``One night I dreamed stuff was falling on me. I literally felt  
it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Younger, who was in a meeting on the fourth floor when  
the bomb went off, said he hasn't been able to watch movies with 
violence in them since that day and finds it difficult to trust 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	He also doesn't like tall buildings.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm nervous all the time, especially if I can't look out a  
window,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Younger said he and other bombing victims will always carry  
those mental and emotional scars. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just learn to deal with them,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Traditional Country Makes Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Traditional country music -- weeping  
steel guitars, twangy voices and lyrics with emotional depth that 
can get downright depressing -- is making a bit of a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Several examples indicate at least part of Nashville is  
returning to its roots: 
</P>
<P>
	-- George Jones recently was nominated for a Country Music  
Association award for his single ``Choices,'' a mournful ballad 
that would fit on his classic albums from the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Hot new country singer Brad Paisley declared from the stage at  
a Nashville performance: ``I'll never record a song that I can't 
sing on the stage of the Grand Ole Opry'' -- home of traditional 
country music since 1925. 
</P>
<P>
	-- New albums by Paisley, David Ball, Matt King, Jerry Kilgore  
and Chalee Tennison all use traditional country music themes and 
sounds. 
</P>
<P>
	In a year when VH-1 vamp Shania Twain continues to rule country  
music airwaves and Garth Brooks is using an alter ego to release a 
rock album, there's new country music that owes more to Tammy 
Wynette than the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyrically, it isn't ``baby food,'' either, King says.  
</P>
<P>
	And Tennison agrees: ``I'm not trying to put anybody down, but I  
can't sing fairy tale stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, for her debut album Tennison picked wrenching songs  
that relate to her recent divorce. The titles include ``I Let Him 
Get Away With It,'' ``I Can Feel You Drifting'' and ``There's a War 
in Me.'' On ``Just Because She Lives There,'' a neglected wife 
struggles with temptation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because she lives there/don't mean she loves there  
anymore,'' Tennison sings, her voice drenched in Texas twang and 
Wynette-style guilty heartache. ``And if she turns to another/she 
knows she'll have to answer to the Lord.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such dark fare is worlds away from the sunny, pop-leaning  
records that Twain and other 1990s country singers have ridden to 
stardom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a woman,'' Tennison says. ``I am 30 years old. I do have  
children. I'm single. I've been divorced. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is your average listener out there, the average  
person turning on the radio, washing the dishes at home, or driving 
to work, is who I am. They can look at me, and feel like I'm 
reachable and I'm touchable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Country music could use more of that kind of connection. While  
there have been individual success stories, the industry as a whole 
has stagnated. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of country music have flattened since peaking in 1995 at  
about $2 billion. After an uptick of 2.7 percent last year, sales 
were down about 3 percent for the first half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Country music's market share of sales has declined to 14.1  
percent, according to the Recording Industry Association of 
America's 1998 Consumer Profile. That's still second -- rock is 
first at 25.7 percent -- but country's share has declined each year 
since peaking at 18.7 percent in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not to say many country artists aren't doing extremely  
well. Twain, Brooks, Faith Hill, Tim McGraw and George Strait 
continue to sell millions. LeAnn Rimes had a good run as a teen 
idol and may yet get back on track, and the Dixie Chicks have 
become major stars. 
</P>
<P>
	But the middling artists have suffered, and there appears to be  
a limit on how many can cross over to pop. It's a time much like 
the early 1980s, when the wave of popularity and pop crossover hits 
caused by the movie ``Urban Cowboy'' dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in 1986, country traditionalist Randy Travis came along  
with hits like ``On The Other Hand,'' sold millions and took 
country back to its roots. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1999, no traditional country artist has broken through to  
Travis-level success. But record executives like Scott Hendricks, 
who signed Kilgore to Virgin Nashville, are gambling on it 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
	``God bless country pop, but you've got to have some meat and  
potatoes once in a while, in my opinion,'' Hendricks says. ``I've 
done the pop stuff, too. I produced Restless Heart, which is as pop 
as it gets. But there's got to be a balance, some straight-ahead 
country music as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are fans out there who are hungry for it, and if you  
give them something real, many of them will partake in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King, who pointedly titled his second album ``Hard Country,''  
said he would be arrogant to imagine he was going to influence 
country music to become more traditional. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just doing what I do best and trying to capitalize on a  
great opportunity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Old-line star Jones says it just feels so good to hear  
traditional country music again. ``I hope it's coming back, if not 
all the way, at least in some form or fashion,'' he says. ``You've 
still got so many, many, many people out there that love the 
traditional music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paisley is the most successful new artist doing traditional  
country. He has a solid hit with the wistful ``Who Needs Pictures'' 
and has made a point of publicly declaring his allegiance to 
traditional country. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a groundswell,'' he says. ``I don't dislike up-tempo,  
positive pop-sounding country records. But I do dislike the fact 
that it has taken such a turn that that seems to be mainstream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ball, whose excellent third album ``Play'' is a perfect  
soundtrack for two-steppin', likewise shows no animosity to 
pop-leaning artists like Twain. So far, ``Play'' isn't selling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I GET what Shania Twain is doing, and understand why people  
like her records,'' Ball says. ``They're put together really well. 
It just doesn't have much to do with the country music I like to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love a good pop record. Unfortunately for me, if that's what  
they want, I have no interest in trying to do it. But I just keep 
doing what I love, and maybe the next time the trend comes around 
I'll be waiting.''

<HEADLINE> Seuss Cartoons Mix Whimsy and War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dr. Seuss' flights of fancy created some of the  
most famous characters in children's books, including the Grinch 
and the Cat in the Hat. Few fans, however, know that the whimsical 
doodler also depicted far more frightening figures -- Hitler, 
Mussolini and Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
	Theodor Seuss Geisel (Dr. Seuss' real name) drew cartoons for  
PM, a progressive New York daily, in the early 1940s, scribbling 
some 400 drawings that took aim at Americans' complacency about 
fascism and urged Washington to enter World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 200 of them will be published in ``Dr. Seuss Goes to War,''  
(The New Press, $25) by Richard Minear, a historian with the 
University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Most have not appeared in 
print for nearly 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The cartoons are filled with a familiarly Seussian stable of  
creatures -- birds with human faces, charmingly sinister dragons, 
sad-sack dachshunds, wide-eyed fish and enough dodo birds, 
woodpeckers, ostriches and talking cats to fill a zoo. 
</P>
<P>
	Seuss also used comically improbable gizmos to get his  
anti-isolationist message across. Props in the wartime cartoons 
included a steam-powered typewriter, an impossibly large tuba and a 
Rube Goldberg-style contraption that uses turtles and a baby 
carriage in a foot-dragging, seven-step effort to put out a fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Those chuckle-inducing images appear alongside caricatures of  
some of the 20th century's most feared leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Seuss' Hitler is alternately hapless and haughty. Benito  
Mussolini is depicted as an overweight, unshaven buffoon with 
delusions of grandeur. Josef Stalin groans while carrying a dozen 
suitcases labeled ``Our War Load'' and, in another sketch, offers 
up a pig-on-a-platter dinner called ``Roast Adolf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Seuss made these drawings with the fire of honest  
indignation and anger that fuels all real political art,'' Pulitzer 
Prize-winning cartoonist Art Spiegelman, creator of the ``Maus'' 
series, wrote in an introduction to the book, coming out in 
October. ``If they have a flaw, it's an absolutely endearing one: 
They're funny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seuss began working for PM in early 1941 and produced several  
cartoons a week until January 1943, when he left to join an Army 
propaganda unit headed by Hollywood moviemaker Frank Capra. 
</P>
<P>
	PM was influential but short-lived, publishing from 1940 to  
1948. The daily paper, which catered to left-leaning intellectuals, 
campaigned hard against isolationism, racism and anti-Semitism, and 
urged the United States to throw its weight into the fight against 
fascism. 
</P>
<P>
	Seuss, who died in 1991 at age 87, used the artistic genius that  
would make him a children's favorite to try to unite Americans 
against Hitler and the Axis powers. He approached the grown-up 
subject matter with his trademark irreverence. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lightheartedness, a sense of humor ... a wonderful,  
overflowing creativity'' in the cartoons, Minear said. But he added 
that Seuss ``had very serious concerns that underlay the whimsy and 
the fantasy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His drawings attacked Hitler, Mussolini and Japan's wartime  
leadership, but also delved into domestic politics. He was tireless 
in his broadsides against those he believed were out to divide 
Americans or profit from the war (``Beware the man who makes a 
fortune in a flood,'' reads one caption). 
</P>
<P>
	Among his favorite targets were aviator Charles Lindbergh, who  
publicly opposed U.S. involvement in the war, the anti-Semitic 
priest Charles Coughlin and the isolationist group America First. 
</P>
<P>
	``He called 'em as he saw 'em, and most of the time he was on  
the side of the angels,'' Spiegelman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Seuss won fame with sweetly screwball drawings and  
catchy rhymes, his venture into political cartooning should not 
surprise those familiar with his children's books, which often 
carried serious, politically liberal messages. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1984 best seller, ``The Butter Battle Book,'' spoofed the  
nuclear arms race; ``The Lorax'' urged environmental preservation; 
and ``The Sneetches'' is often read as a plea for racial tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	Minear said the PM cartoons might help readers find deeper  
meanings in some other Seuss classics. 
</P>
<P>
	The dictatorial title character of ``Yertle the Turtle,'' he  
said, was based partly on Hitler, an interpretation confirmed by 
Seuss. The book's ladder of turtles appeared first in a PM cartoon, 
stacked into a victory ``V.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strong convictions behind the PM cartoons, Minear  
and Spiegelman both wonder whether humor can ever be a meaningful 
weapon against a foe as horrid as the Nazi war machine. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a little like taking a peashooter against a tank,''  
Spiegelman said of the cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
	For Seuss, though, fantastical visions were indispensable, even  
-- maybe especially -- at the grimmest moments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a way of looking at life through a distorted telescope,  
and that's what makes you laugh at the terrible realities,'' he 
once said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without whimsy, none of us can live.''

	Better Building Vowed in Turkey  
</P>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Shoddy construction is blamed for the  
thousands of deaths in last week's deadly earthquake in Turkey, and 
the country's leader has vowed to create stricter building rules. 
Eight days after the powerful 7.4-magnitude quake reduced much of 
western Turkey to rubble, 200,000 survivors remain camped out in 
parks and on vacant lots. For a second night, they were drenched 
with heavy rains. A new tremor 200 miles away sent residents of the 
capital, Ankara, running into the streets in panic. The 
4.7-magnitude quake was centered near Haymana, 40 miles south of 
Ankara. A 4.2-magnitude aftershock followed. 

</P>
<P>
	Study: Okla. Survivors Suffering  
</P>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- According to a study in today's Journal of  
the American Medical Association, almost half the survivors of the 
deadliest bombing on U.S. soil suffer from some sort of psychiatric 
illness, from chronic depression to alcohol and drug use disorders. 
The study -- intended to improve mental health care following a 
disaster -- showed that 34 percent of the Oklahoma City bombing 
survivors surveyed had post-traumatic stress disorder. Its symptoms 
include flashbacks, angry outbursts and sleep and concentration 
problems. The study was based on interviews with 182 survivors of 
the 1995 bombing conducted an average of six months after the 
blast. 

</P>
<P>
	Russian Forces Drive Out Militants  
</P>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russian troops have regained control  
of all six mountain villages captured by Islamic militants in 
southern Russia more than two weeks ago, and were attempting to 
drive scattered groups of rebels from the region entirely, the 
military said today. The operation against the militants in 
Dagestan ``is in its final stage,'' said Defense Minister Igor 
Sergeyev, on a trip with President Boris Yeltsin to the Central 
Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan. The Russians have carried out daily 
bombing raids and artillery attacks, hammering rebels who seized 
the villages when they invaded the Caucasus Mountains region on 
Aug. 7. 

</P>
<P>
	FBI Admits Tear Gas Use in Siege  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taking back previous disavowals, the FBI now  
admits that federal agents fired one or more incendiary tear gas 
canisters during the 1993 standoff with Branch Davidian cult 
members in Texas, a federal law enforcement official says. The 
agency, however, still maintains it did not start the fire that 
consumed the Davidians' compound with leader David Koresh and more 
than 80 followers inside. The April 19, 1993, inferno ended a 
51-day siege by federal agents trying to serve a warrant for 
Koresh's arrest on firearms and explosive charges.

<P>
	Bret Soaks Texas Cotton Fields  
</P>
<P>
	CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) -- Cotton growers in south Texas will  
have slim pickings in the aftermath of Hurricane Bret. ``There's 
quite a few depressed farmers here now,'' said Bill Ordner, a 
cotton farmer who was among those who fled the storm. He returned 
to his 1,500-acre cotton field southwest of Corpus Christi 
yesterday to find crops ruined. ``It made us sick,'' he said. 
Ordner estimated his losses at $700,000. Bret rolled ashore Sunday 
with drenching rains and 125-mph winds. The storm caused relatively 
few problems considering its size and strength, missing urban areas 
and quickly deteriorating into a tropical storm. 

</P>
<P>
	Fly Halts Calif. Projects  
</P>
<P>
	COLTON, Calif. (AP) -- Some people in this Southern California  
community wish the problem would just buzz off: An endangered 
species of fly is holding up construction projects worth hundreds 
of millions. Communities around the country have squared off 
against environmentalists over owls, foxes, fish and trees. But 
here, the fly has a number of foes: county officials, developers, 
bond holders and residents. The U.S. government has all but halted 
development across the sand dunes in the desert east of Los Angeles 
to protect the tiny Delhi Sands flower-loving fly -- the only fly 
ever to make the Endangered Species List. 

</P>
<P>
	Japanese Stocks Close Lower  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Fears about an overly strong yen sent Tokyo share  
prices falling today. The Nikkei shed 240.25 points to close at 
17,855.16. 

</P>
<P>
	Johnson Sets Sights on 400M Record  
</P>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- There was a serious question about Michael  
Johnson's health early this year, but there isn't now: the American 
400-meter runner thinks he can break the world record at the World 
Championships. ``I know I'm in shape to run faster than 43.29,'' 
Johnson said last night after blistering through the first 300 
meters of his semifinal heat and advancing to Thursday night's 
final. American Butch Reynolds set the record in 1988, and Johnson 
has been chasing it in frustration in recent years. He has come 
close three times, with clockings of 43.39, 43.44 and 43.49.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Sworn In As UN Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Richard Holbrooke is beginning his job as U.S.  
ambassador to the United Nations by doing what he's always done 
energetically: a burst of on-the-go diplomacy. But when he settles 
in, he may find his past globe-trotting negotiations were the easy 
part. 
</P>
<P>
	The celebrated diplomatic troubleshooter must make peace with  
the U.N. bureaucracy, explain why the United States remains over $1 
billion in arrears with its U.N. dues, help end a Security Council 
standoff on Iraq and assert authority on peacekeeping in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Confirmed by the Senate 81-16 on Aug. 5, Holbrooke was sworn in  
today in a low-key ceremony at the U.S. mission in New York. A more 
elaborate one at U.N. headquarters, where he will formally present 
his credentials to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, is planned for 
after Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	After two days of ``getting to know the building,'' as one  
Holbrooke associate put it, he'll leave Friday for a whirlwind tour 
of Kosovo, Bosnia, Albania and Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Balkans kickoff holds much symbolism for the diplomat who  
engineered the 1995 Bosnia peace accord and later served as 
President Clinton's special envoy to Yugoslavia on Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke and Secretary or State Madeleine Albright both believe  
``that Kosovo and peace implementation in Kosovo and throughout the 
Balkans ... is a major test case for the United Nations,'' said 
State Department spokesman James Foley. 
</P>
<P>
	While Holbrooke may be laying down his mark as a traveling U.N.  
ambassador, he's still got a lot of fences to mend in New York. The 
U.S. seat has been vacant for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Resentment toward the United Nations and its policies by  
conservatives in Congress has grown; and some of it has been 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the tensions: recent criticism of the slow U.N. start  
in assuming civil administration responsibilities in Kosovo from 
NATO. And it hasn't just come from congressional Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Such criticism also was expressed last month by Defense  
Secretary William Cohen and Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, in congressional testimony, although 
Albright --during a trip to Kosovo late last month -- said she was 
satisfied with the pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke will also have to deal with criticism from Russia and  
France on the Security Council over the continued U.S. airstrikes 
against Iraq. And the issue of U.S. back payments continues to 
fester. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional conservatives have long held up the back payments,  
which have swollen to over $1.2 billion by U.S. tally and to a 
whopping $1.6 billion by U.N. count. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though arch U.N.-critic Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., cut a  
deal with the administration for repaying the bulk of the 
arrearage, the funds are far from in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed a State Department spending bill in June  
providing for $926 million in arrears, but the House version passed 
in July provides no arrearages money at all. 
</P>
<P>
	That will put the burden for coming up with the funds on Helms  
and other Senate negotiators in September when the two sides meet 
to produce a compromise bill. 
</P>
<P>
	And Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., is threatening to attach  
unrelated anti-abortion language. Such a move, if successful, could 
draw another Clinton veto like the one that torpedoed funds for the 
United Nations two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his tortured confirmation process, Holbrooke agreed  
to support a Senate demand that the U.S. share of the regular U.N. 
budget be reduced from the present 25 percent to 20 percent; and 
that its share of peacekeeping operations be reduced from 31 
percent to 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Budgetary discipline will be my watchword,'' Holbrooke told  
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also supporting other 
cost-cutting changes. 
</P>
<P>
	These words could come back to haunt him.  
</P>
<P>
	Other U.N. members are likely to scoff at the U.S. budget  
``cuts,'' since any reduction in U.S. payments would have to be 
approved by the U.N. General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	And unless the United States pays at least $350 million of its  
arrears by Dec. 31, it could be in the embarrassing position of 
losing its General Assembly seat -- although its Security Council 
slot is secure. 
</P>
<P>
	It all adds up to a lot of negotiating for the Clinton  
administration's most celebrated negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
	To satisfy the administration, Congress and the United Nations,  
Holbrooke ``will have to thread the eye of the needle, and it won't 
be easy,'' said Chris Madison, a spokesman for Sen. Joseph Biden, 
D-Del., senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.

<HEADLINE> Bush Pushes Free Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush pitched open  
trade Wednesday to a part of the country where many feel stung by 
it, declaring, ``We'll be prosperous if this nation does not 
retreat within its borders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush opened a three-day Southern swing with a series of events  
in South Carolina, where his rivals for the Republican presidential 
nomination are working hard for an early February primary. Next 
come campaign stops and fund-raisers in North Carolina and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has been a strong advocate of the North American Free Trade  
Agreement pioneered by his father when he was president and put 
into effect in 1994 by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas exports to Mexico have jumped by more than 16 percent in  
two years on the strength of NAFTA. But the results have been 
uneven by industry and region, with critics citing a particular 
toll on textile mills and other industries of the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fearful build walls,'' Bush told the Charleston Rotary  
Club in a wide-ranging stump speech that included his usual defense 
of liberalized trade. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference after his speech, Bush, for once, faced  
only drug-free questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about an emotional regional issue, he said it was up to  
people in South Carolina to decide whether the Confederate flag 
should continue to fly over the Statehouse. The NAACP has called 
for a tourist boycott of South Carolina because the flag still 
flies and some like-minded groups have canceled convention plans in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
	On trade, Bush acknowledged harm done to the textile industry  
and said, without being specific, that he supports ``anti-dumping'' 
laws to prevent some economic sectors from being obliterated. But 
in the main, he said, the United States must compete in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I say that free trade is healthy for our economy,'' he told  
reporters. ``We want Mexico to succeed, not fail. After all, they 
are our friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, announcements of major plant closures have  
been made three times just this year, eliminating jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say NAFTA has been a success, citing increased  
exports and improved relations with neighbors. Opponents say the 
deal has drained jobs from the United States by encouraging 
companies to relocate to Mexico, hire low-paid workers and ship the 
manufactured products back. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican candidate Pat Buchanan calls for a stop to NAFTA when  
he campaigns in South Carolina, warning against the 
``deindustrialization of America.'' Most other candidates in both 
parties either support the deal or have not made it an issue.

<HEADLINE> Family Turning To Mint for Money / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEMPTON, N.D. (AP) -- After struggling for years to turn a profit  
with traditional North Dakota crops such as wheat and sunflowers, 
Bob and Karen Landman are making money with mint. 
</P>
<P>
	Not ``a mint,'' but mint. The Landmans have the state's only  
known mint farm, producing spearmint oil that is used to make 
toothpaste, chewing gum and mouthwash. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I started this, I thought it'd be a nice little  
supplement on the farm,'' he said during a break from harvest last 
week. ``But now we rely on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Landmans' first four crops lost money, but their  
sweet-smelling operation in northeastern North Dakota was in the 
black last year, Landman said. 
</P>
<P>
	They started experimenting with mint in the early 1990s after  
touring a mint farm during a camping trip in Montana. They 
eventually invested in a distillery and mint harvesting equipment, 
but the early years were difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``That first summer when I was buying this equipment, I had a  
hard time sleeping a lot of nights,'' Bob Landman said. ``Now I 
work so hard I have no trouble sleeping at night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Landmans have about 300 acres of spearmint, which will  
produce more than 12,000 pounds of oil. They quit growing 
peppermint because the plants didn't do well during North Dakota's 
brutal winters, but they still have some home-cooked peppermint 
paddies in the freezer. 
</P>
<P>
	Their operation also includes 2,600 acres of wheat, durum,  
sunflowers and beans. Mint is harvested in July and August, before 
the other crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Landman, a fourth-generation farmer, said he would have trouble  
staying on the farm if he produced the same crops as his father and 
grandfather. He or his wife would be working a second job off the 
farm without the money from the mint, he said as he hauled the 
harvested crop through a rugged field with a beat-up pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have had to do something, because I would have gone  
under,'' Landman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The green mint plants are swathed, chopped and then hauled to  
the still, where steam is injected into the leaves to extract the 
oil. The oil is then separated and put into drums before being 
shipped. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvest normally lasts about three weeks, but it can go longer  
if weather doesn't cooperate. It's a grueling process, regardless 
of the duration. 
</P>
<P>
	Landman tries to get at least six hours of sleep during mint  
harvest, and his dirt-stained pants are evidence of an arduous day. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife brings out meals and works until dark running the mint  
still. 
</P>
<P>
	The Landmans' children, Sam, 10, and Daniel, 5, also help out  
during harvest. Daniel is just tall enough to guide trucks as they 
back up to pull mint-filled trailers up to the still. 
</P>
<P>
	The Landmans have two-year contracts with companies in Michigan  
and Indiana that pay about $12 to $14 per pound of spearmint oil. 
Mint prices have been lower this year because of an oversupply 
caused by struggling Asian economies. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Landmans say the mint market still beats wheat prices.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's the only thing making money,'' Bob Landman said.

<HEADLINE> New ABC Game Show Has Record Winner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC's hit new game show on Wednesday crowned its  
first half-millionaire, a Virginia lawyer who passed up a chance to 
double his winnings because he didn't know heavy metal music. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Shutterly, 46, walked away with $500,000 from the show,  
``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire.'' ABC believes that is the highest 
cash award ever given to a game show contestant in television 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just hasn't quite registered yet,'' said Shutterly, a  
father of three from Richmond, Va. ``It will take a couple of days 
until it settles in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has some experience counting game show winnings. Shutterly  
earned $49,000 a decade ago as a four-time champion on 
``Jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the tradition of the new prime-time game show, Shutterly  
answered a series of questions to build up his winnings, earning 
$500,000 because he correctly identified Pope John Paul I as Albino 
Luciani. 
</P>
<P>
	He was offered one last question and a chance to win a million.  
But if he got it wrong, Shutterly's winnings would be sliced to 
$250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	For the final query, Shutterly had to identify the initial hard  
rock Grammy Award winner when the music awards show established the 
category in 1989. The winner, Jethro Tull, was controversial 
because it doesn't really play hard rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Presented with four choices, Shutterly said he felt certain of  
only one thing: that the winner wasn't Jethro Tull. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisely, he chose to pass on the question and leave with  
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' has been a surprise summer hit  
for ABC during its run of 13 shows in 14 nights. Its audience has 
been increasing throughout the run, and Tuesday night's count of 
just under 16 million viewers was its highest yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Hungry for a success, ABC has already promised producers that  
the game show will be back. 
</P>
<P>
	An international version of the game show has been aired in four  
other countries since last year. None of the overseas versions have 
ever awarded as much as $500,000, ABC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shutterly said he has only one immediate plan for his winnings,  
and it shows he may have a future as a commercial pitchman, too. He 
echoed the boast of sports stars in commercials after they've won 
the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids want to go to Disney World,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hokies To Join Big East in 2001-02 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Virginia Tech, a member of the Big East  
football league since its inception in 1991, will become a full 
member of the conference beginning in the 2001-02 academic year, 
the league announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hokies will become the 14th member of the league.  
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Tech was offered full membership in the league in June,  
but athletic director Jim Weaver said last month he wanted to delay 
the move until 2001 to reduce the school's withdrawal fee from the 
Atlantic 10 basketball league by $300,000, and to see if Miami, 
another marquee team, was leaving for the Atlantic Coast 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hokies eventual full membership is contingent on the  
composition of the league remaining unchanged, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hokies haven't been an all-sports member of a conference  
since leaving the Southern Conference in 1965, but have used their 
affiliation with the Big East to help push their football team into 
the national spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Virginia Tech beat Texas 28-10 in the Sugar Bowl and  
the following year played in the Orange Bowl, losing 41-21 to 
Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hokies have been to bowls six straight seasons.  
</P>
<P>
	Tech earns about $100,000 a year under the Atlantic 10's  
revenue-sharing plan, which includes money from TV contracts and 
tournaments. Weaver has said Tech would earn at least $500,000 to 
$750,000 a year from the Big East pot, and possibly more.

<HEADLINE> Hatch Apologizes for Comparisons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Sen. Orrin Hatch said Wednesday he had  
been ``inarticulate'' and apologized to NAACP officials for a 
statement in which he contrasted homosexual rights and black 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah Republican and GOP presidential candidate was widely  
criticized earlier this month for saying, ``People of color can't 
do anything about their color.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch then continued: ``I do believe gay people have a choice to  
live within the legal rules or not. That's why we have civil-rights 
laws to protect African-Americans from discrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeanetta Williams, president of the Salt Lake branch of the  
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, called 
Hatch's remark ``a poor articulation of what he was trying to 
say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heather Barney, a Hatch spokeswoman, said Hatch ``apologized for  
being inarticulate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He did note that he was coming from a strictly legal  
perspective, that there is judicial precedent that the courts have 
treated race as distinct from sexual orientation, which is the 
point he was making,'' Barney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Darin Hobbs of the Gay and Lesbian Political Action Committee in  
Salt Lake City said Hatch did the right thing by apologizing to the 
NAACP. He said Hatch also should apologize to Utah's gay community. 
</P>
<P>
	``The senator is unable to recognize the commonalities between  
homophobia and racism,'' Hobbs said. ``Both are bigotries rooted in 
fear and ignorance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and Edward J. Lewis, president of the NAACP tri-state  
conference for Utah, Nevada and Idaho, said they felt Hatch's 
apology was sincere after meeting with him for 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and Lewis said Hatch and his wife, Elaine, are lifelong  
NAACP members. Hatch co-sponsored a bill to award civil-rights 
pioneer Rosa Parks the Congressional Gold Medal, which is Congress' 
highest honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Barney said Hatch has enjoyed a good relationship with the  
NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
	``His door has always been open to Jeanetta and the NAACP,'' she  
said. ``They meet regularly and he is proud of some of the things 
he has been able to accomplish which benefit minority communities 
in Utah.''

<HEADLINE> Braves' Maddux To Miss Next Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Sixteen-game winner Greg Maddux will miss his  
next start for the Atlanta Braves after fluid was discovered in his 
injured wrist, while reliever Rudy Seanez could be out for the 
season with a stress fracture in his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux, who chipped a bone in his wrist last weekend while  
diving for a foul pop-up, said he would skip Friday night's game at 
St. Louis to give his injured wrist more time to heal. Terry 
Mulholland will start in his place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I could pitch,'' said Maddux, 16-6 and a four-time  
Cy Young winner. ``I played catch (Tuesday) and it was pretty sore 
an hour later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team doctors advised Maddux to miss his next start after  
discovering fluid in the injured area. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to try to get it out before I throw,'' Maddux said.  
``If I tried to throw this start, I would probably miss the next 
one. We'll wait a week to 10 days to see how it is. It's the old 
better-safe-than-sorry plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux, who has won six straight starts, said the fluid should  
dissipate with rest and he expects to rejoin the rotation for 
Tuesday's game at Cincinnati. In the meantime, the Braves' five-man 
rotation can accommodate his missed start because team is off 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm lucky that my day to pitch was the off-day,'' Maddux said.  
``I'm not going to screw up the other guys. If everything goes 
well, I'll slide right back in next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seanez, one of the team's most valuable middle relievers, was  
placed on the 15-day disabled list Monday after an MRI disclosed 
the stress fracture. He expects to undergo another examination next 
week to see if the injury has improved. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're saying it's going to be six to eight weeks, but I'm  
hoping for mid-September,'' said Seanez, 6-1 with a 3.35 ERA and 
three saves in 56 games. ``That would be the best case if things go 
perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seanez has been plagued by injuries throughout his career. This  
is the seventh stint on the DL. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves began Thursday with a 1 1/2-game lead over the New York  
Mets in the NL East. With less than five weeks remaining in the 
regular season, Seanez hopes to return in time to make a few 
appearances before the 25-man postseason roster is set. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would give me plenty of time to make sure,'' he said.  
``If not, then I'll shut it down for the year.''

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Teen Shoots and Kills Father </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHELBYVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A 15-year-old boy killed his father  
and then shot and wounded his mother when he fired at the bathroom 
door she was hiding behind, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Hardrick was captured shortly after Tuesday's shooting  
when he crashed his family's car about 25 miles from home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was crying and banging his head against the side of the  
window'' of the police car following his arrest, Columbia police 
Lt. James Hanvy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police did not say if they knew of a possible motive. The boy  
was charged with first-degree murder and attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing was set for Sept. 9 to decide whether he'll be  
transferred to adult court. Defense attorney Robert Marlow said he 
likely will seek a psychiatric examination for the boy, who was 
under a psychiatrist's care and taking medication for depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers learned of the shooting when the boy's mother, Eleanor  
Hardrick, waved over a motorist outside her home. She was bleeding 
from a bullet wound to the leg and had gashes on her head. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrived to find the body of James Hardrick, 59, in the  
living room. He was lying on a couch when he had been shot in the 
head with a rifle. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hardrick said her son shot her husband. She was outside  
waiting to drive Matthew to school, ran inside and tried to call 
911 but was attacked by her son, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she ran into a bathroom and locked the door, but her  
son shot off the knob, wounding her, Sheriff Clay Parker said. 
Matthew entered the bathroom and his mother tried to wrestle the 
gun away before fleeing, apparently through a window, Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
	He followed her outside and beat her and took off in the car, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardrick, a sophomore at Shelbyville Central High School, has a  
juvenile arrest record but police refused to give details other 
than to say one charge was for spitting on a teacher's car. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hardrick, 53, was in fair condition at a hospital.

<HEADLINE> Requiem for Mozart-Smart Theory? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A Mozart sonata may lift the soul, but it won't make listeners  
any smarter, according to two studies that challenge previous 
research and popular belief about the effect of music on 
intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest results call into question 1993 research that showed  
college students temporarily gained up to nine IQ points after 
listening to a Mozart piano sonata. The widely reported findings 
spawned an industry of supposedly mind-enhancing recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	South Dakota, Georgia and Tennesee, as well as the National  
Academy of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences, give away classical CDs to 
new mothers. And several ``Mozart Effect'' CDs have been on the 
Billboard classical charts since January 1998. 
</P>

	``Listening to classical music is probably good for kids -- good  
for reasons other than it's going to make them smarter,'' said 
Harvard Medical School researcher Christopher Chabris, who analyzed 
16 previous studies and published his findings in Thursday's issue 
of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Chabris found that IQ improvements, if any, from listening to  
Mozart were not statistically significant. In an accompanying study 
in Nature, other researchers reported that they tried to reproduce 
the 1993 results and failed. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors of the previous research said it's too early to play  
a requiem for the Mozart effect. The latest studies tried to find 
evidence of improvement in overall intelligence, while the original 
results were more limited, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In every talk that I give, I make it very clear that there is  
no scientific evidence that listening to music will make you 
smarter,'' said Fran Rauscher, lead researcher of the 1993 study 
and a psychology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh. 
</P>
<P>
	She said her test subjects showed the greatest improvement in  
spatial thinking skills, which are useful in doing math or playing 
chess. The participants were asked to visualize the shape of paper 
after being told how it would be folded or cut. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chabris' analysis of 16 studies involving a total of 714  
people found no significant improvement in either broader abstract 
reasoning or spatial thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	The participants were tested before and after listening to  
Mozart. On average, Mozart listeners' scores were enhanced by 1.4 
IQ points. In the paper-folding test, scores increased by 2.1 
points. Both numbers fall below the 4.5-point difference that would 
be expected of anyone taking the test twice on the same day, 
Chabris said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom-line message is that there is either no Mozart  
effect or a very small Mozart effect,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One study he analyzed showed no difference between students who  
listened to Mozart and those who heard a passage from a Stephen 
King horror story. That suggests that people are better at the 
tests when they're in a good mood, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The original researchers theorized that the music, specifically  
Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major (K. 448), primes higher 
brain functions because it is complex, highly structured and 
nonrepetitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very premature to think that they have made a big dent in  
our results,'' said a co-author of the 1993 study, Gordon Shaw, a 
physicist at the University of California at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other Nature report, researchers said they failed to  
reproduce the original results. In the Mozart effect's strongest 
showing, listeners scored only three points higher than those who 
heard nothing, said Kenneth Steele, an Appalachian State University 
professor in Boone, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Rauscher said the researchers failed to follow the procedures of  
the original work. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Campbell, who has sold recordings that claim to take  
advantage of the Mozart effect, said all the research is too 
narrowly focused. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it is possible to measure one small part of the  
musical process in the brain,'' he said. ``It can make us dance, 
relax the body, intrigue the mind. It affects multiple parts at 
once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Aikin of Danville, Calif., recently bought a ``Mozart  
Effect'' CD because she likes the composer. Her children call it 
``Mommy's happy music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was intrigued by it because it was a nice compilation,'' she  
said. ``Who knows if it raises my children's IQ? Even if it 
doesn't, I'm still happy with it.''

<HEADLINE> Man Nabbed in Calif. Cyclist Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- A man suspected in a minor hit-and-run  
involving a bicyclist was arrested by police in the traffic death 
of another cyclist whose body struck a car's windshield and was 
carried 13 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Isidro Calderon Hernandez, 26, surrendered to authorities  
Tuesday and was booked for investigation of felony hit-and-run, 
police Sgt. Joe Vargas said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Lee LaBord of Orange was hit Sunday night while riding home  
from work. LaBord had just greeted friends who were walking nearby 
when a speeding car ran into him, Vargas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses told authorities that the driver didn't slow down.  
They found LaBord's bike and a sneaker, but not the man's body. 
</P>
<P>
	The body was found Monday morning about 13 miles from where he  
was struck. Police said his body was about 25 feet away from the 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
	Police located Hernandez after they got a tip about a white  
Honda Civic with a smashed windshield. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez was already being investigated for possible  
involvement in a hit-and-run accident May 22 in which a bicyclist 
was scraped, Vargas said, adding, ``We don't think we have a serial 
bicycle-hitter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lilia Calderon, Hernandez's mother, said he has suffered  
recurring headaches since he fell off a scaffold two years ago and 
injured his head.

<HEADLINE> K.C. Jazz Pioneer Pleased With Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Some people lead lives. Life has led Jay  
McShann. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever happened just happened,'' says the 83-year-old avatar  
of Kansas City jazz. ``You know how it is, you just take things as 
they come. You run into a few snags, you try to unsnag them and go 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way of going on, McShann thought Kansas City would  
just be a stopover, and it became his home; he figured he'd be a 
sideman, and became a leader. And he was with Charlie Parker when 
he got his famous nickname. 
</P>
<P>
	He also picked up a nickname himself -- ``Hootie'' -- long before  
another one had his Blowfish. 
</P>
<P>
	McShann is long known for his blues singing and his compelling  
solo piano playing with an indefinable blend of blues and boogie. 
Still going strong, he recently played on a sultry summer night 
with the Duke Robillard Band outdoors at Lincoln Center, then moved 
on to gigs in New England and at the Montreal Jazz Festival. His 
newest CD with Robillard, ``Still Jumpin' the Blues,'' was released 
in May. For the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival earlier this 
year, he put together his own group. 
</P>
<P>
	Born James Columbus McShann in Muskogee, Okla., he started  
playing the piano when he was 12. His parents disapproved, so in 
high school he'd tell his parents he was studying late even though 
he really was listening to Earl ``Fatha'' Hines' radio broadcasts 
from the Grand Terrace Ballroom in Chicago. Hines was an early 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
	McShann got his start by touring with bands in Oklahoma,  
Arkansas, Arizona, and New Mexico. ``Then somebody would make the 
old sheriff mad and he'd come down and raid the place and we got 
out of a job,'' he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
	After one raid, he recalled, ``I said, `I've got an uncle in  
Omaha. I think I'll go up there and see what the cats are doing in 
Omaha.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a bus ticket. I had a layover of two hours in Kansas  
City. I knew Basie had a band at the Reno Club. I thought I'd run 
over to the Reno. I might know some of these cats. 
</P>
<P>
	``A guy in the Reno said, `This is it, right here in Kansas  
City.' I said, `My money is a little low. I don't think I can stick 
around here too long.' He said, `Take my apartment key. Stay as 
long as you want. I'll stay over at my girlfriend's.''' 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of days later someone knocked on his door and said,  
``I'm looking for that piano player just come in town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McShann, then 18, never got to Omaha, but later spent some time  
in Chicago and on the West Coast and served in the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	McShann, a non-drinker, was snookered into some booze one night  
when some fellow musicians had the bartender give him a cold drink. 
``The weather was hot in Kansas City,'' he remembers. ``Every time 
I'd turn it up, it tasted better and better. I didn't know they 
were spiking it with alcohol. When it came time to blow, I couldn't 
get out of the seat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he says, ``My tasting days are over. But not my playing  
days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McShann became a leader when he and two other musicians began to  
play in a basement club in Chicago. ``A union guy came in there 
raising cane. `Who do you think you are, coming in this territory, 
walking in on a job without depositing a contract with the union? 
Who's the leader anyway?' He asked the bass player. `No.' He asked 
the drummer. `No.' He said to me, `You're the leader.' 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us knew the leader made $25 or $30 more. ... They  
dropped it on me. I was satisfied just to play. I didn't have any 
ambitions to be leader.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after that, in 1937, McShann and another musician were  
walking along 12th Street in Kansas City after a gig, listening to 
the music coming from clubs, when he heard something different on a 
saxophone. ``We went in and it was Charlie Parker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parker, known as ``The Bird,'' worked for McShann off and on  
from from 1937 to 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	McShann's orchestra toured extensively, and their recording of  
``Hootie Blues'' was the first to document Parker's emerging 
genius. The band's most popular recording, though, was ``Confessin' 
the Blues,'' and its many modern compositions bridged traditional 
Kansas City jazz and bebop. 
</P>
<P>
	One day they were on their way to the University of Nebraska, to  
play for a dance after a football game. ``Driving along country 
roads, you pass these farms,'' McShann says. ``Chickens hear a car 
passing and run out and run along with the car. This particular 
time the chicken was a little too close and we hit the chicken. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charlie yelled, `Back up. You hit a yardbird!' He got out of  
the car and got it and carried the chicken on into Lincoln. When we 
got to the rooming house, the first thing he did was say, `Miss 
Josie, we ran over this yardbird coming up here. I wonder if you 
would cook it for me.' She fixed the yardbird for Charlie and he 
didn't let nobody else have none of it. That's where he got the 
name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was only after he came out of the Army in 1944 that McShann  
began to sing. An audience member demanded singing; McShann asked 
who in the band sang and got no takers, once again he did it 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured, well, to shut this guy up I'd go ahead on and sing.  
That's how that started.''

<HEADLINE> Cleaner Returns $20,000 in Jewels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- A woman cleaning a Swissair jet found a bag  
containing $20,000 worth of gold, diamonds and pearls and turned it 
in, getting a $400 reward. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt sorry for the woman who had lost it,'' Cruz Escobar,  
who speaks Spanish, said through an interpreter. ``I always 
believed what my mother taught me, that you should never keep 
something that doesn't belong to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the owner of the bag, Viki Koutsis of Fairfax, learned  
about Ms. Escobar's honesty, she wanted to thank the honest 
cleaning lady. The women met on Tuesday at a reception held by Ms. 
Escobar's bosses. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Koutsis embraced the 60-year-old Ms. Escobar, who is from El  
Salvador, and handed her a $300 reward. Ms. Escobar's boss at 
DynAir gave her another $100 from the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jewelry's sentimental value would have been  
irreplaceable,'' Ms. Koutsis, 42, said. ``I would have been 
devastated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Koutsis had lost the bag on her return from a five-week  
vacation in Greece. She had left her driver's license in the bag 
also, which made finding her easy.

<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat delayed a  
trip to Washington today amid reports that the Israelis and 
Palestinians are close to a compromise on reviving a U.S.-brokered 
peace accord. A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said agreement had been reached today on a timetable for 
Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank outlined in the accords 
brokered by President Clinton at Wye River, Md., last October.

Chevrolet Malibu exploded in a crash have offered to accept less 
than a tenth of the $4.9 billion a jury awarded them if General 
Motors agrees to recall similar vehicles, their attorney said 
today. Patricia Anderson, her four children and a family friend are 
willing to settle for about $400 million from GM for injuries 
sustained in the 1993 accident, attorney Brian Panish said. GM 
rejected the settlement offer in a written statement.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI, reversing a 6-year-old course,  
admitted tonight its agents may have fired some potentially 
inflammatory tear gas canisters on the final day of the 1993 
standoff with the Branch Davidian cult near Waco, Texas. Cult 
leader David Koresh and many of his followers died during the fire

to create all-Serb havens within Kosovo, a proposal immediately

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Soccer Match Ends in Riot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- A riot at the end of a soccer game,  
dispersed when police fired tear gas at fighting players and fans, 
left scores of people injured Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors and Arab Games officials said least 12 people were  
hospitalized, including two of three players injured in the melee 
after the match between teams from Palestinian and Libyan 
territories. The street outside the stadium was littered with 
broken glass from windshields of cars rioters smashed. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble started after the Palestinians tied the second-round  
game 2-2 at the end. Angry Libyan fans pulled out the chairs at the 
stadium and attacked Palestinian supporters, who retaliated, 
government officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The witnesses said the fans hurled bottles with frozen water and  
soda bottles looted from snack stands, and fought with wooden 
sticks and iron parts of the uprooted chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, there was trouble in the changing room after the  
players left the field. Libyan players burst into the Palestinian 
area and exchanged blows, a television crew member said on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Libyans were armed with iron chains.  
</P>
<P>
	Two of the players were hospitalized, one with chest and  
shoulder injuries and another with a torn thigh muscle, said Dr. 
Mouafak al-Jamal at the Specialist Hospital where there injured 
were being treated. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the other injured people suffered cuts in the head.  
</P>
<P>
	``I stitched them up and sent them home,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	A senior government official, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said a Libyan player was also seen hurling a tear gas 
canister at the Palestinian locker room before police moved in. 
</P>
<P>
	Riot police intervened, and fired tear gas inside the room to  
disperse the players. They also fired tear gas canisters in the 
tunnel connecting the field to the changing room. 
</P>
<P>
	``The police tried to help us, but they were beaten up, too, by  
the Libyans,'' said Saeed Jandiye, a Palestinian player. 
</P>
<P>
	After dispersing the players, police moved near the gates of the  
stadium, where most of the rioting was taking place. They fired 
tear gas again and fought pitched battles with the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Several police were among those injured, the officials said.  
</P>
<P>
	Tempers had been flaring since the start of the match, when the  
Palestinians scored a goal in the 15th second. The Libyan players 
were further angered because they apparently thought that the 
referee unjustly allowed the game to spill into injury time, giving 
the Palestinians an opportunity to tie.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Zach Thornton stopped three shots, including a  
penalty kick in the 71st minute Wednesday to lead Chicago to a 2-0 
victory over the Kansas City Wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	Thornton spoiled Tony Meola's debut in goal for the Wizards.  
Meola spent six-months on the Kansas City injured-reserve list with 
a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fire (13-11) did not score until the 56th minute when  
Chicago defender Lubos Kubik launched a pass to Ante Razov. Razov, 
the Fire's leading scorer, fired a shot into the far corner of the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City (7-17) had its best chance to score 15 minutes  
later, when Wizards midfielder Chris Klein was brought down hard in 
the box. Preki failed to convert the ensuing penalty kick when 
Thornton deflected his shot off the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago sealed the victory when Roman Kosecki and Andrew Lewis  
fed the ball to Peter Nowak at the top of the Wizards' box. Nowak 
scored to give the Fire a 2-0 lead.

<HEADLINE> Jury Hasn't Decided Martin's Fate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Jurors went a second day Wednesday without  
rendering a verdict in the trial of Miami Dolphins receiver Tony 
Martin, charged with five federal counts of money-laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel of eight women and four men discussed the case, now in  
its fourth week, for slightly more than six hours Wednesday. They 
now have deliberated for about 12 hours over two days. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore instructed the jury to  
return at 8:30 a.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin is being tried alongside Rickey Brownlee, who spent seven  
years in prison for two 1980s drug convictions, in a case largely 
focusing on Brownlee's alleged narcotics activities from 1994 to 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pro Bowl receiver is charged with four counts of laundering  
drug profits and one of conspiracy to hide drug money. He faces a 
prison term of 3-5 years if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin spent the day huddled with his lawyers or with his  
parents, girlfriend and supporters in the waiting area outside the 
courtroom. At one point he dozed in an overstuffed blue chair. 
</P>
<P>
	After lawyers passed along word that the jury was going home,  
Martin signed an autograph for 15-year-old Wilson Louis of Miami. 
Underneath his signature, Martin wrote: ``Good luck in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He looks innocent to me,'' said the teen-ager, who said he  
came to the courthouse because he wants to become a reporter. 
``This is just wasting his time for nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 33, is accused of leasing three cars in his name on  
behalf of Brownlee, who repaid him with cash. He also is accused of 
taking $100,000 in cash to reimburse a check written to Brownlee's 
first lawyer, though he later stopped payment on the check and 
returned the money. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether Martin, who has known Brownlee since  
childhood and calls him his uncle, knowingly accepted drug money.

	The aircraft was immediately surrounded by security forces, and  
Spanish authorities began negotiations with the hijackers in 
French, said Spanish Interior Ministry spokesman Eduardo Planells. 
</P>
<P>
	There appeared to be three hijackers, said Luisa Pena, a  
ministry spokeswoman. They demanded that the plane be refueled and 
flown to Frankfurt, Germany. However, another ministry official 
said later that there might be just one hijacker. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word on the condition of the hostages or  
on the identities of the hijackers or about any other demands. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royal Air Maroc 737-400 was carrying 79 passengers and a  
crew of nine, Pena said. It was en route from Casablanca, Morocco, 
to Tunis, Tunisia, when the hijacking occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	It landed at Barcelona's El Prat airport at about 11 p.m. and  
taxied to an isolated area of the airport, Planells said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja was in contact with  
the Moroccan authorities, Pena said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish airports or planes have been involved in 14 hijackings  
or attempted hijackings since 1969, according to the news agency 
Efe. 
</P>
<P>
	The last was in June 1998 when a 43-year-old Spanish man seized  
an Iberia plane with 130 people aboard while flying from Seville, 
Spain, to Barcelona. The hijacker forced the plane to land in 
Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
	A handheld device he had said was an explosive turned out to be  
television remote control, and he surrendered a few hours after 
talking with his psychiatrist on the telephone.

<HEADLINE> Petroleum Lease Sales in Gulf Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A sharp drop in bids for leases for offshore  
petroleum sites off the coast of Texas was due to consolidation of 
some major energy companies as well as a move toward developing 
leases sold over the past few years, analysts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy companies made a total of $94.6 million in high bids for  
153 federally owned drilling tracts in the western Gulf of Mexico, 
which also includes a portion of off-coast Louisiana, down from 
$553.4 million for 402 tracts last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 18 of the tracts received more than one bid. There were 177  
bids, down from 486 at last summer's sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale followed a pattern set at a March sale of leases to  
drill in the central Gulf, when the number of bids dropped to 273 
from 1,188 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Although wavering oil prices were a factor, many companies have  
a full inventory of lease sites and are moving more towards 
exploration and production, rather than obtaining more leases, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	That is particularly true among the major companies that have  
merged, which are now re-evaluating their joint holdings, said Paul 
Kelly, senior vice president of Rowan Cos. Inc., an oil service 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Wednesday's sale saw more participation by  
smaller independents trying to take advantage of the low interest 
in the sale, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are busy doing other things,'' Kelly said of the major  
companies. ``It gave independents a unique opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Rosenbusch, director of the U.S. Minerals Management  
Service, which manages federal offshore leases, said one more year 
remains on a federal royalty relief law passed by Congress in the 
mid-1990s that gives breaks for deepwater production. After that, 
the MMS has the authority to continue the program with 
congressional action. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to a robust industry in the Gulf of  
Mexico,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest bid for a tract was $11.3 million by the Kerr-McGee  
Oil &AMP; Gas Corp. The tract is located about 250 miles southeast of 
Galveston. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr-McGee also had the largest total of high bids with $33.2  
million for 36 tracts, far ahead of second-place Coastal Oil &AMP; Gas 
USA with $4.5 million for 18 tracts.

<HEADLINE> Fed Boosts Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs for  
millions of Americans for the second time this summer on Tuesday, 
boosting two rates it controls by a quarter point in an effort to 
keep the economy from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank said its actions ``should markedly diminish the  
risk of rising inflation going forward'' -- a statement that some in 
the financial markets hoped would mean the Fed will stop with just 
the two rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
	But many private economists said they were still looking for a  
third tightening move later this year because of their view the 
economy is still growing more rapidly than the Fed considers safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street, after a roller-coaster afternoon following the Fed  
announcement, closed with the Dow Jones industrial average down 
just 16.46 points from Monday's record high. 
</P>
<P>
	But economists suggested investors were being overly optimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	``The market euphoria is not justified,'' said Sung Won Sohn,  
chief economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. ``This is not the 
end of the Fed rate hikes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Sohn said the central bank could move to increase rates  
for a third time at its next meeting on Oct. 5, other analysts 
suggested the central bank will now adopt a wait-and-see stance, 
watching to see whether the economy slows on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed left its policy directive, intended to signal future  
moves, at neutral. But analysts said this meant little since it had 
also moved to neutral after its last meeting on June 30, a change 
that did not stop it from raising rates this time around. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has misjudged the Fed's determination to fight  
inflation,'' said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston 
&AMP; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In its announcement, the Fed said it was increasing its target  
for the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge on 
overnight loans, by a quarter point to 5.25 percent. The rate had 
been boosted -- by the same amount -- for the first time in two years 
on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase triggered a quick quarter-point increase to 8.25  
percent by commercial banks in their prime lending rate, the 
benchmark rate for millions of consumer and business loans, ranging 
from home equity loans to some credit card debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's goal is to raise rates that it directly controls and  
thus influence those set by financial markets, such as 30-year 
mortgage rates, and in that way slow economic activity in such 
interest-sensitive sectors of the economy as auto and home sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank also announced it was raising its largely  
symbolic discount rate, the interest it charges on direct loans to 
banks, by a quarter point to 4.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists saw the double move as an effort by Federal  
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to underscore his resolve to fight 
inflation. He promised Congress in July that the Fed would move 
``promptly and forcefully'' to keep prices stable. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a sharp jump in energy costs, consumer prices the first  
seven months of this year having been rising at a moderate annual 
rate of 2.4 percent. But the Fed is concerned that the economy is 
still growing too strongly and that without some moderation, tight 
labor markets will begin to push wages higher and trigger overall 
price pressures. Unemployment has been hovering around a 
three-decade low of 4.3 percent all year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed believes a little bit of pain now is the price the  
economy has to pay to keep inflation low,'' said Allen Sinai, chief 
economist at Primark Global Economics in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fed critics complained that the central bank is overreacting  
and is running the risk of derailing a global recovery that is 
still struggling to emerge from two years of currency turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	``To bring the global economy out of its slump, the United  
States needs to act as a locomotive and a rate hike only steepens 
the grade up which we're pulling the global economy.'' said Jerry 
Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, 
whose members have been battered this year by falling export sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., complained, ``The Fed seems  
determined to slow the economy down, without regard to the costs it 
imposes on average Americans, and despite evidence that it has been 
wrong, time after time, about inflation.''

<HEADLINE> Colombians, Airline Ring Said Tied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Ten Colombians arrested over the weekend  
in Cali used American Airlines flights to smuggle more than a half 
ton of heroin and cocaine to Miami, a state security official said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleotilde Moreno, an aide to the state security agency's chief  
of investigations, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that an 
airline maintenance company got the drugs aboard the American 
Airlines planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. airline has one flight daily to Miami from Cali.  
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate indication that the arrests were  
connected to a sting operation in the United States involving 
dozens of American Airlines employees and contract workers. They 
were arrested Tuesday on cocaine and marijuana smuggling charges. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines officials could not immediately be reached for  
comment on the Cali-based smuggling ring. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the DAS security agency, the Cali traffickers  
worked through the maintenance company, Aercol, and smuggled more 
than a half ton of heroin to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	DAS spokesman Efrain Marin said the group occasionally smuggled  
cocaine, but opted generally for heroin, which is harder to detect 
and more lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
	Mechanics hid the drugs in the tail sections, behind the pilots'  
seats and in technical compartments. Once in Miami, the heroin was 
received by a man whose identity DAS provided to U.S. authorities, 
the Colombian agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	A respected foreign carrier was used ``because its planes are  
not subjected to as rigorous inspections as occurs with (Colombian) 
airlines.'' DAS said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno said the security agency had been investigating the  
heroin ring for seven months, and believes it had been operating 
for two years. It's alleged leader, Simeon Gomez, is one of the men 
arrested Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia is the source of more than 80 percent of the world's  
cocaine and a growing share of heroin. Three-quarters of the heroin 
seized on the East Coast originates in this Andean nation, U.S. 
officials say.

<HEADLINE> Umps May Try To Topple Phillips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As umpires filed a new unfair labor practice  
charge against owners, there were indications Wednesday that the 
group opposed to union head Richie Phillips will try to topple him 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-Phillips faction has been organizing, a person with  
knowledge of the group's activities said on the condition he not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen umpires, mostly in the AL, issued a statement last  
month criticizing Phillips and they have been seeking more umpires 
to join them. 
</P>
<P>
	They could try to force him out in a union vote, but it's more  
likely they will file a decertification petition with the National 
Labor Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's to be determined,'' said Dave Phillips, a senior umpire  
in the opposition group. ``We haven't discussed that yet. But we 
want our union to be based on democracy, with a non-dictatorial 
leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The opposition group is headed by three AL umps: Dave Phillips,  
who is not related to the union head, Joe Brinkman and John 
Hirschbeck. They voted last spring against giving Richie Phillips a 
new contract and were among the 27 umpires who refused to go along 
with the union's strategy of mass resignations, causing the plan to 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	The union had hoped to force the start of negotiations for a new  
labor deal. Instead, 22 umpires' resignations were accepted, 
effective Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires now claim the resignations were merely symbolic and want  
the NLRB to seek an injunction to keep owners from terminating the 
22. It's unclear when the agency will act. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leadership we have at present is a leadership that has led  
these guys to absolute slaughter,'' Dave Phillips said. ``Less than 
one month and a half ago, we didn't have 22 guys out of work. We, 
the Major League Umpires Association, don't want to see Richie 
Phillips lead them the way of the Professional Air Traffic 
Controllers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, President Reagan fired more than 11,000 PATCO members  
when they defied a back-to-work order. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that whatever they do, they'll be unsuccessful,''  
Richie Phillips said. ``I believe they will do whatever they can do 
to try to cover up their own dishonor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest unfair labor practice charge deals with the 25 new  
umpires baseball has hired from the minor leagues. While many of 
them have been vacation callups this summer, some have been working 
in the minor leagues since they were formally hired last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a clear contract violation,'' Richie Phillips said.  
``It's a clear unilateral change in the contract. It's purposeful 
undermining of the union. It shows there was no need for the hiring 
of these umpires in July for potential duty in September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In papers filed with the NLRB, umpires claim baseball jumped at  
the disunity among umpires in an attempt to break the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said the newly hired umpires will be pressured by  
baseball to side against him in the umpires' internal struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe all these umpires will be shortly receiving serious  
threats from major league baseball, and I expect that to happen in 
the next 24 hours,'' Phillips said. ``They will be told that if 
they support the union, they essentially will have the shortest 
careers in history. That message will come in letter form and phone 
calls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While most AL umps back the dissident group, the NL umps are  
near unanimous in their support of Phillips. There have been rumors 
that many NL umps will walk out next week, and baseball has told 
teams to have replacements available. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've discussed several options,'' said NL ump Jerry Crawford,  
the union president. ``Have we decided on any? No. I wouldn't rule 
out anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owners do not think the latest charge has merit but didn't want  
to respond publicly, one management lawyer said on the condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Phillips also accused Richie Phillips of creating a  
conflict of interest by having Pilot Air Freight Inc., a company 
controlled by the union head, pay some umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that any response by me would only lend a measure of  
dignity to those comments,'' Richie Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some umpires out there that do specific work for  
Richie Phillips, yes there are,'' Crawford said. ``Ask Davey 
Phillips who he gets paid by. Whatever guys do for Pilot Air 
Freight, it's got nothing to do with baseball. There's other guys 
that have other jobs out there. What's the big deal?''

<HEADLINE> U.S., Israel Disagree on Teen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prosecutors in Israel and the United States  
disagree vehemently about an American teen's plea bargain on a 
murder charge, a situation that has revived tensions between the 
allies. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel's Attorney General on Wednesday rejected a Maryland  
prosecutor's criticism that Samuel Sheinbein's likely 24-year 
sentence for the 1997 murder of Alfred Tello Jr. is too lenient. 
</P>
<P>
	``We treated this as a vicious murder by accepting a plea that  
is in the very upper levels of cases for minors,'' Elyakim 
Rubinstein told a press conference packed with Israeli reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein was 17 at the time of the murder. Under Israeli law  
juveniles cannot be tried as adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Israelis worried that the revived flap could adversely  
affect relations between Israel and its closest ally. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Americans don't understand how a strapping, healthy --  
violent, even -- 17-year old can be treated as a minor, and frankly, 
neither can I,'' Amnon Rubinstein, an Israeli legislator who is not 
related to the attorney general, told Israel TV. ``A 17-year-old 
murderer is not a minor. He deserves life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gil Tamari, Israel TV's Washington correspondent, held up the  
front page of The Washington Post on the evening newscast, with the 
headline ``Sheinbein to Plead Guilty in Israel,'' and warned: 
``This case is causing grave damage to Israel's image in the United 
States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amnon Rubinstein led a successful effort this year to modify the  
law that Sheinbein used to seek asylum here -- albeit too late to 
extradite the teen. The 1978 law was designed to protect Jews from 
being prosecuted by anti-Semites. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-born Sheinbein fled to Israel days after the  
dismembered and charred body of Tello was discovered near 
Sheinbein's home in Maryland. Citing his Israeli-born father's 
citizenship, he sought refuge under a broad anti-extradition law. 
Otherwise, he had only visited Israel a few times as a child and 
had little connection with the country. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. authorities expressed outrage at Sheinbein's manipulation  
of the system, and some U.S. lawmakers threatened to cut aid to 
Israel if Sheinbein was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli government was sympathetic and Attorney General  
Rubinstein fought all the way to the Supreme Court to extradite 
Sheinbein. But the court upheld Sheinbein's citizenship earlier 
this year and set the stage for the trial to take place in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein entered a not guilty plea, and the attorney general's  
staff -- seeking to avoid a lengthy, costly trial that would likely 
further exacerbate U.S.-Israel relations -- began negotiating a plea 
bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	As a courtesy, Israeli officials faxed the plea bargain to  
Montgomery County State Attorney Douglas Gansler's office on 
Monday. Under Israeli law -- considerably more liberal than in the 
United States -- Sheinbein is eligible for parole after 16 years, 
likely to include the two years he has already spent in jail. He is 
also eligible for weekend furloughs after six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein is scheduled to reverse his not guilty plea at a Sept.  
2 court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	At a press conference Tuesday, Gansler expressed his outrage  
with the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not pleased with the result, because it's still a very  
short sentence in terms of what he would have gotten here,'' 
Gansler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Rubinstein was furious with Gansler for  
violating a request to keep the deal secret until Sept. 2. The 
judge is free to reject the plea bargain, and could be influenced 
by media reporting of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't feel it was proper, we felt it was a breach of  
professional faith,'' the attorney general said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the attorney general, who said Israel would pay for a member  
of Tello's family to attend the hearing, was quick to declare that 
revived tensions over the extradition case had not damaged 
diplomatic relations between the countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this will not have any effect whatsoever because it  
shouldn't,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others were not so sure.  
</P>
<P>
	``It may very well harm relations between the two legal  
systems,'' Emanuel Gross, a Haifa University criminal law expert, 
told Israel army radio. ``This is about an American citizen who has 
no connection with the state of Israel, and who received shelter 
and protection just because ... he held a sliver of Israeli 
citizenship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government ministers expressed their discomfort with the  
emerging ruckus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that it is forbidden for us to become a shelter''  
for Jewish criminals, Michael Melchior, the minister who liaises 
with the Jewish Diaspora, told Israel radio. ``It is anti-Jewish.''

<HEADLINE> Drug Arrests Hurt American's Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- American Airlines has seen its share of  
adverse publicity in the last several months, ranging from a fatal 
jetliner crash to antitrust charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came Wednesday's arrests of airline employees on  
drug-smuggling charges. 
</P>
<P>
	American officials admit to feeling besieged by bad news, but  
they defend the airline's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be totally unfair to draw any conclusions by linking  
any of these events,'' said spokesman John Hotard. ``This is an 
industry and an airline that lends itself to always being in the 
public eye, and many times, not in a favorable light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50 people, including 30 American Airlines baggage  
handlers and ramp workers based in Miami, were arrested after a 
two-year federal investigation into a drug ring that authorities 
said used the airline's planes to smuggle drugs into the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts said American is not to blame for drug  
smuggling, but they faulted the airline on a number of other 
fronts, especially its troubled record in labor relations, which 
they said has contributed to low employee morale. 
</P>
<P>
	James M. Higgins, an analyst for Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette,  
said if drugs were smuggled on American's planes it was because the 
airline flies between Miami and drug-producing and transit 
countries in the Caribbean and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I do think that employee morale internally at American is  
not great,'' Higgins said. ``Whether that contributed to a culture 
where they're more prone to accidents is an open question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Bernstein, a labor law professor at Washington University  
in St. Louis, said American's labor relations are among the worst 
in the airline industry. He said the result could be disgruntled 
workers who perform the least work possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it would have anything to do with safety, but  
it's hard for someone who is unhappy about their job to be as 
efficient or enthusiastic,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	American's relations with its pilots reached a low point in  
February, when about one-fourth of its 9,500 pilots called in sick 
for several days to protest the lack of an agreement over the 
airline's absorption of lower-paid pilots from Reno Air, which 
American bought in December. The job action caused the cancelation 
of 6,700 flights, and a federal judge fined the union $45.5 million 
for ignoring a back-to-work order. 
</P>
<P>
	Next month, flight attendants will vote on a contract proposal  
and even airline officials are bracing for union rejection. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 1, an American jetliner crashed while landing during a  
storm in Little Rock, killing 11 people. Fatigue is suspected of 
being a factor. The co-pilot had been on duty more than 13 hours 
the day of the crash, although that is within the 14-hour duty 
period in American's pilot contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board and a contractor hired  
by American are looking into the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, an anonymous pilot wrote in a union grievance report  
that he and the co-pilot fell asleep for a half-hour while flying 
over Mexico en route to Central America. The union charged that 
American doesn't strictly enforce crew rest rules. 
</P>
<P>
	American's tart reply: The charge came from the same union that  
claimed 2,500 pilots suddenly became ill in February. 
</P>
<P>
	American is also being sued by the Justice Department, which  
accuses American of predatory pricing to drive competitors out of 
routes in the Midwest. Since April, eight class-action lawsuits 
have been filed against American charging monopoly practices. 
</P>
<P>
	David Margulies, a public relations consultant in Dallas, gave  
American good marks for its response to all the unfavorable 
incidents. He praised chairman Donald Carty for cutting short a 
trip to Japan after hearing of the Little Rock crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Margulies said, American has conveyed a cold image. He  
recalled an official boasting about removing olives from in-flight 
salads to save money -- it might have pleased shareholders but not 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't create a warm, fuzzy feeling about American  
Airlines,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With John Lewis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Lewis, famous for his 40-plus years of  
playing piano and composing for the Modern Jazz Quartet, still 
improvises when he plays live and makes recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, improvisation is one of the most exciting parts of  
making music,'' Lewis said during an interview in his Manhattan 
apartment. ``You're not confined. If you have enough imagination, 
you don't have to repeat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 17th century, Lewis said, Bach and Handel composed  
variations on themes so they wouldn't repeat. And musicians 
improvised a lot. ``You have to try to be as perfect as you can 
when you're improvising -- without the advantage of an eraser,'' he 
said. ``And it's like composing -- it should be a complete and 
satisfying experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis was born in LaGrange, Ill., in 1920, and grew up in  
Albuquerque, N.M. He began piano lessons at 6. Before he was 12, he 
had earned Boy Scout merit badges in music, played for a Holy 
Roller church for 50 cents and played Saturday nights at a 
nightclub for $1. 
</P>
<P>
	He studied at the University of New Mexico and got a master's  
degree from the Manhattan School of Music in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis and nine other American jazz pianists, billed as 100  
Golden Fingers, toured Japan this summer, giving 14 concerts in 18 
days. For the finale, they all played ``Take the A Train,'' quickly 
trading places on two pianos. 
</P>
<P>
	The Modern Jazz Quartet began recording in 1952 with Lewis,  
vibraphonist Milt Jackson, bassist Percy Heath and drummer Kenny 
Clarke. When Clarke moved to Paris in 1955, Connie Kay replaced him 
and the quartet continued until Kay's death in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis took time out from his busy schedule to answer questions  
about his long career. 
</P>
<P>
	1. Do you miss the Manhattan Jazz Quartet?  
</P>
<P>
	Lewis: Yes. It would be hard not to miss a major part of my  
life. Milt, Percy and I keep in contact. They're still playing. 
Percy's youngest brother, Albert, played drums with us for a while 
but he lives in California, which makes rehearsing difficult. So 
far we haven't had any reunions. 
</P>
<P>
	2. What is your favorite context for playing piano?  
</P>
<P>
	Lewis: My favorite is solo. It's very difficult to do and takes  
a lot of work to make it come off. For a listener, a band is very 
attractive. There's a lot of things to look at; it's actually a 
show. The most impressed I ever was with a band was the Duke 
Ellington Band playing in Albuquerque in 1939 and 1941. They were 
impressive before they ever played a note. When they played, it was 
overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Your new CD is solo piano, isn't it?  
</P>
<P>
	Lewis: Yes. It's `Evolution,' the first of three CDs for  
Atlantic Records. Two pieces from it will be in the next CD, which 
will be a trio album, and two pieces from the first two will be in 
the third CD, played by an instrumental group including horns. At 
least one tune will be on all three. That's an opportunity for me 
and other people who are interested to see how a piece of music can 
evolve. 
</P>
<P>
	4. Did you compose anything on ``Evolution''?  
</P>
<P>
	Lewis: Yes. `At the Horse Show' I wrote for this album. `For  
Ellington' I wrote for the MJQ as the title song for an album. Milt 
wrote one for that album; the rest were Ellington pieces. I made it 
feel like a piece of church music. It starts off like a simple 
hymn. I tried to make it turn to a gospel feeling and go back to 
the hymn to close. I was inspired by Ellington's devotion to his 
sacred concerts near the end of his life. `Afternoon in Paris' and 
`Two Degrees East, Three Degrees West' I wrote before the quartet, 
in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	5. How has your piano playing changed over the years?  
</P>
<P>
	Lewis: I worked in Dizzy Gillespie's big band from 1946 into  
1948 and again in 1950. I accompanied singers at the beginning of 
our quartet. We were trying to build up literature; everybody had 
to do other things. I was fortunate to accompany Ella Fitzgerald 
for six months. I made records and toured Japan with Helen Merrill. 
And I played in theaters for Sarah Vaughan when I was working for 
Dizzy. My piano playing may seem like it has changed but it hasn't. 
Maybe some things have become refined and I can control them 
better. But it hasn't really changed. I do what I do and that's it.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Heads Toward U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis was headed for this  
island chain early Thursday with 75 mph winds after being upgraded 
from a tropical storm. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami urged people on the  
southeast coast of the United States, primarily North and South 
Carolina, to closely monitor Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipating possible heavy rains, the South Florida Water  
Management District on Wednesday started to drain canals to stave 
off flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	``The uncertainty is killing us,'' said district spokeswoman Ann  
Overton. 
</P>
<P>
	Bahamians took a nonchalant attitude.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think some degree of complacency has developed in the  
Bahamas because we have had the good fortune of escaping a direct 
hit of a hurricane for a number of years,'' said Godwin Blyden of 
the Bahamas National Disaster Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 a.m. EDT, Dennis was centered near latitude 23.8 north,  
longitude 73.1 west, 290 miles east-southeast of Nassau, the 
Bahamian capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm was moving northwest near 5 mph and expected to  
strengthen. It was upgraded to a hurricane late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's looking like it's going to be in the central Bahamas by  
Thursday,'' said meteorologist Trisha Wallace at the National 
Hurricane Center in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Before it was upgraded to hurricane status, Dennis was one of  
three tropical storms in the area. Emily sprang up Tuesday at near 
hurricane strength, surprising forecasters who hadn't even thought 
it was a depression. Wednesday morning, they warned people in the 
Lesser Antilles Islands in the southeastern Caribbean to monitor 
the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	But Emily weakened quickly. Wednesday night it had top winds of  
45 mph and was centered near 13.4 north latitude, 55.7 west 
longitude, 255 miles east of Barbados. It was moving northwest at 
about 7 mph with little change expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Emily may tangle with Tropical Storm Cindy, which was near  
hurricane strength with winds of 70 mph but far out in the Atlantic 
with no threat to land. Meteorologists explained that if the storms 
do combine, the resulting system would probably not suddenly become 
twice as strong.

	Chelsea advanced with a scoreless tie against Skonto Riga in  
Latvia, advancing on 3-0 aggregate. It joined Manchester United and 
Arsenal in the final 32. 
</P>
<P>
	Dynamo Kiev, a semifinalist last year, tied Denmark's Aalborg  
2-2 at home on Maksim Shatskikh's goal in the final minute and 
advanced on 4-3 aggregate.

<P>
	Heiko Herrlich's header with two minutes left gave Borussia  
Dortmund a 1-0 victory at home to FK Teplice. Borussia Dortmund, 
which won the tournament in 1996, advanced on 2-0 aggregate. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams will be drawn into eight four-team groups on Thursday at  
Monte Carlo, Monaco. The top two teams in each group advance to the

<HEADLINE> Choosing Options for Long-Term Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Americans are living longer and healthier than  
ever before. Yet many will find themselves needing long-term care 
at some point in their life, cautions an insurance expert at the 
College for Financial Planning. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why it's important to plan ahead in order to choose the  
best option or options to pay for any long term care needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``An American Health Care Association study several years ago  
found that one in three people who reach the age of 65 will spend 
at least three months in a nursing home, and one in four will spend 
a full year or longer in a nursing home,'' says Michael Snowdon, an 
academic associate at the College. 
</P>
<P>
	With nursing home costs running $40,000 to $60,000 a year, even  
a short stay can be expensive. And the percentage of people needing 
home health care is even higher, Snowdon notes. 
</P>
<P>
	So how do you pay for these long-term care costs? Snowdon says  
there are several options, and as people reach their late 50s and 
early 60s they need to think seriously about what is the best 
option for them. They also need to be aware of some of the 
misconceptions people have about paying for long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the biggest misconceptions is that Medicare, or the  
Medicare supplemental insurance known as Medigap, will pay for 
long-term care. Medicare will pay for skilled nursing and home care 
only in limited circumstances; Medigap policies don't substantially 
expand that coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicaid will pay for long-term nursing home stays, and  
sometimes home health care, but a person basically has to be 
impoverished before qualifying for coverage. Furthermore, Snowdon 
says, experience has shown that Medicaid patients tend not to 
receive the same level of care compared to what they would receive 
on a private-pay basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The most favorable option for paying for long-term care usually  
is long-term care insurance, either private or through group 
coverage at work, according to Snowdon. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, long-term care insurance isn't necessarily the best  
answer for everyone,'' Snowdon says. ``You have to look at its cost 
effectiveness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, he says a study by the United Seniors Health  
Cooperative recommends that long-term care insurance can be a good 
buy for households where there are more than $75,000 in assets per 
person, income of $30,000 or more per person, and they can afford 
premium increases of 20 percent to 30 percent in the future. People 
who have less than these assets and income may find the insurance 
coverage too expensive and may be better off relying on other 
options. 
</P>
<P>
	Snowdon adds that households with substantial assets may be able  
to fund their own long-term care needs, though insurance would 
minimize the impact on those assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the value of long-term care insurance in many  
circumstances, people who could afford to pay for it often refuse 
to buy it, Snowdon says. This doesn't make sense, he adds. ``A 
homeowner would never risk going without homeowner's insurance. Yet 
your potential exposure to long-term care is significantly higher 
than the risk to your home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snowdon notes several other alternatives people may want to  
consider if long-term care insurance isn't in the picture. One 
option is to own life insurance with a rider that pays out a 
portion of the face value of the policy -- typically up to 2 percent 
a month -- for long-term care needs. 
</P>
<P>
	This may be useful if you have a brief need, Snowdon says, but  
if you need care for a long time you're ``cannibalizing'' your life 
insurance policy because you're eating away what's left of the 
policy's proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, Snowdon points out that you will need to have a lot  
of life insurance to fund an annual nursing home bill of $40,000 or 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Another option, he says, is to use a reverse mortgage. This is  
when the mortgage company pays you money based on the equity you've 
built up in your home. The money isn't paid back until you die or 
sell your home. This can be helpful in situations where someone is 
cash-poor but house-rich, though Medicaid may be the better option 
since you may not be required to give up your home. 
</P>
<P>
	Retirees also may want to consider setting aside an annuity  
specifically to cover long-term care. If you never need it, the 
money can be used for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The important point is to consider ahead of time what option or  
options are best for you, Snowdon says. For example, if you have 
the money and you're in good health, you might insure part of the 
risk through long-term care coverage and pay for the remainder out 
of personal savings or an annuity.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Vacation: Read, Rest, Sun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- No fund-raisers, no parties, no dinner  
out. The president read. The first lady nursed a summer cold. They 
joined their daughter on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday was a quiet, relaxed vacation day for Bill, Hillary and  
Chelsea Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House press office brushed aside attempts to stir  
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in Washington, a spokesman for the White House counsel's  
office told a newspaper that, as was said during his 1992 campaign, 
the president had never used cocaine. Not once. 
</P>
<P>
	At the vacation press center on the Massachusetts island of  
Martha's Vineyard, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said 
the denial of cocaine use was ``both authorized and accurate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart had told reporters on Monday that the president has  
expressed no interest in news stories discussing whether Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush, the front-runner for the Republican presidential 
nomination, ever used cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the cigar. The White House spokesman said it  
wasn't lit. 
</P>
<P>
	Enterprising photographers snapped the president Monday on the  
second hole of the Farm Neck golf club here chomping on a large 
stogie. A story said he had lit it and was puffing on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen the president light a cigar,'' Lockhart said  
when asked about it. ``I've seen him, obviously, chew on the end of 
it. I don't think he had a lit cigar. I've seen the picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no smoking gun, as the case may be.''  
</P>
<P>
	After five straight nights of fund-raisers and social  
engagements, the Clintons spent the night at their borrowed Oyster 
Pond vacation home. Lockhart described the first lady's nagging 
summer cold as ``nothing serious'' and said that when he saw the 
Clintons, they were on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said the Clintons wanted to unwind and relax before  
heading to New York state this weekend for a busy round of money 
raising for Democrats generally and for the first lady's 
near-certain run for a New York Senate seat in particular. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll try to enjoy themselves as well as they begin their  
second vacation week in the Hamptons on Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect he'll have some time to relax there and enjoy the  
wonderful, natural surroundings,'' Lockhart said. ``The ocean, the 
beach and potentially some fine golf courses.''

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' Top Pick Hurts Hamstring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Miami Dolphins top draft pick J.J. Johnson  
may have to wait a little longer to make his NFL debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson reinjured his left hamstring in practice Tuesday and  
will likely miss Saturday's exhibition game against the Detroit 
Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	The rookie running back strained his hamstring in a scrimmage  
Aug. 7 and has practiced little since. The injury has kept Johnson 
from contending for playing time with incumbent running back Karim 
Abdul-Jabbar and rookie Cecil Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	``J.J. Johnson reinjured the hamstring, actually in a little  
different place than it was before,'' coach Jimmy Johnson said 
Wednesday. ``It's not as serious as it originally was, but it looks 
doubtful for him this week.''

<HEADLINE> UN Debates Childrens' Plight in War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Dozens of ambassadors and a top U.N.  
official called Wednesday for all governments to ratify treaties to 
protect children of war and to cease enlisting soldiers younger 
than 18 to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	At an open meeting of the United Nations Security Council on the  
plight of children in war, delegates voiced alarm at the increasing 
numbers of children killed or maimed in wars or actively recruited 
to fight in them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children neither start wars nor perpetrate them. They should  
not pay the price for adults' wars,'' said the deputy British 
Ambassador Stuart Eldon in announcing more than a half million 
dollars to support U.N. projects for children affected by wars. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. figures show more than 300,000 children under 18 are known  
to be currently under arms around the world, in places such as 
Sudan, Colombia, Angola, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. In most of 
these countries, children under 15 -- and even as young as seven or 
eight -- have reportedly been taking part in armed conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last decade, 2 million children have been killed, 1  
million orphaned, 6 million seriously injured or disabled and 12 
million made homeless because of war. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict,  
Olara Otunnu, made a pointed appeal Wednesday for the ratification 
and worldwide application of the Geneva Conventions, the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child and the treaty establishing the 
International Criminal Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Words on paper cannot save children and women in peril,''  
Otunnu told the council. 
</P>
<P>
	His call was backed by ambassadors from Malaysia, Argentina,  
Canada, the Netherlands and Russia, among others. Several 
ambassadors including those from Slovenia and Britain also backed 
Otunnu's plea to raise the age limit for the recruitment of 
soldiers from the present 15 to 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, however, opposed the move because it wants to  
retain the ability to recruit high schoolers for the military. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. is also the only country aside from Somalia that hasn't  
signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child. And it was one of 
seven countries that refused to sign the statute creating the 
world's first permanent international criminal court, and has been 
trying to curb its reach to protect U.S. civilians and military 
from political prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy U.S. Ambassador Nancy Soderberg referred indirectly to  
the U.S. positions on the touchy subjects, saying the council 
shouldn't be distracted by the debates ``on the margin of the 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the council ``should focus on where the real abuses are  
-- with children even younger than 15 whose lives are totally 
distorted by their recruitment into armed conflict and brutality -- 
becoming both perpetrators and victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The council had on its agenda a resolution condemning the  
targeting and recruitment of children in war and also pledging to 
prioritize children's needs in future U.N. missions. The council 
also vowed in the resolution to consider the impact sanctions have 
on children whenever they are applied against states.

<HEADLINE> Secret Birth Woman Dies With Baby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OREM, Utah (AP) -- A woman awaiting trial in the unattended birth  
and death of her first baby gave birth in secret again and died 
along with the newborn. 
</P>
<P>
	Darcie Jo Baum, 26, was found dead Tuesday in her apartment. She  
apparently bled to death after giving birth in the bathroom. The 
body of the infant boy was found in the toilet. 
</P>
<P>
	Baum was to go on trial in September on a charge of desecration  
of a body, the most serious charge prosecutors could bring because 
it was unclear whether her first baby was stillborn or she had left 
it to die. The body was found in August 1998 wrapped in a red, 
handmade quilt in a grove of trees near the mouth of American Fork 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	Baum's mother called the apartment Tuesday morning, police Lt.  
Ned Jackson said. Baum's 4-year-old son answered and said his 
mother couldn't come to the phone. When Baum's mother called back, 
the boy said his mother was lying on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers found the boy standing near his dead mother, who was  
covered in blood, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baum denied she killed the first baby or allowed it to die, her  
lawyer Randy Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he did not know Baum was pregnant again.

<HEADLINE> Lemon Drop Kid Eyes Saratoga Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Scotty Schulhofer has a simple  
plan for Belmont Stakes winner Lemon Drop Kid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Win the Travers, win the Gold Cup and go on to the Breeders'  
Cup,'' the Hall of Fame trainer said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid is expected to oppose seven other 3-year-olds in  
$1 million Travers on Saturday at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	The colt, owned by Jeanne and Laddie Vance, then will be pointed  
to the Jockey Club Gold Cup on Oct. 9 at Belmont Park and the 
Breeders' Cup Classic on Nov. 6 at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Lemon Drop Kid's rivals in the 1 1/4-mile Travers will be  
the Elliott Walden-trained Menifee and Ecton Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, second in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness,  
finished eighth in the Belmont. In his only start since, he won the 
1 1/8-mile Haskell Invitational Handicap on Aug. 8 at Monmouth Park. 
</P>
<P>
	In three starts since finishing 12th in the Kentucky Derby,  
Ecton Park won an allowance race at Churchill Downs, finished 
second in the 1 1/8-mile Ohio Derby at Thistledown and won the 1 1/8-mile 
Jim Dandy on Aug. 8 at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	``Menifee is the horse to beat,'' Schulhofer said. ``If it comes  
up sloppy, he has his other horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid finished second, 5 1/4 lengths behind Ecton Park, on  
a sloppy track in the Jim Dandy. 
</P>
<P>
	Schulhofer feels it was the track that did in Lemon Drop Kid.  
</P>
<P>
	``That was it,'' he said. ``The horse ran a good race.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Jim Dandy was first start for Lemon Drop Kid since his  
victory in the 1 1/2-mile Belmont on June 5, and the sixth of the year 
for the colt, a May foal. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning two of six starts, with two seconds and a third,  
as a 2-year-old, Lemon Drop Kid, bought for $200,000 as a yearling, 
opened his 3-year-old campaign by winning an allowance race on Feb. 
27. He next finished fifth in the 1 1/8-mile Blue Grass won by Menifee 
on April 10 at Keeneland, then was ninth in the 1 1/4-mile Kentucky 
Derby on May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	After skipping the 1 3-16-mile Preakness on May 15, Lemon Drop  
Kid finished third in the 1 1/8-mile Peter Pan won by Travers 
probability Best of Luck on a muddy track May 23 at Belmont Park. 
He then won Belmont Stakes in which Derby-Preakness winner 
Charismatic was injured while finishing third 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid was then rested until the Jim Dandy.  
</P>
<P>
	Schulhofer said he has had no second thoughts about not pushing  
Lemon Drop Kid harder. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's done nothing but go forward,'' Schulhofer said. ``I've  
got good owners who let me do what I think is best, and it's worked 
out real well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others expected to be entered in the Travers on Thursday were  
Badger Gold, Cat Thief, Unbridled Jet and Vision and Verse.

<HEADLINE> FBI Readies Reversal on Waco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI sought to craft a statement Wednesday  
that officials said would publicly reverse a 6-year-old course and 
admit agents fired potentially inflammatory tear gas canisters on 
the final day of the 1993 standoff with the Branch Davidian cult 
near Waco, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal law enforcement officials maintained, however, that  
the two canisters could not have started the fire in the wood main 
building that took many lives among the followers of David Koresh. 
</P>
<P>
	The government consistently has disputed the idea that the FBI  
started the fire, and one official said ``the bottom line'' remains 
that the Davidians set the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the two military tear gas canisters, labeled  
pyrotechnic because of their ability to cause a spark, were fired 
just after 6 a.m. on April 19, 1993, six hours before the fire 
began. The canisters were fired not at the wood main structure but 
at a concrete bunker some yards away, bounced off its roof and 
landed in an open field, according to these officials, who spoke 
only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The canisters were tried because other, nonpyrotechnic tear gas  
canisters had not penetrated the bunker, which was linked to the 
main building by tunnels, the officials said. The FBI wanted to 
clear out anyone hiding in the bunker. 
</P>
<P>
	The tear gas canisters inserted in the wooden, main building by  
FBI tanks during the final assault later that day were not 
flammable because of concern about causing a fire, these officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For six years, the FBI and top Justice Department officials have  
categorically insisted no incendiary devices were used by the FBI 
on April 19, when it mounted the assault that ended the 51-day 
siege by federal agents trying to serve a warrant for Koresh's 
arrest on firearms and explosives charges. 
</P>
<P>
	For two days, since a former assistant deputy FBI director,  
Danny Coulson, acknowledged for the first time to the Dallas 
Morning News that the two canisters were fired, FBI officials have 
struggled to issue a public statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Several draft versions were reviewed inside the FBI and by  
Justice Department officials, who privately expressed anger that 
the FBI had allowed Attorney General Janet Reno and other officials 
to issue public denials. Some said the incident would harm the 
credibility of federal law enforcement even if the devices had no 
role in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials were attempting to be certain any new statement would  
be complete and accurate and not have to be revised later. They 
also were proceeding carefully because the issue has been raised in 
a lawsuit against the government by Waco survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	An inquiry was begun to determine why the information about the  
two pyrotechnic canisters was not provided earlier to Reno, FBI 
Director Louis Freeh or Congress, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	One official suggested the information might have been  
considered irrelevant since the canisters were fired long before 
the fire broke out and were fired away from the building that 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
	Coulson, who was founding commander of the FBI's hostage rescue  
team, also told the newspaper the incendiary canisters were fired 
hours before the blaze began and played no role in starting it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're aware of the reports and we're trying to get to the  
bottom of it as quickly as we can,'' Justice Department spokesman 
Myron Marlin said. In July when a documentary filmmaker raised 
allegations the FBI used flammable devices during the final 
assault, Marlin had called them ``nonsense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We know of no evidence to support that any incendiary device  
was fired into the compound on April 19, 1993,'' Marlin said then. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of whether the FBI used pyrotechnic devices has been a  
major focus of an inquiry by the Texas Rangers and a key allegation 
in a pending wrongful-death lawsuit against the government by 
surviving Davidians and families of those who died. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government consistently has disputed accusations  
that the FBI started the fire. Independent investigators concluded 
the fire began simultaneously in three separate places. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI bugs recorded Davidians discussing spreading fuel and  
planning a fire hours before the compound burned. Arson 
investigators also found evidence that gasoline, charcoal lighter 
fluid and camp stove fuel had been poured inside the compound.

<HEADLINE> 3 Students at 1 School Kill Selves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANTIOCH, Calif. (AP) -- A 16-year-old boy is the third student in  
the past four months from one high school to kill himself with a 
gun. School officials said there's no reason to think the deaths 
are linked. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're grieving,'' Principal Dee Hopfenspirger said Wednesday.  
``We're very concerned. We're very concerned about our students and 
why they would hurt themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first suicide at Deer Valley High School was in May. The  
second was two weeks ago. The latest death was Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Crisis counselors were at the school this week to help students  
deal with the anguish of losing so many classmates in such a short 
period of time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes with suicide there's what's called a contagion  
effect, where one suicide produces a copycat effect,'' said John 
Bateson, executive director of a crisis center. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's teen suicide rate has tripled in 20 years and is  
the third-leading cause of death for that age group, following 
accidents and homicides, according to the federal Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, an Associated Press review found that more than a third  
of California's 999 school districts had no counselors and no 
psychologists on staff to spot or help troubled children in the 
1997-1998 school year.

<HEADLINE>  Convicted Terrorist Returns To Rome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Hundreds of supporters greeted an Italian returning  
to Rome today to serve her sentence for helping plan armed 
robberies to finance leftist terrorists in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian government provided a private Falcon 900 jet to  
bring 51-year-old Silvia Baraldini to Rome, and the minister of 
justice personally escorted her mother to Ciampino airport to greet 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	The now silver-haired Baraldini, who had complained that U.S.  
prison officials put her in chains, walked off the plane 
unrestrained, clad in dark slacks, a white blouse and dark jacket 
rather than a prison uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	At Rebibbia prison, cries of ``Freedom!'' went up from a crowd  
of hundreds of well-wishers who'd waited hours to give Baraldini a 
hero's welcome. Champagne corks popped, and many of her supporters 
wore T-shirts emblazoned with her picture or carried banners 
reading ``Welcome back, Silvia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baraldini became a cause celebre for Italian communists and  
other leftists, with supporters holding rallies in Italy and the 
United States since she was convicted in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Baraldini embodied a righteous challenge of what leftists  
believed to be an unjust establishment. Many members of the new 
left-wing Italian governement were themselves anti-government 
protesters in the late 1960s and early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Before gaining power, many in the Italian left were also highly  
anti-American and Baraldini became a hero for working with black 
militants to overthrow the white establishment. Her 43-year 
sentence was widely seen as extraordinarily severe. 
</P>
<P>
	Premier Massimo D'Alema's center-left coalition government  
worked doggedly to persuade the United States to allow Baraldini to 
serve the last nine years of her sentence in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are moments of happiness,'' Justice Minister Oliviero  
Diliberto said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Italian cities and towns, from Palermo to the resort  
island of Ischia, have offered Baraldini honorary citizenship, 
calling her a symbol of injustice. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the conservative opposition was outraged at the warm  
welcome extended to Baraldini by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``Couldn't she have taken a regular commercial flight?'' snapped  
former Christian Democrat Giuseppe Brienza, who demanded taxpayers 
be told the cost of the private flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Gustavo Selva of the right-wing National Alliance party rejected  
the government's contention that the flight was needed for security 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	A colleague from the National Alliance, Franco Pontone, branded  
as ``shameful'' the ``red carpet laid out for a terrorist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diliberto denied accusations that Baraldini was permitted to  
return home to ease anger over the acquittal of an American 
military pilot whose plane sliced through a ski gondola cable in 
1998, killing 20 people at an Italian ski resort. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no exchange, no barter,'' Italy's justice minister  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department said Baraldini was permitted to  
return to Italy only after that country guaranteed she would serve 
the remaining nine years of her sentence. Baraldini has served 16 
years on conspiracy and racketeering charges. She is scheduled for 
mandatory release in 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say she participated in a string of 16 robberies and  
attempted robberies that included the 1981 holdup of a Brinks truck 
near Nyack, N.Y. A guard and two police officers were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	She was also convicted of kidnapping prison guards during the  
1979 escape of a Black Liberation Army leader who was serving a 
life sentence for killing a New Jersey state trooper. 
</P>
<P>
	Baraldini had long sought a return to Rome to be near her  
elderly mother. She began life in the United States at age 11, the 
daughter of a diplomat.

<HEADLINE>  Convicted Terrorist Returns To Rome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Hundreds of supporters greeted an Italian returning  
to Rome today to serve her sentence for helping plan armed 
robberies to finance leftist terrorists in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian government provided a private Falcon 900 jet to  
bring 51-year-old Silvia Baraldini to Rome, and the minister of 
justice personally escorted her mother to Ciampino airport to greet 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	The now silver-haired Baraldini, who had complained that U.S.  
prison officials put her in chains, walked off the plane 
unrestrained, clad in dark slacks, a white blouse and dark jacket 
rather than a prison uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	At Rebibbia prison, cries of ``Freedom!'' went up from a crowd  
of hundreds of well-wishers who'd waited hours to give Baraldini a 
hero's welcome. Champagne corks popped, and many of her supporters 
wore T-shirts emblazoned with her picture or carried banners 
reading ``Welcome back, Silvia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baraldini became a cause celebre for Italian communists and  
other leftists, with supporters holding rallies in Italy and the 
United States since she was convicted in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Baraldini embodied a righteous challenge of what leftists  
believed to be an unjust establishment. Many members of the new 
left-wing Italian governement were themselves anti-government 
protesters in the late 1960s and early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Before gaining power, many in the Italian left were also highly  
anti-American and Baraldini became a hero for working with black 
militants to overthrow the white establishment. Her 43-year 
sentence was widely seen as extraordinarily severe. 
</P>
<P>
	Premier Massimo D'Alema's center-left coalition government  
worked doggedly to persuade the United States to allow Baraldini to 
serve the last nine years of her sentence in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are moments of happiness,'' Justice Minister Oliviero  
Diliberto said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Italian cities and towns, from Palermo to the resort  
island of Ischia, have offered Baraldini honorary citizenship, 
calling her a symbol of injustice. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the conservative opposition was outraged at the warm  
welcome extended to Baraldini by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``Couldn't she have taken a regular commercial flight?'' snapped  
former Christian Democrat Giuseppe Brienza, who demanded taxpayers 
be told the cost of the private flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Gustavo Selva of the right-wing National Alliance party rejected  
the government's contention that the flight was needed for security 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	A colleague from the National Alliance, Franco Pontone, branded  
as ``shameful'' the ``red carpet laid out for a terrorist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diliberto denied accusations that Baraldini was permitted to  
return home to ease anger over the acquittal of an American 
military pilot whose plane sliced through a ski gondola cable in 
1998, killing 20 people at an Italian ski resort. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no exchange, no barter,'' Italy's justice minister  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department said Baraldini was permitted to  
return to Italy only after that country guaranteed she would serve 
the remaining nine years of her sentence. Baraldini has served 16 
years on conspiracy and racketeering charges. She is scheduled for 
mandatory release in 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say she participated in a string of 16 robberies and  
attempted robberies that included the 1981 holdup of a Brinks truck 
near Nyack, N.Y. A guard and two police officers were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	She was also convicted of kidnapping prison guards during the  
1979 escape of a Black Liberation Army leader who was serving a 
life sentence for killing a New Jersey state trooper. 
</P>
<P>
	Baraldini had long sought a return to Rome to be near her  
elderly mother. She began life in the United States at age 11, the 
daughter of a diplomat.

<HEADLINE> Little League Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -- There isn't much pressure on a Little  
League manager in the United States. But in Japan, it's a different 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Tsutomu Kameyama, who also played for the Hanshin  
Tigers, knows all about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not a lot of pressure on the Little League players --  
besides the pressure they put on themselves,'' Kameyama said 
through an interpreter, Bill Lundy. ``All of the pressure is on the 
manager. I bring it all on myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kameyama, now a sports consultant, went 10-1 on the way to the  
series, including a 14-4 win over Korea in the Far East 
championship. His team is 2-1 and may have to wait until Wednesday 
to learn whether it will reach Thursday's international 
championship, probably against Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will work one, two, three years, whatever it takes'' to take  
the team to a championship, he said.

	TAKING CANDY FROM A BOISE: Edward Hughmanic, general manager of  
the United Water business in Toms River, N.J., can look forward to 
a taste treat from the Northwest -- potato candy. 
</P>
<P>
	Toms River's 4-0 win over Boise on Monday means that United  
Water of Boise's Bill Linham has to pay up with five boxes of 
potato shaped Idaho Spud Candy. Had Toms River lost, Linham would 
have gotten a taste of the boardwalk with five boxes of salt water 
taffy, according to the Asbury Park Press. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	TOMS RIVER REDUX: Toms River manager Mike Gaynor said the thing  
that makes the 1999 team better than 1998 championship squad is 
depth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like this team has a few more heroes every evening --  
Zack Del Vento, Chris Fontenelli,'' he said. ``That team knew how 
to win a game when it needed to pull one out, and this team knows 
how to win a game when it needs to pull one out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was asked if everyone on his team pitched.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone except Cunningham -- he's terrible,'' he said,  
needling catcher Chris Cunningham, who was also at a post-game news 
conference Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The unlikely heroes include R.J. Jones, who had a pinch-hit  
single and scored in the win over Boise, Idaho on Tuesday night. 
And everyone gets a chance to be a hero with Little League's 
must-play rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll get 12 players in there on Thursday night, and hopefully  
I'll have a chance to get 12 players in there on Saturday,'' Gaynor 
said.

Fred Blankenhorn spent his 59th birthday Tuesday showing the 
Japanese team around. As one of the Little League ``uncles,'' 
Blankenhorn's job is to help players with whatever they might need

<HEADLINE> Americans Will Miss Mir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- They endured a fire and crash,  
breakdowns and blackouts, sweltering heat and noxious fumes. 
</P>
<P>
	One came back noticeably thinner, another looking skeletal,  
thanks to rations on the space station Mir. A third struggled with 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Once back on Earth, more than one vowed never to return. Three  
promptly quit the astronaut corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet as Mir finally begins to wind down, its last long-duration  
crew due to leave Saturday and a fiery plunge planned for early 
next year, the seven Americans who lived on the venerable Russian 
station to help NASA prepare for a new space station can't help but 
feel a little nostalgic. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, they'll miss Mir, or at least miss knowing Mir's there.  
But it's high time, they say, for a new house in the sky: the 
NASA-led international space station. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of like if you've lived in a house and you've really  
enjoyed living in the house and maybe your kids have been born 
there,'' says NASA astronaut Shannon Lucid. ``But then there comes 
a point in time when you need those extra bedrooms and you need to 
move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lucid lived on Mir for six months in 1996 and, in doing so, set  
a space endurance record not only for Americans but also for women 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	A biochemist in her 50s with grown children, Lucid was the only  
American woman on Mir. Her craving for M&AMP;M's and potato chips and 
her delayed homecoming -- she spent more than six extra weeks in 
orbit because of problems with her shuttle ride home -- endeared her 
to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time that you leave some place, obviously you're more than  
anxious to get home. But you do feel a certain sadness,'' Lucid 
says. ``I sort of feel the same way about the thought of Mir 
re-entering the Earth's atmosphere and burning up. Mir has been a 
very historic part of space travel, and I think you'll feel a sense 
of loss when Mir comes down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. David Wolf also will be sorry to see Mir go, even though he  
says it's time the Russians focus their scarce resources on the 
international space station, a work in progress 250 miles in the 
sky. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like maybe a place you used to live. You may never go  
back, but you always know you could,'' says Wolf, who stayed on Mir 
from the end of September 1997 to January 1998. ``The grape juice 
spill I got all over the wall -- I'd be able to see the stains. A 
few things that I fixed up there, I'd be able to go see how they 
held out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first American on Mir, Dr. Norman Thagard, came across as a  
whiner after he arrived in March 1995. But the truth is, he sat on 
Mir almost two months with virtually nothing to do, waiting for his 
experiments to arrive on the Spektre module. Originally scheduled 
to attach to Mir before Thagard's arrival, Spektre was not launched 
until that June. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA had underestimated the psychological hardships of training  
for a year in Russia, conversing in Russian, then living with 
Russians on THEIR space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Thagard returned from almost four months aloft looking anemic  
and haggard. He'd lost muscle. By year's end, he'd resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	John Blaha, the only test pilot and nonscientist of the bunch,  
also suffered on Mir. He replace Lucid and spent the first month of 
his four-month mission in a depression -- he badly missed his wife 
of 30 years, back home in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he finally told himself: ``This is crazy, John. You need  
to get happy that you're here again'' in space. ``I realized that I 
was clinging to Earth so to speak. I psychologically cut the cords 
with all those things that were on the planet that I couldn't have. 
... Once I did, I really enjoyed the Mir space station. I was happy 
to get up in the morning and go to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next came Dr. Jerry Linenger, who battled two-foot flames from a  
burst oxygen generator in February 1997, then English-American 
Michael Foale, who four months later found himself trying to save 
the ruptured station following a near-catastrophic collision with a 
cargo ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Within months of returning to Earth, Blaha and Linenger followed  
Thagard out the door. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf relieved Foale in September 1997 after considerable debate  
over whether Mir was safe. A female astronaut should have followed 
Foale, but was bumped for being too small for a Russian 
space-walking suit, necessary for outdoor repairs. Wolf spent most 
of his time doing maintenance and repairs on the insufferably hot 
space station. He returned 20 pounds lighter. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian-American Andrew Thomas closed out the shuttle-Mir  
collaboration in June 1998. In all, the seven astronauts spent a 
total of 907 days on Mir. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some of the seven American volunteers had it tougher  
than others, ``it was certainly not easy for any one of them,'' 
says NASA's Jim Van Laak. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did not anticipate before the mission ... how hard they  
had to work or how deep they had to go within themselves to be 
successful. But they all did and all grew as a result of it.''

<HEADLINE> New Career As Writer and Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Polly Draper makes a short gagging sound -- a  
quiet cough that barely reverberates over the hum of traffic beyond 
the walls of a dressing room in the Music Box Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	She is demonstrating a symptom of Tourette's Syndrome, the  
neurological disorder that most people associate with violent 
shaking and outbursts of obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only 10 to 15 percent of the people who have Tourette's have  
that,'' says Draper. ``But it's the kind most depicted in the 
movies and on television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not in her new film, though. The actress has become something of  
an authority on the disease. Tourette's figures prominently in 
``The Tic Code,'' the movie she wrote and which she co-produced 
with her husband, jazz musician Michael Wolff, who has a mild form 
of the illness. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 43-year-old Draper, still remembered for her role as  
Ellyn, the insecure career woman on television's 
``thirtysomething,'' the movie is the first fruit of a new career 
as a writer-producer. The film will be released later this year or 
early next year. It already has won praise at various film 
festivals from Vancouver to Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that she has given up acting. Draper, who trained at the  
Yale School of Drama, spent her summer working on Broadway. She 
replaced Natasha Richardson in ``Closer,'' Patrick Marber's smart, 
occasionally savage look at love and sex in London during the last 
decade before the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Marber altered the leading role for Draper, turning an  
Englishwoman, played by the London-born Richardson, into an 
American. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patrick kept saying he wanted someone who was openhearted,''  
Draper says. ``That's the word he kept using as a description of 
the character: `She's very openhearted.' So all the experiences 
that come her way are received in that light. She's not a 
manipulator. I like to think I'm like that, too -- that I'm just out 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Draper is also persistent. ``The Tic Code'' took five years to  
get to the screen. The actress started writing the script before 
she had her first child, Matt, now 4, and she was pregnant with her 
second son while the actual filming took place. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Tic Code'' concerns a mother and her 10-year-old son, a  
gifted young pianist who has Tourette's. The boy forges a 
friendship with a jazz musician who also has the disease. The 
musician, played by Gregory Hines, gets involved with the mother, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have told me that it is the most amazing mother-and-son  
relationship they have seen,'' Draper says. ``That's one of the 
reasons why I wanted to write it. At that stage in my career, I was 
starting to audition for mother parts, and I thought they were so 
phonily written.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Draper knew she could do better, even though she had never  
written a full-length script. Yet she did her share of tinkering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in a lot of bad TV movies and in self-defense just  
had to change some lines,'' she says. ``I thought, `You know, I 
could do my own one of these instead of helping other people so 
much.' And that's when I started writing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a child Draper thought of becoming a writer.  
</P>
<P>
	``I used to ride my bike home from school and think up different  
stories I was going to write down,'' she recalls. ``The transfer to 
becoming an actress wasn't much of a stretch because I still was 
using my imagination. But the good thing about writing is you get 
to play every single part in your head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An impetus for the script was her husband's illness. The two met  
in 1989 on Arsenio Hall's television show where Wolff was the 
bandleader. Wolff also contributed the jazz score to the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted Tourette's to be a metaphor for a certain emotional  
freedom, the way jazz is a metaphor for musical freedom because it 
is such a free-form kind of music,'' says Draper. 
</P>
<P>
	``To someone who doesn't know, a person with Tourette's can seem  
nutty -- like there is something wrong with them,'' the actress 
says. ``With Michael, it almost looks like he is singing to music 
all the time. So I think that people never really questioned it 
because he is a musician. He tells me I was the only one who was 
rude enough to ask.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Tic Code'' cost $2.7 million, pocket change for Hollywood  
studios but a fortune if you are raising it yourself. 
</P>
<P>
	The project faced roadblocks. Script readers at the big studios  
loved it; the marketing people ran the other way -- a disease story, 
a little kid story (usually box-office death), an interracial 
romance, and starring the woman who wrote it, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``The financing was raised haphazardly at best,'' Draper says  
with a sigh. ``We got $1 million when Gregory came aboard, but it 
was a struggle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, dividing her time between Los Angeles and New York, she is  
on to her next writing project -- a play, which Draper describes as 
much more avant-garde than her movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``A character who has died comes back to life to talk to the  
audience,'' she says. ``He is basically soliciting their good will 
for a person he is trying to get into heaven. It's called `Getting 
into Heaven.' We shall see what happens.''

<HEADLINE> Redskins' Bowie Breaks Ankle Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Washington Redskins fullback Larry Bowie,  
attempting to come back from a broken ankle, broke it again 
Wednesday after jumping over a defender during practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowie, the team's best backfield blocker, landed awkwardly on  
the saturated artificial turf at Redskin Park and was dejected as 
he was driven away on an equipment cart. Heavy rain had forced the 
team to move the practice from the regular grass fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was in a lot of pain,'' trainer Bubba Tyer said. ``He knew  
it wasn't a sprained ankle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyer said the fracture was in the lower left fibula, the same  
part of the leg that was broken in the second quarter against 
Dallas in the fifth game last season. Bowie underwent surgery and 
did not play the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Tyer, this injury was not as severe and would not  
require surgery. The leg will be placed in a cast for about five 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyer said Bowie would then have to spend up to five weeks in  
rehabilitation, although a better prognosis for his return wouldn't 
be known until a full examination Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowie made the Redskins as an undrafted rookie from Georgia in  
1996 and became the starter in 1997. After he was injured last 
year, the team moved Stephen Davis to fullback for the rest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowie worked hard in the offseason to rehabilitate the ankle,  
but continued to feel discomfort during training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	His injury makes the offseason acquisition of Larry Centers even  
more crucial. Centers was expected to play more than Bowie anyway, 
but primarily as a receiving back. Bowie, who weighs 25 pounds more 
than Centers, was expected to lead the way through the holes on 
running plays and help protect the passer. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other fullback on the current roster is second-year  
player Mike Sellers, who played tight end last season. The Redskins 
were using Sellers at his old position in some workouts this week 
because tight ends Stephen Alexander and Kevin Pesak also are hurt.

<HEADLINE> Jim Bakker's Son Has Own Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jay Bakker looks more like a punk rocker than a  
preacher, and that's exactly the point. 
</P>
<P>
	The tattooed and pierced son of fallen evangelists Jim and Tammy  
Fay Bakker lives in Atlanta and runs his own ministry, Revolution. 
He preaches a message of self-worth and unconditional love to 
punks, Goths and gays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I dropped out of high school. I can barely write. I'm white  
trash,'' he said in the latest issue of Rolling Stone. 
</P>
<P>
	``But God has given me a gift -- to relate to people and to see  
the common sense of the Bible. The church needs to stop figuring 
out ways that they can fight Marilyn Manson and start accepting all 
types of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bakker, 23, was just a kid when his father was charged with  
defrauding followers and went to prison, the family dynasty 
crumbled and his parents split up. He was left in the rubble with 
drug and alcohol problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``The punk groups really attracted me because they had this  
attitude like, `We'll accept you and everyone else can go to 
hell,''' he said.

<HEADLINE> Comic Wants S.C. Flag To Come Down </HEADLINE>

<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Chris Rock wants to see the Confederate  
battle flag removed from South Carolina's Statehouse dome. 
</P>
<P>
	The black stand-up comic was in Columbia on Tuesday filming

flag.

	Rock, a New Yorker, said he thinks the flag should come down  
because it is ``a symbol of oppression, and Old Dixie, and it 
probably should come down just because it's frightening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I get the whole heritage thing,'' he said, ``but I think other  
people have messed it up to the point, you know, the Klan uses the

<HEADLINE> Japan: Job Pressure Caused Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Job pressure drove a Japanese baseball scout to  
commit suicide after he failed to sign a star pitcher, making his 
family eligible for government compensation, the Labor Ministry 
ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government pays a pension of about $17,000 a year to the  
family of a worker who dies from a job-related injury or illness. 
The number of applications for government compensation in cases of 
suicide by overwork has risen dramatically as Japan's economy 
stagnates. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazutoshi Miwata's job as a scout for the Orix BlueWave pro  
baseball club was so stressful that he lost the ability to make 
sound judgments, leading him to jump from the 11th floor of a 
building in Okinawa in October, said Labor Ministry official 
Masayuki Takeda. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would often have to hold meetings at 6:30 a.m.,'' said  
Takeda. ``But unlike many other cases, the real reason for his 
suicide wasn't long hours, but the pressure of his job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Takeda refused to say how much Miwata's family will receive.  
</P>
<P>
	The BlueWave had ordered Miwata to sign high school pitching  
sensation Nagisa Arakaki, the team's top pick in last year's draft, 
and he felt burdened by guilt when negotiations broke down, the 
ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miwata showed classic symptoms of extreme stress -- loss of  
appetite, sleep disorders, memory loss and concentration problems, 
the ministry said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Suicide from overwork -- or ``karojisatsu'' -- is increasingly  
common in Japan, a country famous for its assiduous work force. 
Earlier this year, a Japanese court ordered the government to 
compensate a machine-shop employee who killed himself after working 
80-hour weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the baseball suicide, Orix won exclusive negotiating rights  
to Arakaki in an amateur draft, but the 18-year-old player had 
already said he wanted to play for the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks -- making 
Miwata's task nearly impossible.

<HEADLINE> Actor Martin Lawrence Collapses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) -- Actor Martin Lawrence collapsed  
while jogging in 100-degree weather and lay in a coma for three 
days before regaining consciousness, hospital officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence was running in heavy clothing to try to lose weight for  
a movie role, putting himself near death when his body temperature 
rose to more than 107 degrees, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence, 34, who starred in TV's ``Martin'' and the movies  
``Life,'' ``Bad Boys'' and ``Nothing to Lose,'' was listed in 
critical but stable condition Wednesday at Los Robles Regional 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor was responding to voice commands but was unable to  
speak because he remained on a ventilator, said critical care nurse 
Susie Faz. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence was near death when he was rushed to the hospital by  
paramedics, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you come in with a temperature of 107, that's not very  
compatible with life,'' Faz said. ``He's a very lucky man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His girlfriend opened their front door on Sunday after he had  
gone out for a jog and found him keeled over the doorstep, moaning 
and having trouble breathing, hospital spokeswoman Kris Carraway. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence arrived at the hospital and didn't regain consciousness  
until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Suffering from heat exhaustion and acute hypothermia, he was  
treated with ice and fans by emergency doctors and nurses on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A scan showed that his brain functions were unaffected, Ms.  
Carraway-Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unknown for which film he was preparing, but it was  
recently reported that he will star in ``See Spot Run,'' in which 
he'll play a postal worker who adopts a special dog.

<HEADLINE> Suit Filed Over Olympic Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A South Korean International Olympic  
Committee member's son filed a defamation lawsuit Wednesday against 
a U.S. businessman, accusing him of false testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The $100,000 suit claims that 41-year-old Kim Jung-hoon had his  
integrity hurt by testimony from Utah businessman David Simmons, 
according to court officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives confirmed that Kim, the son of South Korean IOC  
executive member Kim Un-yong, filed the suit with the Seoul 
District Civil Court, but declined to discuss details. They said he 
returned his green card to the U.S. embassy in Seoul on Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued earlier through a family spokesman in New  
York, Kim said he gave up his green card ``in response to 
speculation regarding my motives, past and present, for permanent 
resident status in the U.S.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second legal case stemming from controversy over Salt  
Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 3, Simmons pleaded guilty in U.S. court to misdemeanor  
tax evasion. It was the first criminal case developing from U.S. 
investigations of Salt Lake City's vote-buying scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons testified that he helped Kim obtain permanent U.S.  
resident status by setting up a sham job at his now-defunct 
communications company. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons said he used fake contracts and phony invoices to  
conceal the fact that the younger Kim's salary was paid by the Salt 
Lake City Olympic Bid Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim claimed that his deal with Simmons' company was purely  
business. Under the arrangement, Simmons visited South Korea 
several times to explore business opportunities in 
telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said he knew nothing of the salary arrangement between SLOC  
and Simmons' company, Keystone Communications. Kim also said he 
rejected SLOC payments, including one for $10,000, and turned down 
an SLOC offer of consulting work. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim's father has said that any deal between Simmons and the Salt  
Lake City bid committee was kept secret from his family. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's own investigation in March gave Kim Un-yong a ``severe  
warning'' for his conduct, but stopped short of harsher sanctions 
in the inquiry that led to an unprecedented 10 expulsions or 
resignations.

<HEADLINE> MetLife Said Near Deal With Insurer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. appears to have  
won the bidding war to buy the troubled General American Life 
Insurance Co. in a deal worth $1.2 billion, according to several 
news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Larance, a spokesman for St. Louis-based General American  
said the announcement of a new owner could come as early as today. 
The board of directors met Wednesday night to consider offers and 
proposals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	MetLife's board already has approved a preliminary plan for the  
deal, Dow Jones News reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	MetLife would operate General American as a stand-alone brand  
and leave its headquarters in St. Louis, the St. Louis 
Post-Dispatch reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	MetLife, based in New York, is the nation's second-largest  
insurance company, with $357 billion in assets. It dwarfs General 
American's roughly $30 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach MetLife officials after business hours  
Wednesday were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	Larance said he could not comment on the Dow Jones report, but  
said a half-dozen companies have expressed an interest in buying 
General American since the company announced it was seeking a 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no secret we have been negotiating with several  
companies,'' Larance added. 
</P>
<P>
	Larance declined to say who was interested, how many offers had  
been made or possible financial terms. He also declined to say if 
MetLife was among the suitors. 
</P>
<P>
	General American is seeking a buyer to take over the $6.8  
billion in ``funding agreements'' that sent it searching for a 
rescuer. General American couldn't quickly come up with the cash 
when 37 big institutional investors, mainly money-market funds, 
staged a run on $5 billion in General American contracts early this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Any deal would require the approval of regulators in both New  
York and Missouri.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Heads Toward U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Tropical Storm Dennis gathered strength  
as it stalled off the southern Bahamas Wednesday, with forecasters 
warning it could become a hurricane overnight and threaten the 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami urged people on the  
southeast coast of the United States, primarily North and South 
Carolina, to closely monitor Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipating possible heavy rains, the South Florida Water  
Management District on Wednesday started to drain canals to stave 
off flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	``The uncertainty is killing us,'' said district spokeswoman Ann  
Overton. 
</P>
<P>
	Bahamians took a nonchalant attitude, though a hurricane watch  
and tropical storm warnings were posted Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think some degree of complacency has developed in the  
Bahamas because we have had the good fortune of escaping a direct 
hit of a hurricane for a number of years,'' said Godwin Blyden of 
the Bahamas National Disaster Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 p.m. EDT, Dennis was centered near 23.1 north latitude,  
72.1 west longitude, 60 miles east-northeast of the island of 
Mayaguana and about 365 miles east-southeast of Nassau, the 
Bahamian capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm slowed to a crawl and gained strength, with top  
sustained winds at 65 mph, just shy of hurricane strength, but 
concentrated on its eastern section facing open seas. Tropical 
storm force winds extended up to 70 miles from its center. Dennis 
was expected to resume a slow west-northwest track later Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasts had the storm reaching hurricane strength Wednesday  
night or Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's looking like it's going to be in the central Bahamas by  
Thursday,'' said meteorologist Trisha Wallace at the National 
Hurricane Center in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was one of three tropical storms in the area. Emily  
sprang up Tuesday at near hurricane strength, surprising 
forecasters who hadn't even thought it was a depression. Wednesday 
morning, they warned people in the Lesser Antilles islands in the 
southeastern Caribbean to monitor the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	But Emily weakened quickly and at 5 p.m. EDT had top winds of 45  
mph and was centered near 13.4 north latitude, 55.7 west longitude, 
about 255 miles east of Barbados. It was moving toward the 
northwest near 7 mph with little change expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Emily may tangle with Tropical Storm Cindy, which was near  
hurricane strength with winds of 70 mph, but far out in the 
Atlantic with no threat to land. Meteorologists explained that if 
the storms do combine, the resulting system would not suddenly 
become twice as strong.

<HEADLINE> Former Fugitive Sentenced to 7 Yrs. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLOUCESTER, Va. (AP) -- A 16-year-old boy who allegedly faked his  
death to avoid going to jail for robbery has been sentenced to 
seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence Wednesday was more than twice the three-year  
maximum Sage Weakland would have spent in a youthful offender 
program under a plea agreement reached after his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	But he disappeared in July 1997 during a boating accident the  
night before his sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's family maintained that he died, but the FBI arrested  
him July 14 in Las Vegas. Agents were acting on a tip from a friend 
who said Weakland's father helped the teen-ager get away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry for what I did,'' Weakland, now 18, told the judge.  
</P>
<P>
	The night before he was to be sentenced for a housebreak,  
Weakland and his father, Eugene, went fishing. Their boat slammed 
into an anchored ship, and father and son went overboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugene Weakland was rescued, but Sage was not found after  
authorities spent weeks looking for him with the aid of 
helicopters, divers and sonar equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The father, who was not in court Wednesday, is under  
investigation and has already been charged with reckless boating.

<HEADLINE> UN Debates Childrens' Plight in War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Dozens of ambassadors and a top U.N.  
official called Wednesday for all governments to ratify treaties to 
protect children of war and to cease enlisting soldiers younger 
than 18 to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	At an open meeting of the United Nations Security Council on the  
plight of children in war, delegates voiced alarm at the increasing 
numbers of children killed or maimed in wars or actively recruited 
to fight in them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children neither start wars nor perpetrate them. They should  
not pay the price for adults' wars,'' said the deputy British 
Ambassador Stuart Eldon in announcing more than a half million 
dollars to support U.N. projects for children affected by wars. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. figures show more than 300,000 children under 18 are known  
to be currently under arms around the world, in places such as 
Sudan, Colombia, Angola, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. In most of 
these countries, children under 15 -- and even as young as seven or 
eight -- have reportedly been taking part in armed conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last decade, 2 million children have been killed, 1  
million orphaned, 6 million seriously injured or disabled and 12 
million made homeless because of war. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict,  
Olara Otunnu, made a pointed appeal Wednesday for the ratification 
and worldwide application of the Geneva Conventions, the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child and the treaty establishing the 
International Criminal Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Words on paper cannot save children and women in peril,''  
Otunnu told the council. 
</P>
<P>
	His call was backed by ambassadors from Malaysia, Argentina,  
Canada, the Netherlands and Russia, among others. Several 
ambassadors including those from Slovenia and Britain also backed 
Otunnu's plea to raise the age limit for the recruitment of 
soldiers from the present 15 to 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, however, opposed the move because it wants to  
retain the ability to recruit high schoolers for the military. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. is also the only country aside from Somalia that hasn't  
signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child. And it was one of 
seven countries that refused to sign the statute creating the 
world's first permanent international criminal court, and has been 
trying to curb its reach to protect U.S. civilians and military 
from political prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy U.S. Ambassador Nancy Soderberg referred indirectly to  
the U.S. positions on the touchy subjects, saying the council 
shouldn't be distracted by the debates ``on the margin of the 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the council ``should focus on where the real abuses are  
-- with children even younger than 15 whose lives are totally 
distorted by their recruitment into armed conflict and brutality -- 
becoming both perpetrators and victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The council unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the  
targeting and recruitment of children in war and also pledging to 
prioritize children's needs in future U.N. missions. The council 
also vowed in the resolution to consider the impact sanctions have 
on children whenever they are applied against states.

<HEADLINE> House To Hold Laundering Hearings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the House Banking Committee  
said Wednesday that Congress must investigate whether the Bank of 
New York was duped or willingly aided an alleged money-laundering 
scheme that federal investigators say involves the Russian mob. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, Russia's finance minister denied his government was  
linked to the multibillion-dollar scheme, which has been described 
as potentially one of the biggest occurrences of money-laundering 
ever uncovered in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no information indicating that Russia has anything to  
do with this problem, so there is no need for the government to 
interfere in this situation,'' Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov 
told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement authorities in the United States, Britain and  
Russia reportedly are investigating the activities of Konstantin 
Kagalovsky, who was Russia's representative to the International 
Monetary Fund from 1992 to 1995 and later worked as a senior 
executive at Russia's Menatep bank. He now is vice president of 
Russia's oil giant Yukos. 
</P>
<P>
	Kagalovsky is married to Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, a senior  
vice president of Bank of New York who supervised its East European 
division out of New York City. She is one of two Russian-born 
senior officers suspended by the bank last week as news of the 
federal investigation surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, the Banking Committee chairman, said the  
panel will hold hearings next month on the alleged money-laundering 
scheme at Bank of New York, the nation's 15th-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators believe as much as $10 billion was  
laundered through the bank in an operation run by Russian organized 
crime. Some $4.2 billion passed through a single account in more 
than 10,000 transactions between October and March, The New York 
Times reported last week, citing unidentified investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	In money laundering, illicit profits from drug trafficking and  
other criminal activities often are moved through a series of bank 
accounts to make them appear to be legitimate business proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russian banks appear to be more platforms for insiders seeking  
to spirit money out of the country than intermediaries for domestic 
growth,'' Leach said in a statement from Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``At issue is whether foreign theft has been facilitated by  
self-serving banking practices in the Western world, including the 
United States,'' he said. ``With regard to the Bank of New York, 
the question is whether they were unwittingly duped or were willing 
facilitators in what may be the greatest example of kleptocratic 
governance in modern history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bank said last week that it ``has been cooperating with the  
office of the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York 
in the confidential investigation of the use of bank facilities to 
transfer funds from Russia to other countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the bank, Mrs. Kagalovsky nor Lucy Edwards, a bank vice  
president in London who also was suspended, have been charged with 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards' husband, Peter Berlin, who like Konstantin  
Kagalovsky is a Russian businessman, reportedly had authority over 
one of the accounts in question. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing FBI documents, USA Today reported Wednesday that much of  
the money allegedly laundered through the bank came from 
prostitution rings in Europe, weapons factories in Hungary and the 
sale of art and jewelry that once belonged to Russian Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no accusations that the Russian government was  
involved in the case. However, there have been frequent allegations 
of high-level corruption in Russia in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra reported Wednesday  
that Swiss and Russian prosecutors investigating the Russian mob 
uncovered payments of more than $1 million to Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin and his daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the money came from an Albanian-born contractor,  
Bahgjet Pacolli, who had been hired to work on the Kremlin and the 
Russian parliament building. 
</P>
<P>
	A Kremlin spokesman, who declined to give his name, denied the  
report. The Swiss prosecutor's office had no immediate comment.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Gets Tough Opening Matchup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pete Sampras could have a tough opening-round  
match when he begins his bid for a record 13th Grand Slam 
tournament men's singles title at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's draw ceremony at the National Tennis Center, Marat  
Safin, a young Russian who is considered to be a future star, was 
selected to play Sampras in the opening round. 
</P>
<P>
	The year's final Grand Slam tournament begins its two-week run  
Monday at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, who is also seeking his fifth U.S. Open title -- but  
first since 1996 -- tied Roy Emerson's mark of 12 major men's 
singles titles by capturing his sixth Wimbledon crown in July. 
</P>
<P>
	If the seedings hold, Sampras would face No. 2 Andre Agassi in  
the final, a rematch of the Wimbledon title match. Sampras and 
Agassi have met twice for the U.S. Open championship, Sampras 
winning both times. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi, who won the French Open in June, becoming only the fifth  
man to win all four major titles in his career, starts off against 
Nicklas Kulti of Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's Patrick Rafter is going after his third straight  
title on the hard courts of the National Tennis Center. His 
first-round opponent will be Cedric Pioline, a Frenchman who has 
reached the final of both the U.S. Open and Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, who won the  
Australian Open in January, will take on Alberto Martin of Spain in 
his opener. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's draw, No. 1 Martina Hingis of Switzerland opens  
against Kveta Hrdlickova of the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsay Davenport, who is seeded second, begins the defense of  
her U.S. Open title against fellow American Corina Morariu. 
</P>
<P>
	The Williams sisters -- third-seeded Venus and No. 7 Serena are  
playing in opposite halves of the draw and could meet in the final. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Little League Manager Sacrifices Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -- Tony Rasmus had a choice to make: Stay  
on in his job as football coach at a small private school or help 
his two sons fulfill their Little League dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a no-brainer.  
</P>
<P>
	``I made the decision to resign early on, for the good of the  
kids,'' said Rasmus, a former minor leaguer in the Anaheim Angels 
system and manager of the Phenix City, Ala., team that is three 
victories away from a Little League World Series championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a sacrifice but all this is worth it,'' Rasmus said  
before his team defeated Boise, Idaho 12-0 to advance to the U.S. 
championships. ``Shoot, I wasn't making a million dollars in the 
job anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, signs pointed to Rasmus leaving his beloved Little League  
team behind. He had just been giving the responsibilities of 
coaching running backs and linebackers at the Glenwood School and 
closed on a loan for a house that would have enabled him to move 
the family out of their mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have four kids living in a trailer in a 10-foot-by-10-foot  
room,'' he said. ``At the time, my wife didn't think it was the 
smartest thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the thrill of watching 12-year-old Colby and 11-year-old  
Cory take the field in Williamsport is priceless, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking back, it was a super-good decision. I wouldn't have  
traded this for anything,'' Rasmus said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the team won its district championship last month, Rasmus  
knew he had something special. So he went into the athletic 
director's office on July 12 and told them he was considering 
leaving and taking another job close by. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounded better than to say, `I quit my job for Little  
League,''' he said. ``They would have laughed me right out of the 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until a week -- and two no-hitters -- later that Rasmus  
signed his resignation letter with his squad going to the Alabama 
state championships. 
</P>
<P>
	At Williamsport, Phenix City has had its ups and downs. They  
lost their opening game 6-0 to defending champion Toms River, then 
rallied from a four-run deficit to take a 5-4 win over Brownsburg, 
Ind., on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure didn't seem to be affecting Rasmus' players before  
Tuesday night's game. A Phenix City win sets up a rematch with Toms 
River in the U.S. championship game Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	As metal bats pinged in the background and crowds cheered during  
an afternoon game, Colby signed autographs for two female fans, 
while other teammates ran onto the grassy hilly beyond the outfield 
fence to talk with family members. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty sure he was going to stay with us,'' the  
soft-spoken Colby said between glances at the field to watch an 
ongoing game. ``He knows a lot more about baseball than most people 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rasmus said he has no hard feelings with the situation at  
Glenwood since he left on his own accord. The school already had 
recently lost two football coaches, and Rasmus wanted to make sure 
it had a full-time coach from the start of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be other jobs, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It just didn't seem fair to my (Little League) team,'' Rasmus  
said. ``It wasn't fair to say, `OK, guys, congratulations on this, 
but I've got to leave you now.'''

<HEADLINE> Eaton Lays Off Thousands of Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Troubled retailer T. Eaton Co., now going through  
liquidation, said Tuesday it has laid off or given termination 
notices to thousands of employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those employees whose services will be required during the  
liquidation have been advised to continue to report to work through 
the notice period,'' the company said in a release. ``Those 
employees whose services will not be required have had their 
employment terminated effective immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The once-dominant department store chain, with 64 stores, has  
close to 13,000 full- and part-time employees. It was not clear how 
many workers were immediately laid off. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced the resignation of Brent Ballantyne  
as chief executive and president. He will stay on as a director and 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the appointment of the interim receiver and the  
engagement of the liquidators, I did not think I could add any 
further value and it seemed appropriate to offer my resignation as 
president and chief executive officer,'' Ballantyne said in the 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to continue on as chairman in order to lead the  
company through to the presentation of a proposal to its 
creditors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, trading on the company's stock was halted on the  
Toronto Stock Exchange due to ``failure to meet continued listing 
requirements.'' Eaton's shares plunged more than 43 percent Monday 
to close at 27 cents a share. The shares were valued at over $10 
each when the chain went public in mid-1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton's said after an insolvency hearing Monday that a selloff  
of its inventory will start at mid-week in all its stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our management team is also continuing to explore all  
alternatives in order to preserve as much value for its 
stakeholders as possible,'' Ballantyne said after an Ontario 
Superior Court judge appointed a receiver and approved the 
liquidation. 
</P>
<P>
	With the chain $220 million in debt, Richter Partners of  
Montreal was appointed interim receiver while Gordon Brothers 
Retail Partners of Boston will liquidate the company's goods. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is designed to protect the greater body of creditors and  
employees,'' Eaton's lawyer Gordon Marantz of Osler, Hoskin &AMP; 
Harcourt told Justice James Farley.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department is urging China not to  
prosecute leading members of the Falun Gong movement.

<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- U.S. software giant Microsoft plans to  
open a services center office in Jamaica next month, The Daily 
Observer newspaper reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redmond, Wash.-based company plans to open the office in New  
Kingston in September to assist information technology providers 
and local businesses, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main idea is not for the customer to go and buy from them,  
but for consulting and recommendations. They are here to push 
product; it will be more like a promotion center,'' Microsoft 
spokesman Stephen Peart was quoted as saying in The Observer. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has been negotiating with the Jamaican government to  
link all public agencies through the Internet and provide 
consultation services on government computer projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamaican Minister of Commerce and Technology Phillip Paulwell  
has said the growing information technologies field could provide 
the Caribbean island with thousands of jobs.

<HEADLINE> Ark. Coach Faces Sex Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A former high school administrator  
awaiting retrial on charges of sexually assaulting a cheerleader 
has been hired as a junior high basketball coach and teacher in 
another school district. 
</P>
<P>
	However, 41-year-old Wally Love took a leave from his new job  
last week after parents raised questions and complained. He did not 
return calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The district superintendent said he knew about the accusation  
before Love was hired as a coach and special education and health 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be a great asset to our school,'' said Jimmy Allen,  
superintendent of the 725-student Palestine-Wheatley School 
District. ``I have a daughter and I hope he's here long enough to 
coach my daughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen has said he didn't know Love was due back in court Sept.  
28 to face the retrial. He said Love's status will be reviewed 
after his retrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Love was West Memphis High School's dean of students when he was  
arrested two years ago and charged with sexual violation of a 
minor. Last year, a jury deadlocked in favor of conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer had argued that it was the girl's word against Love's  
and that the prosecution had only unreliable circumstantial 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Love's accuser, now 19, screamed, cursed and cried when she  
heard that Love was returning to a school only an hour's drive 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate him for what he did to me and wish he would die,'' she  
said. ``I know that's mean, but that's the way I feel.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Declares He's Anti-Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate John McCain  
has not satisfied some conservative critics despite declaring his 
support for overturning the Supreme Court ruling that legalized 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I share our common goal of reducing the staggering number of  
abortions currently performed in this country and overturning the 
Roe vs. Wade decision,'' McCain said in a letter, released Tuesday, 
to National Right to Life Committee president Wanda Franz. ``I 
truly hope this clarifies any ambiguity on my position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona senator angered some social conservatives with  
recent remarks that appeared to soften his stance against abortion. 
His advisers said McCain was misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
	In separate interviews, the senator had:  
</P>
<P>
	--Told the San Francisco Chronicle: ``I'd love to see a point  
where it is irrelevant, and could be repealed because abortion is 
no longer necessary. But certainly in the short term, or even the 
long term, I would not support repeal of Roe vs. Wade, which would 
then force X number of women in America to (undergo) illegal and 
dangerous operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Told CNN that although he ultimately favored repeal of the 1973  
Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, ``We all know, and it's 
obvious, that if we repeal Roe vs. Wade tomorrow, thousands of 
young American women would be performing illegal and dangerous 
operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Juleanna Glover Weiss, spokeswoman for GOP presidential rival  
Steve Forbes, said McCain was ``stuttering and stammering'' on the 
abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after receiving McCain's letter, the National Right to Life  
Committee questioned whether he was backpedaling from his longtime 
anti-abortion views. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last week, he said he would not support overturning Roe vs.  
Wade in the short term or the long term,'' said the committee's 
political director, Carol Tobias. ``This week, he is saying he 
supports overturning Roe vs. Wade but he is not saying when. Does 
he mean in 200 years? In 50 years?'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky replied that McCain ``has a  
17-year voting record of supporting efforts to overturn Roe vs. 
Wade and simultaneously reducing the abortion rate in America. He 
does that currently. He did that previously and will continue to do 
that as president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the controversial quotes, Opinsky said McCain had  
responded to questions about Roe vs. Wade ``in a vacuum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While we work to overturn Roe vs. Wade, we must promote  
policies that reduce the number of abortions,'' McCain wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's letter detailed a long anti-abortion record, including  
his sponsorship of the effort to overturn President Clinton's veto 
of a bill banning late-term procedures called ``partial birth'' 
abortions. He also has opposed public financing of abortions, 
except in cases of rape, incest or a threat to the mother's life.

<HEADLINE> Talk Show Trial Races Toward Finish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich, (AP) -- With quick questions and well-practiced  
answers, the retrial of the man who killed a gay acquaintance after 
a taping of ``The Jenny Jones Show'' neared a finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the witnesses in the retrial of Jonathan Schmitz had  
taken the stand twice before -- in Schmitz's 1996 trial, where he 
was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of Scott 
Amedure, and in the civil trial against the producers of the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing arguments were scheduled to begin today, with the jury  
asked to decide whether Schmitz committed second-degree murder or 
manslaughter when he shot an unarmed Amedure twice in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting came three days after Amedure had revealed a crush  
on Schmitz during the show taping. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz, 29, was sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison three  
years ago, but an appeals court overturned the verdict because of 
an error in jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the first trial, Schmitz's defense has not been able to  
bring up his mental history as a factor in the killing. Attorney 
Jerome Sabbota has also refrained from blaming the show, as 
Schmitz's lawyers did in his first trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Sabbota sought to show that Amedure sparked his own  
death by pursuing Schmitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabbota said Amedure lied to Schmitz about the show, entitled  
``Same-Sex Secret Crushes,'' and introduced testimony that Schmitz, 
who says he is heterosexual, went to the show believing he would be 
reunited with an ex-girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabbota argued that Schmitz should be convicted of manslaughter,  
which has a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. The maximum 
sentence for second-degree murder is life.

<HEADLINE> Volvo To Install LatAm Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Aiming at a threefold increase in its  
Latin American market share, automaker Volvo will move its regional 
headquarters from Sweden to Brazil, a top company official said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Latin America market for prestige imported cars is one of  
the world's fastest growing, and in this sense Brazil is the 
region's most important country,'' said Luis Carlos Pimenta, 
general manager for Volvo's sales operations in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Pimenta said that Volvo competes with Mercedes Benz, BMW and  
Audi in Latin America for sales of cars costing more than $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	All of Volvo's sales from Mexico on down will be coordinated  
from the company's new Latin American headquarters, scheduled to 
open by the end of October in Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	Pimenta said the company will launch a $8 million marketing  
program to increase Volvo's prestige car market share in Brazil 
from its current 7 percent to 20 percent by the end of 2001. Of the 
8,500 such vehicles sold in this country in 1998, close to 600 were 
Volvos. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar market share increase should take place elsewhere in  
Latin America, Pimenta said by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	He said while Volvo does not discard the idea of eventually  
building its cars in Brazil, no such plans were being drawn up. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Latin American headquarters would operate  
independently of Ford, which acquired a controlling share of the 
Swedish automakers in January of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo has a truck and bus production unit near the southern city  
of Curitiba.

<HEADLINE> Emmys: Even Presenters Are Winners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Let's say you're a star who failed to score  
an Emmy nomination. Or maybe, if you did, you're a long shot to win 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	But you could at least serve as a presenter, for goodness sake,  
proving you have the stature to hold an Emmy statue even if you 
can't take it home with you. 
</P>
<P>
	You are Mr. or Ms. Television, and the show will not go on  
without you -- unless Don Mischer decides it will. 
</P>
<P>
	Mischer, producer of the Sept. 12 awards for the Academy of  
Television Arts &AMP; Sciences, knows how much industry members long to 
be associated with the high-profile ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have had cables sent to me by people who've said, 'I've got  
the dress, I just need the invitation.' I've had big bouquets of 
flowers sent by artists who want to do something on the show. ... 
Some will get the heads of big agencies to call you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many people who deserve to be on the Emmy Awards who  
we simply don't have room for,'' said Mischer. ``In the end, our 
job is to do what's best for the show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A scant three weeks before the ceremony, he and his crew are  
balancing the big and small elements that can turn the three-hour 
broadcast on Fox (down from last year's four-hour, 50th anniversary 
blockbuster) into a thriller or a yawner. 
</P>
<P>
	There's the all-important display of stars, of course. Jenna  
Elfman (``Dharma &AMP; Greg'') and David Hyde Pierce (``Frasier'') were 
tapped this week as co-hosts. Presenters announced so far include 
Dennis Franz, Calista Flockhart, Sarah Michelle Gellar, David 
Spade, Dylan McDermott and Jon Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Decisions are being made about the show's theme (Mischer favors  
a millennium-tinged look to TV's future), comic relief and the clip 
packages for nominated series and performers. The mob drama ``The 
Sopranos,'' the leading nominee with 16 bids, and best-comedy 
contender ``Sex and the City'' will get especially careful 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	The two HBO series, true to their carefree cable pedigree, brim  
with explicit language and story lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to find scenes that don't have more than five or  
six bleeps,'' said Mischer. ``This show will probably have more 
bleeps than any other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A veteran of five Emmy ceremonies, Mischer knows the potential  
pitfalls, some of which simply can't be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
	When a presenter's remarks fall flat or the stilted, scripted  
banter between two stars is painful to behold, the celebrities may 
have only themselves to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you rehearse, that stuff emerges and you fix it on the  
spot. But fewer and fewer stars want to rehearse. Those who have a 
good sense of self-preservation will want to come to rehearsal, but 
a lot of stars say, 'Hey, just let me show up and do it.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	It is, after all, a nonpaying gig. But Emmy does have some  
lovely gifts for her guests: ``Treasure chests'' filled with 
several thousand dollars worth of products will be bestowed on

<HEADLINE> Court Affirms $50 Million Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A Florida appeals court on  
Wednesday rejected attempts by CSX Transportation to throw out a 
$50 million award to the widow of a Miami police officer killed in 
a train derailment. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th District Court of Appeal said a lower court was right to  
approve the $50 million in punitive damages against CSX, a railroad 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury ruled the company disregarded passenger safety when it  
cut its maintenance work force in half, saving itself hundreds of 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed ... and we are reviewing our appellate  
options,'' CSX spokesman Adam Hollingsworth said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officer Paul Palank was one of eight passengers who died  
when the Amtrak Silver Star slammed into a parked freight train in 
July 1991 near Camden, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Palank was traveling by train because he feared flying.  
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the derailment was the fault of a corroded  
pin that caused a malfunction in a switch. 
</P>
<P>
	During a trial on the wrongful death lawsuit, there was  
testimony that CSX lied about how often it did maintenance checks 
on the tracks, and that it put passenger safety at risk by cutting 
back on its inspection staff to boost profits.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Avtovaz Expects GM Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's biggest car maker, Avtovaz, said  
Wednesday that a long-awaited agreement for a joint car plant with 
General Motors Corp. is likely to be signed next month. 
</P>
<P>
	GM executives indicated, however, that details remained to be  
worked out despite two years of talks on the project. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to finalize the agreement in September, but it's too  
early to talk about further details,'' said GM spokesman Dmitry 
Choulga. 
</P>
<P>
	Avtovaz chief Vladimir Kadannikov told reporters at an annual  
international car show here that production at the plant could 
begin a year after the deal is signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Avtovaz has serious financial problems and has been looking for  
foreign partners to help it pay off $113 million in back taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kadannikov refused to say how much investment he expected from  
GM. Russian media have said GM would invest up to $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant, in the central Russian city of Togliatti, initially  
would produce up to 120,000 cars a year, including 30,000 Opel 
Astra models, Kadannikov said. The output eventually would rise to 
200,000 cars a year, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bankers' Words To Dispel Y2K Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from a sample sermon distributed by the American  
Bankers Association to help clergy dispel fears of a Year 2000 
catastrophe. It is titled ``Thinking About Y2K: Moses, Orson Welles 
and Bill Gates'': 

</P>
<P>
	I doubt that even the wildly inventive mind of Orson Welles  
could have dreamed up a fantasy as improbable, yet as convincing, 
as Y2K. Who would have thought, after all, that America could be 
done in not by aliens from outer space, but by a bug in a computer? 
...

</P>
<P>
	You've heard the dire warnings, the off-the-wall forecasts and  
the downright silly predictions. Life insurance companies, they 
say, could bill us for coverage for the past 100 years. Airplanes 
won't get off the ground. And that could be the good news. Our bank 
accounts will show zero. Our mortgages will require another 100 
years of payments. Hospital monitoring equipment will stop 
monitoring. The lights will go out. The phones will fail. We'll be 
plunged into a deep, cold winter without heat, electricity, money 
or -- worst of all -- pizza delivery. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Quite a few jokes have been made about Y2K as well. Perhaps  
you've heard that Bill Gates has just announced the official 
release date for the new Windows 2000 software. 
</P>
<P>
	It's to be the second quarter of 1901. ...  

</P>
<P>
	It's especially important that we -- as members of our community,  
believers in God and members of the family of faith -- set the 
example. We want to go into the new millennium with hope, eagerness 
and faith in this new century of promise. We don't want to be 
crouched in our basements with candles, matches and guns. 
</P>
<P>
	There are, after all, two ways to cross the Red Sea. With Moses,  
who with God's help, led the children of Israel into a bright, 
hopeful future. Or with Pharaoh, who in trying to preserve the old, 
hurled his chariots, his officers and his army into the sea. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Things will work. Hospitals will be open. Police and fire  
departments will be prepared. Power companies will be fully 
staffed. Banks will keep your money safe. They're backed by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the FDIC, and the federal banking 
regulators have examined every bank in the country for Y2K 
readiness. ... 

</P>
<P>
	So in preparing for Jan. 1, 2000, do what you can. Trust God.  
Trust those you love. Be informed. And take a few practical steps. 
Save copies of your financial records. Keep a few days' worth of 
cash on you. Have a little extra food and water around the house if 
that makes you feel better.

<HEADLINE> Bored Clinton Press Turns to Hoop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton spent another quiet  
day Wednesday close to his Martha's Vineyard beach house, but work 
was starting to intrude on his vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke Tuesday night with Sen. Dianne Feinstein,  
D-Calif., who had just returned from China. On Wednesday he talked 
with his chief of staff, John Podesta, and national security 
adviser, Sandy Berger, who is briefing Clinton daily in 
anticipation of the president's meeting with Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin next month. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said it was unlikely that  
Clinton would remain close to the house during the last two days of 
his stay on Martha's Vineyard. The president planned to play golf 
Thursday and dine at the home of Mattel Corp. executive William 
Rollinick and his wife, Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Waiting for the vacationing Clinton to do something Wednesday  
was no picnic for the White House press corps. It was a basketball 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton and his family lolled on a stretch of beach belonging  
to Boston businessman Richard Freidman, boredom reigned among the 
reporters and photographers who were waiting at the Edgartown 
School gymnasium in case the president made news. 
</P>
<P>
	Then someone found a basketball, and before long Lockhart and  
two of his aides were caught up in a brief but aggressive game 
against three members of the press corps. 
</P>
<P>
	The sound of squeaking sneakers and the thumping ball competed  
with the soft tap-a-tap-tap of reporters working on their laptop 
computers at long tables that took up most of the gym floor. 
</P>
<P>
	With a big advantage in 6-foot-7-inch Washington Times  
correspondent Bill Sammon, the press corps won 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were bigger than us,'' said Lockhart.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	There was a hint early on that levity would be the order of the  
day Wednesday when Lockhart caved to the will of the television 
reporters and donned a blazer to do an on-camera briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a button-down shirt on, a nice jacket ... Oh! And my  
glasses,'' Lockhart said. He put on an oversized pair of purple 
rims, complete with fuzzy eyebrows and a hooked nose. ``OK, 
questions? Ready for television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart had balked at appearing before the cameras Tuesday  
while he was wearing shorts. His legs were ``not ready for prime 
time,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> White House Renews Tax Cut Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Renewing its attack on the Republican tax cut  
plan, the White House contended Wednesday the proposal would result 
in nearly $100 billion in cuts to essential federal programs over 
the next five years, with Medicare and farm programs among the 
hardest hit. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House budget office report said that through the year  
2004, the GOP's 10-year, $792 billion tax cut proposal would 
trigger Medicare cuts of $41 billion and entirely eliminate 
veterans education, farm safety net and child support enforcement 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, writing to House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., from his 
vacation home in Martha's Vineyard, cited the budget office's 
figures and said it would be ``irresponsible'' for him to sign the 
GOP legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate GOP leaders pushed the bill through Congress  
before lawmakers left for their August vacation. But they have yet 
to send it to the White House, where it faces a certain veto, so 
that Republican lawmakers can make their case to constituents 
before Congress returns in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's press spokesman, Pete Jeffries, stressed the  
Republican argument that the tax cut would consume only one-fourth 
of the estimated $3 trillion in Social Security and general budget 
surplus over the next decade, with the rest going to saving Social 
Security and Medicare, reducing the debt and paying for needed 
education and defense programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We as Republicans believe that needs to be returned to  
Americans in the form of tax relief,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the White House and most Democrats argue that the GOP plan  
would use up all of the non-Social Security surplus and require 
major cuts in fundamental government programs. The administration 
says it could support a cut of about $250 billion, but only after 
the future of Social Security and Medicare is secured and money is 
set aside for social and defense programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If your tax cut became law, it would leave America permanently  
in debt,'' Clinton wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	White House Office of Management and Budget Director Jack Lew  
said Wednesday's report, which outlines automatic cuts required by 
law if spending ceilings set in previous budget acts are not met, 
came up with ``distressing information and I hope it factors into 
their (the Republicans') thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The OMB report concluded the GOP plan would require cuts of  
$99.3 billion through 2004 to mandatory, or fixed, government 
programs, with $41.4 billion coming from Medicare, and $19.3 
billion from the Commodity Credit Corporation and other crop 
insurance programs for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Child support enforcement would lose $10.3 billion and social  
services block grants would lose $4.4 billion, essentially 
eliminating those programs, and immigration support would drop by 
$4 billion. Veterans education and training benefits would lose 
$3.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope Congress will treat this report as something of a  
wakeup call,'' Lew said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report does not take up discretionary, or non-mandatory  
spending, but Democrats say this too would have to be cut 
drastically to keep the budget in balance under a massive tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Republicans, in  
talking to constituents back home, have discovered little public 
appetite for a tax cut involving severe reductions in spending for 
education, the FBI, the FAA and veterans programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hastert and Lott, wrote to Clinton last week that the  
estimated budget surplus is more than enough to cut taxes, save 
Social Security and Medicare and ensure adequate levels of 
government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. President, there is no honest reason to veto this  
commonsense tax legislation,'' Hastert and Lott wrote.

<HEADLINE> Minneapolis Institute of Arts Toured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- With only a few minutes to get away from the  
office, Scott Heinrich decided to take a quick tour of 17th century 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Seated in a quiet niche at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts,  
Heinrich touched a computer display and listened as a narrator 
described politics in Italy at the time of the painters Poussin and 
Rembrandt, whose work hung just a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum's new interactive kiosks help him understand art and  
its social context. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here you can come in just a couple of minutes, clear your head  
and go back to work,'' Heinrich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinrich and thousands of other museumgoers have embraced the  
kind of unintimidating familiarity that the MIA was striving for in 
the 10-year, $150 million expansion project it completed last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Exhibit space was boosted by 65 percent, allowing the museum to  
bring many of its works out of storage and add new ones. This 
summer, the new space is filling up with new art and new audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum recently took delivery of the largest single  
corporate gift in its history: Norwest Bank Minnesota's 20th 
century collection of some 475 pieces of furniture, tableware and 
decorative objects. The collection, which includes a Mies van der 
Rohe chair and a Frank Lloyd Wright urn, is valued at more than $5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The MIA's renewal was guided by a single philosophy: Get the  
best art and get everyone to enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, the museum eliminated its entrance fee and rewrote  
labels and panels in less technical language. The flow was 
redesigned to make viewing easier, with displays in chronological 
or thematic order. More respect was given to non-Western art. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes also were cosmetic, with restoration of the main  
entrance to the 1915 neoclassical facade. And a new family center 
comes complete with stroller parking. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal was to make the museum a more comfortable, more  
approachable place to view art,'' museum spokesman John Easley 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Both experts and visitors say the MIA achieved that.  
</P>
<P>
	Museum experts now rank the MIA among America's top seven or  
eight ``encyclopedic,'' or non-specialized, museums. 
</P>
<P>
	``The museum seems more open,'' Jim Bennett, a longtime visitor,  
said during a recent trip to see the new Asian galleries. 
</P>
<P>
	Gazing at a 17th century Chinese marble screen, LeBron Zolbe, an  
Oklahoma City muralist and first-time visitor, said the flow of 
galleries steered her to artwork she might not have set out to see. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know of another museum that has done a better job,''  
said Peter Marzio, who is overseeing his own major expansion as 
director of the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	MIA's patronage has more than doubled since 1988 to an all-time  
peak of nearly 30,000 members and 500,000 visitors. Financial 
support has never been larger, with donations of $5.5 million in 
1998-99. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of lumping together artifacts from Africa, Oceania and  
the Americas as the ``primitive'' poor cousins of European art, the 
galleries highlight each continent separately. Egyptian mummies and 
Zambian masks share new space on the second floor; on the third 
floor, elk skins and contemporary paintings show that American 
Indian art is as alive today as it was centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the MIA is at the forefront nationally for treating  
African or American Indian art as respectfully as paintings by 
Cezanne or Pollock, Marzio says. 
</P>
<P>
	The European and American collection is also presented with a  
twist -- the great masters' paintings are integrated with sculpture 
and decorative arts, so that the whole story of a community at a 
particular time can be narrated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through these exhibits, we hook a lot of people,'' Easley  
says. ``Once we get people here for the first time, they want to 
come back.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods  
vaulted ahead in July, spurred by demand for computers, machine 
tools, electronics and transportation equipment. The Commerce 
Department reported that orders for durable goods -- items expected 
to last at least three years -- rose 3.3 percent last month to a 
seasonally adjusted $204 billion. The 3.3 percent increase was the 
biggest gain since December 1998, when durable good orders rose 3.4 
percent. The report reflects a still-booming economy, powered by 
strong consumer spending and low unemployment, economists said.

drugs into the United States. Undercover agents from the Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms also approached suspects about 
shipping guns and military-style explosives in the sting. At least 
48 people have been arrested. The suspects indicted were mainly

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawyers who work for the Justice Department  
are pressing a class-action lawsuit that accuses the 
law-enforcement agency of illegally failing to provide overtime 
pay. The lawsuit says the department made ``a conscious decision'' 
to ignore a federal law that requires overtime pay for employees 
who work more than 40 hours a week. As many as 12,000 current or 
former Justice Department lawyers might seek damages of more than 
$500 million.

	BERLIN (AP) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Cabinet approved  
hotly debated budget cuts Wednesday that are designed to spur the 
German economy, fight joblessness and bolster the euro. Schroeder's 
effort to trim the nation's social safety net has sparked 
resistance among fellow Social Democrats. If passed by parliament, 
it would trim $16 billion from next year's budget. Its most

<HEADLINE>  Russian Forces Drive Out Militants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russian troops have regained control  
of all six mountain villages captured by Islamic militants in 
southern Russia more than two weeks ago, and were attempting to 
drive scattered groups of rebels from the region entirely, the 
military said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Military officials said most of the rebels have fled from  
Dagestan to neighboring Chechnya, the breakaway republic from which 
they came. The rebels are seeking to establish an independent 
Islamic state in southern Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation against them ``is in its final stage,'' said  
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, on a trip with President Boris 
Yeltsin to the Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebel leader Shamil Basayev appeared on Chechen television and  
claimed that the withdrawal from Dagestan was planned and would be 
followed by guerrilla attacks throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first stage of our operation has been successfully  
completed and now we are getting ready for the second stage,'' 
Basayev said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians have carried out daily bombing raids and artillery  
attacks, hammering rebels who seized the villages when they invaded 
the Caucasus Mountain region Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The outgunned militants said in the past few days that they  
might withdraw or redeploy forces rather than remain in the 
villages and battle the much larger Russian contingent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Ministry said small groups of militants were still  
hiding in the mountains. Wounded Russian troops at a hospital in 
Makhachkala said rebel snipers were still active in many of the 
villages. The soldiers, who refused to give their names, said they 
were attacked in Tando, one of the most hotly contested villages. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Defense Ministry, the militants had been  
completely driven from four villages by Tuesday night, while 
government troops had gained control over two other settlements and 
were sweeping through them today to clear out any remaining rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents who fled the conflict weren't allowed to return home  
because the rebels heavily mined the villages before leaving, the 
Defense Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mine-clearing specialists, accompanied by trained dogs, searched  
for hidden explosives. Two Russian trucks and an armored personnel 
carrier were destroyed by the mines, but no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Government forces were preparing to launch a new operation to  
encircle and eliminate the remaining militants. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian military commander Col. Gen. Viktor Kazantsev on Tuesday  
said the rebels had 2,000 fighters and about half of them have been 
killed in the conflict. Rebel leaders have put their casualty 
figure at 32. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazantsev said 59 government soldiers and police officers were  
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting has been the worst in Russia since government  
troops withdrew from Chechnya nearly three years ago, giving 
Chechnya de facto independence as part of a peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike in the 1994-96 secession war in Chechnya, the Islamic  
militants in Dagestan don't have wide support from the population. 
The republic's secular politicians and moderate religious leaders 
also oppose the militants.

<HEADLINE> Thurmond Undergoes Prostate Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Strom Thurmond, the nation's oldest and  
longest-serving senator, underwent successful prostate surgery 
Wednesday and was resting at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, his 
office said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 96-year-old Thurmond, R-S.C., was alert and joking with  
doctors after the 25-minute procedure to treat an enlarged 
prostate, said his spokesman, John DeCrosta. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation was performed under local anesthesia. Thurmond was  
awake throughout and talked to the anesthesiologist about his D-Day 
experiences during World War II, his office said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said Thurmond's vital signs were strong and stable and  
they found no evidence of prostate cancer or other serious 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond was declared fit after a physical last week but  
underwent tests at a hospital in Columbia, S.C., on Friday after 
collapsing at a University of South Carolina reception. 
</P>
<P>
	He continued his weekend schedule, including a wedding for a  
former aide in Charleston, but then checked himself into Walter 
Reed after returning to Washington, complaining of tiredness. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond decided that while he was at Walter Reed he would go  
ahead with the elective prostate procedure. The operation was 
originally scheduled for November. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been hospitalized briefly several times in recent years,  
including for a day in Washington after he became dizzy in October 
1997. He also spent several days in a military hospital for a 
respiratory infection that December and earlier that year was 
hospitalized in Washington recovering from the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond was first elected to the Senate in 1954 and became the  
oldest person to serve in Congress at age 93. At 94 he became the 
longest-serving senator ever.

<HEADLINE> New Book Continues Hitler Novel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The villain in Ron Hansen's latest novel holds a  
gun to his niece's neck and demands that she remove her dress. As 
she undoes the buttons he glides the barrel across her chest. She 
smiles. He strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``And then his free fist flashed out and hit her face hard,''  
Hansen writes. ``Holding her hurting nose she flailed a fist at 
him, but she felt him catch her hair in one hand and yank her as he 
held the Walther pistol just above her heart, then fired down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The setting is a Munich apartment, in 1931. The victim is  
23-year-old Geli Raubal. Her assailant is Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hitler's Niece'' investigates one of the greatest mysteries in  
Hitler's life before he came to power. There is still no definitive 
explanation for the death of Ms. Raubal, whom Hitler would say was 
the only woman he ever loved. Although police ruled the case a 
suicide, Hansen is among those who believe that Hitler, violently 
jealous, killed her. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming out in September, Hansen's book also continues a strange  
and controversial literary genre: The Hitler novel. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, fiction writers have attempted what hundreds of  
biographers still haven't accomplished: to make sense of Hitler. 
Along with Jesus Christ, Hitler has been the most difficult to 
fictionalize -- the former because it's so hard to enter the mind of 
a god, the latter because it's so hard to enter the mind of a 
devil. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't write that kind of book because I cannot see myself  
as Hitler,'' said novelist Aharon Appelfeld, a Holocaust survivor 
who lives in Israel. ``You have to identify yourself with the 
character and how can you identify yourself with him? He's the 
essence of evil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That premise is hard for me to accept,'' said Hansen, a  
51-year-old Nebraska native and author of five well-regarded 
previous works of fiction. ``I've written about Jesse James and I 
never identified with him. I can imagine writing about people 
without stepping into their skins. I tried to observe Hitler like a 
cameraman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Storytellers, from Shakespeare on down, have long dramatized the  
belief that even the worst of us share something with the rest. In 
spite (or because) of ourselves, we mourn the downfall of tyrants 
and gangsters. 
</P>
<P>
	But to ``humanize'' Hitler seems appalling. Details of his  
private life, no matter how touching or vile, seem overwhelmed by 
his public crimes. Hitler is so gross, so infernal a figure, he 
threatens a fundamental law among writers: that no subject is 
forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally recoil at the idea of a novel about Hitler, but I  
know I haven't got permission. I have to put the principles of 
fiction writing above my personal feelings,'' said author-critic 
Cynthia Ozick, who wrote about the Holocaust in her acclaimed short 
story ``The Shawl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason for my recoil is my own experience as a writer of  
fiction, which is that when you imaginatively recreate someone the 
whole complexity of the human being comes into play. Almost 
inevitably you're going to show a human side. We do know that 
Hitler loved his dogs, but I don't care if Hitler loved his dogs. 
Better if he had been bitten by one and died.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A leading critic has been Alvin Rosenfeld, author of ``Imagining  
Hitler,'' a 1985 publication that analyzes dozens of Hitler 
fictionalizations. In the book's introduction, Rosenfeld argued 
that no author, ``high brow or low,'' had been able to make him a 
true fictional character, both human and inhuman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those works that demonize him distort through excess,'' he  
wrote, ``making him into a creature altogether unlike any to be 
found in humankind, whereas those works that normalize him tend to 
minimize his wickedness and diminish or deny his destructive side. 
</P>
<P>
	``Between these contrasting images of the demonic and the  
domestic figure, the `real' Hitler, one feels, somehow gets lost or 
slips away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitler fiction began in his lifetime, when such books as Max  
Radin's ``The Day of Reckoning'' and Michael Young's ``The Trial of 
Adolf Hitler'' imagined the dictator duly proved guilty of his 
crimes. Ernst Weiss' ``The Eyewitness,'' written in Paris in 1938, 
imagined the history of Hitler's rise from obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his death, in 1945, a common theme has been ``what if'' --  
what if he survived. In Pierre Boulle's ``His Last Battle,'' Hitler 
lives peacefully in the Peruvian mountains. Richard Grayson's story 
``With Hitler in New York'' transforms him into a blue-jeaned 
backpacker with a Jewish girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Even greater excess can be found in science fiction. In Roland  
Puccetti's ``The Death of the Fuhrer,'' Hitler's brain is 
transplanted into what becomes the leader of the next German Reich. 
Hitler is granted a son in Gus Weill's ``The Fuhrer Seed,'' in 
which ``Kurt Hitler'' becomes mayor of West Berlin and enjoys 
ravenous sex with his rich, Jewish lover. 
</P>
<P>
	The most controversial Hitler novel has been ``The Portage to  
San Cristobal of A.H.,'' by essayist-critic George Steiner. 
Published in 1981, Steiner's book imagined that Hitler survived the 
war and was hunted down by Israeli agents. At his trial he became 
the devil's advocate to end all devil's advocates, linking the 
Holocaust to the founding of the Zionist state. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the Holocaust that gave you the courage of injustice,''  
Steiner's Hitler argued, ``that made you drive the Arab out of his 
home, out of his field because he was in your divinely ordered way. 
That made you endure knowing that those whom you had driven out 
were rotting in refugee camps not ten miles away, buried alive in 
despair and lunatic dreams of vengeance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Steiner was clearly being ironic, Rosenfeld and others  
were offended both by the content of the speech and by his giving 
Hitler the final words of the story. Again, Hitler threatens the 
rules of literature. The author is supposed to withhold judgment 
and let the characters speak for themselves. But even in fiction, 
Hitler appears beyond objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Narratives follow conventions that have developed over a long,  
long time and we learn how to read novels by reading other 
novels,'' Rosenfeld said. ``But Hitler fits no character type that 
we know. And consequently, narrative conventions don't contain him. 
He bursts the bounds of such things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Novels such as Hansen's and Beryl Bainbridge's ``Young Adolf''  
are less provocative, and more realistic. They attempt to give us 
the Hitler of history, not of fantasy. The Hitler in Bainbridge's 
novel is pathetic rather than dangerous. He's lazy, clumsy, the 
choreographer of his own pratfalls. Observes a family friend: ``It 
is a pity he will never amount to anything.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Bainbridge's novel is set in 1912, when Hitler was a young  
idler. Hansen's novel takes place in the late '20s and early '30s. 
His Hitler, a quickly rising demagogue, is a far more potent 
figure: moody, charismatic, sadistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is that another Hitler doesn't happen, and that we  
recognize the signs of someone like him,'' Hansen said. ``When you 
take a small part of him, like his treatment of Geli, you see what 
he's going to do to Germany and to the Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to demystify Hitler. A lot of people want to put him  
in a special category. They want to make him a devil incarnate, a 
monster. But the 20th century tells us there are a lot of evil 
people who have the same evil notions, and they just haven't been 
as successful carrying out their scheme of hate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Hansen is getting his biggest-ever first printing in  
the United States, more than 50,000, no publisher in Germany has 
yet acquired rights. Hansen's agent, Peter Matson, said the 
response has been cautious. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they like the idea of the characterization of  
Hitler in fiction. It gets a little bit too close to the bone,'' 
said Matson. ``Ron's previous publisher (Fischer Verlag) has been 
dragging its feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Geli Raubal, the daughter of Hitler's half-sister, got to know  
her uncle in the mid-1920s. Then the head of a struggling Nazi 
party, Hitler became infatuated with his attractive, flirtatious 
niece and began escorting her to social outings. 
</P>
<P>
	The murder scene in ``Hitler's Niece'' is wholly imagined, but  
it's well established that Hitler had an intense, possessive 
relationship with Geli and that she lived in a Munich apartment he 
owned. Pictures exist of the two relaxing together and strong 
evidence exists that he made pornographic drawings of Geli. 
</P>
<P>
	According to ``Hitler and Geli,'' a biography published last  
year, she was going to leave for Vienna at the time of her death. 
She was increasingly bored and unhappy and associates of Hitler's 
were worried that their relationship would become public knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 19, 1931, her body was found on the floor of her  
apartment, a bullet wound near her heart and bruises on her face. 
One arm was stretched to a Walther pistol on the nearby couch. On 
her table was an unfinished letter, an apparently cheerful note to 
a friend she hoped to see in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
	Many historians consider the suicide verdict a cover-up, and  
Hansen is among those who call it more than just a private tragedy. 
Hansen believes that if Hitler had been caught, his career would 
have been aborted and the Holocaust prevented. 
</P>
<P>
	``People just let him get away with lots of things, primarily  
because he was anti-Communist,'' said Hansen, who read ``Hitler and 
Geli'' and other Hitler biographies while researching for his 
novel. 
</P>
<P>
	``As people have said before, `No Hitler. No Holocaust.' I think  
when he got away with murdering his niece, it made it possible for 
him to get away with other crimes and then start the second world 
war. The whole process was exponential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a benevolent hypothesis,'' Ozick responded, ``but `if  
only' doesn't hold. History has given us the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``All through the history of that part of the world there has  
been pogrom after pogrom and the Holocaust really is just a great 
big pogrom. You can take the `if onlys' all the way back through 
history. If only Jesus hadn't been born, there wouldn't be 
Christian persecution of Jews. These `if onlys' just fade away 
before historical reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Ernst Hanfstaengel, a Nazi party official, Geli  
provided Hitler for ``the first and only time in his life with a 
release to his nervous energy which only too soon was to find its 
final expression in ruthlessness and savagery.'' Herman Goering 
would later remark that ``Geli's death had such a devastating 
effect on Hitler that it ... changed his relationship to everyone 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A scene near the end of Hansen's novel is virtually all based on  
historical record. Hitler visited Geli's grave a few days after her 
death. He had hardly slept, refused food and was feared suicidal. 
He arrived at the cemetery at sundown, humming the funeral march 
from ``Die Gotterdammerung'' as he strolled through the tall iron 
gates. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's the only woman I'll ever love,'' Hitler said after  
laying down 23 red chrysanthemums, her favorite flower, one for 
each year she lived. 
</P>
<P>
	``Germany shall now be my only bride.''

<HEADLINE> Sosa Hits 52nd Homer, Leads McGwire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa hit his 52nd homer Wednesday night,  
breaking a tie with Mark McGwire for the major league lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa sent a 2-1 pitch from San Francisco's Kirk Rueter high and  
far over the left-field fence in the sixth inning of the second 
game of a doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	Giants left fielder Barry Bonds, who had three homers in the  
doubleheader, hardly moved. He just turned his head and watched the 
flight of the ball as it went through an 8 mph wind and landed on 
Waveland Ave., an estimated 480 feet from the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's 52nd homer came in the Cubs' 125th game and kept him well  
ahead of his pace last year. Sosa hit his 52nd in Chicago's 133rd 
game last season and finished with 66, four short of McGwire's 
record.

<HEADLINE> LPGA Oldsmobile Event Up for Grabs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Karrie Webb, Meg Mallon, Dottie  
Pepper, Rosie Jones, Kelli Kuehne, Kelly Robbins. Take your pick. 
</P>
<P>
	All have gathered at Walnut Hills Country Club, and any one of  
them could leave town $105,000 richer on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Lisa Walters, who has undergone two  
operations this season, is unable to defend her Oldsmobile Classic 
title. But just about everybody who is anybody on the LPGA Tour is 
on hand, including four of the season's top 10 money-winners. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a solid field,'' said Rosie Jones, who beat Upper  
Peninsula favorite Becky Iverson and veteran Jan Stephenson in a 
playoff last week in the Firstar LPGA Classic at Beavercreek, Ohio. 
``It's a good golf course, too, probably one of the top 10 courses 
we play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webb, the top money-winner with more than $1.2 million, has to  
be the favorite when first-round action begins Thursday. She 
already has six victories this season, including the du Maurier 
Classic on Aug. 1 -- the circuit's fourth and final major of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The rolling, tree-lined course has been set up at 6,191 yards  
and will play at par 72 for the women. Two days of rain in the area 
made Walnut Hills play a tad longer in the practice rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	If those conditions hold, it would favor long hitters like Webb  
and Robbins, the pride of Mount Pleasant, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	``The course plays a lot longer,'' Kuehne said after a round in  
Wednesday's pro-am event. ``Where you fly it is where the ball 
goes, by and large. It's not rolling much in the fairways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A wet, energy-sapping golf course is perhaps the last thing  
Jones needs. The playoff victory last week left her drained. 
</P>
<P>
	``After nine holes, it looked a little stormy and I was tired,''  
said Jones, who needed four extra holes to win it. ``When you win, 
you have some adrenaline sabotage. So, I went home and took a nap 
and went to a movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephenson, the 47-year-old Australian, hasn't won an LPGA event  
since 1987. That made last week's near-miss all the more 
frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I can win any week now,'' Stephenson said. ``My  
coach, Mike McGetrick, keeps telling me I can win. He said if I 
would just keep some patience, I'd be fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I get off to a bad start, I get frustrated.''  
</P>
<P>
	Walnut Hills could be just the place to shed those blues. It is  
a course on which veterans have done well. Past winners in this 
field this week include Barb Mucha, Jane Geddes, Beth Daniel, Dale 
Eggeling, Michelle McGann and Pat Hurst. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm playing the best I have in a long time,'' Stephenson said.  
``We'll see what happens.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. May Vote Again on Casinos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORONADO, Calif. (AP) -- Some California lawmakers have vowed to  
repair the constitutional flaws in a voter initiative that 
legalized Nevada-style gambling at Indian casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Supreme Court this week invalidated the measure --  
known as Proposition 5 -- on the grounds that it sought to allow 
tribes to operate video slot machines and other games banned by the 
state constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, state Sen. James Brulte, the Republican minority  
caucus leader, and Sen. Richard Polanco, the Democratic majority 
leader, both pledged to revive the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will do what we can to ensure that we move a constitutional  
amendment to the voters that allows them to once again say that 
this kind of gaming is acceptable on reservations,'' Polanco said. 
</P>
<P>
	A constitutional amendment allowing the video slot machines  
would require a two-thirds vote of the Democrat-controlled 
Legislature in order to get on the ballot, making Republican 
support essential. But the issue cuts across party lines and is 
influenced by the big-money lobbying and campaign contributions of 
both casino supporters and foes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly $100 million was spent last year in campaigns for and  
against Proposition 5, the most expensive ballot initiative race in 
the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribes have been operating video slot machines and certain  
casino-style card games, like blackjack, for years without state or 
federal approval. The machines bring in 70 percent of Indian 
gambling revenues in California, said Daniel Tucker, chairman of 
the California Nations Indian Gaming Association. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the 41 Indian casinos in California generated an  
estimated $1.4 billion in gross revenue, according to CNIGA.

	Legislative Emergency in Venezuela  
</P>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A constitutional assembly controlled  
by supporters of President Hugo Chavez declared a legislative 
emergency in Venezuela today, usurping most of Congress's 
functions. The move takes away the Venezuelan Congress's right to 
pass laws and limits its duties to a narrow range of activities 
such as budget oversight. It is the latest development in an 
ongoing confrontation between the assembly -- established last month 
to write a new constitution for Venezuela -- and the legislative and 
judicial branches of government.

	Evening Trading Begins With Trickle  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Trading began with a trickle today in what  
amounted to the first real evening session for individual investors 
on the East Coast and the first real afternoon session for those on 
the West Coast. The new session from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time 
-- or 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific time -- is being offered Monday 
through Thursday for customers of Discover Brokerage and Dreyfus 
Brokerage Services on an electronic exchange named MarketXT. About 
45 minutes into Wednesday's session, about 1,200 orders had been 
executed.

	Prehistoric Man May Not Be Very Old  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Scientists say the frozen remains of a  
prehistoric man found in a Canadian glacier is a rare and 
intriguing discovery, but may not be old enough to help resolve the 
intensifying debate over how people arrived in North America. Three 
teachers were hunting for sheep in a remote corner of northwestern 
British Columbia when they found the well-preserved body Aug. 14 in 
a rapidly melting glacier just south of the Yukon-British Columbia 
border.

	Walking Said To Avoid Heart Disease

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- You don't have to get all sweaty to avoid heart  
disease -- brisk walking is just fine. Either three hours of brisk 
walking per week or half that time spent working up a sweat at 
jogging, aerobic dance or other vigorous exercise reduced the risk 
of heart disease 35 percent to 40 percent in a study of 72,488 
women. The study was to be published in tomorrow's New England 
Journal of Medicine

	Palestinian Delays Washington Trip  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- The top Palestinian negotiator delayed a trip  
to Washington today amid reports that the Israelis and Palestinians 
are close to a compromise on reviving a U.S.-brokered peace accord. 
Saeb Erekat said he would continue talks tomorrow with Israeli 
negotiator Gilead Sher on two major deadlocked issues: the release 
of Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel attacks; and a timetable for 
an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank outlined in the accords 
brokered by President Clinton at Wye River, Maryland last October.

	Phasing Out Gas Additive Urged  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A report by environmental officials from eight  
Northeast states called today for a controversial methanol-based 
gasoline additive to be largely phased out within three years 
because it pollutes waterways. But the report also cautioned that 
replacing MTBE as an additive could become tricky and pose still 
other health risks by increasing the amount of toxic chemicals 
going into the air from motor vehicles. 

</P>
<P>
	Lawmaker Wants Bank Investigated

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the House Banking Committee  
said today that Congress must investigate whether the Bank of New 
York was duped or willingly aided a money-laundering scheme that 
federal investigators say involves the Russian mob. In Moscow, 
Russia's finance minister denied his government was linked to the 
multibillion-dollar scheme, which has been described as potentially 
one of the biggest cases of money-laundering ever uncovered in the 
United States.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The heads of the country's ATM networks today  
urged consumers not to withdraw unusually large amounts of cash, 
while assuring them that their cards will work normally through the 
year-end date change. The nation's bankers, meanwhile, are 
distributing a folksy sample sermon for clergy to help them debunk 
fears of a Year 2000 catastrophe.

Jones industrials to a new closing high. The Dow Jones industrial 
average was up 42.74 at 11,326.04, topping its previous record 
close of 11,299.76, set Monday. Advancing issues on the New York 
Stock Exchange led decliners 1,612-1,388. The Nasdaq was up 53.23 
at 2,805.60.

</P>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Manny Ramirez hit three of Cleveland's  
five home runs, and the Indians rebounded from a tough loss to beat 
the Oakland Athletics 12-4 today. Ramirez, who had 36 homers and a 
major league-leading 130 RBIs, had the second three-homer game of 
his career.

<HEADLINE> Harvard, Boston Settle Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Harvard University and Boston have reached a $40  
million agreement to settle a fight over the university's secret 
purchase of 14 properties in the city's Allston neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	The two announced Tuesday that Harvard will make $40 million in  
voluntary payments-in-lieu-of-taxes over the next two decades -- $12 
million more than a previous agreement between the school and the 
city. Harvard will also build 288 new units of graduate student 
housing on its Allston campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole thing is a big deal and it's a signal of a very  
cooperative and progressive relationship between Harvard and the 
city that's been going on two years now,'' said Joe Wrinn, Harvard 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, it was learned Harvard secretly bought 52 acres in  
Allston for $88 million between 1988 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard used a private broker and didn't tell sellers, city  
officials or residents who was behind the purchases. Officials said 
they feared the owners would have raised the prices if they knew 
the buyer was the world's wealthiest university. 
</P>
<P>
	After the sale became known, Harvard donated land that will be  
the home of a new Allston branch of the Boston Public Library.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Child Stars Squandered Riches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former child star Paul Petersen thought ``The  
Donna Reed Show'' gravy train would never end. He played Jeff Stone 
on the popular 1960s television show until he was 21, and there was 
quite a fortune in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lassie'' star Jon Provost was 3 when he started his television  
career. He ``basically retired'' with a nest egg when he was 18. 
And Brandon Cruz had a bundle of cash after ``The Courtship of 
Eddie's Father'' left the air. 
</P>
<P>
	That was then, this is now. These TV icons, riding high during  
the formative years of the baby boomer generation, squandered their 
riches, and now they are out there selling their tales. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services giant SunAmerica Inc. is paying them to  
appear on talk shows to discuss how poor financial planning left 
them with little of their Hollywood fortunes. It is SunAmerica's 
way of promoting its retirement planning services. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the former child stars has settled into  
non-entertainment careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen, 53, founded the nonprofit A Minor Consideration, which  
serves as an advocate for the new generation of childhood stars and 
athletes. He talks about the ``terrible choices in my 20s: drugs, 
alcohol, bad people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he bought 20 cars, five homes and 30 televisions.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was a pile of money, and the mistake I made is that I  
didn't save my savings. I thought this gravy train would 
continue,'' Petersen said. 
</P>
<P>
	He ponders: ``When I look back at buying a sports car at 17 and  
my first house in Beverly Hills, I think now, `Why didn't I buy it 
in Burbank?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Provost, 49, also has regrets.  
</P>
<P>
	He now works for an escrow title company in the Northern  
California community of Santa Rosa. His spending spree began when 
he dropped $6,000 (1960s dollars) for a Lotus sports car. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pretty much partied my money away,'' Provost said. ``During  
the 1960s and 1970s the motto was `live for today,' and we didn't 
really plan for the future. The money was there and I never really 
understood about money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went out and bought cars. I was turned loose in a candy  
store, what can I say? It was instant gratification.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz, 37, remembers buying 12 surfboards, six wet suits and  
airline tickets in one day for an around-the-world surf adventure. 
He eventually lost a significant amount of his money in failed real 
estate deals. 
</P>
<P>
	These are the stories SunAmerica wants America to hear, and they  
are betting these familiar faces will appeal to the boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	SunAmerica won't say how much it is paying the former child  
stars. The firm made a $10,000 donation to A Minor Consideration, 
but Petersen said his fees for personal appearances are 
significant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their target group is baby boomers and I'm a boomer myself,''  
said Provost, who isn't bashful about speaking in public. ``I enjoy 
being in front of people. It's in the blood I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so easy to forget that the future is going to come,''  
Petersen said. ``If it takes a bunch of vintage celebrities to 
change the thinking, then that's what it will take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen said he recovered financially since blowing his  
fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once I got my bearings, my life is fine. We're cool,'' he  
said. ``I've learned my lessons. But I'm concerned. I see my 
friends with pretty fancy ZIP codes who have no savings. If I can 
speak to them, then I feel I can speak to everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Provost agrees they can have an impact.  
</P>
<P>
	``For people who grew up with Lassie and Timmy, they can relate  
to me because of the image I portrayed of being wholesome and 
honest. They'll know I've made mistakes and learned from them,'' 
Provost said.

<HEADLINE> China Bans Two Top Swimmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Two of China's veteran swimmers have been banned  
for three years for doping, making them ineligible for the 2000 
Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese Swimming Association imposed the bans on Wang Wei  
and Xiong Guoming, who each had a previous drug offense, the 
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported late Wednesday. Their 
coaches, Cheng Zhi and Xu Huiqin, were banned for one year. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban on Xiong deprives China of one of its top male swimmers  
heading into next year's Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang and Xiong tested positive for the performance-enhancing  
drug clenbuterol in out-of-competition tests in March. Athletes use 
clenbuterol to bulk up muscle mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Xiong's ban went into effect Aug. 9, and Wang's will start on  
April 13, 2000, when he finishes a two-year ban imposed earlier, 
Xinhua said. They also were each fined 8,000 yuan ($936), and their 
coaches were each fined 12,000 yuan ($1,445).

<HEADLINE> Dell Offers Online Server Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp. announced a new service  
Wednesday under which the company will maintain customers' servers 
over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal, said Ro Parra, senior vice president of Round Rock,  
Texas-based Dell, is to eventually have computer systems detect, 
diagnose and resolve most of their problems without human 
interaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend to use the Internet to revolutionize the customer  
support experience,'' Parra said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement marks an expansion of Dell's Internet  
capabilities, said Cody Acree, vice president of technical research 
at Frost Securities in Dallas. ``It is not something I've seen in 
the other major PC manufacturers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Dell, head of the country's largest PC maker,  
demonstrated the new technology for diagnosing computer problems 
online at Dell's first DirectConnect convention Wednesday, though 
at one point audience members had to prompt the leading seller of 
desktop computers how to delete an infected file. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet will provide a dramatic drop in costs, destroy old  
competitive advantages and remake business models, Dell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is clearly reshaping the flow of capital,'' Dell  
said, noting that an increasing portion of the company's sales are 
over the Internet. ``The net is really the backbone of the company 
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft chairman Bill Gates demonstrated new Microsoft  
software, including some of the capabilities of Windows 2000, its 
long-delayed operating system for high-powered computers and 
corporate networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to see Windows 2000 in action,'' Gates said.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked what problems the company has encountered besides its  
antitrust case with the Justice Department, Gates pointed inward. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the problems we have are the problems of success,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates said it's important to retain creativity, stifle  
bureaucracy and move fast. ``You don't let someone come along like 
we did and change the rules of the game.''

<HEADLINE> Jumper Blames Shoe Co. for Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A college track star says a shoe that came apart  
just as he was about to high jump caused a foot injury and ruined 
his chances of making the Olympic team. He is suing. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Lyon, captain of the track team at Augustana College,  
claims in his suit that a specialized sports shoe tore in half 
during his approach in the high jump last winter. He fell, injuring 
ligaments and bones in his left foot. He has been wearing a cast 
since the Feb. 26 track meet at Illinois Wesleyan. 
</P>
<P>
	He filed suit Tuesday in Cook County Circuit Court against ASICS  
Tiger Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyon, winner of the NCAA Division III national championship his  
sophomore year, said the meet was the first time he wore the new 
Mega Hi-Jump shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	He had planned to participate in the Olympic trials next summer  
and is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	ASICS representatives were not immediately available to comment  
on the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons said doctors have told him that he has an 80 to 90 percent  
chance of being able to run again, but his future as a high jumper 
is questionable.

<HEADLINE> Streaming Video Can Slow to Trickle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Progress isn't always pretty.  
</P>
<P>
	From the discovery of fire to the invention of the wheel to  
radio, television, computers and other modern technological 
wonders, there are always bugs to work out of any new breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
	Live video -- or even canned tape -- on the Internet is a perfect  
example. 
</P>
<P>
	Streaming video, the Internet's highly touted attempt to be like  
television, burst on the scene a few years ago plagued by digital 
flotsam and jetsam that turned the ``stream'' into a mere trickle, 
reducing the flow of motion pictures to a halting slide show. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a small square on the screen about the size of a postage  
stamp, frames froze at random, catching unsuspecting subjects in 
unflattering candid shots -- mouths agape in midspeech or twisted in 
some ordinary expression made grotesque by the stop-action whimsy 
of snarled ``streaming'' images. 
</P>
<P>
	That was then. What about now?  
</P>
<P>
	With more and more Internet ``TV shows'' and other video-based  
entertainment content coming to the World Wide Web at a furious 
pace, it seemed like a good time to test streaming video, using 
three different computers ranging from ancient (5 years old) to 
archaic (2 years) to brand new. 
</P>
<P>
	There are a slew of sites that offer streaming video, many  
pornographic or voyeuristic, but few focus entirely on presenting 
material via video like Alternative Entertainment Network TV 
(www.aentv.com), which offers things like classic TV shows, 
historic sports moments, Hollywood behind-the-scenes footage and 
comedy, including live coverage of this year's Montreal 
International Comedy Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Hosted by veteran comic actor Fred Willard, the multi-layered  
festival site-within-a-site fit the bill for some serious but 
unscientific testing, with lots of spots to explore and lots of 
comedy built in. Maybe too much. 
</P>
<P>
	From the beginning, the limitations of streaming video are part  
of the joke, with an intro announcer saying that 200 performers 
from around the world will fit their routines into a ``screen the 
size of a ravioli.'' The opening message was blurry and the sound 
was out of synch. 
</P>
<P>
	Jumping to the festival's main page, the first of many delays  
cropped up, momentum blocked by a message saying that the latest 
version of a certain ``helper'' program was needed. It had to be 
downloaded from a separate site and then it had to be installed, 
which required restarting the machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Resistance was futile. There was no choice but to comply.  
</P>
<P>
	After doing all that and returning to the festival site, the  
2-year-old computer's Internet browser crash three times trying to 
get to Willard's interviews of nightly festival guest hosts. After 
finally getting through, following a cold boot of the computer, the 
interviews wouldn't launch until I exited again and registered the 
pushy new ``helper'' program with its maker via e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Crashes, mandatory downloads, tyrannical software. Was this all  
part of the gag? 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' Willard deadpanned later in a telephone interview. ``We  
were working in conjunction with the technical people to bring the 
jokes home, even if that meant having to call a computer repairman 
to your house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Montreal, the difficulties in putting so much visual  
information on the Web immediately as it happened were too much 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was supposed to be live,'' Willard said. ``Then I got there  
and they said to say `almost live.' Then they said scratch that and 
how it turned out was that we would do one Wednesday and it would 
come out on Thursday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Fernwood Tonight'' actor is currently all over television  
hawking one of those 10-10 phone numbers, and also had a small part 
in this summer's ``Austin Powers'' sequel. He said he was pleased 
with the outcome of the latest venture, despite technical problems, 
even when he heard his face was a smeary, unrecognizable blur on 
much of his tape. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the future,'' he said. ``Radio and television had lots of  
glitches in the beginning too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally into the interview area, the segments revealed that many  
of streaming video's original shortcomings are still apparent, 
especially with a 56k modem connection. 
</P>
<P>
	The sound was clear (thanks to that pesky little ``helper''  
program) but was almost always out of synch with video clips, which 
ranged in image quality from lurching to fairly smooth motionwise, 
but were never sharp. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Springer, Howie Mandel, David Hyde-Pierce and Rob Lowe  
cracked wise, and were actually funny a few times, despite what the 
herky-jerky video playback did to their timing. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving the interview area to check out tapes of stand-up  
comedians on stage, the browser crashed again, requiring a restart. 
Doing the same test on the other machines, not surprisingly things 
were even worse on the older machine and slightly better on the 
newest, but on all of them the images were tiny, blurry and people 
moved like robots. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not fair to blame AENTV or any other individual streaming  
video provider though; the problems are unavoidable because of the 
limited bandwidth connections to the Internet most people have at 
home. There is just too much data trying to move through regular 
telephone wiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Someday, when bandwidth limitations are history, the Internet  
might just compete with television for the everyday entertainment 
audience. It can be fun now, as a novelty, but for most of the 
millions surfing the Web, streaming video is still a bit of a 
laugher.

<HEADLINE> Telecoms Push European Shares Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks rose Wednesday, as top-performing  
telecommunications shares climbed across the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies ended 3.81  
points higher, or 1.2 percent, at 314.34, while the Dow Jones Euro 
Stoxx Index, which tracks 297 companies in countries joining the 
single currency, ended 5.24 points higher at 328.98. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index closed up 75.42 points at  
3856.72, while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index ended 58.83 points better at 
2792.27. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecoms sector indexes were the day's best performers, fueled  
by talk of expansion, tie-up expectations and the lack of surprises 
on U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's U.S. interest rate increase of one-quarter percentage  
point was expected, which relieved concerns about the immediate 
outlook for global interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In Frankfurt, the Xetra DAX index rose 1.4 percent to 5,400.32,  
aided by Deutsche Telekom's announcement it plans to expand 
internationally in mobile communications, online business and data 
communications and network access through mergers and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Mannesman, the telecommunications and engineering group, rose  
after it said it hopes to offer a five-year eurobond issue this 
week or the next to help refinance outstanding debt in acquired 
stakes of Omnitel and Infostrada. The news removed fears of a 
capital increase, a trader said. 
</P>
<P>
	London's FTSE 100 index rose 0.9 percent, to 6,369.5, with  
British Telecom gaining 5.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paris CAC 40 index ended up 2 percent to 4,629.23, with  
France Telecom rising strongly. The banking sector also rose. 
Banque Nationale de Paris, Societe Generale and the investment bank 
Paribas all gained. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in French pay-television group Canal Plus climbed on  
speculation that Vivendi is planning to sell part of its 49 percent 
stake to German media group Bertelsmann. 
</P>
<P>
	Amsterdam's AEX rose 2 percent to 583.80, with publisher VNU up  
4.8 percent, after it posted a 16 percent rise in first-half income 
from consolidated operations.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Maddux To Miss Next Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Sixteen-game winner Greg Maddux will miss his  
next start for the Atlanta Braves after fluid was discovered in his 
injured wrist, while reliever Rudy Seanez could be out for the 
season with a stress fracture in his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux, who chipped a bone in his wrist last weekend while  
diving for a foul pop-up, said he would skip Friday night's game at 
St. Louis to give his injured wrist more time to heal. Terry 
Mulholland will start in his place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I could pitch,'' said Maddux, 16-6 and a four-time  
Cy Young winner. ``I played catch (Tuesday) and it was pretty sore 
an hour later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team doctors advised Maddux to miss his next start after  
discovering fluid in the injured area. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to try to get it out before I throw,'' Maddux said.  
``If I tried to throw this start, I would probably miss the next 
one. We'll wait a week to 10 days to see how it is. It's the old 
better-safe-than-sorry plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux, who has won six straight starts, said the fluid should  
dissipate with rest and he expects to rejoin the rotation for 
Tuesday's game at Cincinnati. In the meantime, the Braves' five-man 
rotation can accommodate his missed start because team is off 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm lucky that my day to pitch was the off-day,'' Maddux said.  
``I'm not going to screw up the other guys. If everything goes 
well, I'll slide right back in next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seanez, one of the team's most valuable middle relievers, was  
placed on the 15-day disabled list Monday after an MRI disclosed 
the stress fracture. He expects to undergo another examination next 
week to see if the injury has improved. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're saying it's going to be six to eight weeks, but I'm  
hoping for mid-September,'' said Seanez, 6-1 with a 3.35 ERA and 
three saves in 56 games. ``That would be the best case if things go 
perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seanez has been plagued by injuries throughout his career. This  
is the seventh stint on the DL. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves began Thursday with a 1 1/2-game lead over the New York  
Mets in the NL East. With less than five weeks remaining in the 
regular season, Seanez hopes to return in time to make a few 
appearances before the 25-man postseason roster is set. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would give me plenty of time to make sure,'' he said.  
``If not, then I'll shut it down for the year.''

<HEADLINE> Private Land Hidden in Park System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Privately owned land within the national parks  
is becoming increasingly valuable, raising concerns that 
development will threaten the federal park system, a conservation 
group said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Park Service as well as private groups have tried  
to increase purchase of such parcels -- known as ``inholdings'' -- 
but Congress has not provided nearly enough money to buy the 
thousands of acres that environmentalists say are in greatest 
peril. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within 84 million acres of the national park system, 7 million  
acres are privately owned,'' Paul Pritchard, president of the 
National Park Trust, said at a news conference. The group is one of 
a number of organizations that are trying to find ways to buy some 
of these lands and donate them to the park system. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing Park Service statistics, Pritchard said, ``On any given  
day 200,000 acres are under an immediate threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its report the National Park Trust said that the threat to  
parks from the commercialization of ``inholding'' properties is 
growing significantly because the value of these lands in many 
cases has skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
	The report cited 110,000 acres of privately owned property in  
and next to 20 parks, valued at more than $70 million, as being at 
greatest risk of being sold for commercial purposes. The ``top 
targets'' list ranged from 9 acres within the Cape Cod National 
Seashore in Massachusetts, appraised at $2.8 million, to 86,426 
acres of the Catellus property at the Mojave National Preserve in 
California, valued at $7.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	David Barna, spokesman for the National Park Service, said the  
agency was ``delighted that they're bringing attention to these 
pieces of property within the national parks that we'd like to 
acquire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials said there are no restrictions on the use of  
privately owned land within the parks, although the owners must 
comply with local zoning requirements. ``The Park Service has no 
jurisdiction over it (and) ... no control over what they do with 
the land,'' said Elaine Sevy, an agency spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chuck Cushman, executive director of the American Land  
Rights Association, a property rights advocacy group, said concerns 
about inholdings are exaggerated. ``Most inholders do not want to 
sell their land and do not want to use the land for logging, 
condos, or other activities'' detrimental to the adjacent parks, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pritchard said ``the danger that this land could be sold for  
development, bulldozing, clear cutting or for other destructive 
purposes constitutes the single greatest threat to the system of 
national and state parks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has been reluctant to come up with money for buying  
land inside or next to federal park land. Pritchard's group said in 
1998 only $23 million was provided for national park land 
acquisition, a tenth of what the Park Service had sought. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer the House and Senate approved about half of the $295  
million the Interior Department had sought for its ``land legacy'' 
purchases, including funds earmarked to buy inholdings and land 
adjacent to federal parks. 
</P>
<P>
	One ambitious attempt to address the inholding problems has  
focused on the southern California desert. 
</P>
<P>
	A private group, the Wildlands Conservancy, recently began  
negotiations to buy 430,000 acres parceled out checkerboard-fashion 
in and around Joshua Tree National Park and the Mojave National 
Preserve in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Catellus property is up for sale. But the deal is  
still in preliminary stages and final approval will depend on $36 
million coming from the federal government. So far, the Senate has 
agreed to come up with only $15 million and the House none at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the more than 100,000 acres of inholdings cited by the  
National Park Trust as being in peril were 375 acres in the Pecos 
National Historic Park in New Mexico; 11 acres in the Keweenaw 
National Historic Park in Michigan; 40 acres in the Blue Ridge 
Parkway in North Carolina and Virginia; 315 acres in the Antietam 
National Battlefield in Maryland; and 17,321 acres in the 
Everglades National Park in Florida.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Utility Customers Outraged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- What happens when you flip the light switch? In  
Chicago these days, you can't be too sure. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of blackouts large and small this summer have outraged  
residents and businesses, nearly spoiled frozen plant and animal 
tissue at the distinguished Field Museum of Natural History, and 
made Commonwealth Edison a target for politicians and consumer 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was actually giving them the benefit of the doubt till the  
last week or so when everything went out downtown. Then I totally 
lost faith,'' said Natalie Smith, co-owner of Langtree Salon on the 
North Side. 
</P>
<P>
	Her business lost power in July's heat wave just before her last  
two customers of the day arrived. ``This one person came in and I 
was like, `The wax is still hot,' so I took her up front and waxed 
her eyebrows by the window,'' Ms. Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	ComEd, which serves about 3.4 million customers in northern  
Illinois, has acknowledged the problems, apologized and said it 
will spend about $3 billion to improve its system, including 
replacing or upgrading aging equipment and perhaps even building a 
new substation on the North Side. 
</P>
<P>
	The utility said some of the power failures may have been caused  
by Bakelite, an early ``wonder plastic'' that was used to seal 
joints in ComEd's underground cables in the 1950s. Some of the 
Bakelite has become porous, allowing moisture in and causing short 
circuits, ComEd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite ComEd's promises to do better, many are unconvinced.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone recognizes the system stinks. The company has to  
completely rebuild its infrastructure,'' said William Abolt, 
Chicago's environment commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	ComEd spokesman Keith Bromery called that statement an  
``over-characterization'' but conceded, ``Basically, we know that 
we have a reliability problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, ComEd's problems have been so chronic that a University  
of Michigan customer-satisfaction survey of the nation's 21 largest 
electric companies has put the utility at or near the bottom every 
year since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer's troubles started July 30 with a blackout that left  
a large slice of Chicago -- about 100,000 customers -- without power 
on the hottest day of the year, when the mercury hit 104. The 
utility blamed high demand for electricity because of the extreme 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems at a substation on Aug. 12 forced ComEd to shut off  
power to part of the Loop, Chicago's busiest business district. 
That led to the forced resignation of the utility's vice president 
for transmission and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Another mechanical problem caused a blackout Sunday that  
shuttered the Field Museum, imperiling its collection of DNA 
samples. A spokeswoman said Wednesday the samples appeared to have 
been saved by staff members who kept them cold with dry ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just not acceptable,'' said Rob Kelter, an attorney with  
the Citizens Utility Board. ``We're going to have a few days of 
100-degree weather every summer in Chicago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abolt said the problems are technically fixable but it is a  
matter of whether ComEd can make ``a cultural change'' within the 
organization and find the will to transform itself.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Denies Forcing Out Employee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department official who initially  
pressed for an inquiry into China's suspected theft of nuclear 
secrets from a U.S. weapons lab has generated a new controversy 
over whether he's been forced out his job -- a claim strongly denied 
by department officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Notra Trulock began work Tuesday for a private contractor, only  
24 hours after he announced his resignation from the government and 
told reporters he departed because he was being squeezed out of the 
ongoing spy investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Undersecretary Ernest Moniz said in an interview Tuesday  
that Trulock ``in no sense was forced out'' and that he had been 
asked to stay as deputy chief of the department's intelligence 
office. Moniz said Trulock had indicated a desire to leave the 
department for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	A career civil servant, Trulock has been a controversial figure  
often at the core of the government's handling of a three-year 
espionage investigation involving a Taiwan-born scientist at the 
Los Alamos weapons lab in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Trulock, who resigned on Monday, did not return several  
telephone calls on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moniz acknowledged that Trulock no longer was involved in the  
Los Alamos investigation and said there was no reason for him to 
be. The department under a presidential directive in early 1998 
created a separate counterintelligence office, headed by a veteran 
FBI official, to deal with investigations such as the Los Alamos 
case, Moniz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The intelligence office, where Trulock worked, had other duties  
including assessing what secrets may have been lost to China as a 
result of espionage. Moniz said Trulock had been involved in making 
that assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson gave Trulock  
a $10,000 achievement award for his persistence in pursuing the Los 
Alamos espionage concerns back to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Trulock had been demoted from chief to acting deputy chief of  
the intelligence office. When Richardson arrived in the fall of 
1998, he put Larry Sanchez, a CIA official who worked with him at 
the United Nations, in to head the office. Moniz said Sanchez had 
tried to keep Trulock on as his permanent deputy, but that Trulock 
didn't want the No. 2 job after being told he would not replace 
Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
	Largely because of Trulock's persistence, an FBI investigation  
was begun in 1996 focusing on a Taiwan-born scientist, Wen Ho Lee, 
at Los Alamos. The investigation continues, although Lee, who was 
fired in March for security violations, has not been charged with a 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Praised by some senators as a hero, Trulock in recent months has  
been the focus of criticism as well. 
</P>
<P>
	He was rebuked sharply by former Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., in  
June after Trulock complained that he had not been allowed to see 
in advance a report by the President's Foreign Intelligence 
Advisory Board on security at the department. Trulock accused the 
panel of trying to ``shoot the messenger'' because it recommended 
reorganizing the DOE intelligence activities. 
</P>
<P>
	In a scathing letter to Trulock, Rudman accused the DOE official  
of making ``wildly inaccurate assertions and reckless 
accusations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have misconstrued your obligations to be candid as a  
license for calumny. And, intentionally or unintentionally, you 
have repeatedly marketed fiction as fact,'' Rudman wrote Trulock. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, the former intelligence chief at Los Alamos, who  
himself has been singled out for criticism, accused Trulock of 
inappropriately singling out Lee in the espionage investigation 
because of Lee's Chinese heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	Trulock has denied singling out Lee because of his ethnic  
background. 
</P>
<P>
	Trulock also clashed with the DOE's independent inspector  
general because of the IG's recent report that failed to support 
Trulock's contention that senior DOE officials had blocked him on 
the espionage issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general, in findings made public Aug. 13, said  
investigators ``were unable to reconcile the conflicting 
information'' concerning Trulock's allegations about interference 
by his superiors.

<HEADLINE> Two Die in Train-Vehicle Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELWOOD, Ill. (AP) -- An Amtrak train headed for Chicago collided  
with a truck this morning, killing two men who were thrown from the 
truck, officials said. No one aboard the train was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the accident happened at a private gravel  
crossing near Elwood, about 40 miles south of Chicago. The crossing 
had a stop sign and a sign pointing out the crossing on one side, 
but no flashing lights or gates, Will County Sheriff's Lt. Marty 
Shifflet said. 
</P>
<P>
	The train, known as the Statehouse, was carring 103 passengers  
from St. Louis to Chicago when the crash occurred, Amtrak 
spokeswoman Debbie Hare said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shifflet said the train stayed on track and showed little  
damage, while the truck was ``extremely twisted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was demolished and on fire,'' Shifflet said.  
</P>
<P>
	The train was stopped for about an hour, Hare said.  
</P>
<P>
	The victims' names were not immediately released.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- It has become a tradition for Jason  
Gatson. Each year, he comes close to winning a national gymnastics 
championship, only to lose out to Blaine Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson took a small step Wednesday toward finally catching his  
training partner, taking a slim first-night lead over Wilson in the 
all-around competition in the U.S. Gymnastics Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson, 18, who trains with Wilson at the U.S. Olympic Training  
Center in Colorado Springs, Colo., won the parallel bars event with 
a mark of 9.95 and placed first in the floor exercise with a mark 
of 9.8 en route to scoring 57.325 points in the preliminary phase 
of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, 25, seeking an unprecedented fourth straight national  
all-around title, won on the rings with a mark of 9.6 en route to a 
total score of 57.225. He is competing despite recent problems with 
both shoulders -- after the pommel horse routine, Wilson rubbed his 
right shoulder for several seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson finished second to Wilson at the national championships  
in 1996 and 1998. He was third in 1997, behind Wilson and John 
Roethlisberger. 
</P>
<P>
	Roethlisberger, 29, a two-time Olympian who won four national  
titles in the early 1990s, was third in the all-around competition 
with a score of 56.475 and Brett McClure was fourth with 55.800 
points. Guard Young, a senior at BYU, was fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's scores count for 20 percent of the all-around  
competition. The remaining 80 percent will be based on scores in 
Friday night's all-around finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to beat him Friday. I hate losing,'' Wilson said of  
his battle with Gatson. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 14 men in the all-around competition qualify for the  
World Championships team trials, to be held Sept. 15-18 in Kansas 
City. That event will help choose the American squad for the World 
Gymnastics Championships Oct. 8-16 in Tianjin, China. 
</P>
<P>
	The championships opened in nearly empty Arco Arena, with only a  
few hundred spectators on hand at the start of competition. A much 
larger crowd is expected Thursday when the women begin competing. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Gatson and Wilson, three other champions were  
crowned Wednesday in individual events. Roethlisberger won the 
pommel horse (9.95), Young the vault (9.8) and Jamie Natalie of 
Ohio State, who had knee surgery three weeks ago, the horizontal 
bars (9.95). 
</P>
<P>
	Roethlisberger, who was thrilled with his win in the pommel  
horse and his third-place showing in the all-around standings, is 
coming off knee surgery that kept him sidelined until recently and 
forced him to wear a brace on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is by far the biggest accomplishment I've had in my  
career,'' he said, choking up. ``I'm a 29-year-old gymnast with a 
reconstructed knee and I'm real proud to be where I am. I'm prouder 
of this than anything I've done before. You can take all of my 
national championships.''

<HEADLINE> Big College Football Weekend Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Get ready for a classic weekend of college football.  
</P>
<P>
	Three of the nation's top four teams help kick off the season on  
Saturday, with top-ranked Florida State opening at home against 
Louisiana Tech, and No. 4 Arizona at No. 3 Penn State in the 
Pigskin Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Seminoles are five-touchdown favorites over the  
Bulldogs, Arizona-Penn State shapes up as one of the biggest 
season-openers in years. 
</P>
<P>
	Why jeopardize national title aspirations by playing such a big  
game so early? 
</P>
<P>
	``Really, there are very few negatives,'' Penn State coach Joe  
Paterno insisted. ``When you have a chance to prepare for a team as 
good as Arizona, you probably get a little more out of summer 
conditioning and preseason practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Win or lose, you are probably a better football team when you  
start the next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds reasonable, but the loser may find it a bit tougher to  
get back in the chase for the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We plan to go in there and play well,'' said Keith Smith, who  
alternates at quarterback with Ortege Jenkins. ``We want to come 
out with a win. We're not playing Hawaii, this is Penn State. And a 
lot of guys stayed here in the summer getting ready for it. We'll 
be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, winners of 16 of its last 17 games, boasts an offense  
that averaged 445 yards and 34.7 points last season. In addition to 
their topnotch quarterbacks, the Wildcats have Trung Canidate, the 
Pac-10's leading rusher last season with 1,220 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State, meanwhile, counters with what could be the best  
defense in the nation, led by linebackers LaVar Arrington and 
Brandon Short, end Courtney Brown and cornerback David Macklin. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the talk about Penn State's defense is definitely true,''  
Canidate said. ``They're frightening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The opening weekend concludes on Sunday, when No. 9 Ohio State  
plays No. 12 Miami in the Kickoff Classic at Giants Stadium. Both 
teams have new quarterbacks -- Kenny Kelly for the Hurricanes and 
Austin Moherman for the Buckeyes. 
</P>
<P>
	The picks: 	
</P>
<P>
             *Louisiana Tech (plus 35) at No. 1 Florida State 	
</P>
<P>
	Seminoles find out if QB Chris Weinke has fully recovered from  
neck injury. ... FLORIDA STATE, 49-20. 
</P>
<P>
                *No. 4 Arizona (plus 5) at No. 3 Penn State    	
</P>
<P>
	If the Lions' defense lives up to the preseason hype, Penn State  
gets off to a strong start. ... PENN STATE, 24-13. 
</P>
<P>
                  *Kansas (plus 17) at No. 18 Notre Dame    	
</P>
<P>
	Irish better be careful of a Jayhawk team ready to spring a few  
surprises in '99. ... NOTRE DAME, 27-20. 
</P>
<P>
            *North Carolina State (plus 8 1/2) at No. 17 Texas    	
</P>
<P>
	With Ricky Williams gone, Longhorns' fate rides on Major  
Applewhite's arm . ... TEXAS, 31-24. 
</P>
<P>
       *No. 9 Ohio State (minus 6) vs. No. 12 Miami (at Giants Stadium)    	
</P>
<P>
	Buckeyes have lots of fresh faces, Hurricanes primed for a  
strong start. ... MIAMI, 27-24. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	1998-99 bowl game results: 13-7 (straight up); 10-10 (vs.  
spread).

<HEADLINE> George Thorogood Wants Only the Best </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don't call them covers. Call them the best songs  
that George Thorogood can find. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find good songs that need to be exposed,'' Thorogood said in  
a recent interview. ``The original recordings might not be that 
good, but you can hear a good song in there. To a person hearing it 
now for the first time, it's a new song. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's been the idea of this band, pretty much from day one,  
to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Destroyers released their first record in 1975. Their first  
hit, ``One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer,'' is a song by John Lee 
Hooker, one of Thorogood's main influences. (The others are Chuck 
Berry and Elmore James.) 
</P>
<P>
	He calls what he plays a form of blues boogie. ``It has been  
done before, by Canned Heat, Savoy Brown, Elvin Bishop, Steve 
Miller. They showed me the way. I try to pick out obscure songs 
those guys missed or didn't want to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gets harder all the time to find good songs for a CD.  
Writing gets harder too,'' he said. ``What do you do to not keep 
repeating yourself?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Thorogood was advised to use only his songs, so that he  
could be paid composer's royalties, he reasoned that if some of the 
songs weren't good, the albums wouldn't sell. ``I always say, get 
the best songs on the album.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His new album ``Half a Boy-Half a Man'' includes two of his  
songs: ``Just Passin' Thru'' and ``Not Tonight (I Have a 
Heartache),'' which has a country flavor. 
</P>
<P>
	The guitarist-singer doesn't see much difference between his  
music and country. ``I've got a slide guitar. They've got a pedal 
steel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thorogood, 46, enjoys humor in rock music. He cites two  
examples: Chuck Berry's ``Roll Over Beethoven'' and Randy Newman's 
``Mama Told Me (Not to Come).'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you do a show and make people laugh and dance at the same  
time, it's great. I like people to get the songs and have a 
chuckle,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He is impatient with rockers who go on TV talk shows and act  
depressed about their tours and record sales. ``You dream of being 
in a rock band. Why would you be depressed? I say, `What did you 
dream of in the 11th grade? You're doing it!' 
</P>
<P>
	``Doing it is still fun for me. Of course, I wouldn't be sitting  
in front of you talking about it if it wasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thorogood and the Destroyers toured with the Steve Miller Band  
for five weeks this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can't work with the best, we go out alone,'' said  
Thorogood, who has toured with Santana, Little Feat, the Allman 
Brothers, Z.Z. Top, the Rolling Stones and the J. Geils Band.

<HEADLINE> Two EPA Officials Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Two Environmental Protection Agency employees  
have been indicted on charges of falsifying documents that backed 
up the agency's decision to let Indian tribes regulate their own 
water quality. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Radell and Claudia Johnson each face fines of $1 million  
and up to 30 years in prison if convicted on charges of obstructing 
justice, conspiracy to obstruct justice and perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials allege that Radell and Johnson  
falsified and backdated EPA documents that were required for the 
agency's 1996 decision to let three tribes regulate water standards 
on their reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	The state of Wisconsin sued over the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	The agreements with the tribes -- the Lac du Flambeau Chippewa  
band, the Oneida tribe and the Menominee tribe -- were withdrawn. 
The agency was eventually ordered to pay Wisconsin and other 
parties about $369,000 in attorney's fees and costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Radell is an employee in the agency's Office of Regional Counsel  
in Philadelphia. Johnson is an employee of the EPA Water Division 
in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA spokesman Bill Omohundro declined comment on the content of  
the charges.

<HEADLINE> Judge Tosses Lawsuit Against Ford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Two days into the retrial of a $25 million  
lawsuit against the Ford Motor Co., a federal judge dismissed the 
case, agreeing with the automaker that the case lacked merit. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Alexander Harvey II's ruling marked the  
second time David Binakonsky's family has been rebuffed in its 
attempt to hold Ford liable for an alleged design flaw in the 1988 
Econoline van. Fire caused by leaking fuel killed Binakonsky in 
1992 after his van plowed into a tree alongside a hilly road in 
Frederick County, the family argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Binakonsky was drunk at the time, the family acknowledged.  
</P>
<P>
	``We won without even having to call a witness because the  
plaintiff's case was so flimsy and preposterous,'' said company 
spokesman Jim Cain from Ford headquarters in Dearborn, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	``It amazes me that the family believes they have a valid claim  
against Ford when clearly this driver was drunk, he had a history 
of drunk driving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family's attorney, Martin Freeman, said he will appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our case is he did survive the impact and he would be alive  
today if it hadn't been for the defective fuel system,'' Freeman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The family argued Ford is liable because the van didn't have a  
so-called ``check'' valve to prevent gasoline from reaching the 
engine compartment in an accident. The automaker also used plastic 
connectors and fuel lines even though they knew the devices were 
fire hazards, Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, however, didn't allow damaging Ford documents that  
proved some Ford employees had reservations about the plastic 
parts. The judge also ended the trial before the testimony of an 
automobile expert who could have proved harmful to Ford's case, 
Freeman said.

<HEADLINE> Evening Trading Begins With Trickle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Trading began with a trickle Wednesday in what  
amounted to the first real evening session ever held for individual 
investors on the East Coast and the first real afternoon session 
for those on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The new session from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time -- or 3 p.m.  
to 5 p.m. Pacific time -- is being offered Monday through Thursday 
for customers of Discover Brokerage and Dreyfus Brokerage Services 
on an electronic exchange named MarketXT. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 142 orders were executed during Wednesday's two-hour  
session, with about $3.5 million worth of stock changing hands 
overall. However, there was insufficient volume to match up most 
buyers and sellers, with more than 1,000 orders going unfilled. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft grabbed top honors as the most active issue for the  
inaugural session -- although with just 5,500 shares changing hands, 
the term ``most active'' was a bit of a stretch. The software maker 
finished the MarketXT session at $95.56 1/4 a share, a gain of 25 
cents from the closing Nasdaq quote. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have already demonstrated an appetite for making  
portfolio decisions at home, where they have more privacy and time 
to think. An estimated 20 percent to 25 percent of online trades 
are currently placed outside normal hours, and then executed when 
regular trading resumes in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	While other brokerages and alternative markets have already  
announced plans to extend their trading hours in the coming months, 
only the discount broker Datek Online had officially launched an 
after-hours session before Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	MarketXT takes after-hours trading a step forward because the  
late session on Datek's Island ECN exchange only runs for an hour 
and fifteen minutes after the regular 4 p.m. close of the New York 
Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's launch by MarketXT, formerly named Eclipse Trading,  
comes amid a suddenly fierce scramble to roll out extended hours 
for individual investors as the stock market hits new highs. The 
Dow Jones industrial average set another record on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, ETrade Group said it will offer trading from 4 p.m.  
to 6:30 p.m. through Instinet, the busiest market when regular 
exchanges are closed, and the Chicago Stock Exchange disclosed 
plans to become the first traditional market to extend its hours. 
</P>
<P>
	A week earlier, America Online announced that it would provide a  
link to after-hours trading through Wit Capital later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The impending competition has prompted NYSE and Nasdaq officials  
to announce that they'll introduce after-hours trading sometime 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	For most individual investors, the new offerings mark the first  
time they're being given a chance to manage their portfolios or 
react to late-breaking news outside normal trading hours. 
</P>
<P>
	That privilege has been long-reserved for elite money managers  
handling large pools of money such as mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	And on the West Coast, where the daily close of regular trading  
comes at 1 p.m., extended hours mean that investors won't get shut 
out after lunch -- a long-standing gripe. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the mainstreaming of after-hours trading has provoked  
some worries because it may expose investors to sharp price swings 
if there isn't sufficient demand to buy or sell a stock. 
</P>
<P>
	For that reason, many of the first after-hours services are  
requiring investors to specify the most they're willing to pay when 
buying or the least they're willing to take when selling. That 
means brokers carrying out the trades will be restricted in the 
deals they arrange. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, trading is being limited to major companies that are  
likely to generate sufficient volume for price stability. 
</P>
<P>
	Any changes in price that occur after hours won't affect the  
prices that appear in newspaper stock tables for that day's 
trading. Instead, after-hours price movements are reflected in the 
following day's opening quote. The after-hour prices also won't 
affect the closing quotes on market indexes and mutual funds, which 
are calculated at the 4 p.m. finish of NYSE and Nasdaq trading.

<HEADLINE> Workers Saved After Scaffold Breaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two workers dangling off the side of a building,  
their safety harnesses holding them 120 feet above the ground, were 
rescued by a policeman and a fireman who rappelled down from the 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
	A scaffolding suspension cable snapped Tuesday while Jose Lopez,  
35, and Roberto Hernandez, 33, were waterproofing the 17-story 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men were wearing safety harnesses attached to ropes  
tethered to the roof of the building. They dangled 12 stories up 
for about 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden, the machine stopped and my back was slamming  
the wall,'' said Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirley Toro, a resident in the building, said she heard  
Hernandez shouting in Spanish that the rope was too thin and was 
about to break. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Officer Romano Amleto rappelled down the building and  
hitched Lopez's safety harness to his own rope, despite concerns 
that it might not support both men. Amleto lowered himself and 
Lopez to the ground as about 200 onlookers cheered. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighter Thomas Foley came to Hernandez's aid, attaching the  
worker's harness to his rope and guiding him to a ladder on a fire 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get impressed much,'' said police Sgt. Mike Curtain,  
who supervised the rescue. ``But this was one of the most heroic 
things I've seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez was treated at a hospital for neck pain and released.  
Lopez was admitted with a deep finger cut and other minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Buildings department spokesman Paul Wein said Hernandez and  
Lopez acted properly and he considered the matter an accident. He 
said the department had no plans to investigate.

<HEADLINE> Belluzzo To Run Microsoft Web Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. reportedly has chosen  
Richard Belluzzo, a computer industry veteran, to run its Internet 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft today would not confirm the reports.  
</P>
<P>
	Belluzzo, 45, resigned on Monday as chairman and chief executive  
officer of Silicon Graphics Inc., a position he held for less than 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that he's expected to  
start as head of Microsoft's Internet unit -- now called the 
Consumer and Commerce Group -- on Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no comment for you at the moment,'' Microsoft spokesman  
Dan Leach said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he moved to Silicon Graphics, Belluzzo had a 22-year  
career at Hewlett-Packard, where he became the No. 2 executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's strategy appears to be to transfer its strength in  
the personal computer business to the Internet commerce arena, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strategy now is to use its software strengths to create a  
transaction backbone for the Internet,'' Mark R. Anderson, 
president of the research firm Technology Alliance Partners, told 
The Times. ``And Microsoft is really pulling back from the media 
stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's recent Web investments focus mainly on  
communications, shopping, travel, scheduling and personal finance. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the company has pulled back from some of its media  
ventures, last week selling off its collection of city arts and 
entertainment guides, MSN Sidewalk, for about $240 million to 
Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch.

<HEADLINE> 'Scream' Writer Ditches Horror </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Reliving his traumas has become a lucrative  
business for Kevin Williamson, the horror screenwriter and 
``Dawson's Creek'' creator says much of his work is based on things 
that really happened to him. 
</P>
<P>
	It's definitely the case with his directorial debut, ``Teaching  
Mrs. Tingle.'' The fanciful tale of three high school students' 
revenge against a tyrannical teacher is based on a cruel schoolmarm 
who squashed Williamson's budding writing ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was so mean to me, she just hated me and I never knew  
why,'' Williamson says. ``She, like, really discouraged me from 
being a writer, to the point where she ripped up a short story in 
my face and almost sent me to the principal's office because she 
hated me so much. 
</P>
<P>
	``She basically just tried to crush the dream, you know? She  
basically said, `You'll never be a writer. Your voice should never 
be heard.''' 
</P>
<P>
	A similar academic drubbing a year or two later in a college  
writing class finished the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``They trashed me. And I said, `There's the answer. No writing.  
I can't write.' And I gave up on it until, like, nine years 
later,'' says the 34-year-old Williamson, who bounced back to 
become one of the hottest screenwriters in Hollywood, penning 
``Scream,'' ``I Know What You Did Last Summer,'' ``Scream 2,'' 
``The Faculty'' and ``Halloween: H20.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it was a long haul back. He tried his hand at acting for a  
number of years before working on music videos, then was ready to 
give up on his Hollywood aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was severely unhappy because my life wasn't taking off, none  
of my dreams were coming true, nothing was happening for me,'' 
Williamson says. ``So I made a deal with myself that I would leave 
the business and move out of L.A. and try to find something else to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was going to go take a real estate course, but before I did  
that I said I'll write a script, and then just see. I always kept 
talking about it but I never did it, so I said, `If you just write 
it and then fail, then there's your answer, yet again.' And I wrote 
`Tingle.' That's what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the emotional pain of his early journey toward success,  
Williamson wouldn't trade the experience for an easier one. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's sort of the irony of the whole piece. All those  
negative messages I got as a kid, those things like, `You're not 
good enough, you can't do this,' and `You can't do that,' are 
ultimately the things that fueled me and propelled me onward,'' he 
says. ``It just didn't happen in my time line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He sold his first script, but it was never made into a movie, so  
it was a perfect choice for his directorial debut, and a decided 
departure from horror for a storyteller eager to avoid typecasting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly didn't want to be defined as the Horror Guy the  
rest of my life,'' Williamson says. ``And I also wanted to say to 
the world that I can create an adult character. I'm not just about 
teen-agers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furthering that effort, Williamson is writing an all-adult film  
he'll direct next year and has moved on from the WB network's 
``Dawson's Creek,'' which will continue without him, to a new TV 
series, the upcoming fall drama ``Wasteland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It deals with the lives of a group in their mid-20s struggling  
to make it in New York. ``Basically it's another autobiographical 
story, about me, my favorite subject,'' says Williamson, harking 
back to his days as a hard-up aspiring actor in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steven Spielberg-adoring title character on ``Dawson's  
Creek'' is a thinly disguised teen version of Williamson, while 
``Scream'' was inspired by a frightening night he had while house 
sitting. 
</P>
<P>
	With a major career goal -- directing -- under his belt,  
Williamson is focusing on personal challenges, like trying to have 
a life. 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole goal this year was to slack off,'' he says. ``It's  
really hard, I'm having a hard time, because I can't stand it. I'm 
a workaholic. I'd rather work. I'd rather work than sit back and 
relax. I can't understand the concept really, so it's really hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wears me out to relax. Trying to relax takes so much  
work,'' he says, stopping suddenly at what he's saying. ``Sounds 
sick. I hear myself and say, `How pathetic is this guy?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Williamson, who grew up in rural North Carolina, is a  
fisherman's son who credits his yarn-spinning mother with fostering 
his natural storytelling bent. 
</P>
<P>
	``She can make washing clothes sound exciting, you know,'' he  
says. ``She just goes off in her Southern way, about anything, a 
trip to the store, a visit from a friend. And she has a flair for 
the dramatic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And unlike some of the teens in his movies and TV show, he says  
his childhood was normal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was never in one clique or circle, but I think I was kind of  
liked,'' he says. ``There weren't any big horror stories growing up 
and in high school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then where does his blistering talent for creating cinema terror  
come from? Williamson thinks it stems from his lively imagination, 
and one intense primal fear. 
</P>
<P>
	``What scares me? I'm scared of the dark,'' he says. ``When I  
was a little kid my mom and dad used to make me turn out all the 
lights because we didn't have any money. They said if you left the 
light on, it cost, like, a quarter per hour, so if I kept the 
lights on I'd get charged. 
</P>
<P>
	``So what I did was I made an agreement with myself that when I  
became an adult, I would leave all the lights on if I chose to. And 
so when you go into my house at any given moment, it's lit up. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I walk into a dark house, I go nuts.''

<HEADLINE> NKorea Reactor Plan To Be Sped Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Work on two nuclear reactors in North  
Korea under a 1994 accord will be accelerated to allay the North's 
complaints the project is behind schedule, a South Korean official 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Chang Sun-sup, chief South Korean delegate to an American-led  
international consortium building the reactors, said major 
construction would likely begin before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ground was broken in 1997 for two light-water reactors, each  
with a rated capacity of 2,000 megawatts, but work was slowed due 
to tensions on the Korean Peninsula and a funding delay, Chang 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since South Korea and Japan have finished all needed legal  
action on the funding, including parliamentary approval, the 
project can now be accelerated,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The $4.6 billion non-weapons reactor project is a reward for a  
North Korean promise to freeze and eventually dismantle its 
suspected nuclear weapons program under the 1994 agreement with the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea will take up 70 percent, or $3.2 billion of the  
total cost, while Japan will assume $1 billion. The United States 
is required to supply 500,000 tons of fuel oil a year until the 
first reactor is built by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Chang's comments came after North Korea threatened to withdraw  
from the 1994 agreement, arguing that the United States has failed 
to live up to its end of the accord. 
</P>
<P>
	In a commentary carried Tuesday by the country's foreign news  
outlet KCNA, the North's ruling party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, 
said North Korea has suffered a ``huge loss'' by freezing its 
nuclear activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no intention to suffer any more. The relevant  
institutions in (North Korea), including the military, are calling 
for urgent measures against the indefinite delay'' in the reactor 
project, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States rejected the North Korean claim.  
</P>
<P>
	``Let me make clear the United States is meeting all of its  
obligations under the agreed framework,'' State Department deputy 
spokesman James Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chang indicated that the reactors cannot be built by 2003 as  
specified in the accord. He said 2003 is a ``target year, not the 
fixed year by which we definitely promised to build them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chang held North Korea partly responsible for the delay. He  
noted that the project was put on hold for several months in 1996 
because a North Korean submarine infiltrated into South Korean 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korean Peninsula was divided into the communist North and  
the capitalist South in 1945. They are technically still at war, 
with no peace treaty signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea's relations with South Korea, Japan and the United  
States have also been hurt since the reclusive regime test-fired a 
missile in August 1998 that flew over Japan and landed in the 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts fear North Korea is preparing to test a more advanced  
long-range ballistic missile capable of reaching Hawaii and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of U.S. congressional support today Rep. Tony Hall,  
D-Ohio, said foreign donors should continue supplying food aid to 
North Korea to help fight a famine that has killed as many as 2 
million of its people. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said he will use his fifth visit to North Korea to urge top  
government officials to cancel an expected test of its new 
long-range missile. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, who leaves Tokyo for Pyongyang on Thursday, will spend  
most of his time in the reclusive country traveling through rural 
areas, as he has done before, to evaluate the famine. But he also 
plans to meet with high-ranking government officials in the 
capital.

<HEADLINE> Perdue Rejoins Chicago Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Center Will Perdue, a member of three of  
Chicago's NBA championship teams, signed a contract Wednesday with 
the Bulls rather than return to league champion San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Perdue, who played for the Spurs for four years, flew into  
Chicago on Wednesday to sign the contract and then flew back to 
Texas, Bulls spokesman Tim Hallam said. He refused to release terms 
of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had an offer from the Bulls since last week, and I couldn't  
afford to let it sit on the table any longer,'' Perdue said. ``I 
tried to wait as long as I could to try to work something out with 
the Spurs, but it just didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perdue, who came to San Antonio before the 1995-96 season in  
exchange for Dennis Rodman, was a backup during the Bulls' first 
three championship seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, the Bulls signed free agent guard Cory Carr,  
second-round draft pick Lari Ketner and free agent center-forward 
Brett Robisch. Terms weren't disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr averaged 4.1 points and 1.2 rebounds in 42 games for the  
Bulls last season. The 6-foot-10 Ketner averaged 10.8 points, 8.3 
rebounds and 2.1 blocked shots as a senior at Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-11, 250-pound Robisch spent last season with Sioux  
Falls of the CBA.

<HEADLINE> Electric Chair Debated in Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The state Supreme Court has more than  
words to consider when deciding the fate of Florida's electric 
chair -- it has graphic color photos of the last victim. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Thomas Provenzano, the next man scheduled to die,  
held up two pictures Tuesday of Allen Lee ``Tiny'' Davis strapped 
in the chair minutes after being executed. 
</P>
<P>
	In one, the upper half of Davis' face is purplish and his  
features are scrunched together. A line of blood stretches down 
from beneath his leather mask. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Harry Lee Anstead called the images of Davis  
``heinous,'' ``horrible'' and ``right out of some horror movie.'' 
He challenged the lawyer representing the state to defend them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you hold that picture up to the people of the state of  
Florida and say this is what we want to do when we are taking a 
person's life through due process?'' Anstead asked Richard Martell, 
chief of capital appeals for Attorney General Bob Butterworth. 
</P>
<P>
	Martell agreed the photographs were graphic but disagreed they  
were reason to retire the electric chair. While electrocution is 
unpleasant, he said, that doesn't make it unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any execution is going to involve certain things no matter how  
it's carried out,'' Martell said. ``It's going to involve fear, 
it's going to involve ... discomfort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Justice Leander Shaw asked Martell if death by guillotine  
would be considered constitutional. Martell replied that it would 
not. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that's pretty painless, isn't it?'' asked Chief Justice  
Major Harding, who voted to uphold the electric chair in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was executed July 8 for the 1982 murders of a pregnant  
Jacksonville woman and her two young daughters. His nose started 
bleeding just before the current was sent through his body and the 
bloody mess saved Provenzano from going to the electric chair 24 
hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's high court ordered a halt to further executions until  
Sept. 14 and ordered a judge in Orlando to hold a hearing on 
operation of the chair. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Clarence Johnson ruled three weeks ago that  
electrocution does not violate the constitutional ban on cruel or 
unusual punishment. Provenzano's lawyers appealed to the high 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Provenzano, 50, is condemned for the 1984 murders of two  
bailiffs. A third bailiff was left paralyzed after Provenzano 
opened fire in an Orlando courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Three states besides Florida -- Alabama, Georgia and Nebraska --  
still use electrocution as the sole method of execution.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Paint Job Angers Adults </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YARMOUTH, Mass. (AP) -- Dr. Robert Bauer couldn't believe his  
eyes when he drove up to get a cup of coffee at his local 
McDonald's earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers were slapping fire-engine red, canary yellow and  
blinding white paint on the weathered shingled walls that had been 
so typical of Cape Cod's rustic architecture. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, furious about a paint job he considered garish and cheap,  
fired off a blistering letter to the eatery's owners threatening a 
boycott. Amid community pressure, the owners agreed to repaint the 
restaurant cream and replace the bright red roof with cedar 
shingles. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a struggle that's being replicated around eastern  
Massachusetts as McDonald's owner-operators repaint their Golden 
Arches to update the image of the 44-year-old chain. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're trying to do is refreshen the stores, make them  
look better, in some cases, a little cleaner,'' said Robin 
Boorstein Mayhew, who co-owns two McDonald's on the South Shore. 
``The concept behind a lot of it was to give a fun look, a clean 
look.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say it's fairly routine for restaurant franchises to  
regularly update their properties. McDonald's latest makeover comes 
as part of a turnaround after the industry leader suffered 
declining sales and inroads by competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The chain last year gained market share at stores open at least  
a year, in part because of successful promotions. The company's 
stock, which rose more than 4 percent on Wednesday, has soared from 
a 12-month low of $26.75 on Sept. 21 to $42.75 a share on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Restaurants in the Northeast are the first to try the new  
``youthful spirit'' color scheme, but franchisees in markets around 
the country also are choosing to give themselves a facelift, a 
company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The acceptance of this has been exceptional,'' said Henry  
Gonzalez, president of McDonald's Northeast Division. 
Owner-operators in Philadelphia have adopted the new colors and 
traffic is up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, Gonzalez said, McDonald's owner-operators are spending  
$31 million in four months to enhance 310 restaurants from 
Providence, R.I., to southern New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	The makeover includes new menu boards, a visual customer order  
display for drive-through windows and new uniforms. But it's the 
new colors that have generated the biggest mess. 
</P>
<P>
	Although nary a peep has been heard about the repainted  
restaurants in old cities with big commercial districts, officials 
in historic New England towns are appalled by the colors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children may like it, but adults are enraged by it,'' said  
Paul Carroll, chairman of the Canton zoning board of appeal. ``Town 
leaders are enraged by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canton won't permit the new colors. Nor will its South Shore  
neighbors of Randolph and Hanson. In the Cape Cod towns of Hyannis 
and Bourne, one McDonald's owner suspended plans to repaint because 
of the outcry over his restaurant in Falmouth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like one big Coney Island washboard by the bay,'' said  
Raleigh Costa, president of the Teaticket Civic Association in 
Falmouth. Costa has asked the owner to change the restaurant back 
to its original brick. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner has promised to check with corporate headquarters in  
Oak Brook, Ill., to see if the company allows any flexibility in 
the new decor. Gonzalez said repainting is not mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
	In Yarmouth, local authorities permitted a McDonald's to open on  
the condition the building conform to traditional Cape 
architectural standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark and Janice McBee, the restaurant's owners, ignored the  
town's wishes at their peril. Angry letters were fired off to local 
officials and newspapers, describing the new McDonald's as 
``glaringly ugly,'' with colors ``heretofore only seen by those 
ingesting hallucinatory drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think even Ray Kroc might be dismayed,'' wrote one person,  
referring to the restaurant chain's founder. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the McBees agreed to repaint the store after weeks of  
stormy public debate as well as negotiations between the building 
department and McDonald's lawyers. The McBees did not return calls 
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Bauer, he is looking forward to returning to his favorite  
fast-food restaurant -- as soon as the red, white and yellow 
disappears. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the food,'' he said. ``But I'm going to make sure I  
like the paint job before I go back.''
